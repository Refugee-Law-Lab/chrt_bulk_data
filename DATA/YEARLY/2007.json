WHAT IS THIS COMPLAINT ABOUT? [1] This complaint is about whether Canada Post discriminated against Sandy Lipp (n\u00e9e Culic) on the basis of her disability and gender (pregnancy) in 2000 and 2001 at the Mail Processing Plant in Regina, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nII. WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLAINT? [2] Sandy Lipp began work as a part-time postal clerk with Canada Post Corporation in Regina in 1991. Postal clerks carry out the important functions of sorting and dispatching mail in Canada.\n[3] In 1995 and 1997, Ms. Lipp sustained injuries to her neck, shoulder and head areas. In March 2000, Canada Post acknowledged in a letter to Ms. Lipp that she was permanently partially disabled (PPD).\n[4] As a result of her PPD status, Ms. Lipp had certain restrictions with regard to the tasks that she could perform as a postal clerk. One of these restrictions was that she could generally work only six hours per day.\n[5] In June 2000, Ms. Lipp applied for a full-time postal clerk position on Shift 3, which is the evening shift at the Mail Processing Plant. Full-time postal clerks generally work eight hour shifts. Therefore, Canada Post required medical documentation establishing that Ms. Lipp could safely work past the six hour restriction that had been set out in her PPD letter.\n[6] Ms. Lipp provided medical documentation from her physician stating that she could work full-time (eight hour) shifts on modified duties. Canada Post and Medisys, the medical consulting firm that handles Canada Post's occupational health and safety issues, had concerns about this information. Among those was the concern that the information did not provide an objective medical assessment of Ms. Lipp's restrictions and capabilities.\n[7] Notwithstanding the concerns, Canada Post awarded Ms. Lipp the full-time position on Shift 3 in October 2000. She was permitted to work in that position on modified duties.\n[8] Canada Post told her, however, that she would still be required to provide more medical documentation regarding her medical restrictions. Consequently, while she was working in the full-time position, Ms. Lipp was asked to attend an Independent Medical Examination (IME) in Regina. As a result of a miscommunication about the date, Ms. Lipp did not attend the IME in Regina in April of 2001.\n[9] In that same month, Ms. Lipp went on disability leave. She was diagnosed as suffering from major depression and anxiety disorder.\n[10] In the fall of 2001, Ms. Lipp informed Canada Post that she was fit and ready to return to work. Canada Post told her that before she returned to work, she would be required to attend two Independent Medical Examinations in Winnipeg. One of the IME's was with an occupational specialist and the other was with a psychiatrist.\n[11] Ms. Lipp was pregnant at the time and told Canada Post that she could not travel as a result of difficulties that she was experiencing with her pregnancy. She refused to attend the IME's. Canada Post placed her on disciplinary leave without pay for her refusal to attend the IME's.\n[12] On March 18, 2003, Ms. Lipp filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[13] Ms. Lipp also filed grievances alleging that Canada Post had violated the collective agreement by engaging in an unreasonable delay in returning her to the workplace, and in putting her on disciplinary leave without pay. On April 16, 2004, an arbitrator dismissed Ms. Lipp's grievances (Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. Canada Post Corporation (Re Culic) (16 April 2004), Regina, Union Grievance No's 820-00-00046 & 00051 (Norman).\n[14] On September 28, 2005, Ms. Lipp's human rights complaint was referred to the Tribunal. Canada Post subsequently brought a motion requesting that the complaint be dismissed on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata. The Tribunal dismissed Canada Post's motion and ordered that the inquiry into the complaint proceed (Culic v. Canada Post Corporation 2006 CHRT 06).\nIII. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES IN THIS COMPLAINT? [15] There was no issue during these proceedings as to whether Ms. Lipp's head, neck, and shoulder problems constituted a disability, and thus, a prohibited ground of discrimination according to the Act. Similarly, there was no issue as to whether Ms. Lipp was pregnant in the fall of 2001, and that differential treatment on the basis of pregnancy would constitute differential treatment on the basis of sex.\n[16] During the hearing, however, an issue was raised as to whether the complaint should include the allegation that in refusing to return Ms. Lipp to work in the fall of 2001, Canada Post discriminated against Ms. Lipp on the basis of her psychological problems, or her perceived psychological problems. In written closing argument, counsel for Canada Post indicated that he had no objection to the addition of this allegation in the complaint. Therefore, I have included it in the allegations in this complaint.\n[17] On the second day of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent sought to have the Arbitrator's award entered into evidence. I ruled that the award was admissible on the basis that it was relevant to the issues raised in the complaint, and there was strong judicial authority supporting such a decision (Ford Motor Co. of Canada v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 465). I stated however, that I would reserve my decision as to what weight I would accord to the arbitrator's findings until the final decision in the matter. Given that the arbitrator's findings are relevant to Canada Post's explanation for the allegedly discriminatory conduct, I will address the weight that I have accorded them in the part of my decision that deals with Canada Post's explanation.\n[18] The issues, therefore, in this case are:\nWhether the requirements for medical information about Ms. Lipp's disability, including the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend an IME in Regina, were discriminatory; Whether the manner in which Canada Post handled its requirements for information was discriminatory; and, Whether the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend two IME's in Winnipeg before she could return to work in the fall of 2001 was discriminatory.\nIV. WHAT MUST BE PROVEN TO ESTABLISH DISCRIMINATION IN THIS CASE? [19] It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to continue to employ, or, in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination (CHRA, s. 7).\n[20] The complainant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley) provides the basic guidance for what is required to make out a prima facie case. The Court stated that a prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent.\n[21] Thus, the question that must be answered with regard to the prima facie case is whether there is credible evidence to support Ms. Lipp's allegations of adverse differential treatment, contrary to s. 7(b) and\/or a refusal to employ or to continue to employ Ms. Lipp, contrary to s. 7(a) of the Act.\n[22] If that question is answered in the affirmative, the onus then shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory. If a reasonable explanation is provided by the Respondent, it is up to the Complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No.1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[23] Conduct may be found to be non-discriminatory if, in accordance with s. 15(1) of the Act, it is established that it constituted a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). Section 15(2) of the Act stipulates that to be considered a bona fide occupational requirement, it must be established that accommodation of the individual would impose undue hardship considering health safety and cost.\nV. WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIMA FACIE CASE? [24] Ms. Lipp's allegations relate to two distinct periods of time. The first set of allegations relates to the period from June 2000, when she applied for a full-time postal clerk position on Shift 3, until October 2001, when Ms. Lipp's disability leave ended. Ms. Lipp alleged that the following conduct on the part of Canada Post during the first time period constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability:\nRepeated questioning about her ability to perform tasks during pre-shift meetings; The requirement that she provide medical information regarding her ability to perform to work as a full-time postal clerk including the requirement that she attend an IME in Regina; Repeated negative communication regarding her restrictions and the provision of medical information regarding her disability;\n[25] The second set of allegations relates to the period from October 2001, when Ms. Lipp informed Canada Post that she wanted to return to work, until December 2001, when she was placed on disciplinary leave without pay for refusing to attend the IME's in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp alleges that the following conduct on the part of Canada Post during the second time period constitutes adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability and\/or perceived disability and\/or her sex:\n(4 The refusal to permit her to return to work in the fall of 2001 until she had attended two IME's in Winnipeg;\n(5.) The imposition of disciplinary leave without pay.\nVI. THE FIRST TIME PERIOD: JUNE 2000 - OCTOBER 2001 A. ALLEGATION NUMBER 1 - Repeated questions during pre-shift meetings constituted adverse differential treatment [26] During the hearing, Ms. Lipp testified that she was singled out for questioning during pre-shift meetings about whether her medical restrictions would permit her to perform certain scheduled tasks. Pre-shift meetings are ten - fifteen minute meetings conducted by the shift supervisor prior to the start of each shift. Uncontested evidence established that the purpose of the meetings is to assign individual tasks to employees on that shift and to discuss general issues in the plant.\n[27] In final argument, counsel for Ms. Lipp argued that the questioning of Ms. Lipp during pre-shift meetings constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability. Counsel for Ms. Lipp further alleged that the process by which tasks were assigned during pre-shift meetings was discriminatory because the schedules were computer-generated and did not take into account the functional limitations of employees. Therefore by its very nature, the process of scheduling employees necessitated the questioning of disabled employees about their abilities and this resulted in systemic discrimination against disabled employees.\n[28] Canada Post objected to the fact that these issues had been raised for the first time during the hearing. It argued that the Tribunal should refuse to deal with them, given that their late disclosure had deprived Canada Post of an adequate opportunity to address the issues. Counsel for Canada Post said that had he known that the issue of the computer-generation of schedules was in question in this case, he would have called evidence specifically to deal with this point. Should the Tribunal agree to consider this allegation as part of the complaint, the fact that Canada Post was unable to call evidence on this issue because of its late disclosure would cause significant prejudice to Canada Post.\n[29] I agree with the Respondent's position on this issue. As the Tribunal stated in Uzoaba v. Correctional Services of Canada (1994), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/361, when considering whether to deal with allegations that do not form part of the initial complaint, the essential issue is whether the Respondent has been provided with adequate notice of the case that it has to meet, so as to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness. Subsequent decisions of this Tribunal have confirmed this point (see for example: Parent v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces 2005 CHRT 37).\n[30] Counsel for Ms. Lipp stated that the issue of pre-shift questioning was raised generally in the complaint form. There, Ms. Lipp stated that in July 1996, her doctor could not provide a date by which she would be fully recovered and able to return to regular duties. She then stated: Subsequently, CPC asked me on a monthly basis, in front of co-workers, if I still required accommodation and to have my doctor complete and submit Occupational Fitness Forms and questionnaires.\n[31] In my view, the above-noted allegation in the complaint form is not specific enough to constitute notice to the Respondent that the issues of questioning during pre-shift meetings and the computer-generation of work schedules would be raised during the hearing. The evidence presented during the hearing indicated that pre-shift meetings occurred on a daily basis. Ms. Lipp testified that she was asked three or four times a week during pre-shift meetings about her ability to perform certain tasks. Thus, it seems to me that the statement made in the complaint form was not in reference to the allegations about pre-shift questioning or the computer-generated work schedules.\n[32] Moreover, I was unable to find any other references in the pre-hearing material to the issue of pre-shift questions or the work schedule. In preparation for the hearing, the Complainant provided a cursory Statement of Particulars. The Respondent requested additional particulars. This was not provided.\n[33] Rule 9(3) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure stipulates that, except with leave of the Tribunal, parties shall not be permitted to raise issues or adduce evidence during the hearing unless they have been disclosed prior to the hearing. During the hearing, counsel for the Respondent did not raise any objections to the admission of evidence on this issue. However, when counsel for the Complainant made the allegation for the first time in closing argument that the scheduling process and the pre-shift questioning were discriminatory, counsel for the Respondent raised his objections. I think it is fair to say that it may not have been until closing argument that counsel for the Respondent became aware of the use that was going to be made of the evidence on these points.\n[34] The Respondent suffered prejudice as a result of the failure on the part of the Complainant to raise the issues of pre-shift questioning and the allegation of systemic discrimination based on the scheduling process prior to the hearing. As counsel for the Complainant herself stated, Canada Post provided no evidence about the scheduling process and in particular, it provided no evidence about any undue hardship that would result from adapting the computer program to obviate the need for questioning. The Respondent was not provided with sufficient notice that it was necessary to lead such evidence.\n[35] Therefore, I will not consider the allegations of pre-shift questioning and systemic discrimination based on the scheduling process to be part of the complaint.\nB. ALLEGATION NUMBER 2 - The requirement that Ms. Lipp provide medical information regarding her ability to perform the full-time postal clerk position constituted adverse differential treatment [36] Ms. Lipp acknowledged that when she applied for a full-time postal clerk position in June of 2000, Canada Post was entitled to ask for assurances from her doctor that she could safely perform the requirements of a full-time postal clerk. However, when her doctor wrote a note on June 29, 2000, indicating that she was fit to work an eight hour shift on light duties, the requirement for further medical information should have ended, according to Ms. Lipp.\n[37] She argued that Canada Post had ample information at its disposal confirming the validity of the information provided in the doctor's note. In particular, Canada Post had transferred Ms. Lipp to the full-time position, and she worked in that position for six months. This, she argued, established that she could work full-time on modified duties. The insistence, therefore, that Ms. Lipp provide further medical information and attend an IME in Regina was unreasonable and imposed a burden upon her that other employees in full-time positions did not have to bear.\n(1) Is there credible evidence to support this allegation?\n[38] Ms. Lipp testified that when a full-time postal clerk position came up on Shift 3 she applied for it. As the most senior part-time postal clerk she was entitled to the position, according to the collective agreement. However, Ms. Lipp testified that after she applied for the position the Superintendent on Shift 3, Mr. David Slater, told her that she could not have the position because Canada Post needed someone who could perform the full range of duties in the full-time shift. She testified that Mr. Slater told her to get a doctor's note stating that she could work the eight hour shift.\n[39] Ms. Lipp testified that she did this. She produced a note from her physician, Dr. Chooi, indicating that she could move: from part-time to full time (8 hours\/day) from 29 June 2000 light duty.\n[40] A month after she produced her doctor's note, Medisys informed Ms. Lipp that more information was needed than had been provided in the note. Medisys asked her to take a set of questions that had been formulated by a Medisys physician, Dr. Lori Koz, to her doctor. This was known as an Acquisition of Medical Information (AMI). Ms. Lipp was to return the AMI to Medisys by August 31, 2000.\n[41] Ms. Lipp testified that she did not understand why she was required to produce more information about her ability to work full-time. She testified that prior to applying for the full-time position she had worked eight-hour shifts on numerous occasions, notwithstanding her six-hour work restriction. This was because Canada Post had either offered her the additional hours, or had scheduled her to work eight-hour shifts.\n[42] Ms. Lipp testified that she wrote Mr. Slater a letter dated August 21, 2000, asking why she was required to have an AMI completed. She asked Mr. Slater whether Canada Post had considered the fact that she had regularly been working an eight hour shift when she was part-time, thereby demonstrating her ability to work eight hours a day.\n[43] Ms. Lipp testified that she did not receive answers to any of her questions. However, she proceeded to have the AMI completed by her physician, Dr. Chooi.\n[44] In the cover letter to Dr. Chooi, Dr. Koz stated that there would be a number of job duties in the full-time postal clerk position that Ms. Lipp could not do if she was restricted to light duties. Dr. Koz indicated that Canada Post wanted clarification as to what factors had changed such that Ms. Lipp was now able to increase her hours of work, but not her duties, specifically sorting oversize letter mail. Dr. Koz stated in her letter that Canada Post wished to determine whether Ms. Lipp could now participate in a gradual return to work plan toward the full duties of a full-time postal clerk.\n[45] In his response to the questions posed by Dr. Koz in the AMI, Dr. Chooi indicated that Ms. Lipp needed to work full-time in order to get enough pay to cope with her financial situation. He indicated that Ms. Lipp could not sort oversize mail and that she had reached her maximum medical improvement at this point in time. Dr. Chooi also indicated that he felt Ms. Lipp would suffer physical harm if she undertook a gradual return to work.\n[46] The information from the AMI was provided to Medisys. Medisys reviewed the information from the AMI and evaluated it in the light of Ms. Lipp's medical file. Medisys then provided what is known as a Field Report to Canada Post. Uncontested evidence established that Field Reports are designed to protect the privacy of the employee by providing Canada Post with only the information that is needed to provide appropriate workplace accommodations or to otherwise respond to medical concerns that have been raised by the employee.\n[47] In a Field Report dated September 20, 2000, Dr. Lori Koz of Medisys indicated the information provided by Dr. Chooi was consistent with the previous information on the file. Dr. Koz further stated that given that Ms. Lipp had had her medical conditions for a number of years, the likelihood of a vast change in her restrictions at that point in time was unlikely. She stated that there might, therefore, be some merit in an IME.\n[48] Ms. Lipp testified that on October 1, 2000, she was transferred to the full-time position on Shift 3. She testified that there was no indication from anyone at Canada Post or Medisys that her transfer to the full-time position was contingent upon the provision of any further medical information.\n[49] Nonetheless, on October 18, 2000, Ms. Lipp was informed that she was required to attend an Independent Medical Examination (IME) in Winnipeg on October 30, 2000.\n[50] Mr. Keith Jeworski, President of the Regina local of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, testified that article 33.10(c) of the Collective Agreement provided that Canada Post could require an independent medical examination by a doctor selected by the Corporation. Mr. Jeworski testified, however, that IME requests were very uncommon in Regina at that time. Prior to Ms. Lipp, Canada Post had not, to his knowledge, made any other requests for an IME.\n[51] Ms. Lipp asked Canada Post to reconsider the decision to send her to Winnipeg for the IME. Flying made her ill, and traveling by land on the highways was difficult for her because her first husband was killed on Highway One in an accident.\n[52] Canada Post granted Ms. Lipp's request not to travel to Winnipeg and agreed to reschedule the IME at a later date in Regina. In the letter advising her that the appointment would be rescheduled, Mr. Dale Hippe, the Manager of Mail Operations, stated that Canada Post's ability to accommodate Ms. Lipp in any permanent modified duty position and particularly as it related to her pending promotion to full time status was dependent upon an understanding of her physical limitations and the impact of those limitations on Canada Post's Operations and Ms. Lipp's peers.\n[53] Ms. Lipp testified that she worked in the full-time position on modified duties until April 2, 2001. She testified that she did not experience any difficulties performing the modified functions of her position. She did not take sick leave or any other time off to deal with problems arising from working full-time.\n[54] On or about March 22, 2001, Ms. Lipp was informed that she was required to attend an IME in Regina on April 2, 2001, with Dr. Milo Fink. However, Ms. Lipp and Mr. Jeworski testified that, as a result of a miscommunication about a proposed change in the date of the appointment, Ms. Lipp did not attend the IME. Ms. Lipp subsequently went on sick leave. She testified that while she was on sick leave, she attended an IME appointment on July 30, 2001, that she had rescheduled after she missed the one in April. However, when she got to the appointment, she found that, unbeknownst to her, it had been cancelled.\n[55] Ms. Lipp testified that she felt great emotional stress as a result of the demands to produce medical information and to attend appointments. She testified that it was difficult for her to arrange the appointments and to organize her schedule to attend them. She felt stress every time she received a letter requiring that she provide more medical information. She understood the need to provide medical information about her disability, but felt that Canada Post was asking her for medical information that was not necessary.\n(2) The Tribunal's Findings and Conclusion Regarding the Prima Facie Case for Allegation # 2\n[56] For the following reasons, I find that Ms. Lipp has established a prima facie case that Canada Post's insistence that she attend an IME in Regina constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability.\n[57] While Ms. Lipp's testimony throughout the hearing was not always entirely credible, I find that the information she provided with regard to the above-noted allegations was credible. For example, her testimony that she had worked eight hour shifts on numerous occasions prior to applying for the full-time job was confirmed later by evidence provided by Mr. Slater indicating that between March and June of 2000, Ms. Lipp worked an eight hour shift on 22 occasions. Her testimony with regard to the above-noted allegations was straightforward, unembellished and consistent.\n[58] Ms. Lipp provided medical information indicating that she could work full-time, but that she could not increase her duties beyond the modified duties that she had been performing. Canada Post then allowed Ms. Lipp to assume the full-time position on modified duties. She worked full-time for 6 months until she went on leave. There were no indications that Ms. Lipp was having any difficulty performing the modified functions of a full-time postal clerk.\n[59] In spite of the fact that Ms. Lipp was working work full-time on modified duties, Canada Post continued to require that she provide more medical information to establish that she could do the job. She felt great emotional stress when she received requests to provide more information or to attend an appointment since they were communicated in such a way as to put her job security in question. Moreover, it was difficult for Ms. Lipp to provide the information and to attend the appointments.\n[60] I find that Ms. Lipp has established a prima facie case that Canada Post's ongoing requirement to establish her fitness to work full-time constituted adverse differential treatment. She was treated differently from non-disabled employees in that her job security in the full-time position was contingent upon fulfilling the requirement, in a form acceptable to Canada Post, for satisfactory medical information about her disability. Given that the requirement stemmed from Canada Post's stated concern that her disability might prevent her from being able to perform the functions of a full-time postal clerk, I find that Canada Post's adverse differential treatment of Ms. Lipp was based on the fact that she is disabled.\n(3) Does Canada Post have a reasonable explanation for its otherwise discriminatory practice?\n[61] Once the prima facie case has been established, the onus then shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory. Conduct may be found to be non-discriminatory if, in accordance with s. 15(1) of the Act, it is established that it constituted a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[62] Canada Post has argued that the requirement to attend the IME was a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this, Canada Post must demonstrate that accommodating Ms. Lipp in the full-time position without the information provided by the IME would impose undue hardship on Canada Post, having regard to health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\n[63] In determining whether a BFOR has been established, it is helpful to keep in mind the principles set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin) and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer)).\n(4) Does the evidence support the allegation that the requirement to attend an IME was a bona fide occupational requirement?\n[64] Both Mr. Slater and Mr. Hippe testified about the events that led to the decision to require that Ms. Lipp attend an IME. Mr. Slater testified in a straightforward manner and candidly admitted that his recollection of the events was poor. He often said we would have or I would have before he provided his testimony of what he thought had occurred. Therefore, I have reduced the weight of his testimony in certain areas based on the fact that his recollection was poor and it appeared that he was, at times, trying to reconstruct what he would have done based on his review of the documentation during the hearing. However, I was impressed by the fact that Mr. Slater candidly admitted at times that there was a problem with the way things had been handled by Canada Post. Moreover, he did not appear to exaggerate or embellish any of the information he provided. Were it not for the fact that his memory of the events was so poor, I would have accorded his testimony significant weight.\n[65] Mr. Hippe's memory of the events was somewhat stronger even though the extent of his involvement was less. He too testified in a straightforward and candid manner. His evidence with respect to this time period was internally consistent and held up well under cross-examination.\n[66] I find, on a balance of probabilities and for the reasons that follow that the requirement that Ms. Lipp provide further medical information in the form of an AMI and that she attend an IME in Regina were bona fide occupational requirements.\n(a) The Requirement for medical information from an AMI and an IME is rationally connected to the functions of the position.\n[67] The first step in assessing whether the employer has successfully established a BFOR defence is to identify the general purpose of the impugned standard and determine whether it is rationally connected to the performance of the job (Meiorin, supra, at para. 57). The focus at this stage is not on the validity of the particular standard that is at issue, but rather on the validity of the general purpose.\n[68] The evidence of Mr. Hippe and Mr. Slater was that Canada Post required objective medical information about employees' medical restrictions for a number of reasons: (1) to ensure that employees are able to safely perform the functions of their position; (2) to enable Canada Post to properly accommodate disabled employees; and, (3) to enable Canada Post to maximize the amount and variety of work that disabled employees could do within their restrictions.\n[69] Mr. Slater testified that objective, concise medical information is needed from disabled or injured employees to enable Canada Post to ensure that they are safely working within their restrictions and that they are working productively.\n[70] With respect to the third goal, Mr. Hippe testified that Canada Post requires employees to provide updated medical information whenever they change positions or their restrictions change so that Canada Post can determine how best to maximize the employee's work potential within their restrictions. Medical information about an employee's restrictions allows Canada Post to determine how to accomplish the goal of efficiency and productivity in the workplace without putting the safety and well-being of the individual employee or other employees at risk.\n[71] On the basis of this evidence, I am satisfied that the requirement to provide medical information is rationally to the goals of employee safety, accommodation and productivity. Moreover, I am satisfied that all three goals are valid. Canada Post has an obligation to ensure that employee productivity and efficiency is achieved without compromising its obligation to accommodate disabled employees, and without putting employees' safety and health at risk. To do so, Canada Post requires medical updates on employees' restrictions as the restrictions change or as the work assignment changes.\n(b) Canada Post required the additional medical information including the IME in the honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to achieve the above-noted objectives.\n[72] Once the legitimacy of the employer's more general purpose is established, the employer must take the second step of demonstrating that it adopted the particular standard with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the complainant (Meiorin, supra, at para. 60). The focus at this stage in the analysis of the BFOR is on evidence of the subjective views of the respondent with regard to the particular standard, which in this case, is the requirement for more medical information.\n[73] The evidence established that Canada Post formulated the requirement that Ms. Lipp provide additional medical documentation and attend the IME in Regina in the honest and good faith belief that this was necessary to accomplish the goals set out above.\n[74] Mr. Slater and Mr. Hippe testified that neither the note from Ms. Lipp's doctor nor the Field Report from Dr. Koz provided them with them with the clear, objective medical information that they needed to ensure that Ms. Lipp was being safely accommodated in the full-time position.\n[75] The Field Report from Dr. Koz of Medisys, dated September 20, 2000, indicated that a significant number of Ms. Lipp's medical concerns were based upon subjective information provided by Ms. Lipp to her doctor. Dr. Koz questioned whether a vast change in her condition was likely given that Ms. Lipp had been working under medical restrictions for a number of years. She stated that there might be some merit in an IME prior to taking a final look at how to accommodate Ms. Lipp within Canada Post.\n[76] Mr. Hippe testified that the Medisys Field Report would have been discussed at a weekly case management meeting with superintendents. He stated that he would have had concerns, as a result of the Field Report, that even with the AMI results Canada Post still had insufficient information to be able to accommodate Ms. Lipp in the full-time position.\n[77] Mr. Slater candidly admitted that it was unusual to require an employee to provide further medical information once she had already assumed the position. However, Mr. Slater's evidence was that Canada Post continued to be concerned about Ms. Lipp's long-term capacity to work past her 6 hour restriction. That was why she was required to attend the IME even after she had been in the full-time position for six months.\n[78] I find that Canada Post required the additional medical information including the IME in the honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to achieve the goals of safely accommodating Ms. Lipp in productive work.\n(c) The Requirement for additional medical information was reasonably necessary having regard to health and safety.\n[79] The final step in determining whether the requirement for additional information is a BFOR requires Canada Post to demonstrate that it was reasonably necessary to accomplish the goals set out in step one. To do this, Canada Post must establish that it could not accommodate Ms. Lipp without experiencing undue hardship.\n[80] Ms. Lipp argued that Canada Post had all the information it needed to establish that she could safely work full-time on modified duties. She argued that it would not, therefore, have created undue hardship to Canada Post to accommodate her in the position without the information from the AMI and the IME.\n[81] Canada Post argued that it had an obligation to ensure that Ms. Lipp's health and safety would not be jeopardized by working past her restrictions. It further argued that the health and safety risks created by allowing Ms. Lipp to remain in the full-time position without this information would create undue hardship to Canada Post. I agree with this argument for the following reasons.\n[82] Section 124 of the Canada Labour Code establishes that employers have an obligation to ensure that the health and safety at work of every person employed by them is protected (R.S.C., 1985, c. L-2, s. 124). The case law further indicates that when transferring an employee to another position, an employer is not only entitled to, but is also obliged to obtain reasonably complete medical information about the employee's condition to ensure that the employee can safely perform the functions of the position (Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) and C.U.P.E., Loc. 43, Re (1991), 22 L.A.C. (4th) 216; Belliveau v. Steel Co. of Canada [1988] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 11 (Q.L.) at para. 51; Mazuelos v. Clark 2000 BCHRT 1 at para. 46).\n[83] Where the employee is seeking modified work, he or she has a corresponding duty to cooperate by providing the required information (Canada Post Corp. and Canadian Union of Postal Workers (Reniak Grievance) (1998), 73 L.A.C. (4th) 15). To the extent that the medical information provided by the employee is inadequate for the purposes of ensuring the employee's health or safety, an employer has the right to make further inquiries.\n[84] The evidence in this case indicates that the work done by postal clerks can be physically demanding and repetitive. Mr. Hippe also testified that more is demanded of full-time postal clerks; they work longer hours than the part-time clerks and are expected to move through a greater range of duties. Mr. Slater explained that Canada Post rotated employees through as many different jobs as possible in mail processing to ensure that all employees had a good range of duties in order to avoid problems with repetitive strain. He testified that repetitive strain injuries at Canada Post were a concern.\n[85] Ms. Lipp testified that her injuries involved rotator cuff problems, fibromyalgia, and cervical spine degeneration. Mr. Slater stated that, based on Ms. Lipp's medical conditions, there was a concern that going beyond six hours on a long-term basis would subvert the 6 hour restriction and put Ms. Lipp at risk. The fact that she had worked for 6 months in the full-time position did not alleviate his concerns about the long term impact of working full-time on Ms. Lipp. If Ms. Lipp were to injure herself on the job as a result of working beyond her physical capabilities, Canada Post would be responsible for the consequences.\n[86] Ms. Lipp's own testimony was that when she was working full-time she would become exhausted and run down. Although she testified that she did not take sick leave or leave without pay during the period during which she worked full-time, Mr. Hippe testified that Canada Post was concerned that this could happen. Therefore, Canada Post needed more information about Ms. Lipp's restrictions so that long-term health problems for Ms. Lipp could be avoided.\n[87] The doctor's note that was initially provided to Canada Post simply stated that Ms. Lipp could go to full-time (8 hour) shifts on light duties. Mr. Hippe testified that it did not explain what factors had changed to allow Ms. Lipp to safely increase her hours to full-time. Canada Post had concerns about what light duties meant and whether Ms. Lipp could be asked to work beyond 8 hours a day as sometimes happened with full-time employees. In view of these concerns, Ms. Lipp was asked to have her physician complete an AMI questionnaire.\n[88] The doctor's responses to the questions in the AMI were not particularly helpful. When asked what factors had changed to allow Ms. Lipp to increase her hours of work to eight hours, Dr. Chooi replied that Ms. Lipp needed to work full-time in order to get enough pay to cope with her financial situation. She was widowed and had difficulty in looking after herself. The doctor's statement that Ms. Lipp needed to work full-time did not respond to the question about what changes had occurred in her physical condition from March 2000, to October 2000, to enable her to work past the 6 hour restriction that had been set in March of 2000.\n[89] On the basis of Dr. Chooi's answers, Medisys provided Canada Post with a Field Report in September 2000, which suggested that an IME might provide the objective information that was needed to answer this and other questions about Ms. Lipp's restrictions.\n[90] Given the nature of the work that is done by postal clerks and the nature of Ms. Lipp's medical conditions and recently established restrictions, I am satisfied that Canada Post had a legitimate concern about safely accommodating Ms. Lipp in the full-time postal clerk position on a long-term basis. The information provided by Ms. Lipp's physician in the note and the AMI did not address Canada Post's concerns. Canada Post had an obligation to ensure that Ms. Lipp was not being placed in a situation where she might injure herself.\n[91] Were there alternatives to the IME that could have been used to obtain the information that Canada Post needed to ensure that Ms. Lipp's health and safety was protected? Mr. Hippe and Mr. Slater testified that the process for obtaining medical information is as follows: a doctor's note is provided by the employee; if more information is needed regarding an employee's restrictions, the employee is asked to have his or her doctor complete an OFA; if that information is incomplete or unsatisfactory, the same physician is asked to complete an AMI, which is a series of questions regarding the employee's specific medical condition and limitations; if the information in the AMI does not provide the kind of clear and objective information that is needed to properly accommodate the employee, an IME is requested. Mr. Hippe testified that, as far as he knew once an AMI and an OFA had been provided, the IME was the only remaining means of obtaining objective medical information when the information provided by the employee's doctor was inadequate.\n[92] I accept that during this first time period, Canada Post, together with Medisys, first explored and exhausted all possible means, other than an IME, to obtain the information that was needed to fulfill Canada Post's statutory obligation to protect Ms. Lipp's health. The IME was therefore, the only remaining means of obtaining the necessary information.\n[93] Accordingly, I find that Canada Post has established that waiving the requirement for an IME would have caused it undue hardship: it would have deprived Canada Post of the only remaining means at its disposal of ensuring that it was fulfilling its obligation to protect Ms. Lipp's health and safety.\n(5) The Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding Allegation Number Two\n[94] Given the findings above, I conclude that the requirement that Ms. Lipp produce additional medical information and attend the IME in Regina was a bona fide occupational requirement.\nC. ALLEGATION NUMBER 3 - Canada Post's repeated and negative communications with Ms. Lipp regarding her restrictions and the provision of medical information was discriminatory [95] Ms. Lipp claims that she was subjected to frequent questions and comments about her limitations on the shop floor and unusually intense supervision of her work. She further claims that the Respondent's demands to produce medical documentation and to attend the IME were very often accompanied by threats of disciplinary action should she fail to produce the required information within the stipulated time period. This, she argues constitutes prima facie evidence of adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability.\n(1) Is there credible evidence to support this allegation?\n(a) Questions and Comments Regarding Ms. Lipp's Disability on the Shop Floor\n[96] Ms. Lipp testified that around the time that she applied for the full-time position in June of 2000, her supervisor approached her on the shop floor, crossed his arms and asked her just what is it you're capable of? What can you do? She said the workers around her stopped and looked at her. She felt humiliated and ashamed.\n[97] Ms. Lipp testified that Mr. Slater would approach her on a daily basis to discuss her medical restrictions, the need to produce medical information or the need to attend a medical appointment. Sometimes he would ask her whether she had been to the doctor yet. She felt this was inappropriate.\n[98] She also testified that Mr. Slater would come up to her when she was working by herself and threaten her that a failure to provide medical documents on time would mean disciplinary action. Ms. Lipp testified that Mr. Slater would hand her medical forms on the shop floor. She did not like this as it drew further attention to her disability.\n[99] Ms. Janice Karchewski, a shop steward at Canada Post, testified on Ms. Lipp's behalf. Ms. Karchewski stated that the question what can you do? was asked of her on the shop floor when she too was on modified duties. She said that, as shop steward, she was aware that this question was quite frequently asked of people who were on modified duties. She stated that it made her and others feel very uncomfortable.\n[100] Ms. Louise Shoeman also testified on behalf of Ms. Lipp. Ms. Shoeman has been employed at Canada Post for 27 years. She is also a postal clerk and worked on the same floor as Ms. Lipp on Shift Three. Ms. Shoeman testified that she observed the interactions between Ms. Lipp and Mr. Slater. She testified that Mr. Slater was constantly berating and questioning Ms. Lipp about her restrictions.\n[101] Ms. Shoeman observed a confrontation between the two that began with Mr. Slater watching Ms. Lipp. He then approached Ms. Lipp and began to question her about her ability to do the full range of duties. Ms. Shoeman testified that when Mr. Slater spoke with Ms. Lipp he would lean over and move very close to her. His tone of voice was loud and rough. Ms. Shoeman stated that Ms. Lipp was frequently in tears at the end of her conversations with Mr. Slater.\n[102] Mr. Jeworski testified that there was a history of conflict between Ms. Lipp and Mr. Slater that related, to some extent, to Ms. Lipp's use of sick leave time in the past. Mr. Jeworski stated that Ms. Lipp was not the only employee who had problems with Mr. Slater's management style.\n[103] Ms. Lipp testified that in January 2001, while she was working full-time on Shift 3, a full-time position opened up on the midnight shift (Shift 1) in Forward Letters. She bid for it, was transferred to the position and worked there until March 4, 2001, when she was transferred back to Shift 3. Canada Post's reason for transferring Ms. Lipp back to Shift 3 was that her restrictions could not be accommodated on Shift 1.\n[104] Ms. Lipp testified that when she arrived for her first shift back on Shift 3, on March 4, 2001, she discovered that her co-workers had been informed, prior to her return, that she was coming back and that it was because of her disability. She stated that she felt humiliated and singled out for different treatment because she was disabled.\n(b) Close Supervision\n[105] Ms. Lipp testified that she felt she was more closely supervised than other employees. She described an incident where she saw Mr. Slater look at his watch when she went to the washroom and then check it again after she came out of the washroom. Ms. Lipp stated that she felt Mr. Slater was always watching her. Other people noticed this too and would make comments to her about it. Ms. Shoeman was one of the people who observed Mr. Slater watching Ms. Lipp. As indicated above, she testified about this.\n[106] Ms. Lipp testified that she saw Mr. Slater hide behind pillars and watch her while she was working.\n(c) Letters from Canada Post\n[107] Ms. Lipp testified that she felt she was always getting letters from Canada Post about the need for more medical information and that more often than not, these letters were accompanied by threats of discipline. She testified that her perception of these communications was that Canada Post had a problem with her disability and was looking for a way to get rid of her. The communications that were alleged to be problematic were as follows:\nA letter dated August 14, 2000, from Mr. Slater, indicating that Ms. Lipp had not returned the AMI\n[108] In this letter, Mr. Slater indicated that the AMI questionnaire regarding Ms. Lipp's ability to work full time, which was to have been returned by August 9, 2000, had not been returned. Mr. Slater stated: It is important that you realize that uncertainty surrounding your medical status may inhibit our ability to accommodate you with your requests for advancement within the Corporation. He stated that: If your decision is to not take the questions to your physician your current status of Permanently Partially disabled is all that we have to work with.\n(ii) A letter dated November 17, 2000, from Mr. Dale Hippe indicating the IME in Winnipeg had been changed to a later date in Regina\n[109] Mr. Hippe wrote to Ms. Lipp informing her that she would not be required to attend an IME in Winnipeg. He stated, however, that another examination would be scheduled in Regina in March 2001. Mr. Hippe added that Ms. Lipp's pending promotion to full-time status depended upon obtaining further information about her restrictions.\n(iii) A letter dated March 26, 2001, from Mr. Slater informing Ms. Lipp that she was required to attend an IME on April 2, 2001\n[110] Ms. Lipp testified that one day in March 2001, she was at her work station when her supervisor, Brian Kanciruk, approached her, crossed his arms and stated Enlighten me. Are you going to this doctor's appointment? Ms. Lipp did not know anything about an appointment and told Mr. Kanciruk that when she received the paperwork for the appointment she would let him know. She stated that she was embarrassed because her co-workers overheard the conversation.\n[111] Ms. Lipp testified that the next day she received a letter from Mr. Slater dated March 26, 2001, stating that she was required to attend an IME on April 2, and that it was evident from her remarks to Mr. Kanciruk that she was considering not attending the appointment. In his letter, Mr. Slater indicated that a failure to report for the examination on April 2, 2001, at 15:00 could result in administrative action up to and including a change in Ms. Lipp's status from a full-time PO4 to that of a part-time PO4. In that letter, Mr. Slater stated that other administrative action affecting accommodation and employment might also be required until another examination could be scheduled. Ms. Lipp was instructed to express her intentions to either attend or not attend immediately.\n[112] Ms. Lipp testified that she felt very upset by this turn of events. She had not told Mr. Kanciruk that she would not attend the IME. She stated that this was an example of why she refused to speak directly with Canada Post management; she felt that her words were misinterpreted and used against her. She preferred to communicate through the union.\n(iv) A twenty-four hour Notice of Interview dated April 2, 2001 - The Missed IME Appointment on April 2, 2001.\n[113] Ms. Lipp testified that she could not make the April 2, 2001, appointment for an IME. She had not been consulted about the date and had made personal plans for that date. She called Keith Jeworski to see if he could arrange to have her appointment switched with another Canada Post employee whom she knew had been scheduled to attend an IME with the same doctor on April 9. She subsequently received a memorandum from Darlene Black, a nurse with Medisys who worked in the Regina Mail Sorting Plant, confirming that her appointment had been changed to April 9. The memorandum was dated March 28, 2001, and was addressed to Mr. Slater with a carbon copy to Ms. Lipp.\n[114] Ms. Lipp went into work in the afternoon as scheduled on April 2, 2001; her personal plans were for the early part of the day. She testified that her supervisor, Kevin Zimmerman immediately approached her, followed her out onto the work floor, and in a loud voice asked her what she was doing at work. When she replied that she was here to work, Mr. Zimmerman asked her why she was not at her doctor's appointment. Ms. Lipp testified that a little crowd of people had formed around the area and were listening to the conversation. Mr. Zimmerman continued to question her about the appointment. She was very embarrassed, burst into tears and said speak to Keith, talk to Keith. (Keith was Keith Jeworski, the union president.) Ms. Lipp then went to her shop steward, Lindy Freegone, for help.\n[115] Later that day, Mr. Slater approached her on the shop floor and handed her a notice indicating that she was to attend an interview with management to investigate her failure to attend the IME on April 2, 2001. Disciplinary action was threatened for failure to attend the meeting.\n[116] Ms. Lipp stated that she was very upset by this event. She could not believe that Canada Post was angry with her for not attending an appointment that had been rescheduled to another date. She left work after her shift and subsequently went on sick leave.\n(v) A letter from Mr. Slater dated April 3, 2001, indicating that until Ms. Lipp provided medical documentation regarding her sick leave she would be on leave without pay.\n[117] In this letter, Mr. Slater stated that a fully completed Occupational Fitness Assessment (OFA) was required by April 5, 2001, to support her sick leave. He stated that until this documentation was received, she would be considered to be on leave without pay. An OFA is a form that is filled out by the employee's doctor. It does not provide a medical diagnosis; the OFA simply sets out what the employee's limitations are and the expected duration of the limitations.\n[118] Ms. Lipp provided the completed OFA by April 5, 2001.\n(vi) A letter dated June 7, 2001, from Mr. Slater to Ms. Lipp regarding her recent refusal to attend an IME and the requirement that she attend a third IME appointment.\n[119] On June 7, 2001, Mr. Slater wrote to Ms. Lipp to clarify our position regarding your recent refusal to attend an IME. He stated that Canada Post was making a third attempt to schedule an IME and that she would be required to attend this one. Her attendance was to be confirmed within 48 hours of the receipt of the letter. The concluding paragraph read as follows:\nThis situation has put us in an administrative position that may jeopardize your employment with Canada Post Corporation. Please consider responding to this letter as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of further administrative or disciplinary action. You can contact me at 761-6304 if you have any further questions.\n[120] Ms. Lipp testified that she was very distraught about this. She had not purposefully missed the appointment on April 2, 2001; she was under the impression that it had been rescheduled. Ms. Lipp testified that she took this letter to mean that if she did not attend the IME appointment on July 30, 2001, which she had rescheduled on her own, she would be fired. However, unbeknownst to her, the third IME appointment, scheduled for July 30, 2001, was cancelled by Medisys in June, 2001.\n(vii) A letter dated June 8, 2001 from Mr. Dale Hippe, and a letter from Mr. Slater dated June 13, 2001 indicating that Ms. Lipp was required to provide an AMI.\n[121] Ms. Lipp testified that on or about June 13, 2001, while she was on sick leave, she received a package from Canada Post that contained a sealed envelope and three covering letters. The first letter was from Medisys dated June 8, 2001, informing Ms. Lipp that she was required to have an AMI regarding her current fitness for work completed by her physician by June 26, 2001. The second letter was from Mr. Hippe on the same date. He too informed Ms. Lipp that she was to complete the AMI by June 26th. He said that if she needed any assistance with this she was to contact the Occupational Health Nurse directly.\n[122] The third letter, dated June 13, 2001, was from Mr. Slater. In his letter, Mr. Slater stated that clarification was required regarding her current absence. She was required to have the AMI completed by June 25, 2001, a day earlier than the authors of the other two letters had required. Mr. Slater added that if Ms. Lipp failed to produce the documentation and an acceptable explanation, disciplinary action up to and including release from Canada Post would follow.\n[123] A copy of the June 13, 2001 letter from Mr. Slater to Ms. Lipp was sent to Sun Life Insurance Company and another copy was placed on her personal file. When she went on sick leave in April 2001, Ms. Lipp applied for disability benefits from Sun Life. Her application was initially denied, but then about a year and a half later, her appeal of that decision was granted.\n[124] Ms. Lipp testified that the letter from Mr. Slater and the AMI package intensified the anxiety that she was feeling. She was required to attend an IME in July, and to provide an AMI within 12 days. Within eight days, Mr. Slater had written Ms. Lipp two letters demanding that she have an AMI completed and then that she attend an IME. Disciplinary action up to and including release from Canada Post was threatened for failure to comply. Ms. Lipp testified that she feared that, no matter what she did, she was going to lose her job.\n[125] Furthermore, it appeared to her that the package from Medisys with the AMI material had been held back from June 8, 2001 until June 13, 2001, so that Mr. Slater could add his cover letter. Not only was the time for complying with the request reduced because of this delay, Mr. Slater had also reduced the deadline himself by one day from the June 26, 2001 deadline that had been provided by Medisys.\n[126] In July 2001, Keith Jeworski wrote a letter of complaint to Dale Hippe about Mr. Slater's letter. He objected to the fact that the AMI package from Medisys was channeled through Canada Post management in order to permit Mr. Slater to include a covering letter. Mr. Jeworski stated that this not only violated Ms. Lipp's confidentiality, it also shortened the amount of time that she had to respond. More importantly, it included threats of discipline and release from Canada Post. Mr. Jeworski stated: This seems to be a departure from management's usual procedure for seeking completion of a medical questionnaire. It further reinforces Ms. Culic's belief that Mr. Slater is acting on a personal animus. Mr. Jeworski requested that the threatening letter of June 13 be removed from Ms. Lipp's personal file and that steps be taken to ensure that this did not happen in the future.\n[127] Mr. Jeworski testified that if an employee refuses to provide medical information through an AMI that would open up the possibility of a demand for an IME or other kinds of administrative action. However, failure to complete an AMI could not involve disciplinary action. There was no basis in the collective agreement or arbitral jurisprudence for this whatsoever. Therefore, he felt that Mr. Slater's letter was improper.\n[128] The AMI was completed on June 15, 2001, and received by Medisys on June 22, 2001. The AMI indicated that Ms. Lipp was suffering from major depression and anxiety disorder which were related to the conflict she was experiencing at work. Ms. Lipp's physician indicated that a change of workplace or shift would hasten her recovery.\n[129] In the Medisys Field Report summarizing the results of the AMI, Dr. Koz stated that Ms. Lipp was unfit for work at the present time. She further stated: ... we need to deal with the issues at hand which appear to have a large basis in the workplace as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in a period of prolonged disability for Ms. Culic.\n(2) The Tribunal's Findings and Conclusion Regarding the Prima Facie Case for Allegation # 3\n[130] Overall, I find that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment with respect to this allegation. However, there are some aspects of the allegation which are not substantiated. Ms. Lipp's testimony seemed, at times, somewhat exaggerated and implausible. For example, her statements that Mr. Slater questioned her on a daily basis about her disability or her medical requirements and that he hid behind pillars to watch her work strained the limits of credulity. Furthermore, while it may be true that Mr. Slater timed her washroom breaks, I find no evidence of a link between such conduct and Ms. Lipp's disability, nor have I heard any evidence that Ms. Lipp was treated differently in that regard from other non-disabled employees.\n[131] I find however, that there is credible evidence to establish a prima facie case that Canada Post management subjected Ms. Lipp to frequent, aggressive and negative questions and commentary on the shop floor regarding her disability and the need to provide further medical documentation or to attend appointments. Ms. Lipp's testimony in that regard was corroborated by Ms. Karchewski's testimony. I find that Ms. Karchewski's statements regarding the questions on the shop floor were convincing because she spoke from personal experience as well as from her experience as a shop steward. She spoke about the fact that she and others were frequently asked what can you do? by Canada Post management while they were on modified duties.\n[132] Mr. Jeworski's testimony lent some support to that of Ms. Lipp. He indicated that there was a history of conflict between Ms. Lipp and Mr. Slater and that this conflict had continued into the present time. Ms. Shoeman gave credible evidence about the negative interaction between Ms. Lipp and Mr. Slater relating to Ms. Lipp's limitations.\n[133] Thus, I find that there is credible evidence to establish a prima facie case that Canada Post's questioning and demands regarding Ms. Lipp's disability and the requirement to produce medical documentation were often done in an aggressive and disrespectful manner and often in public. As a result, Ms. Lipp felt singled out for negative treatment on the basis of her disability. Some of the evidence indicates that a significant cause of Ms. Lipp's depression and anxiety was the negative treatment that she received from Canada Post regarding her physical limitations and the requirement for further medical information.\n[134] Similarly, with respect to Canada Post's other communications, and in particular the letters from Mr. Slater to Ms. Lipp, the Complainant has established a prima facie case that Canada Post focused an inordinate amount of negative attention on Ms. Lipp with regard to her disability and the requirements surrounding that condition. The demands to provide medical information, respond to questions and to attend appointments were peremptory and almost constantly threatened negative employment consequences for failure to comply. The nexus with her disabled status was always evident insofar as the questioning and demands for information related to medical information, appointments or accommodation of her disability. To the extent that they were purported notices of misconduct or insubordination, they almost certainly served to undermine Ms. Lipp's sense of job security.\n[135] Accordingly, with regard to allegation three, I find that a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability has been established.\n(3) Does Canada Post have a reasonable explanation for its otherwise discriminatory practice?\n[136] Canada Post essentially provided three responses to the prima facie case regarding this allegation: (a) it denied that Ms. Lipp was as frequently and as negatively questioned on the shop floor as alleged, or that confrontations occurred over the requirement for medical information and appointments; (b) it alleged that the communications by letter with Ms. Lipp and discussions with her on the shop floor, to the extent that they did occur, did not constitute adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability, but rather were necessary actions taken by Canada Post to deal with an uncooperative employee; and, (c) the close proximity of demands for information in June 2001, was the result of a breakdown in communication with Medisys\n[137] For the following reasons, I find that the evidence does not support the Respondent's explanations with regard to the third allegation.\n(a) The Denial of Frequent and Negative Questioning on the Shop Floor Regarding Ms. Lipp's Disability\n[138] The evidence does not support Canada Post's denial of the frequent and negative questioning of Ms. Lipp on the shop floor regarding her disability. On the contrary, the evidence strongly supports Ms. Lipp's position.\n[139] The evidence indicates that Mr. Slater was actively involved in managing Ms. Lipp's case. Mr. Slater himself testified that during 2000 and 2001, he was more actively involved in the management of the files of workers who were on modified duties than at the present time.\n[140] The evidence also establishes that Canada Post supervisors and Mr. Slater had regular occasion to question employees about their restrictions on the shop floor. Mr. Slater's own testimony was that some supervisors may have told workers on the shop floor that, due to one employee's restrictions, another employee was going to have to cover some of their work.\n[141] Mr. Slater stated that he spoke with Ms. Lipp from time to time about various issues including the need to provide medical information. He described Ms. Lipp as being defensive at times, but he denied that he had ever seen her in tears. He stated that he did not recall any confrontations with Ms. Lipp about her restrictions and the requirements to produce medical information.\n[142] In contrast, Ms. Lipp and Ms. Shoeman clearly recalled confrontations regarding Ms. Lipp's restrictions and the requirement to produce medical information. They testified that Mr. Slater spoke in a very loud and angry voice to Ms. Lipp. Ms. Lipp testified that these confrontations occurred on a regular basis. Ms. Shoeman witnessed one such confrontation and felt she had to intervene because it had become so hostile.\n[143] Mr. Slater's poor recall about the events meant that he was unable to provide evidence to rebut the prima facie case presented by the Complainant on this point. Similarly, Mr. Hippe did not present any evidence that rebutted the evidence presented on behalf of the Complainant. Therefore, I find that Ms. Lipp was frequently and negatively questioned and confronted by Canada Post management on the shop floor about her disability, her restrictions and the requirement to provide medical information.\n(b) Lack of Cooperation from Ms. Lipp\n[144] Canada Post argued that the letters to Ms. Lipp, discussions on the shop floor and threats of discipline did not constitute adverse differential treatment based on Ms. Lipp's disability, but rather were non-discriminatory actions taken to deal with a particularly uncooperative employee. Is there any evidence to support that contention?\n[145] I have carefully examined the evidence on this point and have come to the conclusion, for the following reasons, that while Ms. Lipp was not always as cooperative with Canada Post as she should have been, her deficiencies in that regard do not explain the frequency and intensely negative nature of Canada Post's communication with her.\n[146] The evidence indicates that Ms. Lipp did take some time to respond to the first request for an AMI. It was sent out by Medisys on July 21, 2000. Ms. Lipp testified that she did not understand why the request was being made given that she had provided a doctor's note indicating that she was fit to work 8 hour shifts and also that she had worked eight hour shifts prior to applying for the full-time position in June of 2000. For that reason, she formulated a letter to Mr. Slater dated August 21, 2000 asking him a number of questions.\n[147] Mr. Slater testified that he did not receive this letter. In any event, Ms. Lipp finally attended her physician's office, and had the AMI completed and returned to Medisys by September 8, 2000. This was approximately a month and a half after the request was sent to her. I can understand that from Canada Post's perspective, it would appear that Ms. Lipp was not cooperating fully with them at this point in time.\n[148] However, during the period from September 8, 2000, until Ms. Lipp requested a return to work after her sick leave in the Fall of 2001, I see little evidence of a refusal to cooperate with Canada Post's requests for further information regarding her disability. Moreover, Mr. Jeworski and Ms. Lipp both testified that neither of them had ever taken the position with Canada Post that Ms. Lipp would not attend an IME.\n[149] It is true that Ms. Lipp and the union raised concerns when Ms. Lipp was informed on October 18, 2000, that she would be required to attend an IME in Winnipeg on November 27, 2000. Ms. Lipp and the union told Canada Post that it would be difficult for Ms. Lipp to attend the IME in Winnipeg because, among other reasons, Ms. Lipp had trouble traveling. Mr. Hippe reconsidered the requirement of an IME in Winnipeg, and on November 17, 2000, he indicated that it would be rescheduled in Regina.\n[150] I do not consider this to be a refusal to cooperate. Ms. Lipp and the Union raised concerns which Canada Post accepted as sufficiently legitimate to warrant a change in the location for the IME.\n[151] Subsequently, Ms. Lipp learned, through her supervisor, Mr. Brian Kanciruk, that she had been scheduled to attend an IME in Regina. Ms. Lipp's evidence of that encounter was uncontradicted. She testified that Mr. Kanciruk questioned her in a derogatory way about her intention to attend an IME in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp stated that she had not received the paperwork yet and would let Canada Post know once she had. Ms. Lipp's testimony regarding this event was not challenged by any evidence to the contrary.\n[152] Therefore, Mr. Slater's letter of March 26, 2000, in which he stated that it was apparent that Ms. Lipp was considering not attending the IME reflects an inaccurate portrayal of the situation. Ms. Lipp had not refused to attend the IME; she had indicated that she would consider the matter once she had received the paper work.\n[153] As it turned out, through no fault of her own, Ms. Lipp failed to attend the IME that had been rescheduled in Regina for April 2, 2001. She had attempted, through her union, to have the appointment switched with another employee because the date conflicted with personal plans she had made. Canada Post did not consult with her before setting the date. Therefore, I do not think it could reasonably be said that Ms. Lipp's attempts to switch her appointment with another employee constituted a refusal to cooperate.\n[154] Mr. Jeworski candidly admitted that he had made a mistake in trying to arrange for the switch. It would appear that Canada Post was under the impression that Ms. Lipp would attend the appointment on April 2, 2001, while Ms. Lipp thought she was to attend on April 9, 2001. Mr. Jeworski spoke with Canada Post to indicate that it was his mistake and that Ms. Lipp was not to blame.\n[155] However, in his letter of June 7, 2006, Mr. Slater characterized Ms. Lipp's non-attendance at the previous two scheduled IME's as refusals to attend. He then threatened dismissal if Ms. Lipp failed to attend a third scheduled IME on July 30, 2000. Ms. Lipp attended this appointment only to find that it had been cancelled without notice to her.\n[156] On April 3, 2001, the day after Ms. Lipp went on sick leave, Mr. Slater wrote to Ms. Lipp indicating that she was required to produce a fully completed OFA form by April 5, 2001, or she would be considered on leave without pay. Mr. Slater testified that this kind of letter is not sent out to every employee who calls in sick. He stated that he could not explain why the letter was sent out, but that it was possibly because Canada Post was having trouble getting documentation back from this employee. Ms. Lipp provided the required documentation on April 5, 2001.\n[157] My view of the evidence is that although Ms. Lipp was initially slow to cooperate with the request for an AMI in the fall of 2000, she subsequently complied with Canada Post's continued requests for information and attendance at appointments. It is true that she told Canada Post that she did not want to travel to Winnipeg for an IME. Her reasons for this were not frivolous, however. Moreover, Canada Post accepted them in agreeing to schedule the IME in Regina.\n[158] Mr. Hippe's evidence strongly suggests that in fact, it was Ms. Lipp's inability to perform the full functions of her position that was a significant factor in Canada Post's negative conduct towards her. Mr. Hippe testified that Canada Post had always had difficulty with Ms. Lipp's inability to sort oversize mail. It was hoped that this restriction would change and therefore, Canada Post continuously sought information about her restrictions. Mr. Hippe quickly qualified his answer to indicate that continuously meant on a regular basis and that it was perhaps too strong to say that Canada Post had difficulty with the restriction. I found Mr. Hippe's statements and his obvious realization of the implications of those statements to be revealing. They strongly suggested that Canada Post's conduct was, to a large extent, motivated by an unwillingness to accept all of Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions.\n(c) A Breakdown in Communication with Medisys\n[159] Mr. Slater testified that the issuance of two requests for information, one on June 7, 2001, ordering that she attend an IME on July 30, 2001, and another on June 13, 2001, requesting that she provide an AMI should not have happened. Both letters threatened disciplinary action for failure to comply and both were written by Mr. Slater.\n[160] When asked why he had done this, Mr. Slater admitted that it was odd that we're asking for an IME and an AMI at the same time or very close to the same time. He stated that Canada Post had obviously not communicated with Medisys about this because if it had, one of the two requests for more information would not have happened. He stated that better communication might have avoided the problem.\n[161] The fact remains, however, that it was Mr. Slater who drafted both letters regarding the requirement to attend the IME and the requirement to complete the AMI within days of each other. He issued the warning about disciplinary action. It can be inferred, therefore, that he knew that both requirements were being demanded. Any breakdown in communication with Medisys could easily have been remedied by a call to Medisys. For that reason, Mr. Slater's explanation that the issuance of two threatening letters within 6 days of each other was due to a communication breakdown with Medisys does not seem reasonable to me.\n(d) Other Unexplained Communications with Ms. Lipp\n[162] I find that there were other events for which Canada Post has failed to provide a reasonable explanation. For example, when Ms. Lipp did not attend the IME in Regina on April 2, 2001, Mr. Slater issued a 24 Hour Notice of Interview requesting her attendance to discuss and investigate why she did not attend the IME as requested. A warning was given that failure to attend that meeting could result in separate disciplinary action being taken.\n[163] Mr. Slater testified that there would never be any such discipline. Canada Post had never disciplined anyone for not attending an interview. He admitted that the warning should be taken out of the notice and that the forms are not used anymore.\n[164] When asked why he sent a copy of the June 12 letter to Sun Life, Mr. Slater stated that he may have been aware that an application had been made for disability benefits. It was not usual to send a letter such as this to Sun Life unless there was a request to do so. He stated that he has never received a request for such information. Therefore, he could not explain why he sent in the letter.\n(4) The Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding Allegation Number Three\n[165] I conclude, on the basis of this evidence that Canada Post has not provided a reasonable explanation to rebut the prima facie case raised by Ms. Lipp that Canada Post's conduct during the first period constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability. I do not accept Canada Post's assertion that the threats of discipline and frequent reminders about medical information were based entirely on the fact that Ms. Lipp was dilatory in providing information. Rather, I find that an important factor in the adverse differential treatment of Ms. Lipp was that Canada Post was having difficulty accepting the restrictions in her work functions arising from her disability.\n[166] I accept that Canada Post needs to regularly solicit information from employees who have work limitations about the extent of their limitations and whether there have been any changes to those limitations that would affect their accommodation or allow for a more productive work effort. However, there is an important limit to observe here. The requests for information must be reasonable; they cannot be threatening, or so frequent that the burden on the employee becomes onerous.\n[167] Repeated threats of discipline and discharge for failure to provide information about a disability that are not based on valid concerns about cooperation constitute adverse differentiation on the basis of disability, in my view. Similarly, frequent and unjustified questions and discussions with a disabled employee about her restrictions and the need to provide medical information constitute adverse differentiation on the basis of disability. They impose a burden on the disabled employee that is not imposed on non-disabled employees.\n[168] Accordingly, I find that Canada Post engaged in prima facie discriminatory conduct in respect of which it was unable to provide a reasonable explanation.\nVII. THE SECOND TIME PERIOD - MS. LIPP ASKS TO RETURN TO WORK\nA. ALLEGATION NUMBER 4 - The refusal to permit Ms. Lipp to return to work until she had attended the IME's in Winnipeg was discriminatory Overview\n[169] In September 2001, Ms. Lipp called Canada Post to say that she was fit to return to work from sick leave. She provided a doctor's note and an Occupational Fitness Assessment attesting to her fitness to return to work on October 9, 2001. Thereafter she alleged that she was subjected to the same kind of treatment and requests for information that she underwent during the first time period, culminating in the requirement that she attend two IME's in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp alleged that Canada Post's treatment of her during the second time period and the requirement that she attend the IME's constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of her disability (including her psychological condition) and her sex (she was pregnant at the time the requirement of the IME was imposed).\n(1) Is there credible evidence to support this allegation?\n[170] Ms. Lipp testified that she found out that she was pregnant on or about July 14, 2001. She testified that toward the end of the summer she felt that she would be able to return to work. She also testified that she needed to return to work. Her claim for disability insurance had been denied (although this decision was subsequently overturned on appeal and she was awarded the benefits retroactively).\n[171] Ms. Lipp stated that she calculated the number of weeks that she would have to work at a full-time rate in order to qualify for maternity benefits under the Employment Insurance Act and then determined when she should return to work.\n[172] Ms. Lipp testified that on September 18, 2001, she telephoned Canada Post and advised them that she intended to return to work on October 9, 2001. Ms. Lipp was told that before she would be permitted to return to work, Canada Post required additional information that Ms. Lipp was fit to return. She first provided a note from her physician dated October 10, 2001, indicating that her anxiety and depression had cleared up and that she was fit to do her duty - short and long modified duties. (Short and long refers to the sortation of short and long sized letter mail.)\n[173] Ms. Lipp also had an OFA completed by her physician on the same date. It indicated that her depression and anxiety had cleared up. In addition, Ms. Lipp's physician indicated that her physical capabilities were restricted to lifting and carrying 9 kgs. of weight from floor to waist level, lifting and carrying 2 kgs. of weight from waist to shoulder height, and an inability to lift or carry above shoulder level.\n[174] Finally, Ms. Lipp had her physician complete an AMI. She testified that she did not have the AMI completed when asked because she thought that all that should be required of her was what had been done in the past - a doctor's note and an OFA.\n[175] The AMI dated October 29, 2001, indicated that Ms. Lipp still had an anxiety disorder, but that it was well controlled. Ms. Lipp was no longer on medication but she was using natural stress control. In the AMI, Dr. Van Heerden stated that he no longer thought that a change in work was required. He stated: Patient feels that she will be able to cope. He stated that the conflict with her boss was still an issue, but that Ms. Lipp had been advised by her union that there would be no problem if the correct communication lines were followed.\n[176] In the AMI, Dr. Van Heerden stated that, with respect to Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions, she could not lift heavy objects above shoulder height. No other restrictions were outlined and the doctor indicated that Ms. Lipp should be able to sort light letter mail. Dr. Van Heerden prefaced his remarks about Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions by indicating that he was not the treating physician for Ms. Lipp's shoulder injury or chronic rotator cuff condition.\n[177] In her Field Report of October 30, 2001, Dr. Koz stated that the physical restrictions outlined by Dr. Van Heerden in the AMI were not consistent with the restrictions in the OFA that this same doctor had produced just 20 days earlier on October 10, 2001. Dr. Koz stated that she would have difficulty supporting the physical restrictions and limitations provided by Dr. Van Heerden in the AMI until the discrepancy was clarified.\n[178] Mr. Hippe testified that he thought that the discrepancy to which Dr. Koz was referring in the Field Report was that in the OFA, Dr. Van Heerden had set out significant restrictions with regard to Ms. Lipp's physical capacity. However, in the AMI which was completed just 20 days after the OFA, Dr. Van Heerden simply stated that Ms. Lipp could not lift heavy objects over her shoulder and there were otherwise no restrictions. Mr. Hippe stated that if the AMI were taken at face value, this would mean that Ms. Lipp could be doing a greater rotation of duties.\n[179] Thus, it would appear that when Dr. Koz stated in the Field Report that she would have difficulty supporting the restrictions outlined in the AMI, what she meant was that she was not willing to countenance an increase in Ms. Lipp's range of duties on the basis of what had been written in the AMI. Further clarification was needed before that could be done.\n[180] Dr. Koz therefore recommended a meeting with Mr. Hippe and Canada Post superintendents to discuss the case and to select a mechanism to clarify the discrepancy. There was no indication of what was meant by a mechanism. The Field Report did not indicate that there were any uncertainties with respect to Ms. Lipp's psychological condition.\n[181] Canada Post then requested that Ms. Lipp attend a meeting on November 8, 2001, to discuss the Field Report. Ms. Lipp testified that Mr. Hippe, Mr. Slater, Ms. Karchewski, Mr. Jeworski and Ms. Darlene Black, a nurse from Medisys, were present at the meeting on November 8, 2001. She stated that Mr. Hippe led off the meeting by telling her that he wanted her to attend an IME appointment in Winnipeg. He stated that Canada Post would fly her there or send her by bus and that she could take a shop steward with her. Ms. Lipp replied that she was not a flyer and she didn't want to drive that far when she was pregnant. As well, she still had trouble with highway travel because of her husband's death on the highway.\n[182] She testified that she told Mr. Hippe that her doctor had advised her not to travel because of the trouble she was having with uterine cramping. There was a family history of miscarriage; she didn't want to jeopardize her pregnancy.\n[183] Ms. Lipp testified that she asked if she could avoid the IME in Winnipeg by rescheduling the appointment with Dr. Fink in Regina for a date before November 23rd. Ms. Lipp testified that Mr. Hippe's response was that he did not see a problem with that. The Medisys nurse, Darlene Black, indicated however, that she did not think it would be possible to reschedule the appointment within such a short period of time.\n[184] Ms. Karchewski, the shop steward, was present at this meeting. Her testimony about the meeting confirmed that of Ms. Lipp.\n[185] Mr. Jeworski, who was also present at this meeting, testified that Ms. Lipp expressed her concern about going to Winnipeg because she was pregnant and that she had had difficulty with her pregnancy. He testified that Canada Post proposed a number of options to deal with Ms. Lipp's fear of traveling. But Ms. Lipp expressed another concern with regard to a conflict with an appointment with her gynecologist on the date of the IME. Mr. Jeworski testified that Canada Post was looking for confirmation from Ms. Lipp that she would attend the IME in Winnipeg. Although the option of attending an IME in Regina with Dr. Fink was discussed, no commitment was made by Canada Post to this option. Management did indicate that the proposal would be considered. Ms. Lipp indicated that she would consider the possibility of the IME in Winnipeg.\n[186] On or about November 15, 2001, Ms. Lipp received a letter from Darlene Black from Medisys indicating that as per the discussion held on November 8, 2001, Independent Medical Examinations have been arranged for you in Winnipeg with the following itinerary. The letter then indicated the time and place for two IME's in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp testified that this was the first that she had heard that there was to be two IME's. It was not clear from the evidence exactly how Ms. Lipp determined that one of the two appointments was with a psychiatrist, but that information was somehow conveyed to Ms. Lipp after she received the letter from Darlene Black.\n[187] Ms. Lipp testified that she was puzzled by the letter because, contrary to what Ms. Black stated in the letter, there had been no discussion during the November 8th meeting about the need for two IME's. The discussion about the IME on November 8, 2001 related to her physical restrictions, not her psychological state.\n[188] Mr. Jeworski also testified that he was surprised to learn that Ms. Lipp would be required to attend an IME with a psychiatrist in Winnipeg as well as an occupational specialist before she could return to work. He stated that there had been no indication at the November 8 meeting that there would be an appointment with a psychiatrist in Winnipeg.\n[189] Meanwhile, Ms. Lipp successfully rescheduled the appointment with Dr. Fink, the occupational physician, for November 16, 2001. She called Keith Jeworski and let him know this. Based on the discussions with Canada Post and Medisys during the meeting on November 8th, Ms. Lipp thought the appointment with Dr. Fink would obviate the need to travel to Winnipeg to see an occupational specialist.\n[190] Mary Lou Woodfield, the second vice-president of the CUPW local, testified that she had a good rapport with Mr. Hippe and thought that she might be able to resolve the issue of the IME's. She stated that she met with Mr. Hippe and asked him whether he would consider bringing the doctors from Winnipeg to do the IME's. Mr. Hippe told Ms. Woodfield that he was not going to pay for the cost of a doctor to come to Regina. He said that he would not go there.\n[191] Ms. Lipp testified that she attended the appointment with Dr. Fink on November 16, 2001, thinking that this would result in the cancellation of at least one of the IME's in Winnipeg. Dr. Fink was a physician that Canada Post had used before for IME's. She had no reason to believe that he would not be acceptable to the company now.\n[192] Ms. Lipp also attended an appointment with her physician on November 16, 2001. He wrote a note stating:\nShe is currently 23 week pregnant is experiencing some uterine cramping. We would thus prefer that you get another doctor and psychologist closer to home so that she does not have to travel that far. She has a fear of flying which has been accentuated by the recent events. Dr. J. Alton is an occupational physician who might be able to help.\n[193] Ms. Lipp testified that this note was provided to Canada Post.\n[194] Ms. Lipp testified that she received a letter from Mr. Slater dated November 18, 2001, indicating that if she did not attend the IME appointments in Winnipeg, she would be placed on disciplinary leave without pay. She testified that she did not attend the appointments because she was not willing to put her baby in jeopardy.\n[195] On December 5, 2001, Ms. Lipp received notification that Canada Post had put her on disciplinary leave without pay. Mr. Slater also indicated in this letter that if Ms. Lipp's pregnancy did not enable her to attend the IME then she was required to supply documentation to that effect immediately. Alternate arrangements for the IME would then be made after her pregnancy.\n[196] In a letter dated December 6, 2001, George Britton, Secretary-Treasurer of the Regina Local of CUPW, wrote to Mr. Slater stating that Ms. Lipp was willing to attend the IME's and had, in fact, attended an IME with Dr. Fink on November 16, 2001. Mr. Slater responded to Mr. Britton's letter on January 1, 2002, stating that Dr. Fink's IME could not be used since Ms. Lipp's physician made the referral, not Canada Post. Therefore, his examination could not truly be considered an independent medical examination.\n(2) The Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding the Prima Facie Case for Allegation Number 4\n[197] I find that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment with respect to the refusal to return Ms. Lipp to the workplace without first attending the IME's in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp produced a doctor's note and an OFA indicating that she was fit to return to work on October 9, 2001. She then produced an AMI that was reviewed by Medisys. The AMI suggested that Ms. Lipp might have fewer physical restrictions than her doctor had stated in the previous OFA. However, Medisys's physician was not willing to support such a conclusion until the discrepancy between the OFA and the AMI had been clarified. There was nothing in the Field Report to suggest that Ms. Lipp should not be permitted to return to work.\n[198] Nonetheless, Canada Post demanded that Ms. Lipp attend an IME in Winnipeg before she would be allowed to return to work. At first, it appeared that the IME was only with an occupational specialist in Winnipeg. Ms. Lipp assumed that it was to address the outstanding issues with respect to her long-term fitness to do full-time work. However, there was nothing in any of the medical information provided to Canada Post that would have raised questions about her physical capacity to return to full-time modified work as she had been doing in April of that same year. If anything, the AMI suggested that she might be capable of returning to work with fewer restrictions than in April 2001.\n[199] It later became apparent that Canada Post had issues with respect to her psychological fitness to work since Ms. Lipp was being sent to see a psychiatrist in Winnipeg also. There was, however, nothing in the Field Report from Dr. Koz that indicated that Ms. Lipp's psychological condition was in issue. It would appear therefore that, notwithstanding the lack of information at Canada Post's disposal indicating that Ms. Lipp continued to suffer from depression and anxiety disorder, Canada Post perceived that her psychological condition was a barrier to her return to work.\n[200] It is well established that discrimination on the basis of disability encompasses differential treatment on the basis of a perceived disability (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City) [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665; Milazzo v. Autocar Connaisseur Inc. & Motor Coach Canada 2003 CHRT 37 at para's 82-88). I find therefore, that Ms. Lipp established a prima facie case that Canada Post's refusal to permit her to return to work until she had attended the IME's in Winnipeg, constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of a perceived psychological disability and actual physical disabilities (neck, shoulder and spine problems and fibromyalgia).\n[201] This however, does not end the analysis with respect to the prima facie case on this allegation.\n[202] I find that there is also a prima facie case that Canada Post's insistence on the IME's in Winnipeg constituted adverse effect discrimination on the basis of Ms. Lipp's gender. Instead of permitting Ms. Lipp to have the IME done in Regina, as it had previously been willing to do, Canada Post required that Ms. Lipp attend two IME's in Winnipeg before returning to work. Ms. Lipp communicated to Canada Post that she was having difficulties with her pregnancy and did not feel that she could travel; she was concerned about a possible miscarriage. She obtained a note from her doctor dated November 16, 2001, indicating a preference that she not travel due to the uterine cramping she was experiencing. The doctor provided the name of another physician who might perform the IME in Regina.\n[203] Ms. Lipp stated that this note was provided to Canada Post, although she did not say when or how. Mr. Slater testified that he did not recall receiving this information. However, at the hearing of this case, the note was produced in the Respondent's Book of Documents, not the Complainant's. Therefore, I accept Ms. Lipp's testimony that she provided the note about her pregnancy to Canada Post. I also find that both Ms. Lipp and the union were aware of the importance to Canada Post of providing timely medical information. Therefore, I find that Canada Post was provided with the note around the time that it was written, which was November 16, 2001.\n[204] On the face of it, the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend an IME in Winnipeg would not appear to be discriminatory. As Mr. Jeworski testified, for many employees, traveling to Winnipeg would not be a problem. However, for Ms. Lipp this requirement was a problem given her concerns and those of her doctor about traveling during her pregnancy. This apparently neutral requirement had the effect of imposing a burden on Ms. Lipp that other employees would not have to bear: it forced Ms. Lipp to choose between her job and potentially putting her pregnancy at risk. Thus, even though the requirement did not single her out as a woman, it had an adverse effect on her on the basis of her gender. For that reason, I find that a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of gender (pregnancy) has also been established.\n(3) Has the Respondent provided a Reasonable Explanation?\n[205] The Respondent argued that it had reasonable grounds to doubt the validity of Ms. Lipp's physician's reports with respect to her psychological fitness. This, it argued, was conclusively determined by the arbitrator whose decision was entered into evidence. Moreover, there was the outstanding issue of Ms. Lipp's capacity to work full-time and, on top of that, the discrepancy between the OFA and the AMI provided by Dr. Van Heerden in October 2001 that required clarification.\n[206] On the basis of the uncertainty about Ms. Culic's mental and physical health, Canada Post argued that the requirement that she attend the IME's in Winnipeg before she returned to work was a BFOR. Canada Post further argued that there were no doctors in Regina who could perform the IME's. Therefore, Winnipeg it had to be.\n[207] Finally, Canada Post argued that it had insufficient medical information to establish that Ms. Lipp required accommodation for her pregnancy. Thus, it was argued that Ms. Lipp failed in her duty to cooperate with the accommodation efforts.\n[208] The Complainant argued that there was no evidence to support the need for further medical information. Moreover, there was no evidence to support the assertion that Canada Post would suffer undue hardship in returning Ms. Lipp to the full-time position.\n[209] The Complainant and the Respondent have each provided case law that they claim supports their position. The Complainant relied on Code Electric Products Ltd. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers [2005] B.C.A.A.A. No. 14, for the proposition that the safety and health risks must be serious before a requirement to produce medical information before returning to work will be seen as a BFOR. In that case, Arbitrator Burke considered whether the respondent's refusal to return the grievor to his duties as a machine operator without further medical information and a commitment to therapy was discriminatory. The grievor suffered from Bi-Polar disorder as well as cannabis and alcohol abuse problems. He provided equivocal medical evidence about his fitness to return to work. The arbitrator noted that, applying the Meiorin analysis, the requirement in issue in the case was that the grievor must prove his fitness before returning to work followed by successful completion of a course of therapy.\n[210] The arbitrator found that the first two requirements of the Meiorin test were met. With respect to the question of accommodation to the point of undue hardship, the arbitrator noted the evidence of the doctors who testified in that case. They testified that there was a significant risk of impairment in the grievor's judgment if he were to suffer a psychotic episode. Given that he was working in an industrial enterprise in which he operated a machine that slices metal with a large blade at 30-40 slices a minute, the grievor's medical condition posed a serious risk. The arbitrator stated that this was unlike an office situation where very different issues of safety arise.\n[211] The arbitrator found that, in light of the uncertainty in the grievor's medical situation, the severity of his condition and the nature of the work site, undue hardship would result should fitness to return to work not be adequately established.\n[212] The Respondent relies on Brimacombe v. Northland Road Services Ltd. [1998] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 34 (Q.L.). Brimacombe was a heavy-duty mechanic. He was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and experienced dizziness, fatigue and unsteadiness on the job. He went off work on sick leave and when he returned, he provided a doctor's note indicating that he could operate equipment such as driving a truck, but could not do manual labour. The note, however, did not explain his illness, capabilities, limitations and the risks of an accident due to his condition.\n[213] The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal found that the requirement that the complainant provide a more detailed doctor's note was justified and that returning him to work without it created a significant safety risk. The Tribunal stated that the magnitude of the risk to the complainant and to his fellow workers was considerable. As a heavy-duty mechanic, Mr. Brimacombe worked on and around heavy machines, tractors, plows, graders, etc. To allow Mr. Brimacombe to return to work without a note that better explained his illness and his restrictions would have constituted undue hardship for the Respondent, his fellow employees and, in some circumstances, the general public. Furthermore, the Tribunal held that the employer had no way of properly structuring the job duties without medical information.\n[214] These cases suggest that the requirement to provide further medical information and\/or attend an independent medical examination before being allowed to return to the job will likely constitute a BFOR when the medical evidence available thus far is unclear, and there is a significant risk to the safety and\/or health of the employee and others around him or her. Where safety is at issue, both the magnitude of the risk and the identity of those who bear it are relevant considerations (Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Comm.) (1990), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417 at para. 63). However, risk cannot be considered an independent justification of discrimination; rather, it is part of the analysis as to whether forgoing the requirement for further medical information would create undue hardship (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868, at para. 30).\n[215] The nature of the disability and the workplace conditions are factors that should also be taken into account in assessing whether the requirement for an independent medical examination is a BFOR. Pursuant to s. 15(2) of the Act, the Respondent may also present evidence that the cost of accommodating the Complainant without the medical information constituted undue hardship.\n(a) Steps One and Two of the Meiorin Analysis: Was the Requirement of the IME's in Winnipeg Rationally Connected to Legitimate Goals and Adopted in Good Faith?\n[216] I think it makes sense in the context of this allegation to analyze the first two steps of the Meoirin analysis together.\n[217] The arbitral case law in this area indicates that an employer is entitled to request evidence of medical fitness when an employee returns from an absence due to illness. The requirement for medical information has been found to be necessary in order to ensure the safety and health of the returning employee as well as that of fellow employees and to facilitate the accommodation process (Re Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Ltd. and United Rubber Workers, Local 113 (1979) 3 L.A.C. (2d) 12; Code Electric Products Ltd, supra, at para. 100 Brimacombe, supra, at para. 83).\n[218] In my analysis of the first part of these reasons, I found that the requirement of having Ms. Lipp attend an IME in Regina was rationally connected to the goal of ensuring that Canada Post was safely accommodating her in productive work in the full-time postal clerk position. I also found that the requirement to attend an IME in Regina was done in the honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to fulfill those goals. On the same basis, I am prepared to accept that attendance at the two IME's was rationally connected to the goals of ensuring that Ms. Lipp was safely and productively accommodated in the full-time position.\n[219] The question now is whether the requirement of attendance at two IME's in Winnipeg before returning to work was done in the honest and good faith belief that they were necessary to achieve those goals.\n[220] Both Mr. Hippe and Mr. Slater testified that Dr. Koz had told them that Ms. Lipp should not be in the workplace until she had provided the results of the IME's. They further testified that Dr. Koz had lost confidence in the IME provider in Regina, Dr. Fink. Mr. Hippe testified that Dr. Koz told him that there were no other doctors in Regina who could perform the IME's.\n[221] On the basis of that evidence, I am prepared to accept that Canada Post formulated the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend the IME's in Winnipeg before she returned to work in the honest and good faith belief that it was necessary in order to ensure that Ms. Lipp was safely and productively accommodated in the full-time position.\n[222] As is often the case, the more difficult question for the Respondent to answer is:\n(b) Was the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend the IME's in Winnipeg reasonably necessary to the goal of ensuring that Ms. Lipp was safely and productively accommodated in her full-time position?\n[223] At this stage, Canada Post must demonstrate that the requirement of sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg for the IME's was reasonably necessary in that it could not have accommodated Ms. Lipp without experiencing undue hardship (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62). Canada Post must demonstrate that it investigated alternatives to sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg for the IME's, and that any alternatives considered were rejected only for appropriate reasons (Meiorin, supra, at para. 65; see also, Audet v. CNR 2006 CHRT 25 at para 62). Impressionistic evidence of the cost of accommodating an individual is not acceptable; the respondent must demonstrate in real, concrete terms how the costs associated with accommodation impose undue hardship upon it (Audet, supra, at para 106).\n[224] To analyze the third part of the BFOR test, I have divided the question into the following components:\nWas the psychiatric IME necessary? Was the IME with the occupational specialist necessary? Was it reasonably necessary to hold Ms. Lipp out of service until she provided the results of the IME's? Was it reasonably necessary to require that the IME's be held in Winnipeg?\n(i) Was the psychiatric IME necessary?\n[225] Ms. Lipp produced a doctor's note indicating that she was fit to return to work. The arbitrator held that Canada Post, through its medical consultant, Dr. Koz, had reasonable grounds to doubt the validity of medical information provided by Dr. Van Heerden with regard to Ms. Lipp's psychological fitness to work.\n[226] Dr. Koz was not called to testify at the hearing in this case. Mr. Hippe testified that Dr. Koz had told him that Ms. Lipp should not be in the workplace until the results of the IME's were in. However, he could not explain why Dr. Koz was of this view. Therefore, I was not privy to any information that Dr. Koz might have had to suggest that Ms. Lipp continued to suffer from a psychological condition that would have put herself or others around her at risk if she returned to work without first attending a psychiatric IME. The only evidence from Dr. Koz that was before me was the Field Report that she authored, dated October 30, 2001, wherein nothing was mentioned about Ms. Lipp's psychological status. In that report, Dr. Koz did not identify anything in the AMI provided by Dr. Van Heerden that would have caused her to question the doctor's statement that Ms. Lipp was psychologically fit to return to work.\n[227] Mr. Hippe testified that the main reason that Canada Post questioned the validity of the medical information was that the company had somehow become aware that Ms. Lipp needed to come back to work for financial reasons; her disability benefits from Sun Life had run out. When asked why that would cause him to question whether Ms. Lipp was fit to return to work, Mr. Hippe replied that he thought she might be returning to work because she had to, not because she was able to. He stated that he did not think that her psychological condition had changed. However, I heard no evidence that would have been in Canada Post's possession at the time of her request to return to work, to support that statement.\n[228] Therefore, I am not convinced, on the evidence that was before me, that it was necessary for Canada Post to require Ms. Lipp to attend a psychiatric IME in order to safely accommodate her in the postal clerk position. Nevertheless, even if I were to find that it was necessary, this would not end the analysis. I would still be required to examine whether Canada Post was justified in holding Ms. Lipp out of service and requiring that she go to Winnipeg for the IME. Therefore, I will proceed with the analysis as though it was necessary for Canada Post to require a psychiatric IME.\n(ii) Was the IME with an occupational specialist regarding Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions necessary?\n[229] In addition to the psychiatric IME, Ms. Lipp was required to attend an IME in Winnipeg with an occupational specialist to assess her physical limitations. Both Mr. Hippe and Mr. Slater testified that the requirement for an IME with an occupational specialist was based on the discrepancy between the OFA and the AMI provided by Dr. Van Heerden. Although it was not clear to me, on the evidence, that an IME was necessary to clarify this discrepancy, I am prepared to find that Ms. Lipp's attendance at an IME to clarify her physical restrictions with respect to the full-time postal clerk position continued to be necessary.\n[230] Mr. Slater testified that this requirement was still an issue for Canada Post following her sick leave. Ms. Lipp had been off work for some time by the fall of 2001, and Canada Post continued to be concerned about her ability to work full-time and the exact nature of her restrictions. Therefore, for the reasons that I provided in the previous part of this decision dealing with the requirement to attend an IME, I find that the IME with an occupational specialist to clarify Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions, continued to be necessary.\n(iii) Was it reasonably necessary to hold Ms. Lipp out of service until she provided the results of the IME's?\n[231] Although the requirement to attend IME's with an occupational specialist and a psychiatrist may have been reasonably necessary, the obvious question that arises is whether it was necessary to hold Ms. Lipp out of service until she provided the results of those IME's. Given that prior to her departure on stress leave, Canada Post had been prepared to accommodate Ms. Lipp in the full-time position without first having the results of the IME, Canada Post must now show what factors had changed to justify holding her out of service in the fall of 2001.\n[232] Mr. Hippe testified that he was told by Dr. Koz that Ms. Lipp should not be in the workplace until she had attended the IME's and provided the results to Dr. Koz. Unfortunately, however, as I noted above, Dr. Koz did not testify. Nor did any one else testify about the safety, health or cost issues that would or might arise if Ms. Lipp were returned to the modified full-time position in which she had worked from October 2000, until April 2001.\n[233] Therefore, there was no evidence as to why exactly Ms. Lipp should not be in the workplace pending the gathering of further medical information. Did she pose a particular health and safety risk to herself or others around her such that she could not be permitted in the workplace? If so, why was this the case in October of 2001, and not in October of 2000, when Ms. Lipp was transferred to the full-time position notwithstanding the fact that Medisys did not have the results of an IME? These questions were left unanswered during the hearing. The answers to the questions, however, were crucial to a finding as to whether returning Ms. Lipp to her full-time position on modified duties pending the completion of the requisite medical inquiries, would cause undue hardship to Canada Post.\n[234] There was some suggestion by Mr. Hippe that the fact that the workplace conflict with Mr. Slater had not yet been resolved made it dangerous for Ms. Lipp to return to the workplace. However, in cross-examination, Mr. Hippe admitted that Canada Post did not see this as a barrier to her return to the workplace. He testified that the conflict resolution process would likely have been engaged once Ms. Lipp returned to the workplace. However, although the Field Report of July 10, 2001, written while Ms. Lipp was still on sick leave, indicated that this process should be commenced there was no indication in the Field Report of October 30, 2001, when she wanted to return, that conflict resolution was still needed.\n[235] In fact, the evidence revealed that Ms. Lipp did not wish to meet with Canada Post upon her return to work to discuss the conflict with Mr. Slater. Instead, through her union she had demanded that Mr. Slater not come within 10 feet of her and that he be required to communicate with Ms. Lipp through the shift supervisor only.\n[236] Mr. Hippe testified that the operational requirements of the Plant were such that it would create undue hardship for Canada Post to require Mr. Slater to communicate with Ms. Lipp only through the shift supervisor. He testified that if there was an emergency and the shift supervisor was out of the building, Mr. Slater had to be able to communicate with Ms. Lipp.\n[237] Mr. Jeworski proposed to Canada Post what he thought would be a reasonable solution to the workplace conflict that had resulted in Ms. Lipp's departure on stress leave. He knew that a ten-foot rule was unworkable. Mr. Jeworski testified however, that for the most part, the objectives of conflict resolution and Ms. Lipp's successful return to work could be achieved by simply following the normal chain of command in the Mail Processing Plant. As a normal course of events, most communication on the shop floor flowed through the supervisor to the employee. Superintendents like Mr. Slater only became involved when the supervisor was out of the building or on a break, or when something out of the ordinary occurred.\n[238] Mr. Jeworski testified that he made a suggestion to Canada Post that he thought represented a reasonable compromise. Ms. Lipp testified that she agreed with the proposal. It was this: Ms. Lipp would be allowed to return to work on the understanding that she would still be required to attend the IME's. Efforts would be made to find doctors who were in or closer to Regina, or Canada Post would wait until after her pregnancy. The normal lines of communication would be followed in the Plant; Mr. Slater would do what he could not to aggravate the situation with Ms. Lipp.\n[239] Mr. Jeworski thought this plan would work because normally employers are anxious to have employees return to work. Moreover, this was not a radical suggestion; the union was not seeking to have Mr. Slater removed or moved to a different section. Ms. Lipp was not seeking to avoid the IME's. However, Canada Post had drawn a line in the sand and would not accept the proposal. The IME had to come before the re-entry as far as Canada Post was concerned, Mr. Jeworski testified.\n[240] I find that Mr. Jeworski's proposal was eminently reasonable. Canada Post led no evidence as to why it rejected the proposal. Furthermore, there was no evidence that such a proposal would have caused Canada Post undue hardship.\n[241] I find, therefore, that Canada Post has failed to establish that the requirement of holding Ms. Lipp out of service pending the gathering of further medical information was reasonably necessary.\n(iv) Was it reasonably necessary to require that the IME's be held in Winnipeg?\n[242] On the assumption that the psychiatric IME and that the IME with the occupational specialist were reasonably necessary, the question then is whether it was reasonably necessary to require Ms. Lipp to attend these examinations in Winnipeg.\n[243] Here again, the Respondent relies on the decision of the arbitrator, who heard and seemed to have accepted the evidence of Dr. Koz that were good reasons for her to have lost confidence in Dr. Fink. Those reasons were not set out in the arbitrator's decision. The arbitrator would then appear to have accepted evidence that there were no specialists in Regina who could perform the IME's. I was urged to accept these findings in lieu of evidence from Dr. Koz on these points and to find, therefore, that Canada Post had no alternatives to sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg.\n[244] I have a number of concerns about this. Firstly, as I indicated in my ruling on the res judicata issue, it appears that the human rights issues were not argued at the arbitration nor considered by the arbitrator in his decision. Moreover, counsel for Ms. Lipp was not present at that hearing; only the union and Canada Post had standing. Therefore, counsel for Ms. Lipp did not have the opportunity to pose questions to Dr. Koz that were based on a human rights analysis of the case. For example, she did not have an opportunity to explore the nature of the hardship was that was alleged to result from having the IME's performed in Regina or the surrounding area.\n[245] Secondly, there was evidence presented during the hearing in the form of the note from Ms. Lipp's physician indicating that another doctor by the name of Dr. Alport was able to perform at least one of the IME's in Regina. It is not clear from the arbitrator's decision as to whether this evidence was entered at the hearing and put to Dr. Koz. This evidence is, however, relevant to the question of whether there were reasonable alternatives to the requirement of traveling to Winnipeg for the IME regarding Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions. Given that Dr. Koz did not testify at the hearing into the present complaint, there was therefore no opportunity to question Dr. Koz about whether she had considered this and other alternatives.\n[246] Finally, even if one accepts that there was no one in Regina who could have performed the IME with respect to Ms. Lipp's physical restrictions, the arbitrator's decision does not touch upon any evidence from Dr. Koz regarding the availability of someone in Regina to perform the psychiatric IME.\n[247] For these reasons, I find that the arbitrator's decision with respect to the necessity of attending the IME's in Winnipeg is not applicable in the present case.\nDid Canada Post investigate and consider alternatives to sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg?\n[248] Mr. Hippe testified that Dr. Koz had told him that she was not aware of any doctors in Saskatchewan who performed IME's. However, Mr. Hippe also testified that he thought there might be one or two doctors in the province that performed IME's. Moreover, Canada Post was in possession of a note from Dr. Van Heerden dated November 16, 2001, suggesting that a physician by the name of Dr. Alport might be able to perform the physical IME. There was no evidence that Mr. Hippe looked into these possibilities or requested that Dr. Koz make the appropriate inquiries. He testified that because Dr. Koz was from Winnipeg, she had established relationships with doctors in that city who could perform IME's. Mr. Hippe indicated that he accepted Dr. Koz's statement that the IME's should be done in Winnipeg.\n[249] Similarly, no evidence was provided regarding the efforts that were made to determine the availability of doctors in Regina who might perform the psychiatric IME. Thus, I find that the evidence does not establish that Canada Post seriously investigated or considered the availability of other doctors in Regina or Saskatchewan who might have performed the IME's.\nWould accommodating Ms. Lipp have imposed undue hardship on Canada Post?\n[250] Although I have found that several options for Ms. Lipp's accommodation were not considered by Canada Post, s. 15(2) of the Act provides that an employer may nonetheless justify adverse differential treatment of an individual by showing that accommodating the individual's needs would impose undue hardship on it, considering health, safety and cost.\n[251] The evidence indicated that at one point in time, the union suggested that one way to accommodate Ms. Lipp's travel concerns would be for Canada Post to arrange for the Winnipeg doctors to travel to Regina to meet with Ms. Lipp. Ms. Woodfield testified that Mr. Hippe told her categorically that he was not willing to pay the costs.\n[252] At the hearing, however, it was incumbent upon Canada Post to establish, by way of evidence that was more than just impressionistic or conjectural, that the cost of flying the specialists in from Winnipeg would cause Canada Post undue hardship. There was no such evidence presented at the hearing.\n[253] Similarly, in December 2001, the union proposed that Canada Post accept Dr. Fink's IME Report in lieu of an IME report from an occupational specialist in Winnipeg. Canada Post replied that because Ms. Lipp's family physician had referred her to Dr. Fink, the report was no longer considered to be an IME report. Mr. Hippe also testified that Dr. Koz had also lost confidence in Dr. Fink and therefore, his report was not acceptable. However, Mr. Hippe could not say why Dr. Koz had lost confidence in Dr. Fink, and what the implications of accepting the report would have been for Canada Post.\n[254] Again, in the absence of evidence as to what hardship would result to Canada Post from simply accepting Dr. Fink's recommendations instead of sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg, we are left with a number of unanswered questions that are crucial to the determination at this stage of the BFOR test. Would following Dr. Fink's recommendations have led to an unacceptable safety or health risk to Ms. Lipp or her fellow workers? Would it have created costs that were unmanageable for Canada Post? There was simply no evidence whatsoever that addressed these questions.\n[255] For these reasons, I find that Canada Post has failed to establish that not sending Ms. Lipp to Winnipeg for the IME's would have caused it undue hardship.\nDid Ms. Lipp refuse a reasonable solution to the accommodation issue?\n[256] The courts have stated that an employee cannot refuse a reasonable accommodation on the ground that the alternative which he or she favours would not cause the employer undue hardship (Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment 2003 FCA 133 at para. 77). Thus, if it can be shown that Ms. Lipp refused a reasonable accommodation that was offered to her by Canada Post, then it is immaterial whether Canada Post demonstrated that the above mentioned alternatives would have caused undue hardship.\n[257] Canada Post argued that it made considerable effort to accommodate Ms. Lipp's travel concerns. Mr. Hippe testified that he made a number of offers to encourage Ms. Lipp to agree to travel to Winnipeg. For example, she would be paid from November 7, 2001, until she attended the IME's. In addition, various modes of transportation to Winnipeg were offered to her including bus, plane and car travel. She was also permitted to have a union representative attend with her. Finally, there was some suggestion that the expense of having Ms. Lipp's partner attend with her might be provided, although Ms. Lipp testified that she was never informed of this option.\n[258] Canada Post argued that these efforts to accommodate Ms. Lipp were reasonable and that nothing further was required. I disagree. The options that were offered by Canada Post did not address Ms. Lipp's concerns about travel arising from her pregnancy.\n[259] Mr. Hippe testified that he was aware that Ms. Lipp had had difficulty with previous pregnancies and that she may have miscarried in the past. He knew that she was concerned about her current pregnancy and did not want to travel as a result. Mr. Hippe testified that he may also have been in possession of some information indicating that Ms. Lipp was experiencing uterine cramping. However, he testified that when he spoke with Dr. Koz, she told him that uterine cramping was a normal part of pregnancy. On the basis of that statement from Dr. Koz, he formulated the opinion that Ms. Lipp should be able to travel to Winnipeg.\n[260] The Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized the importance of taking into account the individual needs of the person requesting the accommodation (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62). Generalizations about normal pregnancies cannot, therefore, serve as the basis for a decision not to provide an individual with accommodation for her particular needs. While Dr. Koz's opinion was a factor to be considered in assessing Ms. Lipp's need for accommodation, it was only one among a number other factors that should have been taken into account.\n[261] Ms. Lipp certainly had an obligation to inform Canada Post about the individual circumstances of her pregnancy (Desormeaux v. O.C. Transpo 2003 CHRT 2 at para. 110, aff'd 2005 FCA 311). However, the evidence established that she did so.\n[262] Moreover, even without taking Ms. Lipp's pregnancy into account, I find that the accommodation offers made by Canada Post were not reasonable. In my view, the requirement that Ms. Lipp travel out of the province for a two-day IME should only have been imposed as a last resort. It was an onerous obligation that Ms. Lipp was required to comply with because she was a disabled worker. Canada Post, therefore, had a duty to thoroughly investigate all possible alternatives prior to sending her to Winnipeg for the IME's. The evidence indicates that Canada Post did not do so.\n[263] In the light of this evidence, I find accordingly, that the offer of accommodation that was made to Ms. Lipp with regard to travel to Winnipeg was not a reasonable one.\n(4) Tribunal's Findings and Conclusions Regarding Allegation Number Four\n[264] For all of the above reasons, I find that Canada Post has failed to establish that the requirement that Ms. Lipp attend two IME's in Winnipeg before returning to work was a bona fide occupational requirement. Therefore, I find that Canada Post's refusal to return Ms. Lipp to work until she had attended the IME's in Winnipeg constituted discrimination on the basis of disability (perceived and actual) and gender.\nB. ALLEGATION NUMBER 5 - The imposition of disciplinary leave without Pay (1) The Prima Facie Case\n[265] If Ms. Lipp had not been pregnant and disabled she would not have been placed in a situation where she had to choose between receiving the discipline and risking the health of her fetus. On that basis, I find that there is a prima facie case of differential treatment on the basis of disability and gender.\n(2) The Respondent's Explanation\n[266] Canada Post argued that it imposed the discipline for non-discriminatory reasons, that is, to discipline an employee for insubordination. In that regard, Canada Post relied on the reasoning of the arbitrator who held that Ms. Lipp made a tactical choice not to attend the IME's in Winnipeg. Her defiant stance in that regard justified the imposition of disciplinary leave without pay.\n[267] The question before me is not, as it was in the arbitration, whether Canada Post was justified in imposing disciplinary leave without pay on Ms. Lipp. Rather, the question that I must answer is whether Canada Post has established, on the evidence, either that Ms. Lipp's status as a pregnant and disabled worker was not a factor in the decision to place her on disciplinary leave without pay, or that the discipline was a bona fide occupational requirement. Canada Post did not raise the latter argument. Therefore, I will not address that issue.\n[268] Canada Post led no evidence whatsoever that challenged the Ms. Lipp's evidence that her refusal to attend the IME's in Winnipeg was not insubordination, but rather was a decision based primarily on a concern about the effect of travel on her pregnancy. Ms. Lipp testified that she was willing to attend the IME's, but she could not travel out of town for them. She expressed her concern to Canada Post and provided a doctor's note that substantiated her concern. Mr. Hippe was aware that Ms. Lipp had a history of difficulties with pregnancy, and was aware of her related concerns about traveling, but he chose instead to follow Dr. Koz's general statement to him that uterine cramping during the second trimester was normal. Canada Post did not lead any medical evidence in support of what would appear to be an argument that Ms. Lipp's concern about her pregnancy was just an excuse to avoid the IME.\n[269] In light of the evidence of Ms. Lipp's concerns about her pregnancy and her communication of those concerns to Canada Post, I find that the allegation that Ms. Lipp's refusal to attend the IME's was insubordination, for which she was justifiably disciplined, did not constitute a reasonable explanation for Canada Post's conduct.\n(3) Tribunal's Conclusion Regarding Allegation Number 5\n[270] Accordingly, I find that the imposition of disciplinary leave without pay constituted discrimination on the basis of Ms. Lipp's disability and her gender.\nVIII. WHAT IS THE TRIBUNAL'S CONCLUSION REGARDING LIABILITY? [271] When Ms. Lipp applied for the full-time position on Shift 3, Canada Post was justified in requiring medical information establishing that she could safely perform the duties of the position and the extent of her restrictions in light of her statement that she could now work past the six hour restriction. When Canada Post transferred Ms. Lipp to the position, it was justified in requiring that she attend an IME to determine the long-term safety of her work load.\n[272] However, the manner in which Canada Post implemented these requirements was discriminatory. Canada Post's repeated, negative and threatening communication with Ms. Lipp about her disability and the need to provide medical information constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability.\n[273] Canada Post's continuing requirement that Ms. Lipp attend an IME regarding her physical limitations in the fall of 2001, after her period of sick leave was a bona fide occupational requirement. However, Canada Post's refusal to return Ms. Lipp to her former modified position until she attended two IME's in Winnipeg, one with a psychiatrist and one with an occupational specialist, constituted discrimination on the basis of disability and gender. Finally, the imposition of disciplinary leave without pay was discriminatory.\n[274] Canada Post was provided with insufficient notice that allegation number one was going to be raised during the hearing. Therefore, I did not consider this allegation and it is dismissed.\nIX. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY? A. An Order that Canada Post Return Ms. Lipp to Active Service [275] Ms. Lipp seeks an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the Act, directing Canada Post to return her to active service in her position as a full-time postal clerk, on the basis of the medical information that she has already provided. She states that her return would have to be gradual and include an orientation to any new processes and\/or procedures that have been implemented since her departure from the workplace in April 2001.\n[276] Section 53(2)(b) of the Act provides that where the Tribunal finds the complaint is substantiated, it may order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[277] I have found that Canada Post discriminated against Ms. Lipp on the basis of her disability and her gender when it refused to return her to work on October 9, 2001. I therefore, order Canada Post to return Ms. Lipp to active service in the full-time postal clerk position on Shift Three subject to the following conditions:\nCanada Post shall work with the union, Medisys and Ms. Lipp to implement a gradual return to work and an orientation program at the earliest reasonable opportunity; The return to work shall be implemented on the basis of the restrictions that were established in March 2000; Upon her return to work, Ms. Lipp is to cooperate with Canada Post to set the earliest possible date for an IME appointment with an occupational specialist to evaluate her current health status and to determine the extent of her current physical restrictions; Canada Post shall work with Medisys to secure an appointment with an occupational specialist in Regina, if at all possible, and if not, in the locale that is in closest proximity to Regina as possible. Once the results of the IME are obtained, Canada Post shall work with the union, Medisys and Ms. Lipp to determine the appropriate accommodation of Ms. Lipp in the full-time postal clerk position.\nB. An Order that Canada Post Cease its Discriminatory Conduct and Address the Underlying Factors and Effects of the Conduct [278] I have found that while Canada Post was justified in requiring further information from Ms. Lipp, the manner in which it went about doing this was discriminatory. Frequent and negative requests for information, negative questions and comments on the shop floor about work restrictions, and frequent threats of discipline accompanying these requests for information constituted adverse differential treatment in which Ms. Lipp's disability became the focus of Canada Post's negative attention toward her.\n[279] To address these problems, Ms. Lipp has requested an order directing that Mr. Slater not communicate directly with her except in an emergency. On the basis of the evidence provided by Mr. Hippe and Mr. Jeworski, I find that this order is not appropriate. As Superintendent of Shift 3, Mr. Slater must be free to communicate with all of his employees when the need arises, not only in emergency situations. Although Mr. Jeworski's suggestion of following the normal lines of communication from superintendent to supervisor and from supervisor to employee is a good one, more is needed. It seems to me that what is needed in the present case is a remedy that will address the attitudinal and behavioural factors that gave rise to the discrimination in the first place. It was not only Mr. Slater who was involved in the actions that I have found to be discriminatory.\n[280] In my view, Canada Post's treatment of Ms. Lipp suggests that some members of management in Regina's Mail Processing Plant felt that an aggressive and confrontational approach to managing employees with disabilities like Ms. Lipp was necessary. This is not appropriate, in my view. It is the responsibility of Canada Post, as the employer, to work cooperatively with the union and individual employees to provide a workplace that is free from discrimination.\n[281] Therefore, in order to redress the discriminatory practice and to prevent the same from occurring in the future, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a), I order that:\nCanada Post must cease the conduct that was found to be discriminatory in this case, in particular, unnecessary requests for information about Ms. Lipp's disability including those that are accompanied by unwarranted threats of discipline; In consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Canada Post must provide sensitivity training to all members of Canada Post management at the Regina Mail Processing Plant with respect to the management and accommodation of persons with disabilities; In consultation with Ms. Lipp and the union, Canada Post must undertake to resolve the conflict between Ms. Lipp and Mr. Slater, and\/or make available to Ms. Lipp the services of a counselor of Ms. Lipp's choice to provide her with supportive counseling for a reasonable period of time upon her return to work.\n[282] Nothing in this order shall limit or restrict Ms. Lipp's obligation to cooperate, in a timely fashion, with Canada Post's requirement that she provide regular updates regarding her medical status, or the provision of information should her restrictions or position change. Moreover, nothing in this order shall limit or restrict Canada Post's right to request an Independent Medical Examination in accordance with the collective agreement in the appropriate circumstances.\nC. Compensation for Lost Wages [283] The burden of establishing entitlement to compensation is on the complainant (O'Connor v. Town Taxi (1987) Ltd., 2000 BCHRT 9 at para. 60). To establish such an entitlement, the complainant must show some causal connection between the discriminatory act and the loss claimed (Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan (1991), 85 D.L.R. (4th) 473 (F.C.A.)). To discharge this burden, the complainant must prove only that there is a serious possibility that the respondent's discriminatory act caused the damage for which the complainant claims compensation. Proof of the extent of that damage is another issue. Any uncertainty regarding the extent of the damage must be factored into the assessment of the appropriate quantum of damages (Chopra v. Health Canada 2004 CHRT 27; aff'd Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General) 2006 FC 9).\n[284] Ms. Lipp argues that she should be compensated for lost wages for the period from October 9, 2001, when her doctor advised that she was able to return to work, to the date when she actually returns to work pursuant to this Tribunal's order.\n[285] I have divided the Complainant's claim for wage loss into discrete time periods for ease of analysis.\n1. October 9, 2001 - December 5, 2001\n[286] I have found that Canada Post's refusal to return Ms. Lipp to her full-time duties on October 9, 2001, was discriminatory. Therefore, Canada Post is ordered to pay Ms. Lipp all wages and benefits that she would have received from October 9, 2001 until she was placed on disciplinary leave, on December 5, 2001.\n2. December 5, 2001 - March 16, 2005\n[287] I have also found that the imposition of disciplinary leave without pay on December 5, 2001, was discriminatory. In principle, therefore, Canada Post would be liable for the wages and benefits that were not paid to Ms. Lipp during the period that she was on disciplinary leave without pay. However, the evidence is not clear as to the exact time frame of this leave. Ms. Lipp testified that she felt that even at the time of the hearing, she was still on disciplinary leave without pay. However, it was not clear from the evidence that this was, in fact the case. Moreover, for the following reasons, I find that there were intervening events in the chain of causality that make compensation for the loss of wages for the entire period from December 5, 2001 until present, too remote.\n[288] Ms. Lipp was placed on disciplinary leave without pay effective December 5, 2001, pending receipt of the required medical information.\n[289] On March 16, 2002, Ms. Lipp gave birth to her first child. Canada Post approved Ms. Lipp's request for maternity leave for the period from March 16, 2002, to March 16, 2003.\n[290] Ms. Lipp testified that she received some statutory employment insurance benefits for the period of her maternity leave. However, she did not receive the full amount that she would have received had she been allowed to return to work on October 9, 2001. Moreover, she did not receive the top-up benefits from Canada Post that were provided for under the collective agreement for her maternity leave period.\n[291] On April 7, 2003, Mr. Hippe wrote Ms. Lipp a letter indicating that her maternity leave had expired and that no further requests for leave had been received. The letter from Mr. Hippe indicated that if Ms. Lipp wished to return to work she would be required to first complete an OFA. If she did not return the completed OFA by April 21, 2003, Canada Post would consider that she was unwilling\/unable to perform her duties at Canada Post.\n[292] Instead of having the form completed and returning to work, Ms. Lipp testified that she applied for and was granted two one-year periods of unpaid leave for spousal relocation from March 16, 2003 to March 16, 2005. She was entitled to do so under Article 27.05 of the collective agreement.\n[293] Ms. Lipp stated that her husband (to whom she was not married at the time) had moved to Weyburn because he had found a job there and also because the couple wanted a bigger house in which to raise their family. It was unclear when Ms. Lipp's husband moved to Weyburn, but it would appear to have been prior to April 7, 2003, when Canada Post requested notice of her intentions with respect to her return to work.\n[294] Ms. Lipp testified that she wanted to be compensated for the salary that she did not receive during the spousal relocation leaves from March 16, 2003, to March 16, 2005. She testified that she would not have applied for a relocation leave to move with her husband to Weyburn had she been allowed to return to work in October 2001. It was because she had been without a full-time income since October 2001 that she was forced to sell her house and her cottage, and move with her husband to Weyburn. She stated that had she been allowed to return to work in October of 2001, she would not have had to sell her house in Regina, and could have stayed there until her husband was able to transfer back to Regina.\n[295] Ms. Lipp stated that her relationship with her husband, who was her boyfriend at that time, was relatively new, and she was reluctant to move in with him so early in the relationship. As a result of being forced on disciplinary leave without pay, however, she had to move with him to Weyburn.\n[296] I find that Ms. Lipp's testimony in that regard was somewhat contradictory and implausible. She stated that she would not have moved to Weyburn with her husband but for the financial problems caused by Canada Post. However, she also stated that her husband had moved to Weyburn both for the job, but also because the couple wanted a bigger home for their family. Ms. Lipp further testified that she moved to Weyburn with her husband because they were having a child together.\n[297] On the basis of this evidence, I am not convinced that there was a serious possibility that but for Canada Post's discriminatory conduct, Ms. Lipp would not have applied for spousal relocation leave without pay. Rather, I find, on the basis of the evidence, that it is highly probable that Ms. Lipp would have applied for the relocation leave regardless of whether she had been permitted to return to work in October of 2001. Mr. Hippe's letter of April 7, 2003 invited Ms. Lipp to return to work. She chose not to do so. Therefore, I find that Canada Post is not liable for her wages during the period from March 16, 2003 to March 16, 2005.\n[298] However, Canada Post is liable for the difference between the income and benefits that she would have received had she returned to work on October 9, 2001, and what she actually received for the period from December 5, 2001 to March 16, 2003.\n3. March 16, 2005, to present\n[299] Ms. Lipp testified that she and her family returned to Regina in March of 2005. By that point she had given birth to a second daughter. Ms. Lipp stated that she remembered filling out an application form for care and nurturing leave. The collective agreement provided for an unpaid leave of absence to care for preschool age children. Ms. Lipp also testified that by that point in time, the arbitration was underway, she had filed a human rights complaint, and she just wanted to wait until the legal issues had been determined before she returned to work.\n[300] Canada Post argued that it should not be required to compensate Ms. Lipp for wages that she would have earned from March 2005, until the present time because at no point during this period has Ms. Lipp indicated a willingness or readiness to return to work.\n[301] In my view, the evidence established that Ms. Lipp made a choice not to return to work after March 2005. Although she stated that she felt that she was still on disciplinary leave without pay, Ms. Lipp was also aware that Canada Post was willing to consider her return to work upon completion of an OFA. She chose not to do this. The evidence established that from March 16, 2005, she chose not to return to work either out of a desire to stay at home and care for her children, as evidenced by her completion of the care and nurturing leave form, or a wish to see the legal issues resolved in this case before she returned, or for both reasons. Canada Post should not have to compensate Ms. Lipp for wages and benefits for a period during which she chose not to work. Therefore, no order for wage compensation will be issued for the period from March 16, 2005 to present.\nConclusion Regarding Compensation for Wage Loss\n[302] In conclusion, therefore, I order that Canada Post compensate Ms. Lipp for any wage and\/or maternity and other benefit loss that she incurred during the period from October 9, 2001, to March 16, 2003. While I heard some evidence regarding the amounts that should be considered in calculating the quantum of this award, it was incomplete. I am therefore, unable to set the quantum of the award. The parties are encouraged to reach an agreement on this issue. The calculation of the amounts owing should take into account statutory benefits, insurance payments and any other relevant remuneration received during the time period from October 9, 2001, to March 16, 2003.\n[303] I shall retain jurisdiction over this aspect of the award in the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to the appropriate quantum based on the above findings. The parties are to notify the Tribunal within 60 days of the receipt of this decision if an agreement has not been reached.\nD. Compensation for Pain and Suffering [304] Section 53(2)(e) of the Act states that the Tribunal may order the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory conduct to compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding $20,000.00, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. On the basis of the following evidence, I find that Canada Post's discriminatory conduct caused Ms. Lipp significant pain and suffering.\n[305] Ms. Lipp testified that when she went off work in April 2001, she was very upset. Ms. McCarron, the psychologist who treated Ms. Lipp, testified that when Ms. Lipp first attended at her office she was having trouble sleeping, there was some suicidal ideation, she was having nightmares, difficulty concentrating and feeling very afraid and alone.\n[306] Ms. McCarron tested Ms. Lipp's anxiety and depression levels using the Burns Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. She testified that Ms. Lipp scored in the severe level for depression, and was extremely anxious. Ms. McCarron testified that discussions of the workplace environment during the counseling sessions would bring on panic attacks for Ms. Lipp.\n[307] Ms. Lipp's family physician provided a diagnosis of major depression and anxiety disorder and indicated that the workplace conflict was a factor that would prevent her recovery. He stated that Ms. Lipp's anxiety was heightened just by mentioning the current workplace.\n[308] Ms. Lipp testified that, with the exception of the time that she worked on the midnight shift from January 2001, to March 2001, she felt under constant stress at work. She felt humiliated by the questions and statements about her disability and the seemingly endless requirements to produce more medical information. However, Ms. Lipp also testified that by the fall of 2001, after six months away from the workplace, she was feeling much better. She was happy and anxious to get back to work. She testified that was no longer taking any medication, and was able to control her anxiety with natural stress reduction methods.\n[309] Canada Post suggested that Ms. Lipp's reactions to the events in the workplace were exaggerated and unreasonable. However, the only evidence that was led in support of this contention was Mr. Slater and Mr. Hippe's testimony that Ms. Lipp had no reason to be so upset. This is insufficient to challenge Ms. Lipp's testimony regarding her suffering.\n[310] I find that Canada Post's conduct created an extremely negative work environment for Ms. Lipp which resulted in a considerable amount of pain and suffering, and was a significant factor in the development of her depression and anxiety disorder.\n[311] Ms. Lipp requested $20,000 in compensation for pain and suffering. While I agree that Ms. Lipp experienced considerable pain and suffering as a result of Canada Post's discriminatory conduct, the extent and duration of this suffering does not justify the maximum amount, in my view. Therefore, taking into account all of the circumstances that I detailed above, I order Canada Post to pay Ms. Lipp $12,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering.\nE. Special Compensation - s. 53(3) of the Act [312] Section 53(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to a victim of discrimination if the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly. Counsel for Ms. Lipp argued that Canada Post's conduct was decidedly willful or reckless, particularly with regard to the treatment that Ms. Lipp received while she was on sick leave, and then when she tried to return to work in the fall of 2001. Ms. Lipp's counsel argued that Canada Post should be ordered to pay the maximum amount of compensation under this head.\n[313] I agree that Canada Post's conduct in this case was reckless. Mr. Slater and Mr. Hippe both testified that there were aspects of Ms. Lipp's case that should have been handled differently. Mr. Slater admitted that he sent letters to Ms. Lipp that should not have been sent while she was on sick leave. As I stated earlier, the evidence suggests that Canada Post took a very aggressive and negative approach to managing Ms. Lipp's restrictions and participation in the workforce. I find that this was done in reckless disregard of the consequences that it might have on Ms. Lipp.\n[314] However, I do not agree that Canada Post's conduct in this case was egregious enough to warrant the maximum allowable amount under the Act. In the circumstances of this case, I find that an order in the amount of $10,000 is appropriate. Therefore, I order Canada Post to pay Ms. Lipp the sum of $10,000 in compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act.\nF. Letter of Acknowledgement [315] Counsel for Ms. Lipp argued that while the Federal Court in Stevenson v. Canada (Canadian Security Intelligence Service) 2003 FCT 341, held that the Tribunal may not order the Respondent to provide an apology, the overall goals and intentions of the Act would permit the Tribunal to order the Respondent to acknowledge that its actions have led to a finding of discrimination by this Tribunal. In Stevenson, the Court held that although the Tribunal in that case had made a finding against CSIS, this did not mean that CSIS believed that the decision was necessarily correct, or that CSIS had discriminated against Mr. Stevenson. The Court stated that there was an element of coercion and punishment in the ordering of an apology. It held, therefore, that the authority to order that letters of apology be given to a successful complainant must be expressly provided for in the act or must be derived by necessary implication (an inherent power).\n[316] In my view, there is also an element of coercion involved in requiring the Respondent to provide Ms. Lipp with a letter acknowledging that its actions have led to a finding of discrimination by this Tribunal. Following the Court's reasoning in Stevenson, I find that I do not have the statutory authority under the Act to order that the Respondent issue such a letter.\nG. Costs [317] Ms. Lipp has asked that she be reimbursed on a solicitor client basis for the legal expenses that she incurred as a result of this dispute. In a recent decision, the Chairperson of this Tribunal held that the weight of judicial authority supports the Tribunal's power to award legal costs under s. 53(2) of the Act (Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces 2006 CHRT 49 at para. 27). I agree that the Tribunal has the authority to award costs.\n[318] I am not of the view, however, that the Tribunal has the statutory authority under the Act to order costs on a solicitor client basis. Rather, judicial authority suggests that s. 53(2)(c) authorizes the Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay the reasonable costs of counsel. In Stevenson, supra, the Federal Court adopted the words used by the Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Thwaites [1994] 3 F.C. 38 (F.C.T.D.), indicating that paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act was to be interpreted as granting the Tribunal the authority to award reasonable costs for counsel. Stevenson dealt with an award of costs incurred prior to the referral of a complaint to the Tribunal. In Attorney General of Canada v. Brooks, 2006 FC 500, the Federal Court applied the reasoning in Stevenson to the awarding of costs incurred for ongoing legal representation up to and including representation at the Tribunal hearing.\n[319] Accordingly, I order that Canada Post pay the reasonable costs to Ms. Lipp of retaining counsel both prior to and during the hearing in relation to the discriminatory practices that were alleged and found to be substantiated in this complaint.\n[320] Counsel for Ms. Lipp did not lead any evidence on the issue of costs. Therefore, I am unable to make an order with respect to the quantum of this award. The parties are, however, encouraged to come to an agreement on the quantum of reasonable costs in this matter. I shall retain jurisdiction over this aspect of the award in the event that the parties are unable to reach such an agreement. The parties are to notify the Tribunal within 60 days of the receipt of this decision if an agreement has not been reached.\nH. Interest [321] Interest is payable in respect of all awards made in this decision pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the bank rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Interest with respect to compensation for lost wages and benefits is to run from the midpoint between October 9, 2001, and March 16, 2003. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and the compensation under s. 53(3), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint. In no case, however, should the total amount payable under s. 53(2)(e) including interest, exceed $20,000. Similarly, the total amount payable under s. 53(3), including interest, should not exceed $20,000.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

The Respondent has already indicated to the Tribunal that it had made the decision not to call Dr. Lachance as a witness because of medical reasons. The Respondent however wants to tender in evidence the medical certificate signed by Dr. Bailliu.\n[2] In his Notice of motion dated April 4, 2007, the Complainant requests both disclosure of certain documents he submits are arguably relevant to Dr. Bailliu's testimony as well as information by way of particulars.\n[3] The Tribunal has already indicated that the purpose of a motion for disclosure is to provide the moving party with arguably relevant documents and not to provide information by way of particulars.\n[4] At the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent indicated that he was prepared to disclose some of the requested documents as long as they related to the medical certificate completed by Dr. Bailliu, dated September 14, 2006.\n[5] Counsel for the Respondent thus indicated that he was prepared to provide Dr. Bailliu's curriculum vitae, Dr. Lachance's medical record as well as documentation pertaining to Dr. Lachance's medical record as long as it relates to the medical certificate completed by Dr. Bailliu on September 14, 2006.\n[6] The question in issue here has to do with Dr. Bailliu's appearance as a witness to tender in evidence a medical certificate signed by her that relates to Dr. Lachance's health condition as of September 14, 2006.\n[7] At this stage of the proceeding, the production of Dr. Bailliu's medical certificate is not in issue. What is however in issue is the disclosure of certain documents which the Complainant submits are arguably relevant with respect to her testimony in the event that Dr. Bailliu is called as a witness.\n[8] The Tribunal finds that Dr. Bailliu's curriculum vitae, Dr. Lachance's medical record that she has in her possession as well as all documentation related to her assessment of Dr. Lachance are arguably relevant to Dr. Bailliu's testimony.\n[9] The Tribunal will thus order that the Respondent comply with the Complainant's request for disclosure of documents related to paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) of Complainant's motion, such as Dr. Bailliu's curriculum vitae, Dr. Lachance's medical record, any invoice for professional fees, as long as these documents relate to the medical certificate completed by Dr. Bailliu's on September 14, 2006, subject to any solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\n[10] The Tribunal is of the view that the documents or particulars referred to in paragraphs (viii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii) of Complainant's motion are not arguably relevant given the nature of Dr. Bailliu's purported testimony. The Complainant has failed to show that the documents or information referred to in these paragraphs relate to Dr. Bailliu's assessment of Dr. Lachance's medical condition as of September 14, 2006.\n[11] Counsel for the Complainant will still be able, if Dr. Bailliu is called as a witness, to cross-examine her as to what information or documentation she relied upon when she completed her medical certificate and challenge her opinion as to Dr. Lachance's current state of health.\n[12] As for the information requested in paragraphs (xiv) and (xv) of Complainant's motion, Counsel for the Complainant will be able to question Dr. Bailliu on these matters, if the latter is ever called as a witness.\n[13] The Tribunal orders that the following documents be disclosed to Complainant's counsel:\nDr. Bailliu's current curriculum vitae - Motion, paragraph (a) (i); Dr. Lachance's medical record in the possession of Dr. Bailliu as long as it relates to the medical condition referred to in the medical certificate - Motion, paragraph (a) (iii); Any document, notes, correspondence related to Dr. Bailliu's assessment of Dr. Lachance with regards to her September 14, 2006 medical certificate - Motion, paragraphs (a), (ii), (iii) (iv), (vii); Any document, such as invoices, pertaining to how Dr. Bailliu was compensated for preparing the certificate dated September 14, 2006, as well as her mandate, subject to solicitor-client and litigation privilege - Motion, paragraphs (a), (v), (vi);\n[14] Counsel for the Respondent is to provide Counsel for the Complainant with a copy of the above-mentioned documents as soon as he has completed reviewing the documents.\n[15] Counsel for the Complainant is not to disclose the documents received or any information related to them to anyone except to people in his office directly involved in this file.\n[16] Counsel for the Complainant shall return to Counsel for the Respondent all documents disclosed if Dr. Bailliu's is not called as a witness.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril 13, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT901\/2104\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nShiv Chopra v.

He expressed the fear that this information could find its way onto the web and could be used in order to access additional personal information on him, information that could be used to his detriment.\n[3] Amongst other things, Mr. Martinez referred to the fact that Mr. Fromm, in a nightly radio-show aired on the Stormfront website, had already referred to Mr. Martinez's testimony in the present proceedings.\n[4] This specific security issue gave way to a more general issue as to the cross-examination of Mr. Martinez, more specifically as to whether or not his cross-examination should be held in camera or be the object of a publication ban.\n[5] After hearing from the parties on the above mentioned issues, Mr. Vigna suggested that, in order to deal with the security issue raised by himself and Mr. Martinez, the Tribunal view the DVD which had been disclosed to Mr. Vigna by Mr. Fromm and that Mr. Fromm intended to use in the course of his cross-examination of Mr. Martinez. The Tribunal agreed and viewed the DVD in question in the presence of all the parties in an in camera session.\n[6] The DVD that the Tribunal viewed, marked Exhibit V-1, contains footage from different events pertaining to rallies or protests held in 2004 by Mr. Fromm's group (Canadian Association for Free Expression) in support of Ernst Zundel's release from prison. The first two segments were filmed by Mr. Jurgen Neumann. The third one was produced by the CBC and was aired on the NERVE, a CBC television show. Two other segments deal with other protests involving the ARA (Anti-Racist Action).\n[7] It was stated by Mr. Fromm that the DVD was created and edited by Mr.Marc Lemire. At the outset of the DVD, Mr. Martinez's name appears. He is depicted as a zealot, a fanatic and a terrorist.\n[8] The footage screened shows, amongst other things, Mr. Fromm addressing a crowd of people demonstrating in support of Ernst Zundel's release from prison as well as opponents to the protests. Mr. Martinez is seen, with part of his face hidden, demonstrating with the ARA (Anti Racist Action) group.\n[9] In addition to the DVD, Mr. Vigna tendered in evidence excerpts from different websites (Exhibits V-2 to V-6).\n[10] Exhibit V-2 contains three pictures of Mr. Martinez, pictures that were part of the DVD viewed by the Tribunal. These pictures were posted on the Canadian Redwatch website.\n[11] As for Exhibits V-3 to V-6, they contain postings on the Stormfront website. Some of the postings are from Mr. Fromm. These postings refer to Mr. Martinez in unflattering terms. Exhibit V-5 advertises a DVD on Shane Ruttle Martinez. Mr. Martinez is depicted as an ARA leader, a communist and a terrorist. It is stated that the DVD can be bought at a cost of $20.\n[12] The Tribunal has to decide with respect to the issue of security raised by Mr. Vigna and Mr. Martinez in the course of Mr. Martinez's cross-examination by Mr. Fromm whether or not Mr. Martinez's cross-examination should be held in camera or whether or not a publication ban should be imposed, preventing the dissemination of the content of his cross-examination on the web.\n[13] At the hearing, in relation to the issue that the Tribunal has to decide, Mr. Vigna referred to section 52, paragraph (1), subparagraphs (c) and (d) of the CHRA which read as follows:\nAn inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\n(c) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or\n(d) there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n[14] The evidence shows Mr. Martinez to be a human rights activist with the ARA who was present in the past at rallies and protests organized by groups supporting free speech in relation to Ernst Zundel. The footage viewed by the Tribunal shows Mr. Martinez being an active participant at those events, not afraid to make his views known publicly.\n[15] The evidence also shows that Mr. Martinez has been the object of many postings on websites. The postings are not very flattering towards Mr. Martinez. Mr. Martinez stated he felt offended and degraded by the content of these postings. Mr. Martinez sees them as insulting and defamatory.\n[16] Mr. Martinez acknowledged however that, per se, the postings did not contain any direct threat to his security but that nonetheless he felt that his security would be jeopardize or compromised if his cross-examination was posted on the web given the information on him already on different websites.\n[17] The Tribunal is of the view that the posting do not constitute a direct and immediate threat to Mr. Martinez security so that their existence would justify a publication ban with respect to Mr. Martinez's testimony in the course of his cross-examination by Mr. Fromm.\n[18] As stated previously, the DVD's viewed by the Tribunal refers to Mr. Martinez, in its introduction, as a zealot, a fanatic as well as a terrorist. This, it appears, raises concerns about Mr. Martinez's security.\n[19] It must be stated here that what is at issue in relation to the publication ban's request is not the dissemination of the DVD but any publication of Mr. Martinez's testimony associated with his cross-examination by Mr. Fromm.\n[20] The evidence heard in relation to this motion shows that Mr. Martinez has already made his views publicly known about certain groups and issues and has already created animosity and resentment towards his person. Putting a ban on the publication of the content of his cross-examination will not change this state of fact.\n[21] It must be reiterated here that Human Rights proceeding are public and it is only in exceptional circumstances that the Tribunal should hold in camera sessions or put in place publication bans.\n[22] All things considered, on the basis of the evidence adduced, the Tribunal finds that the Commission and Mr. Martinez have failed to show that Mr. Martinez's security would be jeopardized if a publication ban was not put in place with respect to Mr. Martinez's testimony related to Mr. Fromm's cross-examination.\n[23] It must be noted here that Mr. Martinez examination in chief took place during a public hearing and no request was made at the time that it be held in camera or that a publication ban be ordered.\n[24] This said, if in the course of Mr. Martinez's cross examination security concerns do arise, the Tribunal will deal with these concerns as they arise and, if need be, will make specific orders so as to ensure the protection of sensitive personal information from being disseminated if the Tribunal is of the view that the dissemination of the information could give rise to a serious possibility that the security of Mr. Martinez would be endangered.\n[25] For the above mentioned reasons, the request to have a publication ban with respect to Mr. Martinez's testimony in the course of his cross-examination by Mr. Fromm is denied.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario April 12, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1120\/0206\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCenter for Research-Action on Race Relations v. www.bcwhitepride.com\nDATE AND PLACE OF HEARING:\nApril 12, 2007\nAPPEARANCES:\nFo Niemi\nFor the Complainant\nGiacomo Vigna\nFor the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nPaul Fromm\nFor the Respondent\n",

Hadjis\n[1] The Attorney General of Canada (Attorney General), acting on behalf of the Correctional Service of Canada and the Treasury Board of Canada, has made a motion for an order amending the style of cause in the present case and requiring the parties to compile a list of the individuals who may benefit from any eventual award made by the Tribunal.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) filed written submissions in response to the motion. No submissions were filed by the complainant.\nAn order substituting the Attorney General of Canada as the respondent in this matter [3] The Attorney General points out that this case involves allegations of discrimination against an employer. In the context of the federal public service, the employer is the Crown in Right of Canada. However, by virtue of the royal prerogative, legal proceedings cannot be taken against the Crown. Furthermore, departments are not legal entities. Thus, neither the Treasury Board of Canada nor the Correctional Service of Canada is a proper respondent. The Attorney General, therefore, submits that the style of cause be amended to substitute the Attorney General as the Respondent to the complaint, as mandated by s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50. The Commission consents to this request.\n[4] The Tribunal has in fact issued a comparable order in Plante v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2003 CHRT 28, and I have personally presided in cases where similar amendments were ordered during the case management process (Morin v. Attorney General of Canada, Tribunal docket No. T739\/4402) and during the hearing (Maillet v. Attorney General of Canada, Tribunal docket No. T935\/5504).\n[5] I therefore grant the Attorney General's request in this regard. In the future, I look forward to such matters being addressed by parties before complaints are referred to the Tribunal.\nAn order that the parties compile a list of the individuals who may benefit from any eventual award made by the Tribunal in this case [6] It is alleged in the present complaint that the persons occupying the Assistant Team Leader positions within the Correctional Service of Canada are subject to discriminatory treatment resulting in unequal pay for work of equal value. The Attorney General submits that it would be helpful to all parties as well as the Tribunal to know from the outset who stands to benefit from any eventual award to be made by the Tribunal in this case. For instance, the Attorney General states that with this information, it will be better able to understand the potential liability it faces and marshal the evidence it wishes to call. The Attorney General also points out that if the Tribunal knows which individuals occupied the positions and for what period of time, the calculation of the potential award will be simplified.\n[7] The Attorney General therefore proposes that the parties compile, on a continuous basis, a list of those Assistant Team Leaders who may benefit from any eventual award made by the Tribunal. The list would include the names of those individuals who have held the position of Assistant Team Leader since 1995 and would identify the duration of their employment in this position.\n[8] The Commission, for its part, claims that during a previous case management conference call, all parties had agreed to prepare just such a list. Nevertheless, the Commission consents to the issuance of the order being sought by the Respondent.\n[9] I find the request reasonable, and an order to that effect is provided at the end of this ruling.\nAn order substituting the existing designation of the Complainant with the names of individuals who have been employed as Assistant Team Leaders [10] The complaint form was signed on September 30, 2003, by an individual named John Wiseman. At the top of the form, under the heading Your Name, the following information was entered:\nJohn Wiseman Regional Vice President Canadian Association of Correctional Supervisors on behalf of the Assistant Team Leader positions in women's penitentiaries\n[11] After the complaint was filed, the Commission assigned an investigator to investigate into the complaint. In the investigation report of May 1, 2006, the name of the complainant is indicated as being the Canadian Association of Correctional Supervisors (CACS). On August 22, 2006, the Commission sent a letter to the Tribunal Chairperson notifying him that the Commission had reviewed the complaint of the Canadian Association of Correctional Supervisors and had decided to request that a Tribunal inquiry be instituted into the complaint.\n[12] The Attorney General points out that the CACS is a voluntary association. Since Assistant Team Leaders are excluded from collective bargaining, the CACS is not a bargaining agent representing them. The Attorney General adds that the CACS is not incorporated and as such is neither a legal or natural person. The Attorney General contends, therefore, that the CACS does not have the juridical capacity to act as a party to these proceedings.\n[13] According to s. 40(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file a complaint with the Commission. The Attorney General submits that the ordinary meaning of the words individual or group of individuals demonstrates that Parliament expected that only individuals be allowed to file complaints, whether acting alone or organized around a common purpose. The juridical capacity to act as a party to a proceeding is only bestowed upon persons, whether natural or creations of law. The Attorney General argues that since the plain meaning of s. 40(1) confirms that Parliament intended to allow only natural persons to act as complainants, a voluntary association such as the CACS cannot act as a complainant.\n[14] The Commission takes a different view. It contends that the CACS constitutes a group of individuals within the meaning of s. 40(1). Even if, as the Attorney General contends, the provision can also be interpreted more narrowly to mean that only one individual or groups made up of identified individuals are capable of filing human rights complaints, this interpretation would be in clear contradiction of the well-established principle that human rights legislation must be interpreted in a manner that most advances the protection and promotion of human rights.\n[15] Unfortunately, this entire debate seems to have ignored and left behind what is really at the core of the case: the human rights complaint that was filed on September 30, 2003. In my opinion, a plain reading of the complaint shows that it was not the CACS who filed the complaint but rather Mr. Wiseman. The name of the complainant given at the top of the form is clearly John Wiseman. He may happen to be the Regional Vice-President of the CACS, but the name given as the complainant is his.\n[16] Mr. Wiseman's status as the complainant is evident elsewhere on the complaint form. He signed the form at the bottom with his personal signature alone. There is no indication that he is signing on behalf of a group or organization. Furthermore, his first statement at the top of the form, just below his name, is the following: I have reasonable grounds for believing that I have been discriminated against in employment (my emphasis). There is nothing in this statement to suggest that he is filing the complaint form as a representative of the CACS or any other group.\n[17] In addition, after Mr. Wiseman filed the complaint, the Commission requested and obtained, pursuant to s. 40(2) of the Act, written confirmation from a number of individuals employed as Assistant Team Leaders (i.e. alleged victims of the discrimination), that they consented to the filing of the complaint. Copies of 25 signed consent forms were attached to the Commission's submissions on the motion. The first line on 18 of those forms states, I consent to John Wiseman or his designated alternate acting as my representative in the present human rights complaint. On the remaining seven forms, the words of CACS are inserted after the words designated alternate. Clearly, all of these individuals have named Mr. Wiseman as their representative. They have also authorized him to designate an alternate. However, from the material before me, there is no indication of his ever having amended his complaint so as to designate the CACS or anyone else, as the complainant or as Mr. Wiseman's alternate prior to the Commission's referral of the complaint to the Tribunal. No request for amendment has been brought before the Tribunal since the complaint's referral either. I can only assume that I am dealing with the same complaint that Mr. Wiseman originally filed with the Commission, and consequently, with the same complainant, Mr. Wiseman.\n[18] For all of these reasons, it seems to me that the style of cause in this case has been set out inaccurately from the moment that the complaint was referred to the Tribunal. Rather than the CACS appearing as the complainant, Mr. Wiseman's name should rightly appear.\n[19] I note that that even if it turns out that Mr. Wiseman is not himself a victim of the alleged discriminatory practice (e.g. if he was never employed as an Assistant Team Leader), he is still entitled under the Act to file a complaint as an individual if he has reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in a discriminatory practice. (ss. 40(1) and 40(2)).\n[20] I therefore deny the Attorney General's request for an order substituting the name of the complainant with the names of the individuals who signed the above-noted consent forms. However, given the actual wording on the complaint form, I instruct the Tribunal Registry to amend the style of cause in these proceedings to indicate that John Wiseman is the complainant in this case.\nOrder [21] I order the following:\nThat the style of cause be amended to show the Attorney General of Canada as the Respondent; That the parties compile, on a continuous basis, a list of those Assistant Team Leaders who may benefit from any eventual award made by the Tribunal. The list will include those individuals holding the position of Assistant Team Leader beginning in 1995 and will identify the duration of their employment as an Assistant Team Leader; and, That the style of cause be amended to show John Wiseman as the Complainant.\n[22] I further direct that these amendments to the style of cause take effect from this decision onwards.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent has requested that the hearing into the present complaint be bifurcated. In the first phase of the hearing, the Tribunal would hear evidence regarding the Complainant's allegations of discrimination. If the Tribunal finds that the complaint is substantiated, a second hearing would be conducted regarding the remedial measures being sought by the Complainant.\n[2] The Respondent suggests that the evidence to be led regarding remedial issues would be considerable and time-consuming. This argues for the proposition of holding two separate hearings, given that if the Complainant is unsuccessful in the first phase, evidence on remedy will be unnecessary.\n[3] I note, however, that the anticipated testimonies of most of the Respondent's scheduled witnesses, as set out in the witness summaries, deal at least in part with issues relating to the Complainant's allegations of discrimination. From the Statements of Particulars of both parties, it is apparent that questions regarding the Complainant's career progression do not just relate to remedy; they also relate to his claims of discrimination.\n[4] Furthermore, one must always keep in mind the provision, in s. 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, that the Tribunal conduct proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. The present complaint relates to incidents dating back to 2000. The complaint was filed in 2002, and the Complainant's subsequent dismissal took place almost four years ago, in June 2003. Given the time that has elapsed since these events, any further delay to the final resolution of all the issues arising in this case is unwarranted and would not be in keeping with the objectives of the Act.\n[5] I therefore direct that this case not be bifurcated.

Introduction [1] On January 25, 2005, Michel Knight (the complainant) filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de l\u2019Outaouais (the respondent). The complainant alleged that the respondent discriminated against him because of a disability in relation to employment, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\n[2] The respondent is a public transit authority serving the communities of Gatineau and surrounding areas, in the province of Quebec. From a constitutional point of view, it is under federal jurisdiction because of its inter-provincial transit activities. In fact, its buses transport passengers from the Quebec side of the Ottawa River to Ottawa, Ontario, on a daily basis. The respondent employs about 750 employees, 108 of whom are maintenance employees.\nA. The Factual Background Of Mr. Knight\u2019s Complaint [3] The complainant is currently self-employed as a groundskeeper and landscaper. On May 5, 1998, when he was working as a meat cutter, at Market Fresh in Gatineau, he was involved in a work-related accident. Specifically, his right hand was injured when he accidentally put his hand in a meat grinder. According to the medical assessment report, he sustained a very serious injury to the soft tissue and bones of the right index finger, requiring amputation. He also sustained multiple lacerations and damage to the sensory nerve fiber of his right middle finger.\n[4] Following his accident, he was treated by Dr. Christopher Carter, an orthopaedic surgeon, who proceeded to amputate the index finger of his right hand. Dr. Carter assessed the injury on August 4, 1998, and determined that the complainant had permanent functional limitations, including:\nUnable to grip the right hand as firmly as the left hand, Prehensile strength diminished by about 50%, Unable to perform activities requiring manual dexterity, Unable to grasp or handle small objects, Entire right hand intolerant to cold.\n[5] Following this accident, the complainant received income replacement indemnities from the Commission de la Sant\u00e9 et de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 au Travail (CSST), from the province of Quebec. He then received 90 percent of the net salary that he had earned as a meat cutter. He received these indemnities until about June 2001. The complainant\u2019s functional limitations also entitled him to a lump sum indemnity for anatomicophysiological deficits. This indemnity was $10,812.52. The letter from the CSST advising the complainant of this decision stated that Dr. Carter had calculated his permanent injury at 12.55%, to which the CSST had added 2.50% for pain and loss of enjoyment of life. The complainant never challenged this decision by the CSST.\n[6] The CSST also requested an orientation report from the complainant in order to identify his skills and aspirations through psychometric tests and interviews. Following this report, a career plan was established taking into account the complainant\u2019s functional limitations. Considering the permanent and definitive nature of the functional limitations identified, the complainant was entitled to a professional transition program financed by the CSST. The CSST records indicate that the complainant, after meeting with the guidance counsellor, decided to register for the following courses:\nElevator mechanic course (1st choice) Police technology (2nd choice) Mechanical engineering technology \u2013 tool-making (3rd choice)\n[7] According to the record, the complainant had been refused admission to the elevator mechanics course because it was full. He was however accepted into the police technology course. However, following a discussion between the CSST case officer and the supervisor of the police technology program, the supervisor, when informed of the complainant\u2019s functional limitations, confirmed that he could not work as a police officer. It was therefore decided that this profession was not consistent with the complainant\u2019s functional status.\n[8] Also according to the CSST\u2019s record, the case officer then called the supervisor of the mechanical engineering technology \u2013 tool-making program to discuss the complainant\u2019s functional status with him. The supervisor said that he did not see why the complainant would not be able to successfully complete this training. He added that the duties of a tool-making technician did not require manual dexterity or working in the cold. The CSST therefore determined that the most appropriate rehabilitation measure for the complainant was training in mechanical engineering \u2013 tool-making.\n[9] From September to December 1998, the complainant registered in an adult education centre in Gatineau in order to complete his secondary studies. On January 16, 1999, the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec issued his high school diploma. Then, for his professional transition program, the complainant registered in the fall of 1999 in a mechanical engineering technology\u2013 tool-making program, at the Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale, in Ottawa. On June 8, 2001, he received his diploma. The tuition fees for this course, amounting to $8,000, were paid by the CSST. The CSST also paid for certain fees relating to this training program, including one tank of gas per week as well as parking fees so that the complainant could travel to Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale.\n[10] After receiving his diploma in mechanical engineering technology, the complainant worked for a while at a business named Concert Airline, in Gatineau, as an operating engineer. In 2002, he decided to leave this job to take a course in heavy highway vehicle mechanics.\n[11] For this course, the complainant registered at the Centre professionnel de l\u2019Outaouais, in Gatineau. The evidence established that the complainant had begun this training well before he did the mechanical engineering technology program at Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale. In fact, in the CSST record, the complainant\u2019s case officer wrote a note on July 28, 1999, stating:\n[Translation]\nAt his own initiative, the worker registered in and began training in Heavy highway vehicle mechanics. During one meeting with the worker, I compared the duties of a heavy machinery mechanic with the functional limitations of the worker, the physical environment, the skills and physical abilities. In light of the description of the system benchmark tasks, they do not meet the worker\u2019s functional limitations. This work requires working in the cold, an ability to move fingers quickly and precisely and being able to make distinctions by touch.\n[12] On June 17, 2004, the Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec gave the complainant a secondary school vocational diploma in heavy highway vehicle mechanics.\n[13] The complainant was supposed to complete two on-the-job training sessions in heavy highway vehicle mechanics. Both sessions were done with the respondent. The first session was completed between May 23 and June 6, 2003. The complainant successfully completed this training. On the [Translation] Trainee Evaluation Form, the training supervisor, Mario Tanguay, the respondent\u2019s employee, wrote: [Translation] Very good sense of mechanics, good initiative, very good productivity. During this training, the complainant stated that he had worked in the garage under the supervision of a mechanic. He said that over this two-week period he covered everything involving mechanics. He added that not having his index finger did not cause him any problems.\n[14] Following this training, he applied for a summer job with the respondent. He was hired for the operating station and he worked for the respondent from June 20 to August 25, 2003, i.e. for the duration of the summer contract. During this summer employment, he performed many tasks, including interior and exterior painting, groundskeeping and landscaping. He also mowed the lawn and jet-washed the workstations.\n[15] The second training session took place from April 5 to April 23, 2004. Once again, the complainant successfully completed his training. The comments by the training supervisor about him were again positive. Mr. Tanguay noted in particular that the complainant was [Translation] a very good team player, mastered the training well, reliably performing the work and that he was an excellent trainee.\n[16] Following this second training session, the complainant expressed interest in working for the respondent. He then applied for the position of service attendant. The complainant was responding to a competition for recruiting temporary on-call service attendants, which meant that the persons hired did not have a position and had no guaranteed work hours. It appears that obtaining an attendant\u2019s position was the first step to obtaining a position as a mechanic.\n[17] Work is assigned to on-call service attendants as required. As a general rule, the foreperson assesses the work for the following week and assigns the work to the permanent employees on a seniority basis. Shifts are assigned to the permanent employees for a four- to five-month period. After the work has been assigned to the permanent employees, there is another work assignment for the floating permanent employees, i.e. for permanent employees guaranteed 40 hours of work each week, but who do not have a particular shift. The remaining shifts that are unfilled are then assigned to the on-call attendants. Given that the permanent employees prefer working the day and evening shifts, the on-call employees are generally assigned to the night shifts.\n[18] According to the work description for the position of service attendant, the attendant works under the supervision of the foreperson \u2013 service and rebuilding, ensuring that vehicles are serviced through the periodic maintenance of the buses. The attendant inspects buses before their departure, fuelling, topping up lubricants and checking the air in the tires. Further, he or she cleans all of the vehicles and carries out all related tasks requested by the immediate superior.\n[19] On May 25, 2004, the respondent contacted the complainant and proposed that he take a competency test for the position he had applied for. The complainant passed this test and was given an interview. In a document from the respondent entitled [Translation] The management committee summary . . . meeting of June 1, 2004, it is indicated that the complainant was hired as a part-time, on-call service attendant.\n[20] On May 26, 2004, like all of the other candidates hired, the respondent contacted the complainant and asked him to submit to a pre-hiring medical exam by the respondent\u2019s designated consulting physician, Dr. Pierre Matte. Before the medical exam, each candidate is asked to fill out the pre-employment medical exam form. The consulting physician then sees the candidate.\n[21] In the [Translation] pre-employment exam form filled out by the complainant on June 1, 2004, questions were asked about his personal history. To the question [Translation] Have you ever had a work-related accident or illness?, the complainant responded in the affirmative and referred to the accident involving the index finger of his right hand on May 5, 1998. However, he left the section on functional limitations blank. Similarly, for the question [Translation] Will you receive or have you received a lump sum payment following an illness or injury resulting in a permanent injury?, he checked off no. The complainant signed the form on June 1, 2004.\n[22] On that same day, the respondent\u2019s consulting physician examined the complainant. Dr. Matte then observed that the complainant had been the victim of a work-related accident and had consequently had the index finger of his right hand amputated. He then informed the complainant that his hiring would be delayed because he had to review his CSST record before he could decide his case. With the complainant\u2019s permission, the respondent then asked the CSST to forward the complainant\u2019s record to Dr. Matte.\n[23] On July 5, 2004, after receiving the CSST record, the respondent\u2019s Chief of human resources management, Lucie Plouffe, sent a letter to Dr. Matte in which she asked him to determine the complainant\u2019s physical ability to perform the work of a service attendant. She also joined to the letter a work description of the position of service attendant and, as additional information, she listed the [Translation] type of load that the worker could be called to lift when performing his job:\nOpening the motor door, 90 times\/day (75 pounds) (On cross-examination, Mr. Langlois, head of vehicle maintenance, explained that the 75 pounds referred to the total weight of the door, not the force required to open this door.) Emptying fare box, turning mechanism 35 times\/day Fuelling 90 buses\/day (squeezing lever) Washing exterior of bus with six-foot brush Moving 205 litre (45 gallons) oil barrels when necessary \u2013 (On cross-examination, Mr. Langlois explained that there are forklifts for moving these barrels) Working outside to remove snow (occasionally) Jet washing interiors (3000 pounds of pressure) \u2013 (On cross-examination, Mr. Langlois pointed out that the pressure is created by the motor used and not by the activation of the sprayer) Washing under chassis with jet sprayer Cleaning parts, must pick up parts weighing between 5 and 75 pounds The door going outside opens and closes regularly during the day.\n[24] Mr. Langlois prepared this description at the request of Lucie Plouffe and Jacynthe Poulin, the respondent\u2019s health and safety advisor. Mr. Langlois explained that they had asked him to prepare a list of tasks for an employee with a functional limitation in his hand.\n[25] In light of the mandate conferred to him, as well as the complainant\u2019s work-related accident record and permanent functional limitations, Dr. Matte determined that the complainant did not meet the requirements of the service attendant position on July 14, 2004. During his testimony, Dr. Matte acknowledged, inter alia, that the functional limitation indicating that the [Translation] complainant\u2019s prehensile force was diminished by almost 50% is a relatively vague description. He stated that without verifying it, he relied on the average prehensile force, which in his opinion is about 50 kilograms. Accordingly, he determined that the complainant\u2019s prehensile force in his right hand was between 25 to 30 kilograms. However, when questioned by the complainant, he admitted that a woman, having approximately that much prehensile force, could in fact perform the duties of service attendant. He was quick to point out that he is not considering one particular task, but all of the tasks as a whole.\n[26] He also adds that the service attendant position requires working in the cold given that the employees are required to wash the buses. Further, the motor door is opened regularly \u2013 according to Dr. Matte, it is opened 90 times a day [Translation] because there are about 90 buses that leave \u2013 so that buses can get in so that they can be washed. In the winter, the cold comes in when the door is open, the water for washing the buses is cold and the buses are covered with ice and frost. He therefore determined that the complainant could not perform these tasks because of the functional limitation indicating that his entire right hand is intolerant to the cold.\n[27] Dr. Matte also adds that washing buses requires that the employee handle a water jet with 3,000 pounds of pressure. He pointed out that this work easily requires constant prehensile force of 20 to 25 kilograms. He also stated that the incumbents for this position are asked to move [Translation] large 45-gallon barrels, requiring [Translation] a good grip. During a good part of his testimony in chief, Dr. Matte continued to describe the work to be performed by the employees, determining that the complainant could not perform these tasks because of his functional limitations.\n[28] On cross-examination, he stated that he did not have to verify the complainant\u2019s limitations since the injury had been assessed and that permanent limitations had been found. He added: [Translation] For me, permanent means permanent. That means that in 20 years, it will still be permanent. When cross-examined by the complainant, Dr. Matte stated that his responsibility and his obligations in a CSST file are to respect the limits determined by the attending physician, in this case those established by Dr. Carter.\n[29] Having considered all of the work that an employee must perform as well as the complainant\u2019s permanent limitations, Dr. Matte determined that the complainant could not do the work of an attendant.\n[30] Before taking a final position on the complainant\u2019s case, the respondent gathered its accommodation committee, made up of Lucie Plouffe and Jacynthe Poulin, human resource representatives, and two managerial employees from the maintenance division, i.e. Claude Renaud, the manager, and Sylvain Martel, the chief engineer of the maintenance division. The committee met in order to determine whether it was possible for the respondent to accommodate the complainant. After reviewing the matter, the accommodation committee determined that it was not possible without undue hardship to accommodate the complainant in order to enable him to assume the position of attendant while respecting his functional limitations.\n[31] Specifically, according to the minutes of the accommodation committee\u2019s meeting that was held on July 20, 2004, the committee summarily considered the positions of service attendant \u2013 interior washing and janitor to see whether it would be possible to accommodate the complainant in these positions. The committee determined that the complainant\u2019s functional limitations were inconsistent with these positions. The committee also considered the possibility of setting aside the duty of fuel attendant in the position of service attendant, for the complainant [Translation] since this could meet his limitations. However, the document continues, indicating that [Translation] as it is not conceivable to eliminate the possibility of working at night and the aspect of rotating duties (less popular work shift, usually worked by those with less seniority), this option was eliminated. Further, the committee determined that it did not [Translation] see how it could earmark this duty for the complainant without affecting the morale of the teams, or perhaps their stability. The committee also determined that no other position was available for which the complainant would be qualified. It also stated that it had not examined the possibility of creating a new position, because it would be subject to the posting rules of the collective agreement, and also create financial hardship. Finally, a part-time position was not considered because the duties would be similar to the ones already assessed.\n[32] During her examination, Ms. Plouffe added that the respondent could perhaps have offered a bus driver position to the complainant. She added that she immediately ruled out this position without performing a thorough analysis because she had already had an ergonomic report done for a driver who had injured his thumb and the report pointed out [Translation] significant difficulties in terms of driving the vehicle. However, on cross-examination, she acknowledged that the career development report prepared by the CSST proposed bus driving as a possible job for the complainant.\n[33] Ms. Plouffe also testified that the accommodation committee had discussed the possibility of eliminating the night work in the complainant\u2019s case in the event that he was hired, so that he would not have to perform all of the duties of a service attendant. According to the committee, the rules of the collective agreement would not allow them to place the complainant ahead of the other workers. Further, she added that temporary employees like the complainant are hired as replacements, especially at night.\n[34] The accommodation committee therefore determined that no accommodation could be made for the complainant\u2019s functional limitations.\n[35] On July 27, 2004, the respondent advised the complainant, by letter, that he could not be considered for the position. Lucie Plouffe and Jacynthe Poulin then met with the complainant to give him the letter and to explain the respondent\u2019s decision. They then explained that the respondent was bound by the functional limitations indicated in the CSST record and that they could not consider him for the attendant position.\n[36] Following the respondent\u2019s decision, the complainant again contacted Dr. Carter who had prepared the 1998 report. On October 6, 2004, Dr. Carter had the complainant submit to another medical exam. According to the new report prepared by Dr. Carter, the purpose of this assessment was to determine whether the state of the complainant\u2019s hand had improved since the first assessment in 1998, which indicated permanent functional limitations. On October 10, 2004, the complainant sent the respondent Dr. Carter\u2019s new report indicating that the complainant no longer had any functional limitations. According to Dr. Carter, the complainant no longer had difficulty grasping small objects and the sensation at the tip of his middle finger had returned to normal. He added that the complainant used his right middle finger as though he were using the index finger that was amputated. Dr. Carter pointed out that the prehensile force was now [Translation] more or less normal and that the complainant was no longer intolerant to the cold.\n[37] After receiving the second medical report, the respondent took steps with the CSST in order to see whether it would agree to lift the functional limitations established by Dr. Carter in 1998. The CSST refused to change its 1998 decision and to lift the functional limitations. The respondent therefore considered that it was still bound by the CSST\u2019s 1998 decision. By letter dated December 2, 2004, the respondent informed the complainant that it was not changing its decision not to hire him. In this letter, it stated that [Translation] like any other employer, it has the obligation to take all the measures necessary to ensure the health, safety and integrity of its workers. Pursuant to An Act respecting Industrial accidents and occupational diseases which is a statute of public order, as it was established that you have permanent functional limitations, the STO feels that it is bound by this decision. Moreover, as our company\u2019s physician confirmed that your limitations are inconsistent with the duties of a service attendant, we cannot consider your application.\n[38] In a note filed on December 1, 2004, one Louise Audet, a CSST agent, after discussions with Jacynthe Poulin, wrote: [Translation] We confirm to Ms. Poulin that there was no legal change to the record. The CSST cannot make another determination on the ability to work unless there has been an RRA. The new MER prepared by Dr. Carter at the worker\u2019s request does not give rise to an RRA. Moreover, the STO, while not bound by the legal decisions in this matter, is justified in wanting to verify the worker\u2019s actual capacity to perform this work. If the STO considers that Dr. Carter\u2019s report is not sufficiently conclusive in this regard, the STO can require that the worker provide an assessment of his functional capacity or have him submit to a pre-employment test. We ask the STO to deal with this worker as it would with a worker who had been involved in the same accident outside the workplace. It is the worker\u2019s responsibility to respect his functional limitations while the employer must ensure that the worker is fully able to perform the task. [Emphasis added.]\n[39] Following the respondent\u2019s decision, the complainant said that he retained the services of counsel to take steps with the CSST. In a letter dated December 14, 2004, which he sent to the CSST, R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer, the complainant\u2019s counsel, asked the CSST not to change the 1998 medical report, but rather to include Dr. Carter\u2019s medical report, prepared in 2004, in the complainant\u2019s medical record. On January 10, 2005, the CSST informed the complainant that the medical report had in fact been filed into his record.\n[40] At the hearing, the respondent also filed into evidence the job descriptions of many duties in the maintenance division. Therefore, the office janitor (interior and exterior) is responsible for tidying, maintaining and cleaning the maintenance division\u2019s offices. The service attendant ensures that vehicles are serviced, through the regular maintenance of the buses. The attendant carries out an inspection before departure, fuels, tops up lubricants and checks the air in the tires. The attendant cleans all of the vehicles and performs all related tasks. The labourer (parts cleaning) cleans all of the mechanic parts and cleans the garage. Finally, the labourer (interior and exterior)-garage ensures the overall tidiness of the buildings, the windows and the floors, taking care of internal and external movement of materials as required.\n[41] In the minutes of the respondent\u2019s accommodation committee meeting referred to earlier, the position of service attendant is described as being divided into three [Translation] large groups of duties:\nParking buses in assigned places and emptying the fare box. (Which Mr. Langlois described as the [Translation] parking attendant. Inspection and adjustment of oil levels and inspection of right tires. Fuel attendant, inspection of left tires and electronic data entry (Which Mr. Langlois described as the [Translation] bus refueler.).\nAccording to the minutes, duty 1 involves emptying the fare box and therefore handling the mechanism which requires applying a great deal of uniform pressure with both hands. Duty 2 requires lifting the motor door weighing 75 pounds, 90 times a day. The tire inspection requires that the tire be struck hard with a 5-pound hammer.\n[42] The night shift employees perform the three duties on a rotational basis. The day shift employees, for their part, informally divide up the three duties and the maintenance division tolerates it since it suits the employees and since it does not want to create animosity within the group. The two night shift employees carry out each of the three duties.\n[43] In the wintertime, the service attendants also have the duty to clean the garage doors at the entrances. Mr. Langlois stated that once the buses are on the road, the employees must ensure that the level of antifreeze and oil is adequate. They then have to move what he described as 45-gallon barrels, adding however that they have forklifts to assist them with this task.\n[44] In the daytime, there are three service attendants who work: three parking attendants, one bus refueler and someone to check the oil. For the evening shift, there are also five service attendants: two work from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and the three others from 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. As a general rule, the workers on the evening shift perform the same tasks as those who work in the morning. However, those who work on the night shift carry out all of the tasks. For the day shift, these duties are divided between three workers.\n[45] According to Mr. Langlois\u2019 testimony, the service attendants who work in the daytime have to take care of about 90 buses, while those working the night shift could have between 25 to 45 buses.\n[46] The witness then explained the work of the labourer (interior and exterior)-garage. This employee ensures that the premises are tidy. In the wintertime, the labourer is responsible for ensuring that the exits are well cleaned. This employee must also satisfy the needs of the maintenance service; he or she would be responsible for moving the 45 gallon barrels with the forklift. This employee works on the day shift.\n[47] The labourer\u2013parts cleaner works at what Mr. Langlois described as reconditioning parts. This labourer must clean the parts before they are given to the mechanics for reconditioning and must lift and place the mechanical parts in a large washer. He pointed out that there is a hoist for lifting the largest parts but that parts weighing between 30 and 75 pounds must be handled manually by the employee.\n[48] The collective agreement provides that the respondent is reserved the right to hire nine (9) temporary employees and that these temporary employees will only perform the functions of service attendant, labourer and janitor. Temporary employees do not have guaranteed hours.\n[49] During her testimony, Lucie Plouffe described how a temporary employee could change status with the respondent. First, the temporary employee must accumulate work hours. After accumulating 1,040 work hours, the employee is placed on a priority hiring list for the position of service attendant. Once a permanent position becomes available, following a departure or the creation of a new position, the employee who is at the top of the list then obtains the regular position as a service attendant. Once the employee has a regular position, the employee is guaranteed 40 hours of work per week.\n[50] Ms. Plouffe also stated that temporary employees are given a performance evaluation and that if the evaluation is unsatisfactory, the employer can terminate the employment. Further, according to the collective agreement, the temporary employee who is selected to become a regular employee is subject to a predetermined probationary period. According to the terms of the collective agreement, if the employee accumulated 5,200 working hours or if the employee accumulated 2,080 working hours over a 15-month period, he or she would not be subject to a probationary term. Employees who have accumulated 2,080 working hours over an 18-month period are subject to a three-month probationary period, while the other employees are subject to a six-month probationary period.\nB. Issues [51] The issues are as follows:\nAre the respondent and the complainant bound by the decision of the Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail of the province of Qu\u00e9bec establishing permanent functional limitations? Did the respondent discriminate on the basis of a disability when it refused to hire the complainant because of his disability? In the event that question (b) is answered in the affirmative, did the respondent establish that it is impossible to accommodate Mr. Knight without causing it undue hardship? In the event the complaint is allowed, what compensation should be awarded to the complainant?\nC. The Decision of the Commission De La Sant\u00e9 Et De La S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Du Travail [52] On May 5, 1998, while he was working as a butcher, the complainant was involved in a work-related accident, which resulted in the amputation of the index finger of his right hand. Following the recommendations issued on August 4, 1998, by the complainant\u2019s attending physician, the Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail (the CSST) of the province of Quebec set out the functional limitations which we referred to earlier in this decision.\n[53] On October 10, 2004, the complainant obtained a new report from his attending physician establishing that he no longer had any functional limitations. The respondent submitted this new report to the CSST. The CSST nevertheless confirmed that the permanent functional limitations were maintained and did not revise its 1998 decision.\n[54] At the hearing, the complainant asked the Tribunal to lift the functional limitations established by the CSST or, at the very least, to determine that the complainant no longer had any functional limitations, based on the new report of the attending physician and on an occupational therapy assessment report.\n[55] The Tribunal does not think it necessary to address this issue for the purposes of this matter. Indeed, on reviewing the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is not clear that the Tribunal would have this power. The purpose of the Act is not to determine whether or not a provincial occupational health and safety board was correct to maintain the functional limitations that it assessed. Its purpose is to give effect to individuals\u2019 rights to equality for chances to grow independent of considerations based on their disability.\n[56] The issue of whether the functional limitations assessed in 1998 by the CSST on the recommendation of the complainant\u2019s attending physician should be lifted may be resolved with the procedure provided under the An Act respecting Industrial accidents and occupational diseases (R.S.Q. chapter A-3.001). In order to achieve the objective of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) and to determine whether the complaint is founded, the Tribunal need not decide this first issue because, as the respondent admitted, a person afflicted with functional limitations is a person afflicted with a disability within the meaning of the CHRA and the issue is therefore whether the respondent satisfied its duty to accommodate this person, as provided under the CHRA.\n[57] Moreover, on this point I agree with the remarks of arbitrator Dissanayake, in the arbitration award Re Air Canada and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (1998), 74 L.A.C. (4th) 233, where he stated:\nThe WCB drew to the employer\u2019s attention its obligation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, to attempt to provide the grievor with suitable work. It also had an obligation to accommodate the grievor under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, and the collective agreement. . . .[The employer] went on the basis that as long as it followed the advice of the WCB and complied with that legislation, it would be acting legitimately. That, I find to be a serious error, although I have no doubt whatsoever that management was acting in good faith. The problem is that the WCB has no responsibility for compliance with the Human Rights Act. On the other hand, the employer does have an ongoing responsibility under the Act and the agreement to accommodate the grievor\u2019s disability to the point of undue hardship, which is a duty independent of any obligations under workers\u2019 compensation legislation. [Emphasis added.]\nD. Did The Respondent Discriminate on the Basis of a Disability in Refusing to Hire the Complainant Because of His Disability? [58] These are the relevant provisions of the Act:\n3(1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n\u2026\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n\u2026\n15(1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirements\n\u2026\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirements and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(\u2026)\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu\n(\u2026)\n15(1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es\n(\u2026)\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbt, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[59] Therefore, according to the Act, it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ an individual on the basis of their disability. A disability is defined under section 25 of the Act as a physical or mental disability, past or present.\n[60] The employer\u2019s conduct will not be considered discriminatory where it can be established that the refusal of employment was based on bona fide occupational requirements (BFOR) (subsection 15(1) of the Act). For a practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodating the needs of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the employer considering health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act).\n[61] In British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin) the Supreme Court of Canada stated the method to be followed to establish whether a BFOR exists.\n[62] First, the complaining party has the burden of establishing prima facie evidence of discrimination (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, paragraph 28 (O\u2019Malley)). In this context, the prima facie evidence is the evidence bearing on the allegations that were made and which, if they are to be believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a finding in favour of the complainant, absent a reply by the respondent. Once the existence of the discrimination has been established prima facie, the respondent can justify the impugned standard by establishing the following, on a balance of probabilities:\nThe respondent adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job at issue; The respondent adopted that particular standard with the sincere belief that it was necessary in order to fulfill that legitimate work-related purpose; The standard is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill that legitimate work-related purpose. In order to establish that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must show that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant without the respondent suffering undue hardship. The respondent must establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. (See: British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868, at paragraph 20 (Grismer)).\n(i)Prima facie evidence [63] In this matter, given the respondent\u2019s admission, the issue of whether the complainant suffers from a disability within the meaning of the Act has been determined. Moreover, even if the respondent had not admitted it, I would have nevertheless determined that the complainant\u2019s physical handicap \u2013 namely the absence of an index finger on the right hand and the resulting functional limitations \u2013 amounted to a disability within the meaning of the Act. The issue is therefore whether the respondent can justifiably refuse to employ the complainant on the basis of his disability.\n(ii) The Application of the Meiorin test and section 15 of the CHRA (a) The first two elements of Meiorin [64] The respondent submits that the standard adopted and the ensuing conduct was justified. It contends that considering the functional limitations imposed on the complainant, it was unable to provide him individual accommodation without undue hardship.\n[65] In submitting evidence and in their final arguments, the parties did not see fit to address the first two requirements of Meiorin. On this basis we can infer that they acknowledge that the standard adopted by the respondent \u2013 namely to ensure that the work of the service attendants can be carried out safely and without risk \u2013 had a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job at issue. In my opinion, there is no reason to question this finding.\n[66] Further, I am persuaded that the respondent adopted this standard in good faith, believing that it was necessary to ensure the safe operation of its business. Therefore, the second Meiorin requirement was also met.\n(b) Did the respondent establish that it would be impossible to accommodate Mr. Knight without causing the respondent undue hardship? [67] To establish that a standard is reasonably necessary (the third step of Meiorin, which was codified in subsection 15(2) of the CHRA), an employer must establish that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant and other employees affected by the standard without imposing an undue hardship.\n[68] The Supreme Court in Meiorin, at paragraph 64, advises courts of law and administrative tribunals to consider various ways in which individual capabilities may be accommodated. The employer should determine whether there are different ways to perform the work while still accomplishing the employer\u2019s legitimate work-related purpose. The skills, capabilities and potential contributions of the individual complainant and others like him or her must be respected as much as possible.\n[69] In this case, the hiring standard emphasizes the need to ensure workplace safety. The fact that this standard excludes certain classes of persons is not discrimination if the respondent can establish that it is reasonably necessary to meet the appropriate objective and if the accommodation was incorporated in the standard. Exclusion is only justifiable where the employer or service provider has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship. (See British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868, at paragraph 21).\n[70] One form of accommodation could, for example, be to carry out an individual assessment of the complainant in order to determine whether he is able to work as a service attendant. There is nothing indicating that the respondent attempted to assess the complainant in such a way. Moreover, the testimony of Dr. Matte, the respondent\u2019s consulting physician, was very clear on this issue: he had not examined the complainant personally, nor had he been asked to do so. The evidence establishes that the respondent\u2019s decision was based solely on the findings made by Dr. Carter in 1998 regarding the complainant\u2019s functional limitations. The respondent and Dr. Matte appear to recognize, in good faith I agree, that the decision not to hire the complainant would be legitimate if the respondent adhered to the CSST\u2019s findings with regard to the functional limitations. One problem with this approach is that it fails to take into account the fact that the CSST is not in any way bound to comply with the Act. The respondent is not exempted from the obligations of the Act simply because there is the An Act respecting Industrial accidents and occupational diseases, R.S.Q. chapter A-3.001 (the AIAOD). Moreover, I must point out that with regard to the CSST, the respondent did not show why or how it was bound by the CSST\u2019s findings at the hiring stage, especially when these findings were based on medical information that was no longer current. The respondent had the burden of establishing how the failure to respect these findings would amount to undue hardship.\n[71] I am not persuaded, according to the evidence filed, that the respondent made any effort to assess the complainant individually in order to establish whether his condition would prevent him from carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a service attendant, or how the individual assessment of the complainant would cause it undue hardship. On this point, the respondent appears to have focussed all of its attention on the obligations imposed on it by the AIAOD, and failed to pay sufficient attention to the obligations under the Act.\n[72] The respondent claims that it was not necessary to assess the complainant\u2019s individual ability. It is convinced that the functional limitations issued by the CSST made him unable to safely perform the service attendant duties. I am not persuaded by this argument. Allowing an employer to rely on opinions regarding its employees\u2019 disabilities that it perceives to be obvious without carrying out an individual assessment of their abilities to safely carry out the work would have the effect of giving it too easy a justification for conduct which could otherwise be discriminatory. As the Supreme Court stated in Grismer, supra, at paragraph 19, accommodation must be incorporated into the standard itself to ensure that each person is assessed according to her or his own personal abilities, instead of being judged against presumed group characteristics which are frequently based on bias and historical prejudice. Accordingly, an employee\u2019s individual assessment is an essential step in the accommodation process unless it is in itself an undue hardship for the respondent (See Grismer, at paragraphs 22, 30, 32 and 38; Meiorin, at paragraph 65; and Audet v. National Railway, 2006 CHRT 25, at paragraph 61.)\n[73] However, even if I were to determine that the respondent did not have to carry out a personal assessment of the complainant because it would cause undue hardship, there would still be the issue of whether the respondent, after establishing that the complainant was unfit for the position of service attendant, investigated and reasonably dismissed all other possible alternatives that it could have offered him without causing it undue hardship (See Meiorin, supra, at paragraph 65). In my opinion, it failed to establish that it satisfied this requirement.\n[74] The respondent\u2019s evidence is that it assessed all of the alternatives of reasonable accommodation taking into account the complainant\u2019s disability and functional limitations. Before making a final decision regarding the complainant\u2019s case, it formed an accommodation committee made up of representatives from human resources and the maintenance division. This committee met to assess whether it was possible for the respondent to accommodate the complainant without suffering undue hardship.\n[75] According to the evidence, the accommodation committee determined, after reviewing Dr. Matte\u2019s analysis, that it was not possible to accommodate the complainant so as to enable him to work as an attendant while respecting his functional limitations. According to the analysis that the committee carried out, the different duties assigned to the service attendants did not respect the complainant\u2019s functional limitations.\n[76] The accommodation committee summarily examined the positions of service attendant \u2013 interior cleaning and janitor to see whether it would be possible to accommodate the complainant. It determined that the complainant\u2019s functional limitations were inconsistent with these positions. The committee said that it had also examined the possibility of setting aside the function of fuel attendant for the complainant, within the position of service attendant, [Translation] since this could fit his limitations. The committee determined [Translation] as there is no option of eliminating the night shift and the aspect of rotating duties (less popular shift usually worked by those with less seniority, this option was eliminated. The committee was also of the opinion that it could not [Translation] set aside this duty for the complainant without affecting the moral or even the stability of the teams.\n[77] The committee also determined that no other position was available for which the complainant could qualify. It did not examine the option of creating a new position because, according to the committee, it would have been subject to the rules of the collective agreement, and it would have created financial hardship for the respondent. Finally, a part-time job was not assessed since, according to the committee, the tasks would have been similar to those already assessed.\n[78] During her examination, Ms. Plouffe stated that there may perhaps have been a bus driver position that the respondent could have offered the complainant. She added that, without carrying out an exhaustive analysis of the complainant\u2019s ability to fill that position, she eliminated it [Translation] from the outset because she had already had an ergonomic report performed for another driver who had injured his thumb and the report pointed out [Translation] significant difficulties in terms of driving the vehicle. However, on cross-examination, she acknowledged that the career development report prepared by the CSST proposed bus driving as a possible job for the complainant.\n[79] Ms. Plouffe also testified that the accommodation committee had discussed the possibility of eliminating the night work in the complainant\u2019s case in the event that he was hired, so that he would not have to perform all of the duties of a service attendant. According to the committee, the rules of the collective agreement would not allow them to place the complainant ahead of the other workers. The committee therefore determined that there was no way to accommodate the complainant\u2019s functional limitations.\n[80] Let us first address the argument advanced by the accommodation committee to the effect that accommodating the complainant would undermine the teams\u2019 morale. First, I note that this submission is not supported by the evidence. Further, in Meiorin, supra, the Supreme Court stated the following in regard to a similar issue, at paragraph 80: Although serious consideration must of course be taken of the objection of employees based on well-grounded concerns that their rights will be affected, discrimination on the basis of a prohibited ground cannot be justified by arguing that abandoning such a practice would threaten the morale of the workforce.\n[81] To determine what constitutes undue hardship, the respondent relied on several arbitration awards including, inter alia, the one in Syndicat des technologues en radiologie du Qu\u00e9bec et Centre hospitalier des Vall\u00e9es de l\u2019Outaouais (Pavillon de Hull), T.A. 199-08-12, DTE 99T -1044 (Denis Nadeau), decided a few months before the Supreme Court decisions in Meiorin and Grismer. In this award, the arbitrator listed a certain number of rights that could be adversely affected by the implementation of an accommodation measure. He refers to, inter alia: burdening other employees called to assume part of the accommodated person\u2019s duties, exposing the health and safety of employees to a greater risk when they have to work with a colleague requiring a particular accommodation, agreeing to a less advantageous work schedule, waiving an expected promotion or deployment to another position. Without deciding whether these concerns are founded with regard to the duty to accommodate provided in the Act, I would point out again that there was no evidence establishing that this was the case here and that this would cause undue hardship to the respondent.\n[82] While under certain circumstances these considerations could perhaps justify the refusal to accommodate persons with disabilities, we must avoid not assigning enough importance to the accommodation of the handicapped person. It seems far too easy to raise these considerations to justify a refusal to give equal treatment to handicapped persons. I am not saying that these considerations can never be relevant in matters of accommodation; rather I am saying that the evidence, made up of impressions, is not enough.\n[83] According to the Meiorin requirements, the respondent had to establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. It had to demonstrate that it was impossible to incorporate individual aspects of accommodation without causing it undue hardship. In Grismer, at paragraph 43, the Supreme Court describes the respondent\u2019s burden in a case like this one as follows: Common sense and intuitive reasoning are not excluded, but in a case where accommodation is flatly refused there must be some evidence to link the outright refusal of even the possibility of accommodation with an undue safety risk.\n[84] I also understand that the complainant has the right to be accommodated as long as this does not cause undue hardship to the respondent. The use of the adjective undue indicates that some degree of hardship is acceptable, only the hardship that is undue can excuse the employer from its duty. The evidence did not persuade me that the accommodation of the complainant would require a substantial reorganization of all of the duties to the point where it would have caused undue hardship to the respondent. The respondent alleges, without persuasive evidence, that accommodation \u2013 without specifically defining this accommodation \u2013 would result in risks to the health, safety and security of the complainant and the company\u2019s other salaried employees. In its opinion, that amounts to undue hardship. However, nothing in the evidence submitted at the hearing supports these claims.\n[85] While accepting that the duty to accommodate does not go so far as to oblige the creation of a tailor-made position for the complainant, we must point out that that is not what the complainant is requesting. The complainant is asking for the opportunity to show that he can, with accommodation, perform the tasks of the position for which he applied.\n[86] The evidence filed by the respondent has not persuaded me that providing an accommodation for the complainant could cause it undue hardship. There were possible accommodation options but the employer dismissed them for reasons which, if indeed they could be described as hardships, are far from being undue hardships, at least based on the evidence submitted at the hearing.\n[87] I also note that in his arguments, the respondent\u2019s counsel notes at paragraph 66: [Translation] After receiving the second report of the complainant\u2019s attending physician, the STO even took steps with the CSST in order to see whether it would agree to change the functional limitations, but without avail. I can infer that had the CSST lifted those limitations, the respondent would have hired the complainant. Therefore, we can ask ourselves whether the respondent\u2019s apparent perceived hardship was based on its perception that its obligations under the An Act respecting Industrial accidents and occupational diseases prevented it from hiring the complainant. However, as we have determined that the obligations under that statute do not relieve the employer of the obligation to comply with the Act, it would be difficult to find undue hardship, especially since the respondent did not provide evidence of it.\nE. The Finding on Discrimination [88] For all of the reasons stated above, I find that the respondent did discriminate against the complainant based on his disability, breaching section 7 of the Act. The respondent did not establish that its decision not to hire the complainant for the position of service attendant was based on bona fide occupational requirements, pursuant to section 15 of the Act.\n[89] Mr. Knight\u2019s complaint is therefore founded.\nF. The Relief Sought By Mr. Knight [90] The complainant is seeking the following relief:\nAn order requiring the respondent to be integrated into the workplace in a permanent service attendant position; Compensation for loss of salary pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act; Compensation for pain and suffering in accordance with paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act; and The reimbursement of certain expenses.\n(i) Integration into the workplace [91] The complainant is seeking an order, under paragraph 53(2)(b) of the Act, providing that the respondent integrate him in a service attendant position as a regular employee. Paragraph 53(2)(b) states that the Tribunal, when it finds that a complaint is substantiated, may order that the respondent make available to the complainant, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied to him as a result of the practice.\n[92] The complainant submits that he is entitled to this relief since the evidence established that the employees hired after the respondent denied him the position are now regular employees. He is therefore asking that the Tribunal order the respondent to integrate him into a service attendant position as a permanent employee, retroactive to June 1, 2004. I note however that the evidence does not establish that all of the employees hired after June 1, 2004, have regular positions today. Some did not pass the probationary period and are no longer in the respondent\u2019s employ. The possibility that the complainant could have suffered the same fate cannot be excluded. With regard to the complainant\u2019s integration to a more senior position, it is an issue of sufficiency of evidence. The complainant has the burden of establishing that what he is seeking was reasonably foreseeable. He did not satisfy this burden in this case. I am not persuaded that the evidence filed indicates that there was a serious possibility that the complainant would have attained a permanent position at the time of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. (See Canada (A.G.) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569.)\n[93] Under the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot grant the complainant\u2019s request and order that the respondent integrate him in a regular service attendant position. The respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice did not deprive the respondent of such a position, but rather of the opportunity to be entitled to such a position on call and the opportunity after a probationary period to apply for a regular position, in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement.\n[94] In the arbitration award Air Canada and I.A.M. (Petelka) (Re), supra, Arbitrator Dissanayake was faced with a factual situation that resembled this case on several points. This is what he had to say about a request for a remedy similar to the one sought by the complainant :\nQuite apart from the qualifications and skill, before I order that the grievor be appointed to a particular position, I must be satisfied that he is medically fit to do the functions of the position. On the basis of the evidence before me I am not able to satisfy myself with any reasonable level of confidence whether or not the grievor can do so. It would be irresponsible for me to order that the grievor be appointed to a particular position in the absence of any evidence that the grievor is capable of performing without posing undue risk to himself or his fellow employees. Nor can I decide what accommodation, if any, he may require to be able to do either job. The WCB personnel who assessed the grievor did not testify before me, nor did the Air Canada physician. The only medical expert who testified was the grievor\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Bhatia. His evidence is not very helpful to me in that he testified without ever having turned his mind to the actual duties and responsibilities of a Station Attendant job at the Ottawa Airport. He had not even seen a position description. The employer had not gone through any exercise of identifying the essential duties of either job. It had not had the grievor assessed medically in relation to his ability to perform those duties. If the grievor had some duties outside his restrictions the employer had not considered how he may be accommodated. The grievor\u2019s own assessment of his ability is not dependable either.\n[95] In this case I am faced with a similar problem. Apart from the complainant\u2019s professional abilities, no convincing evidence was submitted regarding his physical ability to perform the duties required for the service attendant position without the need of accommodation. I cannot in good conscience issue an order requiring the respondent to give a regular position to the complainant without being persuaded that he can perform these duties. It is also impossible for me to determine on the basis of the evidence before me what accommodations would be appropriate for the complainant, if need be. The only medical evidence that I have about the complainant\u2019s abilities is from Dr. Carter, who did not assess his functional limitations while considering the duties of the desired position, and from Dr. Matte, who determined that the complainant could not perform these duties, although he had not assessed the complainant.\n[96] Accordingly, I order that the respondent integrate the complainant into an on-call service attendant position. Before the complainant begins working, however, the respondent could proceed with an independent expertise to assess his abilities to perform the duties required of a service attendant and to assess, if need be, the accommodations which could be required. In the event that this expert\u2019s report should establish that the complainant is able to perform these duties with or without accommodation, the complainant shall then be submitted to the probationary period provided under the collective agreement.\n[97] I also order that the respondent and the complainant cooperate in good faith in enforcing this order.\n(ii) Compensation for lost salary pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act [98] As a second remedy, the complainant is seeking compensation for loss of salary pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c). According to the assessment prepared by the complainant, he allegedly lost $75,352.84 in salary between June 2004 and December 2006 because of the respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice. He is therefore claiming this amount as compensation for loss of salary. Without accepting the figures presented by the complainant or his right to recover this or any other amount, the respondent recalculated while taking into account the collective agreement, and arrived at the amount of $73,019.40.\n[99] The respondent argued first, and correctly, that the complainant had the duty to mitigate its losses. This duty to mitigate, whether it results from the Quebec Civil Code or from the common law, has the same purpose in both cases, namely to alleviate the aggravation of damages by taking the measures that a reasonably prudent and diligent person would have taken under the same circumstances. The failure to mitigate damages could lead to a significant reduction of the compensation awarded and even to the dismissal of the complainant\u2019s claim. The issue is therefore whether the complainant established that he reasonably responded to this duty to mitigate his prejudice. (See Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan (C.A.), [1992] 2 F.C. 401, at paragraph 24.).\n[100] After July 27, 2004, the date the complainant learned that the respondent would not hire him for the attendant position, he stated that he was self-employed in his landscaping business. He said that he started this business during the summer of 2003. The business operated essentially, the first year, from April to August.\n[101] From September 2003 to June 2004, the complainant stated that he did not work because during this period he was training to become a heavy highway vehicle mechanic. As of June 2004, he said that he resumed his landscaping business. During 2004, he said that he continued his business beyond the summer until the wintertime, when he began to do snow removal with a snow blower.\n[102] The complainant stated that he began to actively seek employment in the winter of 2005 by sending his curriculum vitae almost everywhere. He added that he applied for work mostly in Quebec because he did not think his knowledge of English was good enough to apply for work in Ontario. He stated that he received very few acknowledgements of receipt and was never called for an interview.\n[103] The complainant filed his income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. In both of these returns, he stated that he was self-employed in the field of landscape design. For 2004, his total revenue was negative, i.e. a loss of $3,947.66. This amount included $5,464 in revenue from employment insurance benefits and from a job that he worked during the year and a loss of $9,511.66, for his work in his landscaping business. In the statement of business activities for that year, he reported $23,839.34 in revenue and expenses of $33,251.66. Inter alia, he reported $4,448.53 in advertising expenses, $11,215.97 in motor vehicle expenses and $14,537.19 in expenses for supplies.\n[104] In his 2005 income tax return, the complainant stated once again that he had a negative income of ($4,993.31). Specifically, his statement of business activities indicated sales of $22,177.34 and expenses of $27,170.65. The motor vehicle expenses for this year were $14,149.14 and those for supplies were $9,569.59.\n[105] He explained the expenses for supplies were for purchasing equipment for his business, namely a trailer, mowers, tractors, trimets and saws. He also added to his supplies expenses the cost of cedars that he had to plant during those years. In his expenses, he included a claim for the payments made on the mortgage interest of his home. On cross-examination, he stated that this expense was unrelated to his business and that he did not see relevance.\n[106] For 2004 and 2005, he declared that he had not had any job.\n[107] I must admit that I have a great deal of difficulty accepting the figures submitted by the complainant regarding his revenues for the years 2004 and 2005. Although I can admit that a business can operate at a loss, I have trouble accepting that the complainant could have worked for two consecutive years without making any income. Nobody would agree to operate a business under those circumstances.\n[108] For 2004, I note that the gross revenues of the complainant\u2019s business were $23,839.34, according to his tax return. If I accept that half of the expenses declared by the complainant in his return are reasonable, his net income for that year would then be about $12,000. I find that this amount more reasonably represents the complainant\u2019s revenue for 2004.\n[109] In his calculations for 2004, the complainant claimed $10,925 for lost salary. He states that if he had worked for the respondent in 2004, he would have worked for 25 weeks, i.e. the equivalent of 575 hours, at the hourly rate of $19.00. According to the evidence of Ms. Plouffe, the hourly rate of the agreement would rather have been $17.07 per hour, for a salary of $9,815.25. I find the calculations of Ms. Plouffe more trustworthy. Taking into consideration the evidence, I find that for the months of June, July and August 2004, the complainant did not suffer from any loss of salary because he was then operating his landscaping business. However, for the months of September to December 2004, I assess his loss at $4,000, namely somewhat less than half of the amount calculated by Ms. Plouffe.\n[110] For 2005, he declared gross earnings of $22,177.34 for his business activities. Once again, I find that the expenses that he is claiming for that year seem excessive. In fact, he says that he had business expenses of $27,170.65, which would mean that he had lost income for a second consecutive year in operating his business. I consider the claims for both the motor vehicle expenses ($14,149.14$ - namely 100% of the use of the vehicle) and the supplies expenses (9 569,59$) to be excessive. These expenses alone would absorb all of the business\u2019 revenues. He again claimed mortgage costs which he recognized on cross-examination had nothing to do with his business.\n[111] For 2005, it would be more realistic to consider a lesser amount for the complainant\u2019s expenses. As the respondent suggested, I believe that this amount could be reduced by half, which would mean that for this year the complainant\u2019s income would be about $11,000. According to the figures submitted by Ms. Plouffe, the complainant would have earned $28,736.43 had he worked for the respondent during that year. Therefore, for 2005, considering the income of $11,000, his loss of salary would be $17 000. I determine that the loss of salary for the complainant for 2005 was $17,000.\n[112] For 2006, the complainant did not submit any statement regarding his income and without such evidence, it is impossible for me to grant an amount for the loss of salary.\n[113] In conclusion, the complainant is entitled to $4,000 for loss of salary for 2004. For 2005, the amount is $17,000. There is no amount awarded for 2006, based on the lack of evidence.\n[114] Under paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, the complainant is therefore entitled to $21,000 for loss of salary following the respondent\u2019s discriminatory act. This amount seems reasonable to me given the evidence and the complainant\u2019s duty to mitigate his loss.\n(iii) Compensation for pain and suffering \u2013 paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act [115] The complainant is also claiming $20,000 as compensation for pain and suffering under paragraph 53(2)(e). I must admit that the evidence submitted at the hearing in support of this claim seems weak to say the least and is certainly not enough to justify the amount claimed by the complainant which is the maximum provided under the Act. While subsection 53(2) of the Act gives discretion to the Tribunal with regard to granting various remedies when a complaint proves to be founded, such discretion must be exercised judiciously in light of the evidence before the Tribunal. In this case the complaint is allowed and nothing in the complainant\u2019s testimony indicates any reason to refuse awarding him compensation for pain and suffering. (See Dumont v. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2002 FCT 1280.)\n[116] I agree that the respondent\u2019s decision did cause the complainant pain and suffering, if only in terms of anxiety. I therefore award $2,000 as compensation for pain and suffering.\n(iv) Expenses incurred - 53(2)(c). [117] Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) a complainant can claim additional costs and expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. In this case, the complainant is claiming the reimbursement of:\nAn invoice for legal representation before the CSST for $312.01; An invoice for an occupational therapy report for $55; and An invoice for a medical report for $315.65.\n[118] For the invoice for legal representation before the CSST, I cannot see how the complainant\u2019s dealings with the CSST could be blamed on the respondent in this matter. This claim is therefore refused.\n[119] With regard to the invoice for an occupational therapy report, we refer to a report prepared by a firm called CRD Physioth\u00e9rapie et R\u00e9adaptation. This report was never filed into evidence. The claim for the reimbursement of these fees is therefore also refused.\n[120] The invoice for the reimbursement of Dr. Carter\u2019s second medical report is however accepted since it resulted from the discriminatory practice. If the respondent had carried out an individual assessment of the complainant, this second report would not have been necessary. I therefore order the reimbursement of the invoice for $315.65.\n(v) Interest [121] Interest is payable with regard to all indemnities awarded in this decision (subsection 53(4) of the Act). Interest shall be calculated in accordance with subsection 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-01-04) simple interest calculated on a yearly basis based on the official rate set by the Bank of Canada. Interest shall accrue from the date of the complaint until the date the indemnity is paid.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario May 2, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1116\/9705\nStyle of Cause: Michel Knight v.

Hadjis\n2007 CHRT 16 2007\/05\/07\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has made a motion seeking an order that special measures be adopted with regard to the upcoming testimony of three witnesses, Hannya Rizk, Harvey Goldberg and Dean Steacy.\n[2] These individuals are employees of the Commission. The circumstances giving rise to Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Steacy being called to testify relate back to affidavits that they each swore shortly before the start of the hearing. These affidavits were produced by the Commission in support of its position that it had complied with its disclosure obligations, a position with which Mr. Lemire took issue. Mr. Lemire's counsel, Barbara Kulaszka, therefore, sought leave from the Tribunal to cross-examine these individuals on their affidavits. Given that the affidavits were filed 17 days prior to the start of the hearing, I directed that if Ms. Kulaszka wanted to cross-examine the affiants, she could simply call them as witnesses at the hearing.\n[3] Ms. Rizk, for her part, was apparently the Commission employee who investigated Mr. Warman's complaint. Mr. Lemire contends that during her investigation, she was unable to locate some of the impugned material that Mr. Warman alleges to have viewed on the Internet. Mr. Lemire is also claiming that Ms. Rizk had been investigating Mr. Lemire's activities on the Internet well before Mr. Warman had filed the present complaint.\n[4] The matter of the three witnesses' testimony was discussed at the opening of the hearing, in Toronto, on January 29, 2007. Ms. Kulaszka confirmed her intent to call the three witnesses, who all apparently reside in the National Capital Region. In order to facilitate matters, Ms. Kulaszka proposed that their evidence be given in Ottawa. None of the parties raised any objection to this choice of venue and I accepted Ms. Kulaszka's proposal. The witnesses would testify following the close of the four weeks of hearings that ended on March 2, 2007, in Toronto. The dates for their testimony were ultimately set down for May 9 to 11, 2007, at the Tribunal's offices in downtown Ottawa.\n[5] The Commission is now seeking the adoption of special measures regarding these witnesses' evidence, namely, that they be allowed to testify from a different location than the Tribunal's hearing room by video conference. Their physical and visual appearance would be seen by the Tribunal and counsel via video while everyone else, including Mr. Lemire, would be seated in a separate room where they would only be able to hear the audio portion of the testimonies.\n[6] During the four weeks of hearings in Toronto, the Commission made no request for the special measures it is now seeking. However, on March 2, 2007, the Commission filed a motion to quash the subpoenas, which I dismissed on March 14, 2007.\n[7] The Commission has filed copies of numerous postings on the Internet that it contends show that the Commission has legitimate reason to fear for the safety and security of its employees. Some of this material is abhorrent and very troubling. It includes a fictional account of a shooting at a Tribunal hearing, numerous messages calling for the death of Mr. Warman, judges, and Tribunal members, and details regarding Mr. Warman's home address. All of these postings are, of course, made anonymously or with pseudonyms. I gather that they have been made on websites based in the USA. There is no evidence before me linking this material to Mr. Lemire.\n[8] Photographs of Mr. Warman have also been posted on the web, as well as those of one individual who is alleged to be involved with a group called Anti-Racist Action. In 2006, prior to the start of the hearing, photographs of all the intended expert witnesses in this case (Mr. Lemire's, as well as the Commission's and the Attorney General's) were presumably posted by Mr. Lemire on a web page dealing principally with the present case, which is located on the freedomsite.org website. The photo of Dr. Karen Mock, the Commission's expert, was edited to portray her in a manner that she found objectionable. The Commission made known her objections and it is my understanding that by the time the hearing commenced, her photo had been removed.\n[9] The Commission submits that the evidence it has filed provides a reasonable ground for the fear regarding the personal and professional safety of the Commission witnesses. Yet, the special measures that the Commission is asking the Tribunal to adopt do not relate to the witnesses' security at the hearing. In a previous ruling, I made it clear to all parties that disturbances or intimidation inside or outside the hearing room would not be tolerated and that I would take appropriate measures to deal with such problems. Indeed, as has been the Tribunal's practice with regard to all s. 13 complaints, additional security measures were taken in this case. Moreover, it was evident at the hearing that the Commission had put in place additional security measures of its own with regard to counsel and its witnesses.\n[10] The issue therefore, for the Commission, does not seem to be security at the hearing but rather the witnesses' identities or more correctly, the capture and publication of the three witnesses' images. The Commission explains the motivation for its request as follows:\nThat the physical appearance\/identity of its employees summoned as witnesses by the Respondent be protected and not be revealed to ensure that its employees are not recognizable in their every day lives and become vulnerable when in society and\/or their photos be placed on the Internet as has been the case with the experts and Mr. Warman as illustrated by the evidence in the exhibits provided.\n[11] Interestingly, no similar request was made when Mr. Warman and the expert witnesses testified in Toronto, although it would appear that their images could already be found on the Internet.\n[12] The Commission has directed me to a number of decisions where courts have ordered that special measures be taken regarding the evidence of witnesses. I note, however, that the special measures in these cases relate to the concealment of the witnesses' names. In the present case, we not only know the names of the witnesses but we also know that they are employees of the Commission.\n[13] The option being proposed by the Commission would result in Mr. Lemire being denied the opportunity to be in the hearing room while these witnesses testify. Section 52(1) states that the Tribunal's inquiry shall be conducted in public. The Tribunal may, on application, take measures that it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the Tribunal is satisfied that certain conditions are present:\n52. (1) An inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\nthere is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed; there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n(2) If the member or panel considers it appropriate, the member or panel may take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a hearing held in respect of an application under subsection (1).\n52. (1) L'instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction s'il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\nil y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique; il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d'atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique; il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique; il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n(2) Le membre instructeur peut, s'il l'estime indiqu\u00e9, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu'il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la demande vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1).\n[14] It is important to note that the measures contemplated in s. 52 are to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry. What is restrained, under s. 52, is the public's access to the proceedings, not a party's access. Typically, the measures adopted by the Tribunal to maintain confidentiality where warranted are those that result in the hearing being conducted in camera.\n[15] This is not what the Commission is seeking here. The request goes well beyond that. If granted, Mr. Lemire will be excluded from the hearing examining his own alleged conduct. He will be denied the opportunity to view the evidence. His opportunity to assist and instruct his lawyer will be restricted. Section 50(1) provides that all parties shall be given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. As Mr. Justice Mackay noted in Canadian Ratio-television and Telecommunications Commission v. Canada (Human Rights Tribunal) (T.D.) (Deegan), [1991] 1 F.C. 141, at 153, (F.C.T.D.):\nThe opportunity to present evidence and make representations implies, as I see it, the necessity to know the evidence and representations of others in order to respond with relevancy in the context of the hearing conducted by the Tribunal.\n[16] The reference to counsel in s. 52 is intended to assure a party of his or her right to be represented by counsel. The presence of counsel does not nullify the right of a party to be present. Each party has a right to appear at the inquiry regardless of whether he or she is represented by counsel. This right flows not only from s. 50(1) but as a matter of natural justice.\n[17] I note that Mr. Lemire has not been a passive participant in these proceedings even though he has been represented by legal counsel. I have observed this throughout the course of the four weeks of hearings. He has been assisting Ms. Kulaszka in all manners; he organizes the numerous documents and exhibits for her, he takes notes, he suggests questions to her, he has even made representations to the Tribunal on occasion. In this regard, I find the Court's finding in Deegan, supra at 153-4, instructive:\n[P]arties to a complaint should be free to attend and hear the evidence presented and without their consent should not be excluded under a general order excluding witnesses whether they represent themselves or are represented by counsel whose effectiveness should not be limited by the exclusion as a potential witness of a party who alone can instruct counsel.\n(emphasis added)\n[18] Outside of the hearing, Mr. Lemire has at times communicated directly with the Tribunal registry, particularly with regard to the organization and format of exhibits.\n[19] In her submissions on this motion, Ms. Kulaszka concludes that in these circumstances, Mr. Lemire should be entitled to see the witnesses and their reactions to questions, and to instruct counsel regarding any matters that arise during their testimony. I agree. I would add that I therefore see no reason why the witnesses' evidence should not be given in the physical presence of all parties, at the Tribunal's facilities in Ottawa.\n[20] This being said, the Commission's concerns are not without some basis. There is evidence that photos have been taken of the alleged Anti Racist Action representative while he was in attendance at another Tribunal hearing relating to a s. 13 complaint. These images were apparently later posted on the web. According to the Commission, the three witnesses fear that if their images are publicized, their ability to do their jobs investigating hate on the Internet may be compromised. Ms. Kulaszka points out that the image of at least one of the three witnesses is already available on the Internet. Nevertheless, I do not see this aspect of the Commission's request as unreasonable. I would note, however, that no evidence has been brought before me of any photos having been taken during the previous four weeks of hearings into this complaint that were later posted on the Internet. There is one exception. The webpage dealing with this case, found on the freedomsite.org website, contains photos, taken in the hearing room during a break in proceedings, of persons identified as the defence team, including Ms. Kulaszka, Paul Fromm (representing the interested party, CAFE) and Mr. Lemire.\n[21] In all of the circumstances, I therefore order that no person be allowed to bring into the hearing room, cameras of any sort including computer cameras, video cameras and camera-phones. The capturing of any visual image will be forbidden. I direct the Tribunal Registry to take the necessary measures for the enforcement of this order.\n[22] The Commission, on a secondary point, requests an order that all questions to be asked of the witnesses fall within the strict parameters of the constitutional question in issue to the exception of Hannya Rizk who would also be asked questions regarding her investigation of the present complaint.\n[23] This request is denied. Any objections that may be raised by the parties regarding the scope of the evidence of these witnesses will be dealt with by the Tribunal as they arise.\n[24] The Commission's motion as presented is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Through its motion, the Commission is requesting that the respondent, the Canadian Forces, disclose or produce notes, documents and drafts relating to an expert\u2019s report prepared by Dr. Pierre Assalian for these proceedings. Specifically, the Commission is seeking the disclosure or production of a preliminary report allegedly prepared by Dr. Assalian and submitted to the respondent\u2019s counsel before April 24, 2006.\n[2] For its part, the respondent is objecting to the disclosure of these documents on the grounds that they are subject to solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege.\n[3] During his testimony on his qualifications as an expert, Dr. Assalian testified about the preparation of the reports he had been called to write for these proceedings.\n[4] Dr. Assalian explained that, during a meeting in the autumn of 2005, the respondent\u2019s counsel, Mr. Morissette, mandated him to review the documents to determine whether the Canadian Forces were justified in imposing an employment limitation on Ms. Montreuil because of gender dysphoria.\n[5] Dr. Assalian then explained that in early 2006, he received the documents that he had to assess and that he subsequently prepared a report or preliminary report in accordance with the mandate given to him.\n[6] According to Dr. Assalian, the draft had been prepared in March or April 2006 and sent by e-mail to the respondent\u2019s counsel, Mr. Lamb. Dr. Assalian stated that, after sending his draft report or preliminary report to the respondent\u2019s counsel, he had asked to meet with him in order to discuss the document.\n[7] Dr. Assalian stated that when he met with the respondent\u2019s counsel, he had indicated that he wanted to perform a clinical assessment of the complainant, which the respondent\u2019s counsel agreed to.\n[8] Called to explain the reasons for his request, Dr. Assalian stated that he could have been satisfied with an assessment based on the documents, but that he considered it was important to perform a clinical assessment in order to confirm his assessment, as he was of the opinion that this matter was a high profile case, to use his words, and foresaw a challenge if there were a documentary analysis without a clinical examination.\n[9] Dr. Assalian, accompanied by two colleagues, therefore proceeded on May 18, 2006, with a clinical assessment of the complainant. On June 21, 2006, Dr. Assalian gave the respondent\u2019s counsel a report signed by him. This report appears to have been written based on the documentation provided by Ms. Montreuil, the interview of May 18, 2006, as well as the MMPI-2 test that Ms. Montreuil has had to take.\n[10] It appears therefore from Dr. Assalian\u2019s testimony that he wrote a first report that he sent to the respondent\u2019s counsel before April 24, 2006, and that on June 21, 2006, he produced a second report following the clinical assessment of Ms. Montreuil.\n[11] During his testimony, Dr. Assalian stated that he no longer had his written notes regarding the complainant\u2019s assessment, as they were destroyed after the expert report was written. He also stated that he had not kept his working documents and that he did not have a medical file on Ms. Montreuil.\n[12] Based on Dr. Assalian\u2019s testimony, it therefore appears that the only document in issue is the draft report or the preliminary report prepared by Dr. Assalian, submitted to the respondent\u2019s counsel prior to April 24, 2006.\nII. The Parties\u2019 Positions A. The Commission [13] The Commission argues, firstly, that the draft report or preliminary report written by Dr. Assalian prior to April 24, 2006, should be communicated or disclosed to it. According to the Commission, that document is potentially relevant to the issues and, on that basis, it is a document which ought to be disclosed to it. On that point, it relies on the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, specifically paragraph 6(1)(d).\n[14] Secondly relying on a decision by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt, [1987] B.C.J. No. 3149, the Commission argues that, so long as experts limit themselves to their role as a party\u2019s adviser, all of the documents that they have in their possession remain privileged and the opposing party cannot require their disclosure. However, as soon as experts are called as a witness, their role changes and their opinions and their sources cannot be considered privileged. The Commission also relies on a certain number of other decisions to the same effect.\n[15] Moreover, the Commission argues that solicitor-client privilege does not apply in this case, that the applicable rules are those which apply to litigation privilege and that according to these rules, the draft reports or the preliminary reports produced by an expert are not confidential when the expert is called as a witness.\nB. The respondent [16] For its part, the respondent is objecting to the disclosure or production of the preliminary report prepared by Dr. Assalian before April 24, 2006, on the grounds that it is protected by solicitor-client privilege, which is disputed by the Commission.\n[17] The respondent relies, inter alia, on the fourth paragraph of section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, c. H-6, which reads as follows:\nThe [Tribunal] may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence.\nIt also relies on section 40 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S. 1985, c. C-5, which reads as follows:\nIn all proceedings over which Parliament has legislative authority, the laws of evidence in force in the province in which those proceedings are taken, including the laws of proof of service of any warrant, summons, subpoena or other document, subject to this Act and other Acts of Parliament, apply to those proceedings.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[18] On this point, the respondent argues that in this case, Quebec evidence law must be applied even though the dispute is one that falls within the purview of a federal statute, namely the Canadian Human Rights Act, supra, and even though there may be resulting discrepancies at the provincial level regarding the applicable rules of evidence.\n[19] Moreover, the respondent argues that in Quebec law, an expert\u2019s drafts, notes, and preliminary reports are protected by solicitor-client privilege. The respondent is relying primarily on the decision by the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec in Poulin v. Prat, [1994] A.Q. No. 142. In this decision, the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec clearly established that a party cannot require the production of an expert\u2019s pre-trial reports, notes, or preliminary drafts and that these documents are covered by solicitor-client privilege.\nC. The complainant [20] The complainant in essence espouses the Commission\u2019s position.\nIII. Analysis [21] From the outset, it should be pointed out that this is not an issue about the disclosure of documents in the possession of a party, documents that the party would be required to disclose under paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, my colleague Jensen\u2019s decision on a motion for disclosure of documents filed by the Commission is not applicable given that the issue in this case is not one of disclosure but rather one of production of documents.\n[22] Experts\u2019 reports and accompanying documents should not be considered documents in a party\u2019s possession within the meaning of paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, documents a party would be required to disclose.\n[23] In any case, a distinction should be made between documents that are in a party\u2019s possession when litigation arises and documents created for a proceeding for the purposes of the litigation. The experts\u2019 reports and, where applicable, all of the related pre-trial versions, must, in this respect, be considered as documents created specifically for litigation purposes and not as related documents in the possession of a party when litigation arises.\n[24] Considering the experts\u2019 reports as documents in the possession of a party would mean that in cases where a party obtained an expert\u2019s report for guidance without intending to file it or having the expert testify, the party would be required to disclose it to the opposing party. This can not be the scope of paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[25] The rules under section 6 of the Rules of Procedure apply to documents in the possession of a party when the litigation arises which could be potentially relevant to the issues.\n[26] In this case, it is rather a matter of determining whether a party can require the production of a document prepared by an expert, be it a draft report or even a preliminary report, in the course of preparing an expert\u2019s report.\n[27] More specifically, the issue in this case is whether the document prepared by Dr. Assalian prior to April 24, 2006, in accordance with the mandate conferred to him by the respondent, is protected by solicitor-client privilege or litigation privilege.\n[28] If the document falls under solicitor-client privilege, it is protected and the Commission cannot have access to it. If the document falls under litigation privilege, the Commission could have access to it. It is therefore important to examine the meaning and the scope of these two concepts of solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege.\nA. The privileges [29] The Commission argues that a distinction should be made between solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege. It is correct. In Canadian law, the courts nowadays distinguish solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege, in Quebec civil law as well as in common law; these privileges are subject to different rules of application.\n(i) Solicitor-client privilege or the litigation privilege [30] In Quebec, in Foster Wheeler Power Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intermunicipale de gestion et d'\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., [2004] 1 S.C.R. 456, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, in Quebec\u2019s statutory framework, the term professional secrecy includes solicitor-client privilege as well as litigation privilege.\n[31] According to the Court, professional secrecy contemplates both the duty of confidentiality imposed on counsel with regard to their client and immunity from disclosure that protects the content of information against compelled disclosure in regard to third parties (Foster Wheeler Power Co. v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intermunicipale de gestion et d'\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., paragraph 29).\n[32] Thus, solicitor-client privilege or, more narrowly in civil law, counsel\u2019s duty of confidentiality toward their client, covers in essence the verbal and written communications exchanged between counsel and their client. These communications are considered privileged and a party cannot require their production or their disclosure (See, to the same effect, Poulin v. Prat, [1994] A.Q. No. 142).\n[33] That said, even if in Quebec law both privileges are included in the privilege of professional secrecy, the two parts must nonetheless be distinguished from one another, according to the Supreme Court (Foster Wheeler Power Co., supra).\n[34] With regard to the common law, the Supreme Court determined in Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [2006] S.C.J. No. 39, paragraph 7) that for the purposes of the legal analysis, it is important to consider solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege as distinct concepts and not as two components of a single concept. These two privileges are subject to different legal rules.\n(ii) The litigation privilege or immunity from disclosure [35] In Quebec civil law, immunity from disclosure, equivalent to the common law\u2019s litigation privilege, is considered a component of solicitor-client privilege (see to this effect: Foster Wheeler Power Co., supra, paragraphs 1 and 15). As stated earlier, both concepts are nevertheless distinct and subject to different rules of application.\n[36] To the contrary, in common law, the Supreme Court determined in Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice, supra, paragraph 7) that litigation privilege differs from solicitor-client privilege in terms of their scope, their objective and their different sources. It should be noted here that in Blank, the Supreme Court did not refer at all to the decision in F oster Wheeler Power Co.\n[37] According to Blank, litigation privilege applies to non-confidential communications between counsel and third parties and even includes documents that are not communications in nature (Sharpe, cited in Blank, at paragraph 28: see also Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt, supra, Jesionowski v. Gorecki, [1992] F.C.J., No. 816. It exists independently of solicitor-client privilege.\n[38] Having established the differences between solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege, it is now necessary to determine whether the document Dr. Assalian gave to the respondent\u2019s counsel prior to April 24, 2006, in relation to the mandate conferred to him by the respondent, falls under the privilege of solicitor-client privilege or whether it is protected or not by the litigation privilege. It is necessary to examine this issue in light of the rules of evidence governing the production of experts\u2019 reports, in civil law as well as at common law.\nB. The experts\u2019 reports\n[39] With regard to experts\u2019 reports, a distinction should be made, on the one hand, between the documents used by experts for writing their reports, which are documents relevant to the expert\u2019s cross-examination and, on the other hand, the draft report or preliminary report prepared by experts in fulfilling the mandate given to them by a party.\n[40] From the outset, it should be pointed out that, in this case, the Commission is not trying to obtain the documents relied on to prepare Dr. Assalian\u2019s report, regarding which he will be examined, but the preliminary report or the draft report which he sent to the respondent\u2019s counsel prior to April 24, 2006.\n(i) The documents used by experts in preparing their reports [41] Once a physician is called as an expert and his or her report has been filed in evidence, a party is entitled to obtain a copy of all of the documents which were used to prepare the report \u2013 the documentary sources of his or her report. This is necessary so that the counsel cross-examining the expert can, with respect to the report filed, fully assess the facts and issues of the expert\u2019s reasoning in regard to the report filed, as well as the expert\u2019s intellectual process.\n[42] Once a party has filed an expert\u2019s report in evidence, this party may not keep any part of the report confidential. This is what stems from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in R. v. Stone, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, paragraph 98.\n[43] Moreover, experts will be bound to make available to the opposing party all of the documents in their possession relied on to prepare their report. This stems from the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt, supra, paragraph 34. It is important to note that this decision does not specifically refer to an expert\u2019s draft reports or preliminary reports, but refers in a broader sense to the documents in the expert\u2019s possession.\n[44] As pointed out by the British Columbia Supreme Court in Vancouver Community College and the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stone, when experts are asked to testify, parties waive any privilege connected to the report. According to the Court, once a witness takes the stand, he\/she can no longer be characterized as offering private advice to a party. They are offering an opinion for the assistance of the court. As such, the opposing party must be given access to the foundation of such opinions to test them adequately (paragraph 99). (Emphasis added.)\n[45] More recently, R. v. Stone was applied in the decision by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Horodynsky Farms Inc. v. Zeneca Corp. (c.o.b. Zeneca Agro), [2006] O.J. No. 3012. In this decision, a judge of the Court of Appeal for Ontario who was called to interpret the scope of subsection 31.06(3) of Ontario\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure, held that a memorandum prepared by counsel after a conversation with an expert who had later filed a report should have been given to the opposing party and that the memorandum was not protected by the litigation privilege.\n[46] According to the Court, this memorandum could be included in the observations, opinions and conclusions referred to in subsection 31.06(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. In obiter, Mr. Justice Gillese of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that an expert\u2019s draft reports fell under the purview of subsection 31.06(3) of Ontario\u2019s R ules of Civil Procedure.\n[47] That said, it appears to us that this decision is of limited scope and cannot be considered a statement of general principle to the extent that it focuses on the interpretation of the meaning of the words findings, conclusions or opinions which are found in subsection 31.06(3) of Ontario\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure and because the document at issue was a memorandum.\n[48] In Quebec, the Court of Appeal of Qu\u00e9bec held in Poulin v. Prat, supra, that [Translation] a party is entitled to know the facts on which the expert has based his or her opinion. According to the Court, a party is entitled to know the facts on which the expert based his or her opinion. From this perspective, a party certainly has the right to know the sources, documentary or otherwise, where the expert drew this information. However, . . . the party cannot compel the expert to produce notes, drafts, or preliminary reports which led to the preparation of the expert\u2019s final report (paragraph 34).\n[49] These different decisions indicate that once an expert is called as a witness, the expert can be required to produce any document used to prepare his or her report and be examined on these documents. The opposing party is, in fact, entitled to know the documentary sources for the expert\u2019s report and to require that the expert produce all of the documentation used to prepare the report. The party producing the expert then waives the litigation privilege, whether it is incorporated in the solicitor-client privilege or not, as is the case in Quebec.\n[50] In this case, therefore, the complainant and the Commission will be entitled, during their cross-examination of Dr. Assalian, to ask him to produce all of the documents that he used in fulfilling the mandate conferred to him by the respondent, unless those documents are already in their possession.\n(ii) The preliminary reports or draft reports [51] It appears that in common law, certain decisions suggest that the draft reports prepared by an expert called to testify in a proceeding are not covered by the litigation privilege and that a party can require their production. This stems from an obiter by Gillese J.A. of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Horodynsky Farms Inc. v. Zeneca Corp. (c.o.b. Zeneca Agro), supra, paragraph 38.\n[52] Similarly, in Chapman Management & Consulting Services Ltd v. Kernic Equipment Sales Ltd, [2004] A.J. No. 756, Mr. Justice McIntyre of Alberta\u2019s Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held, relying inter alia on the decision in Vancouver Community College, supra, that the defendant had to produce its expert\u2019s drafts as well as all documents in the expert\u2019s possession which were used to elaborate his opinion (paragraph 2).\n[53] That said, there does not appear to be unanimity at common law regarding the production of draft reports, notes or preliminary reports relating to the testimony of an expert in a given proceeding. In fact, at common law, there is case law where the courts refused to follow the approach adopted in Vancouver Community College, supra, and considered experts\u2019 drafts and preliminary reports privileged and protected by the litigation privilege (see, for example, Kelly v. Kelly, [1990] O.J. No. 603), Bell Canada v. Olympia & York Developments Ltd. et al., 68 O.R. (2d) 103, Highland Fisheries Ltd v. Lynk Electric Ltd, 63 D.L.R. (4th) 493).\n[54] In this context, one cannot claim that the state of law in common law in matters involving the production of draft reports, notes or preliminary reports is clear and simple, with no room for differing points of view. The decision in Vancouver Community College, supra, does not seem to have as much authority as the Commission seems to assign to it. Besides, the decision in Vancouver Community College, supra, did not bear specifically on the production of draft reports or preliminary reports but rather on documents in the possession of an expert which were relied on in preparing the expert\u2019s report.\n[55] In Quebec civil law, the Court of Appeal, for its part, has held several times that notes and rough drafts, drafts and preliminary reports produced by an expert are included in solicitor-client privilege and that they cannot be produced in evidence at the request of the opposing party (Poulin v. Prat, supra, Laviolette v. Bouchard, [2001] J.Q. No. 3642).\n[56] In Poulin v. Prat, the Court of Appeal expressed the opinion that [Translation] when counsel, in preparing to defend the interests of a client, hires an expert, he is only acting as an agent for his client (paragraph 22). For the Court, the written as well as the verbal communications between counsel and the expert, except under particular circumstances, remain confidential and are protected by solicitor-client privilege (paragraphs 22 and 26).\n[57] Moreover, for the Court of Appeal, [Translation] producing an expert as a witness must not enable the opposing party to require this witness to produce everything in the expert\u2019s possession such as notes, drafts and preliminary reports that the expert could have gathered and written while he was assessing the file and the thought process which led to the formulation of the final opinion that the expert is called to share with the court (Poulin v. Prat, supra, paragraph 27).\n[58] In Poulin v. Prat, the Court found that the documents sought in that case, exchanged between counsel and the expert, were confidential and protected by solicitor-client privilege (paragraph 31).\n[59] It therefore appears that in Quebec, the law which applies to the production of an expert\u2019s draft reports, projects of report or preliminary reports is much more clear if we consider the decisions by the Court of Appeal in Poulin v. Prat, supra, and Laviolette v. Bouchard, supra. Under these circumstances, the case law of the Court of Appeal must be considered as decisive regarding the production of an expert\u2019s draft reports, projects of report or preliminary reports.\n[60] In conclusion, it is important to point out that if seeking the truth is at the heart of every legal dispute, one must however accept that the expert whose services are retained by a party be able to fulfill the mandate conferred by that party without restraint. Experts must be able to develop their opinions and formulate their findings without fearing that third parties could at any time come and capture ideas and words that they wrote down at a time when they were still in the process of analyzing and reasoning and had not formed a final opinion on an issue.\n[61] It is important that experts rest assured that their intellectual process will not be scrutinized by third parties. One can already imagine that a good number of experienced experts do not keep drafts of their report or written notes, for fear that these documents will fall into the hands of the court, thereby publicly revealing their intellectual process, likely to evolve according to the information gathered and periods of reflection spent reviewing a matter.\n[62] That said, the fact remains that the expert who is called to testify in a given proceeding and who files a report should produce all of the documents relied on in preparing the report when so requested by a party. This party is entitled to examine the expert on all of the elements relied on in preparing the report. The Tribunal will then have to assess the objectivity and the soundness of the expertise produced. Moreover, a party will always be able to dispute the validity of an expert\u2019s opinions and findings during the party\u2019s cross-examination of the expert or by calling their own expert who could have points of view which differ from those expressed by the expert. Medicine is both a science and an art.\n[63] Surely, there is always a risk that experts could misunderstand their role as experts and think that they are there to serve the interests of the party calling them as witnesses. There is also a risk that the experts could let themselves be influenced by the remarks of counsel who retain their services or that they agree to change their findings or assessments at the request of counsel. A skilled cross-examination will often expose the shortcomings of an expert\u2019s report that is not objective.\nIV. Conclusion [64] The Tribunal finds that the report sent by Dr. Assalian to the respondent\u2019s counsel before April 24, 2006, is protected by solicitor-client privilege and therefore must be considered confidential. It cannot therefore be admitted in evidence in accordance with subsection 50(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nV. Decision [65] For the reasons stated above, the Commission\u2019s motion for the production of documents or the disclosure of the draft report or the preliminary report submitted to the respondent\u2019s counsel by Dr. Assalian before April 24, 2006, is dismissed.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario May 8, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1047\/2805\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

Hadjis\n2007 CHRT 18 2007\/05\/10\n[1] The Respondent, Canada Post Corporation (CPC), has made a motion requesting that the Tribunal exercise its discretion to refuse to hear the present complaint on the basis that the inordinate delay in filing the complaint constitutes an abuse of process.\nFactual Background [2] The Complainant, Raymond Gagn\u00e9, worked for CPC as a postal clerk in Toronto from November 1974 until October 1988, when he obtained a senior postal clerk position at the post office in Ladysmith, British Columbia. He alleges in his complaint that shortly after transferring into the new position, he was harassed on the basis of his ethnic origin (French Canadian) and his place of origin (which was not specified in the complaint). He refers to a number of specific incidents of verbal and physical abuse that took place between October 1988 and April 1989.\n[3] The next occurrences of discrimination mentioned in the complaint relate to specific incidents of alleged harassment that took place in September of 1995. He states that in December 1995, he was diagnosed with a mental illness, which he claims was to some extent caused by the harassment. When his illness worsened and required that he take medical leave from work from January to May 1996, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 alleges that CPC did not assist him properly in his attempt to obtain worker's compensation benefits. Upon his return to work, he claims that CPC management harassed him by excessively monitoring him due to his disability.\n[4] He also alleges that his co-workers were permitted to harass him by spreading false rumours about his illness and making other efforts to worsen his state of health. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 contends that the level of harassment so affected his mental health that he needed to be hospitalized. His illness prevented him from attending work, as a result of which CPC dismissed him from his employment in August 2000.\n[5] Mr. Gagn\u00e9 did not file his human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, however, until May 5, 2004. The Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal on November 27, 2006.\n[6] Thus, CPC alleges that the length of time from the dates of the alleged discriminatory practices (1988 to 2000) to the present time (2007) is inordinate and constitutes an abuse of process, which warrants the exercise by the Tribunal of its discretion to refuse to hear the complaint.\nAnalysis [7] The Commission decided, pursuant to s. 41(1)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to deal with Mr. Gagn\u00e9's complaint even though the last alleged discriminatory act took place over one year prior to the filing of his complaint (in fact, about 45 months prior thereto). The Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to review this Commission decision. This power rests with the Federal Court (see I.L.W.U. (Marine Section) Local 400 v. Oster, [2002] 2 F.C. 430 (T.D.) at paras. 25-31).\n[8] However, if the entire pre-hearing delay, from the earliest alleged discriminatory acts until the hearing, is so long that the respondent's right to a fair hearing is compromised, the Tribunal has the authority to remedy the situation (see Desormeaux v. Ottawa Carleton Regional Transit Commission (2002 July 19) T701\/0602 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 13; Cremasco v. Canada Post Corporation (2002 September 30) T702\/0702 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 71, aff'd on other grounds Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corporation, [2004] 2 F.C.R. 581 (F.C.)). As the Tribunal in Cremasco noted at paragraph 74, this is in keeping with common sense: a board or tribunal must have some capacity to protect itself from litigants who use its process improperly.\n[9] The leading Supreme Court decision in relation to delay in the context of human rights cases is Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, 2000 SCC 44. The Court noted, at para. 101, that delay, without more, will not warrant a stay of proceedings as an abuse of process at common law, adding that in the administrative law context, there must be proof of significant prejudice which results from an unacceptable delay. The Court went on to state, at para. 102, that where delay impairs a party's ability to answer the complaint against him or her, because, for example memories have faded, essential witnesses have died or are unavailable, or evidence has been lost, then administrative delay may be invoked to impugn the validity of the administrative proceedings and provide a remedy.\n[10] In the present case, only a relatively small portion of the period can be attributed to any administrative delay in the Commission's handling of the complaint. The complaint was filed in May 2004 and the matter was referred to the Tribunal in November 2006, a period of 30 months. In its submissions on the motion, CPC did not take issue with the length of time that has passed since the complaint was filed. It is the pre-filing delay with which CPC takes issue. That being said, the principles articulated by the Supreme Court that I have cited above, remain, in my view, applicable. To warrant remedial action from the Tribunal, there must be proof of significant prejudice resulting from the unacceptable delay, which impairs the respondent's ability to answer the complaint.\n[11] Mr. Gagn\u00e9 worked with a number of CPC employees who could address his allegations. CPC does not affirm in its submissions that any of them have since died. At least seven of them have resigned or retired from CPC. Interestingly, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 points out that of those seven, five had already left CPC when he was dismissed. Thus, even if he had filed his complaint immediately after his dismissal, any issues regarding a party's ability to track down these individuals for the purposes of this case would have already arisen to some extent. In any event, I am not of the view that merely because potential witnesses have retired and perhaps moved away from their original place of employment, they will inevitably be untraceable and therefore, unavailable for a hearing. While trying to find these witnesses may pose a challenge, it is not necessarily an impossible task, and it is in my view not sufficient cause to conclude at this early stage that a respondent's ability to answer the complaint is so impaired as to justify the Tribunal's refusing to conduct a hearing into the complaint.\n[12] Nor is there any indication at this stage that the witnesses' memories have necessarily faded in this case. It should be noted that the bulk of the incidents alleged in the complaint occurred between 1996 and 2000, i.e. between eleven and seven years ago. This would not be the first case before the Tribunal to have received testimony regarding incidents that date back a similar length of time (see e.g. Uzoaba v. Canada (Correctional Service), (1994), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/361 (C.H.R.T.); Sugimoto v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2007 CHRT 5). I cannot therefore presume a priori, as CPC suggests, that its ability to provide evidence in answer to the allegations of the complaint has been compromised. As the Tribunal noted in Bozek v. M.C.L. Ryder Transport Inc., 2002 CanLII 45937 (C.H.R.T.), at paras. 21-2, evidentiary prejudice must be proven.\n[13] In setting out some of the difficulties it faces in preparing its answer to the complaint, CPC raises the absence of sufficient particulars in the complaint, which prevents it and its witnesses from being able to recall these allegedly discriminatory incidents that occurred between 18.5 and seven years ago. This strikes me as a matter that can be addressed through the Tribunal's disclosure process. If CPC believes Mr. Gagn\u00e9's Statement of Particulars, which includes witness will-say statements, is insufficient and that further disclosure is required pursuant to the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, CPC may make a motion to that effect. This is not a ground to justify a refusal by the Tribunal to hear the complaint.\n[14] Thus, just as in the lower court's finding that the Supreme Court adopted in Blencoe at para. 104, I find in the present case that the delay is not such that it would necessarily result in a hearing that lacks the essential elements of fairness. Proof of prejudice in the evidentiary sense has not been demonstrated to be of sufficient magnitude to impact on the fairness of the hearing.\n[15] The Court in Blencoe, however, recognized that there may be cases of abuse of process for other than evidentiary reasons brought about by delay (at para. 115). The delay must be clearly unacceptable and have directly caused a significant prejudice to amount to an abuse of process. It must be a delay that would, in the circumstances of the case, bring the human rights system into disrepute.\n[16] In the present case, while the delay is very long, particularly when taking into account the date of the first alleged discriminatory acts of October 1988, I am not convinced that it was unacceptable to the point of being so oppressive as to taint the proceedings (Blencoe at para. 121). The Court points out, in Blencoe at para. 122, that the determination of whether a delay has become inordinate depends on the nature of the case and its complexity, the facts and issues, the purpose and nature of the proceedings, whether the respondent contributed to or waived the delay, and other circumstances of the case.\n[17] Based on the allegations in the complaint form, Mr. Gagn\u00e9 appears to be claiming that he was harassed at the workplace, which contributed to the development of his disability, and was in turn a factor in the decision to dismiss him. Cases of discrimination are different from typical civil cases, such as the one relating to contract law to which CPC alluded in its submissions (Woodheath Developments Ltd. v. Goldman (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 668 (S.C.J.)). In cases of discrimination, it is not uncommon for the discriminatory practice to be of an ongoing nature, particularly where harassment has been alleged. Tribunals have recognized that victims of discrimination will not always immediately perceive a respondent's acts as being discriminatory.\n[18] Moreover, depending on the circumstances, individual acts may not necessarily amount to harassment, within the meaning of the Act, unless they are repeated over time (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces) (Franke), [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (T.D.)). In harassment cases, the employer's efforts to prevent harassment or its response to acts of harassment will also frequently be in issue (see s. 65(2) of the Act). In determining whether an employer has acted promptly and properly in all of the circumstances of a given case, the previous knowledge of an employer as to the vulnerability of a particular employee may well be germane (Uzoaba, supra, at para. 17). Thus, evidence that may stretch over a fairly extensive period of time may be relevant.\n[19] Part of the delay in the present case is attributable to the forty-five months that Mr. Gagn\u00e9 took before filing his complaint. Mr. Gagn\u00e9 claims that his medical condition was a factor in his failing to file the complaint sooner, and he has produced a letter from a physician in support of this contention. CPC disputes this claim and has submitted a letter from a psychiatrist contradicting some of the findings of Mr. Gagn\u00e9's physician. CPC argues that Mr. Gagn\u00e9's health did not prevent him from filing his complaint within the one year period contemplated in s. 41(1)(e) of the Act.\n[20] As I have already stated, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review Commission decisions to deal with complaints beyond the one-year period. If a party disagrees with the Commission's decision in the present case and wants it reviewed, the Federal Court would be the appropriate forum. Moreover, to the extent that this matter is being raised before the Tribunal as a matter of abuse of process, it is, in my view, inappropriate for the Tribunal to make any findings with respect to expert evidence and other factual issues in dispute without the benefit of a full evidentiary record. The Tribunal should not be drawing any conclusions that could result in the dismissal of a human rights complaint on the basis of a couple of letters written by medical professionals whose expertise has not even been established before the Tribunal and whose evidence has not been heard and tested through cross-examination.\n[21] Furthermore, it would appear, based on some of the documents filed by the parties regarding the present motion, that Mr. Gagn\u00e9 did in fact take action against his employer in response to his dismissal. On October 10, 2002, he filed a grievance through his union, alleging that he had been discharged without just, reasonable or sufficient cause. He asked for his reinstatement. Apparently, the union did not deal with the matter to Mr. Gagn\u00e9's satisfaction, and on May 28, 2003, he filed a complaint with the Canada Industrial Relations Board alleging that his union was in breach of its duty of fair representation, pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Labour Code. This is not therefore a case of a complainant who simply did nothing in response to the last alleged discriminatory act (the dismissal), before filing his human rights complaint.\n[22] In conclusion, given the context and circumstances of this case, I am not convinced that the delay is inordinate. This is not to say that all of the evidence to be introduced regarding the 1988-89 incidents or any of the subsequent events must necessarily be taken into consideration by the Tribunal in adjudicating the complaint on its merits. It may become evident at the hearing that the recollections of the witnesses are hazy or perhaps non-existent, given the passage of time and the nature of the events in relation to which they testified. Key documents may no longer be available. CPC could therefore argue that the Tribunal should not allow any evidence relating to these events to form part of its decision. This was in effect what the Tribunal in Uzoaba, supra, at D\/368-9, decided with respect to evidence led at the hearing of incidents that had occurred as many as 19 years prior to the hearing.\n[23] CPC's motion is therefore dismissed, without prejudice to CPC's right to later argue that the Tribunal should not take into account evidence relating to one or more given incidents that have been alleged in the complaint.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] On June 20, 2003, Mr. Jim St. John filed a complaint against Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post or CPC) alleging that CPC had discriminated against him in employment on the basis of his disability by treating him in an adverse differential manner, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Specifically, Mr. St. John complained that Canada Post sent him home from work early on May 27, 2003, claiming that there was no work for him to do within his restrictions. Canada Post then made use of Mr. St. John's sick leave credits to compensate him for the lost wages he incurred.\n[2] Mr. St. John further alleged that in May 2003, Canada Post was engaging in a discriminatory policy or practice, as those terms are used in s. 10 of the Act, when it sent him and three other disabled employees home early from the Edmonton Mail Processing Plant (EMPP) and paid them from their sick leave credits on May 27, 2003. On that day, Canada Post was experiencing a period of low mail volume. Mr. St. John complained that this was the second time he had been sent home from work as a result of low mail volume. The first time was in 2001.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission fully participated in the hearing into this matter. The Commission called a number of witnesses including the Complainant, Mr. St. John, and several union representatives. The Respondent, Canada Post, called one witness: Ms. Darlene Swabb, the manager of the section of the EMPP in which Mr. St. John worked in May 2003.\n[4] During the hearing of this matter, the parties reached a settlement with respect to the section 7 portion of the complaint. The parties, however, indicated that they wished to have the section 10 complaint heard and determined by this Tribunal. The issue in this decision, therefore, is quite simply: in May of 2003, was Canada Post pursuing a policy or practice that deprived or tended to deprive Mr. St. John and other employees with disabilities of employment opportunities on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\nII. FACTS [5] Mr. Jim St. John is a full-time postal clerk (PO-3) at the Canada Post Mail Processing Plant in Edmonton (the EMPP). He works the day shift at the EMPP. Although there was some confusion with respect to the exact times of the shift, it would appear that in 2003, the day shift at the EMPP was from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mr. St. John is a member of a bargaining unit represented by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW).\n[6] Mr. St. John is disabled; he suffers from bipolar mood disorder and has lower back and knee problems. Mr. St. John has been designated by CPC as having permanent partial disabilities (PPD's).\n[7] As a result of his PPD status, from 1995 onward Mr. St. John has been accommodated in the Forward Letters section of the Communication Value Stream (Communications) in the EMPP. Forward Letters is where all of legal-sized and normal-sized envelopes are sorted and prepared for dispatch to Canada and elsewhere in the world. The Communication Value Stream is a department within Canada Post.\n[8] To accommodate Mr. St. John, Canada Post did not require him to work in sections other than his own, permitted him to work day shift only, and did not require him to perform any tasks that involved bending, twisting or turning with weight. These modifications were subsequently changed to permit Mr. St. John to work in other sections of the EMPP provided his other restrictions were respected.\n[9] On May 27, 2003, the EMPP was experiencing a period of low mail volume. As a result, there was no work for Mr. St. John and other employees in his section to perform; there was however, work to be done in other parts of the plant. A search was undertaken to find work in the EMPP that was within Mr. St. John's restrictions. None was found.\n[10] Therefore, at approximately 1:15 p.m., Mr. St. John and four other individuals, all of whom were disabled, were sent home from work. Canada Post management informed the employees that they were being sent home because although there was work to be done in the plant, there was no work that they were capable of doing, given their restrictions. In order to protect the employees from a loss of earnings as a result of being sent home, their sick leave credits were utilized.\n[11] On June 13, 2003, the union grieved the matter. The grievance was later settled. The employees' sick leave credits were reimbursed.\n[12] Mr. St. John filed the present human rights complaint on June 20, 2003, because he believed that there were outstanding issues that had not been dealt with through the grievance procedure. Specifically, he believed that Canada Post had not changed its practice of sending disabled employees home when there was no work within their restrictions during periods of low mail volume at the EMPP. It is Mr. St. John's view that this practice is discriminatory and he is requesting that the Tribunal issue an order requiring Canada Post to change the practice.\nA. Low Mail Volume at the EMPP [13] Ms. Darlene Swabb, the manager of the Communications Value Stream at the time of the events in this complaint, stated that there are times, primarily in the summer months, when the mail volume in some parts of the EMPP will drop.\n[14] Ms. Swabb stated that when the mail volume is low at the EMPP, Canada Post offers incentives to all employees to reduce the staff compliment that day. Above compliment vacation leave or leave without pay are offered. Once it is determined how many employees are willing to take leave and how many employees wish to remain, Canada Post reassesses the work situation and determines how to re-deploy personnel throughout the plant so that productive work can be found for all the remaining employees.\n[15] It is at that point that Canada Post may decide to loan or re-assign employees from one part of the plant where there is no work to another part of the plant and even to the mail depots in the Edmonton area if there is more work to be done there.\n[16] Article 14.19 of the Collective Agreement between the CUPW and Canada Post permits Canada Post to re-assign workers to duties in other parts of the plant when work is not available in their area. Ms. Swabb testified that the re-assignment or loaning of employees to other sections is a way of ensuring that Canada Post employees are engaged in productive work even when mail volume is low.\n[17] Ms. Swabb stated that if mail volumes become low half way through a shift, Canada Post will sometimes transport the workers to another facility. But within an hour or two of the end of the employees' shift it is usually not worth it to transport them to another facility given the cost of transportation and the time involved in explaining the safety procedures and duties. Ms. Swabb stated that it is a judgment call as to whether it makes sense to send workers to another facility to work.\n[18] Canada Post's ability to loan employees from one part of the plant to another is subject to a general prohibition against backfilling. Backfilling occurs when an employee is moved out of his or her assigned duties and is replaced by another employee. For example, if employee A, who has been assigned to sort letter mail, is moved to another section to operate a coding machine, and employee B is assigned to employee A's sortation duties, then backfilling has occurred. Loaning or reassigning employees pursuant to Article 14.19 is different from backfilling in that another worker is not assigned to do the work that was being done by the reassigned employee. Indeed, there is no reason to do so because employees are only loaned to other sections when there is no work to be done in their own section, that is, the service requirements in that section have been met.\n[19] Ms. Swabb testified that the Corporation is not permitted to backfill because it violates the seniority provisions of the collective agreement. Employees use their seniority rights to bid on a particular section and schedule. Ms. Swabb stated that the arbitral jurisprudence has established that an employee's bid cannot be modified on the unilateral initiative of Canada Post to backfill a position.\nB. CPC's Practice Regarding the Reassignment of Work to Disabled Employees during Periods of Low Mail Volume [20] In re-assigning work to employees during low mail volume periods, Canada Post must observe the restrictions that have been set out in regard to disabled employees. Disabled employees cannot be asked to do work that is not within their restrictions. Therefore, Canada Post has developed a practice regarding the accommodation of disabled employees when mail volume is low.\n[21] Ms. Swabb testified about the practice that was followed in the EMPP in May of 2003. She stated that although it is not written down anywhere, she did have occasion to document the practice in an electronic mail exchange that she had with Mr. John Cherry, a human resource officer with Canada Post. In that e-mail, dated June 29, 2005, Ms. Swabb indicated that the process that was followed in May of 2003 was a combination of current contractual obligations, operational requirements and her understanding of the requirements of the duty to accommodate. In the e-mail, she stated:\nAll employees who fall under the Duty to Accommodate umbrella are discussed with the Local Union. The operation is tasked to ensure that the employees are productive during the course of their day. The following are the steps in which we follow during low mail volume periods:\na) Work Section A is low or has no mail volume to process.\nb) Supervisor reviews other sections to see if there is a requirement for more employees to complete the work in that particular section.\nc) Employees are loaned to other sections as long as there is extra work to complete and the work requirements are within the employee's physical restrictions.\nd) We cannot move employees from section B to section C and backfill their job in section B with another employee as this process does not follow contractual obligations.\ne) If other sections have work and fit the employee's physical restrictions, but do not require extra staff to complete the work by shift end, then above complement vacation leave and leave without pay is offered to employees throughout the facility, including Section A, in an attempt to provide work the employees from Section A.\nf) When employees accept the extra vacation leave or leave without pay, employees are then loaned into the sections, within their restrictions, where there is work.\ng) I never encountered a scenario where there is no work in the plant for employees that do not have physical restrictions. The plant provides both light, medium, and heavy physical duties.\nh) If the available work is outside the physical restrictions of the modified or PPD employee, then the duty to accommodate is no longer available and the employee is sent home to utilize their sick leave benefits. This is no different as when the employee gets initially injured and no work is available at that time, as a result, they stay at home on sick leave or disability insurance until the Corporation has work for accommodation.\n[sic throughout]\n[22] The e-mail correspondence also noted that the union is notified before a modified\/PPD employee is sent home when no work is available within his or her restrictions. The union then, at times, will review the plant status and provide options if any are available.\n[23] Ms. Swabb also stated that Medisys, the occupational health and safety consultant for Canada Post, prepares a report outlining the restrictions for each employee who is on modified duties or has been determined to have permanent partial disabilities. A copy of this report is in the employee's personal file and all supervisors have access to this file.\n[24] At the hearing, Ms. Swabb confirmed that the practice as outlined above is the one that was followed in May of 2003. Ms. Swabb testified, however, that Canada Post's official policy regarding the accommodation of permanently partially disabled employees, which is found in the Corporate Manual System, prevails over point d in the above-cited e-mail correspondence. She testified that the Policy indicates that the rules and provisions of the collective agreement may be disregarded in order to find suitable accommodation for the employee when the Corporation is otherwise unable to accommodate a disabled employee. This means that backfilling is, in fact, permitted if necessary in order to find work for a disabled employee to do during times of low mail volume.\n[25] Therefore, Ms. Swabb clearly indicated that the practice that was followed in May 2003, was not in accordance with the official accommodation policy. Ms. Swabb stated that in order to remedy this situation, Canada Post's current practice is to backfill a position if necessary in order to accommodate a disabled employee.\n[26] However, in May 2003, Mr. Ken Sagan, who was Mr. St. John's supervisor at the time, followed the practice which did not allow for backfilling. As a result, Mr. Sagan did not identify certain job duties that Mr. St. John was capable of performing on May 27, 2003. Had Mr. Sagan understood that he was permitted to backfill positions if necessary to make work available for Mr. St. John and the other disabled employees, he would have been able to assign Mr. St. John to duties in the mechanized section of the Communication Value Stream at the EMPP. There was work available in the mechanized section that was within Mr. St. John's restrictions which was being performed by non-disabled employees. This work could have been reassigned to Mr. St. John and the other employees reassigned to work elsewhere in the plant. Mr. St. John then would not have been sent home and his sick leave credits would not have been utilized.\nC. The No Lay-Off Rule [27] Ms. Swabb stated that low mail volume is fairly common at the EMPP. In contrast, it is rare that the EMPP will run out of work altogether for the employees to do. When there is no work at all for employees to perform at the EMPP or in the depots, or it is not cost effective to transport the employees to a facility where there is work, the rule is that Canada Post is not permitted to lay employees off; it must pay them even if there is no work for them to perform.\n[28] The witnesses in this case disagreed as to whether it was Article 53 or 14.02 of the collective agreement, or a combination of both that prevented Canada Post from laying off employees when there was no work in the plant for them to perform. Interestingly, there would appear to be no provision in the collective agreement that explicitly sets out Canada Post's commitment that it will not lay employees off when there is no work for them to do.\n[29] Article 53.01 of the collective agreement between CUPW and Canada Post provides that there shall be no lay-off of any regular employee, provided the employee agrees to be displaced to another position in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 53. Several witnesses testified that this provision of the collective agreement does not apply to temporary no-work situations; rather, it applies when there is a permanent lack of work and one or more positions must be eliminated.\n[30] Article 14.02 of the collective agreement provides that the normal work week for full-time employees is forty hours, eight hours per day, five days per week. This article does not, however, guarantee that an employee will work the full forty hours, or that he or she will be paid forty hours a week, for fifty-two weeks a year. Mr. Darren Steinhoff, union representative for the Prairie Region of CUPW, testified that if, for example, an employee took leave without pay, he or she would not be entitled to insist, pursuant to Article 14.02, that Canada Post must pay his or her regular wages.\n[31] Although there was disagreement as to the source of the no lay-off rule in the collective agreement, all of the witnesses, whether testifying on behalf of the Commission or the Respondent, stated that when there is no work to be done whatsoever in the EMPP or in the depots in the Edmonton area, the rule is clear that Canada Post is not permitted to lay employees off. They must be paid their regular wages until more mail appears, other work is found for them to do, or their shifts end.\n[32] The evidence presented was also clear that in no-work situations, employees, whether disabled or not, are not required to take sick leave, vacation leave or leave without pay. They are all paid their regular wages.\n[33] Mr. Gord Fisher, the Regional Grievance officer for the Prairie Region of CUPW, testifying on behalf of the Commission, also stated that in return for Canada Post's commitment to pay employees even when there is no work for them to do, employees must remain on the premises if required to do so by Canada Post. Mr. Fisher testified that when he is asked by employees why they can't go home when there is no work to do, he responds by saying that they are being paid for eight hours of work. Therefore, they are required to be at the workplace and remain ready to work if the work becomes available.\nD. The Practice Regarding Use of Leave Provisions in the Collective Agreement [34] Ms. Swabb testified that apart from low mail volume situations such as the one that prevailed on May 27, 2003, employees who are sick or otherwise incapacitated are always given the option of using leave without pay, sick leave credits or vacation time or any other applicable form of leave available under the collective agreement.\n[35] Paragraph (h) of the practice outlined above does not provide for such a choice to be offered to employees who are being sent home during times of low mail volume. It simply states that employees who are sent home will utilize their sick leave credits or will apply for disability insurance.\n[36] Ms. Swabb stated that she did not know whether Mr. St. John had been given a choice of leave options before he was sent home, but she thought maybe not. She stated, however, that if Mr. St. John had asked to access his vacation leave or leave without pay, she would have permitted this, just as she does with other employees who are unable to work.\nIII. ANALYSIS [37] Section 10(a) of the Act makes it a discriminatory practice to establish or pursue a policy or practice that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[38] Section 10(b) is different from s. 10(a) in that it makes it a discriminatory practice to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[39] There is no evidence that Canada Post struck an agreement with the union or anyone else regarding the practice of sending home employees who had PPD's when there was no work for them to do within their restrictions. Therefore, it is section 10(a) of the Act that applies in this case.\n[40] In human rights cases before this Tribunal, the complainant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28 (O'Malley) provides the basic guidance for what is required to make out a prima facie case. The Court stated that a prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997), 139 F\/T.R. 37 at para. 6).\n[41] The onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation that demonstrates either that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory (Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) 2005 FCA 154 at para. 26). If a reasonable explanation is provided by the respondent, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No.1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[42] Conduct may be found to be non-discriminatory if, in accordance with s. 15(1)(a) of the Act, it is established that it is based on a bona fide occupational requirement. Section 15(2) of the Act stipulates that for the practice to be considered a bona fide occupational requirement, it must be established that accommodation of the individual would impose undue hardship considering health, safety and cost.\nA. What was the practice that allegedly violated s. 10(a) of the Act? [43] The evidence established that when mail volume was low in the EMPP in May of 2003, Canada Post followed the practice described by Ms. Swabb in her e-mail correspondence with Mr. John Cherry. If there was no work for employees within a particular section of the plant, an investigation was undertaken to determine if employees were needed in other sections of the plant to complete the work there. This investigation also involved an examination of whether there was work to be done that was within the disabled employees' restrictions. If extra employees were needed in other sections, then the employees would be loaned to those sections. Provided the work was within the disabled employees' restrictions, they were also loaned to other sections. If other sections had work that fit the disabled employee's restrictions, but extra staff was not required to do the work, then above-compliment vacation leave or leave without pay was offered to all employees in the plant in order to make the work available.\n[44] However, Canada Post would not backfill positions in order to make work available for disabled employees at the EMPP. That is, Canada Post would not re-assign employees in a section that had work to other duties within the plant in order to make their work available to disabled employees.\n[45] If, after an otherwise full investigation of all of the options for re-assignment of disabled employees, it was determined that there was no productive work within the disabled employee's restrictions, he or she was sent home on sick leave.\nB. The Allegations [46] The Commission and the Complainant allege that the practice as set out above denies or tends to deny Mr. St. John and other disabled employees the following employment opportunities:\nthe opportunity to perform work duties that were within their restrictions and to be paid regular wages for that work; access to the no lay-off rule which provides that even when there is no work to be done, employees will be paid their regular wages; and, the choice of the leave provisions they wished to utilize upon being sent home.\n[47] Before dealing with each of the above-noted allegations, I note that the issue of what is meant by the term employment opportunity was not argued by the parties. In Mossop v. Canada (Attorney General) [1991] 1 F.C. 18, aff'd on other grounds: [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554, Mr. Justice Marceau of the Federal Court of Appeal stated, in obiter, that the Tribunal should not neglect the analysis of whether the particular employment benefit which has allegedly been denied constitutes an employment opportunity within the meaning of s. 10(a) of the Act. None of the parties addressed the question of whether the above-noted allegations involved an employment opportunity within the meaning of s. 10(a).\n[48] In my view, a legitimate question could be raised about the ambit of this aspect of s. 10 (see: Mossop, supra; Hay v. Cameco [1991] C.H.R.D. No. 5 No. T.D. 5\/91; Cramm v. Canadian National Railway (1998), T.D. 5\/98 at paras. 30-35, aff'd on other grounds: (2000), 192 F.T.R. 83 (T.D.); Stevenson v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1984] 2 F.C. 691 at p. 721-722). However, given that this issue was not canvassed by the parties, it would not be appropriate for me to analyze the question of whether the above-noted allegations were employment opportunities within the meaning of s. 10(a). The Tribunal cannot deal with matters that were never placed before it, and that were not debated by the parties (see Bergeron v. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e., 2005 FC 879 at para. 63; Beauregard v. Canada Post, 2005 FC 1384 at paras. 26-27). Therefore, for the purposes of this decision, I will proceed on the assumption that the opportunities that were allegedly denied the Complainant were employment opportunities within the meaning of s. 10(a).\n(i) The Opportunity to Perform Work and to Be Paid Regular Wages [49] The evidence established that on May 27, 2003, there was productive work that Mr. St. John was capable of performing that had been assigned to non-disabled employees. Mr. St. John was forbidden from performing this work due to Canada Post's blanket prohibition against backfilling. The no backfilling rule prevented Canada Post from identifying and assigning work to Mr. St. John. Therefore, Mr. St. John was denied the opportunity to complete his shift and to be paid his regular wages. The Respondent's denial of this opportunity was based on the fact that Mr. St. John is disabled.\n[50] I find, therefore, that the Commission and Mr. St. John have established a prima facie case that when Canada Post sent Mr. St. John and four other disabled workers home early from their shift on May 27, 2003, in accordance with the practice of refusing to backfill positions, Canada Post was engaging in a practice that denied disabled employees an employment opportunity.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[51] Canada Post did not offer any reasonable explanation for its prima facie discriminatory practice. Moreover, Canada Post did not attempt to justify its practice as a bona fide occupational requirement under s. 15(1)(a). On the contrary, counsel for Canada Post conceded that, to the extent that the practice in May of 2003 contained a blanket prohibition on backfilling, it failed to allow for the accommodation of disabled workers to the point of undue hardship. In view of the fact that Canada Post's practice in May 2003 precluded any investigation whatsoever of backfilling a position in the appropriate circumstances, it effectively blocked a viable option for accommodating Mr. St. John's disabilities. To that extent, counsel for Canada Post stated in closing argument, the practice at the time was discriminatory.\n[52] Given the Respondent's failure to present a reasonable explanation, or establish a justificatory defence under the Canadian Human Rights Act, I find that the Commission and Mr. St. John have established that the practice of refusing to consider backfilling in order to find appropriate work for disabled employees denied Mr. St. John an employment opportunity on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(ii) Denial of Access to the No Lay-off Rule [53] Mr. St. John and the Commission argued that the practice of sending disabled workers home when there was no available work within their restrictions was discriminatory not just because it did not allow for the reassignment of disabled workers to work duties within their restrictions, but also because it resulted in the denial of access by disabled employees to Canada Post's no lay-off rule.\n[54] Thus, the Commission took the position that the simple removal of the blanket prohibition against backfilling would not remedy the impugned practice. Rather, the practice of sending disabled workers home when there is no work available within their restrictions must be stopped altogether. In accordance with the no lay-off rule, disabled employees must be permitted to remain at work and collect regular wages when they cannot be accommodated.\n[55] As noted above, the no lay-off rule applies when there is no work available anywhere in the plant or the mail depots, or where there is work in the depots but it would not be cost effective to send plant workers to another facility. In those cases, Canada Post pays employees their regular wages even though they are not performing productive work.\n[56] In the view of the Commission and Mr. St. John, disabled workers for whom no work can be found should be entitled, like able-bodied employees for whom there is no work in the plant, to the benefit of the no lay-off rule. In essence, the argument is that disabled workers who cannot be accommodated are in a comparable position to that of all workers when there is no work at all to be done in the plant. Yet, because of the practice of sending disabled workers home when there is no available work within their restrictions, disabled workers like Mr. St. John are deprived of the benefit of the no lay-off rule. This, it is alleged constitutes a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[57] Canada Post argued that disabled workers who are sent home after an exhaustive search for alternative work within their restrictions are not laid-off and hence, are not denied the benefit of the no lay-off rule. Rather, in situations like the one on May 27, 2003, when mail volume is reduced, there is still work to be done in the plant. The goal then is to find productive work for all employees remaining in the plant. If disabled employees are sent home it is not because there is no work for them; it is because they are not able to do the work that is there to be done. Provided the practice requires that every reasonable effort be made to find alternative work for disabled employees before they are sent home, Canada Post argued, there is no prima facie discrimination.\n[58] For the following reasons, I agree with the Respondent that the Complainant and the Commission have not established a prima facie case of discrimination regarding this allegation.\n[59] The evidence in this case was clear that the rule regarding no lay-offs applies only in cases where there was no work whatsoever to be done in the plant or it was not cost efficient to transport the employees to another facility to do the available work. The evidence indicates that when there is no work to be done at Canada Post, able-bodied and disabled workers alike are paid their wages for the entire shift. Neither group is forced to take vacation time, sick leave, leave without pay or any other kind of leave or benefit to protect their income. Thus, in no-work situations all employees, whether disabled or not, are treated alike.\n[60] However, in situations of low mail volume, a different set of rules applies. Article 14.19 applies. Employees are loaned out to other sections in accordance with their capabilities. The goal of loaning employees in situations of low mail volume is to ensure that all employees who have chosen to remain at work are performing productive work. In doing so, Canada Post must observe the restrictions that have been assigned to disabled employees. They cannot be asked to do work that is not within their restrictions. This is when the practice, as outlined above, comes into play.\n[61] If, after a thorough search of the facility and the depots, it is determined that there is no work that the disabled employees are capable of doing, they are sent home. The work is there, but it is not within the disabled employees' restrictions. They are not deprived of the benefit of the no lay-off rule because that rule does not apply in situations where there is work to be done in other areas of the plant or the depots. When there is work to be done, no one is given the benefit of the no lay-off rule (including the Complainant); when there is no work to be done in the EMPP or the depots, everybody is given the benefit of the no lay-off rule (including the Complainant). Therefore, in low mail volume situations disabled employees are not deprived of access to the no lay-off rule on the basis of their disabilities, but rather on the basis of the fact that the EMPP is not in a no work situation.\n[62] The Commission and the Complainant argued however, that the no lay-off rule should apply to disabled workers in low mail volume situations since their disabilities have effectively put them in a no-work situation. It is only because they are disabled that the employees are unable to perform the existing work. Therefore, the refusal to apply the no lay-off rule to disabled employees in low mail volume situations is discriminatory since it deprives them of a mechanism that is available under the collective agreement to ensure that when there is no work, employees will be paid nonetheless.\n[63] When this argument is examined more closely, however, it becomes clear that it is not so much the denial of access to the no lay-off rule that is at the root of the complaint. Rather, the real source of the complaint is the Complainant's unequal earning power in a low mail volume situation. The argument then is that the inequality of earning power between disabled employees and non-disabled employees in a low mail volume situation is, in itself, discriminatory.\n[64] With respect, this argument is not based on an accurate interpretation of the rights and obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 10(a), which makes it discriminatory practice to pursue a practice that denies employment opportunities on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, must be interpreted in the light of the general purpose of the Act. Section 2 states that the purpose of the Act is to give effect to the principle that all individuals should have an equal opportunity to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society.\n[65] The Act therefore, does not aim to create equality of results, or economic equality, nor does it grant individuals the right to receive wages. Rather, it ensures an equal opportunity for all individuals to participate on an equal footing with other workers in the workplace.\n[66] There is, therefore, no general obligation on employers to compensate disabled employees who are not providing services (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Human Rights Tribunal) (Dumont-Ferlatte) (1997), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/100 (F.C.T.D.); Cramm v. Canadian National Railway (1998), T.D. 5\/98, aff'd (2000), 192 F.T.R. 83 (T.D.), Orillia Nurses' Association v. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 692 (C.A.) at para 27). In Cramm, the Review Panel observed that if this were not the case, employees who are away from work because of illness or injury would be entitled to be fully indemnified by their employers for the period they were away, however, long that might be, in order to ensure that they were treated no differently than other employees. The Review Panel stated that this would clearly be an untenable result.\n[67] Thus, assuming that Canada Post has been diligent in looking for available work, the inequality in earning power that might arise between disabled employees and non-disabled employees in low mail volume situations is not discriminatory. Disabled employees have been given an equal opportunity commensurate with their abilities to fulfill their workplace duties and obligations. If the inequality of earning power experienced in a low mail volume situations is not in itself discriminatory, then Canada Post's refusal to top up disabled employees' wages by means of the no lay-off rule in order to eliminate the inequality of earning power cannot be discriminatory.\n[68] For all of these reasons, I find that Mr. St. John and the Commission have failed to establish a prima facie case that the practice of denying disabled employees the benefit of the no lay-off rule when an exhaustive search reveals that there is no work that they can perform is discriminatory.\n(iii) Choice of Leave Provisions [69] The Commission and Mr. St. John alleged that the impugned practice denies disabled employees the same choice that is provided to other employees who are unable to work due to incapacity, that is, the choice of which leave provision in the collective agreement they wish to access.\n[70] On behalf of the Commission, Mr. Darren Steinhoff testified that employees who are incapable of working are normally given a choice as to whether they wish to take paid sick leave, sick leave without pay, leave without pay or vacation leave. Mr. St. John testified that he was not given this choice when he was sent home on May 27, 2003.\n[71] The practice, as it was articulated in the electronic mail exchange that Ms. Swabb had with Mr. Cherry, stated:\nIf the available work is outside the physical restrictions of the modified or PPD employee, then the duty to accommodate is no longer available and the employee is sent home to utilize their sick leave benefits. This is no different as when the employee gets initially injured and no work is available at that time, as a result, they stay at home on sick leave or disability insurance until the Corporation has work for accommodation. (emphasis added)\n[72] The practice as set out above, does not contemplate offering employees different leave choices.\n[73] Mr. St. John testified that on May 27, 2003, he was asked to fill out an application for sick leave, but he refused. Despite his refusal, Canada Post accessed his sick leave account and deducted the appropriate number of credits directly from his account.\n[74] Mr. St. John further testified that before he was told that he was going to be sent home, all employees in the plant were given the option of taking leave without pay or vacation leave as part of the general practice when mail volume was low. Mr. St. John stated that whenever such options were presented he refused them because he is a single father and needs the income more than the time off. He also stated that he would not take vacation leave because he uses this leave as a way to manage his stress levels so that his bipolar mood disorder does not flare up.\n[75] Mr. St. John argued, however, that when Canada Post told him that he was going to be sent home, he should have been provided with another opportunity to decide which kind of leave he wished to use, since at that point he knew that the option of receiving regular wages was off the table.\n[76] Mr. St. John testified that maintaining control over his sick leave credits and deciding when he will use them is particularly important to him. The nature of his disability is such that he requires hospitalization from time to time for periods of up to a month at a time. Therefore, he needs to save his sick leave credits so that he has enough to cover these periods of hospitalization. He worries that when Canada Post dips into his credits in order to cover periods when there is no work that he can perform at the EMPP, he may not have enough to cover his hospital stays.\n[77] The practice in May of 2003 of automatically deducting sick leave credits when an employee was sent home denied Mr. St. John the choice of leave options that was provided to other employees who were unable to work for any reason. This practice had an adverse effect on Mr. St. John's ability to deal with his disability. Therefore, I find that Mr. St. John and the Commission have established a prima facie case that the practice with regard to the choice of leave options deprived or tended to deprive Mr. St. John of an employment opportunity.\nThe Respondent's Explanation\n[78] Again, to his credit, counsel for Canada Post conceded that there was no reasonable explanation for failing to offer the choice of leave options to disabled workers who are sent home. He stated that these workers should probably be offered the same choice that is offered to all employees who, because of incapacity are unable to perform productive work.\n[79] Ms. Swabb testified that the practice in May 2003 was based on the assumption that if the employees were unable to work, they should be placed on sick leave. She stated that this was because it was thought that use of sick leave credits was the most expedient way of providing income protection for employees like Mr. St. John.\n[80] Ms. Swabb stated that Canada Post did not consider whether use of the employees' sick leave credits on their behalf might have a negative impact on their ability to manage their disabilities, as in the case of Mr. St. John.\n[81] In view of the fact that Canada Post has not provided a reasonable explanation or justification for refusing to offer a choice of leave to employees who are sent home, I find that the Complainant and the Commission have succeeded in establishing that, to the extent that it does not allow for a choice of leave options, the practice deprived Mr. St. John of an employment opportunity on the basis of his disability.\nIV. REMEDY [82] As a result of the settlement of the section 7 component of the complaint, Mr. St. John withdrew his request for individual remedies under sections 53(2)(e) and 53(3). The Commission requested, however, that the Tribunal issue an order pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) that Canada Post cease the practice of sending disabled workers home as it was described by Ms. Swabb in the hearing and documented in the electronic mail message from her to Mr. Cherry.\n[83] For the reasons provided above, I find that the order requested by the Commission is not appropriate. I have found that the practice was discriminatory only to the extent that it contained a blanket prohibition on backfilling and did not offer employees who were sent home a choice of leave options.\n[84] Therefore, in my view the following order is most appropriate in the circumstances:\nCanada Post is ordered to cease the application of the blanket prohibition against backfilling that formed part of the practice in May 2003; Canada Post is further ordered to offer the same leave options to employees for whom alternative work cannot be found as is offered to other employees who are sent home for reason of incapacity.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] On October 13, 2004, Richard Warman (the Complainant) filed a complaint under section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against Terry Tremaine (the Respondent). The Complainant alleges that the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of religion, national or ethnic origin, race and colour, in a matter related to the usage of a telecommunication undertaking.\n[2] The Commission fully participated at the hearing into the complaint and was represented by legal counsel. The Respondent also participated at the hearing.\nII. PRELIMINARY ISSUES A. Motion of the Commission to have the Respondent's representative excluded [3] On the first day of the hearing, the Commission filed a motion requesting an order prohibiting Mr. Paul Fromm from appearing before the Tribunal as an agent for a period of at least three years, or in the alternative, an order prohibiting Mr. Fromm from appearing in this proceeding as an agent for the Respondent.\n[4] The Commission argued that the Order should be granted because of comments Mr. Fromm made about the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal), and the Canadian judicial system. According to the Commission, these comments are contemptuous. It further argued that the presence of Mr. Fromm before the Tribunal would compromise the integrity, fairness and efficiency of the hearing. The Commission added that Mr. Fromm's participation would hinder rather than facilitate the process.\n(i) Background for the motion [5] At a case management conference, held on March 10, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that he would be representing himself during the proceedings. Then, on May 16, 2006, in his written particulars, he requested permission to have Paul Fromm appear as his representative. He further requested that they both be allowed to cross-examine the Complainant and the witnesses of the Commission and of the Complainant.\n[6] The Commission opposed this request on various grounds. It referred to the fact that the Complainant and the Respondent are currently involved in a civil litigation. It also made reference to various postings on the internet by Mr. Fromm in which he strongly criticized the Tribunal, its members, members of the judiciary and the Commission.\n[7] According to the Commission's evidence, which was not challenged, Mr. Fromm has made contemptuous comments directed at the Canadian judicial system, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, members of the Tribunal and towards the Commission. He has described the Tribunal as a Soviet style kangaroo court and its decisions as Stalinist lunacy. He has also stated that the Tribunal's decisions in hate speech cases are leading Canada to become a Third World banana republic.\n[8] Mr. Fromm has appeared in other cases before the Tribunal as representative of other Respondents.\n(ii) The issues on this preliminary motion [9] The issues on this preliminary motion are as follows:\nDoes the Tribunal have jurisdiction to prohibit a person from appearing before it as an agent for a party?\nShould the Tribunal exercise its discretion to prohibit Mr. Fromm from appearing before it?\nShould the Tribunal exercise its discretion to issue a general order of prohibition against the participation of Mr. Fromm as agent in all Tribunal hearings for three years?\n(iii) Analysis a) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to prohibit a person from appearing before it as an agent for a party? [10] To support its position, the Commission referred to two decisions, one from the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, in Thomas v Assn. of New Brunswick Registered Nursing Assistants (2003), 230 D.L.R. 337 and the Tribunal's decision in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [ 2005] C.H.R.D. No. 31 (QL).\n[11] In the Thomas decision, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal states, at paragraph 10:\nAs stated at the outset, the general rule is that parties appearing before adjudicative tribunals are entitled to representation from an agent of their choosing. But tribunals retain a residual discretion to override this general right, provided the discretion is properly exercised. It is because tribunals are the masters of their own procedure that they retain a right to veto a party's choice of counsel. For this reason, a party to a tribunal proceeding does not have an absolute right to be represented by a person of their choosing, unless the enabling legislation states otherwise.\n[12] In Filgueira, the Tribunal followed the New Brunswick Court of Appeal's decision and added that in cases where complex legal issues are raised the participation of a lay person as a representative may only confuse matters further.\n[13] Subsection 50(1) of the Act provides:\n50. (1) After due notice to the Commission, the Complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations. (The emphasis is mine.)\n50. (1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'originale.)\n[14] Section 48.9 of the Act, is also relevant. It provides, inter alia, that the proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. Generally speaking, representation by non-lawyers is consistent with this purpose which is to facilitate access to the Tribunal and decrease the need for formalities. This section must however be read in conjunction with section 50 in order to determine who can act for a party in a proceeding before the Tribunal.\n[15] Section 50, by recognizing a statutory right to be represented by counsel, eliminates any question whether a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal has the right to retain counsel. What the section does not tell us is whether the right to counsel excludes the right to lay representation. In the French version the word used for counsel is avocat which clearly refers to legal counsel. The French word avocat reinforces and indeed restricts the ordinary meaning of the English term counsel. Taking into consideration the French expression, one could conclude that the word counsel, in the English version, refers to a lawyer.\n[16] This conclusion does not mean that a lay-person cannot appear as an agent before the Tribunal. In Re Men's Clothing Manufacturer's Association et al and Arthurs et al (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 20 (H.C.J.) and again in Thomas v. Association of New Brunswick Registered Nurses Assistants, supra, the courts have recognized that there is a common law right to be represented by an agent, quite distinct from any statutory right to counsel. The fact that the Act expressly allows for legal representation by lawyers does not support the inference that the right to lay representation is not allowed. Section 50 of the Act should not be read as restricting or prohibiting any party from attending the hearing with a representative of his or her choice. In the interest of respecting the purpose of section 48.9, parties should be allowed to be represented by a lay-person, even though that person may not be legally trained or qualified. I agree with the comments of Judge Robertson, of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, in the Thomas case when he stated, at paragraph 19 of the decision: Accordingly, the courts have generally been reluctant to construe statutory directions providing for representation by counsel to exclude persons who are not lawyers.\n[17] Just as section 50 of the Act does not abrogate a party's right to appear with a non-lawyer, neither does any section of the Act abrogate the right of the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to exclude non-jurists. Following the purpose set out in section 48.9, the participation of an agent or representative must be consistent with the proper functioning of the Tribunal and not be an impediment. It is also important to reiterate that an agent appears only with the permission of the Tribunal.\n[18] This is the approach which was taken by the Tribunal in Beaudet -Fortin v. Canada Post Corporation, 2004 CHRT 23. In that case the Tribunal allowed the Complainant to be represented by an individual who was not a lawyer. The Tribunal stated that it was reluctant to deny less financially fortunate Complainants the opportunity to be represented by a non-jurist who would generally be more affordable. The Tribunal felt that no prejudice would be caused to the Respondent by allowing a non-jurist to represent the Complainant and that this would not be a hindrance to the proper administration of justice.\n[19] In Fry v. Department of National Revenue, interim ruling, Transcript, pp. 23-25, March 9, 1993, the Tribunal allowed a disbarred lawyer to represent a Complainant. The Tribunal ruled that it would limit the individual to presenting evidence that the Canadian Human Rights Commission would not be presenting and to cross-examining witnesses. The individual was not permitted to make representations of fact or law.\n[20] Again in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc, [2005] C.H.R.D. No. 31, the Tribunal accepted that the Complainant be represented by an agent. The Tribunal added that the Complainant had an obligation to satisfy the Tribunal, if the Tribunal deemed it necessary, that the agent was in a position to facilitate the process.\n[21] There are also other examples where the Tribunal allowed non-jurists to represent parties. In the recent case of Warman v. Harrison 2006 CHRT 30, Mr. Harrison, the Respondent in that case, was allowed to be represented by his common law wife, who was not a lawyer.\n[22] In summary, a person appearing before the Tribunal possesses the right to be represented by an agent of their choosing. But this right is not absolute. The Tribunal retains a residual discretion to limit participation to those persons the Tribunal believes will facilitate, rather than hinder, the adjudicative process. In exercising that discretion the Tribunal is required to justify its decision. The Tribunal should exclude non-lawyers when it is convinced that their participation is likely to hamper, rather than facilitate, the hearing process. (Thomas v. Association of New Brunswick Registered Nurses Assistants, supra, at para. 25).\n[23] The answer to the first question is therefore yes, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to allow or to prohibit a person to act as an agent for a party.\nb) Should the Tribunal exercise its discretion and prohibit Mr. Fromm from appearing before it? [24] The Commission suggested three reasons why the Tribunal should exercise its discretion and prohibit Mr. Fromm from appearing before it. First, it suggested that he had clearly demonstrated a blatant disrespect for the law. Secondly, that his participation would hinder, rather than facilitate the adjudication. Finally, it referred to the acrimonious relationship between Mr. Fromm and the Complainant which creates a conflict of interest that would hinder the Tribunal's process.\n[25] I will deal first with the second and third reasons given by the Commission. Regarding the third reason, although I agree that the relationship between Mr. Fromm and the Complainant is acrimonious, I fail to see how this could be a justification to exclude Mr. Fromm from appearing as agent for the Respondent. The Tribunal is well capable of dealing with any issues that may arise from the hostile relationship that the parties and their agent might have towards each other. The Tribunal also notes that neither the Commission, nor the Complainant explained exactly what conflict of interest would be created and for whom.\n[26] Regarding the second issue, whether the participation of Mr. Fromm would hinder, rather than facilitate the hearing, no evidence was presented to support this allegation. The Tribunal cannot make a decision on insinuations or allegations which are not supported by facts.\n[27] Finally, the last reason given by the Commission to support its request for the exclusion of Mr. Fromm is more compelling although it will not be enough to convince the Tribunal to grant the order sought. There is no question, from a review of the evidence presented, that in many of his writings, Mr. Fromm has shown a blatant disrespect for the Tribunal and its members. He has also on many occasions manifested disrespectful views towards the Canadian judiciary. The Tribunal is of the opinion that these matters would be better dealt with in another forum and as long as Mr. Fromm accepts the procedure and authority of the Tribunal and acts in a respectful manner towards it, there is no reason to exclude him from acting as a representative in these proceedings.\n[28] The Commission's motion that the Tribunal exercise its discretion to prohibit Mr. Fromm from appearing before it in these proceedings is denied.\n[29] Because of this decision there is no need to deal with the third issue in which the Commission is seeking an order preventing Mr. Fromm from appearing before it as a representative for a period of three years. The Tribunal wishes to make one comment on the procedure used by the Commission to bring this motion forward. The Commission failed to notify Mr. Fromm personally of its intention, although the order sought would directly affect him. This omission alone would have been sufficient to reject the motion or to adjourn the hearing with leave to regularize service.\nB. The post-referral evidence [30] During the proceedings, the Respondent took objection to the fact that the evidence submitted at the hearing referred to postings which were not included specifically in the complaint. The same issue was raised in Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20. In that decision, the Respondent had not raised any objections to the introduction of post-referral evidence by the Commission during the hearing, but had argued in its final submissions that the Tribunal could not consider this evidence since it essentially constituted the basis for a new complaint.\n[31] In Winnicki, the Tribunal rejected this argument. Firstly, the Tribunal referred to the fact that a motion to amend the s. 13(1) complaint had been granted on the basis of the post-referral evidence. In deciding that an amendment to the original complaint was appropriate, the issue whether the new allegations constituted the basis for a new complaint was conclusively determined, therefore it could not be argued that the post-referral evidence relating to those allegations could only be presented in support of a new complaint. In the present case, neither the Commission, nor the Complainant filed a motion to have the complaint amended.\n[32] Although no motion was filed or granted, the Tribunal is of the view that the post-referral evidence in this case could be considered. The evidence goes directly to the issue before the Tribunal of whether the Respondent was engaging in an ongoing violation of section 13(1) of the Act. Even if the complaint form does not specifically include the words and ongoing, as was the case in Winnicki and in LeBlanc v. Canada Post Corporation (1992), 18 CHRR D\/57, it did contemplate the possibility that additional evidence would be submitted. In his complaint, the Complainant mentions that the two postings which were listed constituted samples of the evidence which would accompany the complaint. In the Leblanc ruling, the Tribunal properly set out that in such a situation, the essential question is whether it would be fair to admit the evidence. If there is no evidence of surprise and the Respondent is aware that this evidence relates to matters such as the one submitted in the complaint, then it would be difficult to argue that the admission of this post-referral evidence will cause him prejudice.\n[33] In the present case, there is no evidence that the Respondent was caught by surprise by the introduction of the evidence. The evidence was disclosed to the Respondent prior to the hearing and he admitted that he was the author of these postings. These postings are sufficiently similar to the allegations in the complaint, such that it does not effectively constitute a new or separate complaint. The Tribunal therefore rules that the post-referral evidence was properly admitted.\nIII. THE FACTS RELATING TO THE COMPLAINT [34] For many years, the Complainant has been monitoring activities of what he describes as White Supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, both in Canada and internationally. By white supremacist, he refers to people or groups who assume that there is some inferiority within the races that are traditionally referred to as non-white or non-Aryan. When he uses the term neo-Nazi, he refers to groups or individuals who share similar beliefs as those of the National-Socialist Regime of Germany during the World War II era.\n[35] From 2002 to 2004, the Complainant was employed by the Commission as a Human Rights Officer. His duties would involve the investigation of human rights complaints. He specified that his duties at the Commission were explicitly separate from the investigation he was then conducting on internet hate files. During his cross-examination he admitted that given that he had been employed by the Commission during the relevant time of this complaint, he would probably have been monitoring the activities of the Respondent during this period but he added that it was on his own time.\n[36] The Complainant explained that for a number of years he has been monitoring the Canadian postings on a U.S. website called stormfront.org, which he qualified as white supremacist. This website provides forums where people can communicate and exchange ideas about issues relating to white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology. This website is readily accessible to the public. Anybody that has access to the Internet can log on to this site and read the messages posted, although posting is reserved to members.\n[37] The Stormfront website is organised in the form of a pyramid. There is a forum where the user can have access to different categories of subject matter. When the user clicks on one of the subjects, a thread appears allowing the user to read and the members to participate in the discussion about the chosen topic. The nature of the postings and their content vary enormously on these threads.\n[38] During his monitoring of this website, the Complainant noticed postings by an individual using the pseudonym mathdoktor99 that began to concern him. He did further research into the nature of that person's postings. Having viewed other postings by the individual using this pseudonym, he said that he was convinced that these were likely to violate section 13 of the Act. He began compiling information with a view to identifying that person and ultimately filing a complaint with the Commission.\n[39] An individual who uses a pseudonym to post on Stormfront will also have to provide a profile to the administrator of the website. The profile of the individual identified as mathdoktor99 provided an email address. It also indicated that this person lived in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and that he was a self-employed programmer\/analyst.\n[40] The Complainant did a Google search of the e-mail address. This search established that the e-mail address of mathdoktor99 was affiliated with an individual named Terry Tremaine. The Respondent does not deny that he had made these postings under the pseudonym mathdoktor99.\n[41] Terry Tremaine holds a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Philosophy and a Master's Degree in Science. He also holds a diploma in Computer Programming Analysis. He held for a period of time a part-time position as lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Saskatchewan and, according to his evidence he has been pursuing a career in information technology as a programmer.\n[42] The Respondent testified that he formed the basis of the ideas found in his postings while studying for his Master's degree, in Montreal, in 1982. After obtaining his Master's degree, he took a teaching position in Red Deer, Alberta. It just so happened that the James Keegstra trial was then proceeding in Red Deer. Mr. Keegstra had been charged under the hate crime laws in force at the time. Mr. Tremaine said that he attended the hearing and saw Mr. Keegstra testify. He added that he was very impressed by what he heard. He further added that this got him thinking about what you might call the Jewish problem.\n[43] After his experience in Alberta, he began doctoral studies in a Canadian university, which he stopped before completing them to accept a teaching position in the Bahamas. While there, he testified that he developed some fairly negative views towards blacks and black culture. He stayed there for two years, then returned to Canada. He testified: By then I was a racialist. He has also described his political beliefs as those of National-Socialism.\n[44] On his return to Canada, he pursued a career in information technology and completed a computer diploma. After having obtained this diploma, he opened up a programming company in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n[45] During this period, around 2001, he became interested in what he described as white nationalism. It is also during this period that he found the Stormfront website. For a while, he was just a reader but, after a couple of months, he decided to become a member of the website and started his postings. At the hearing, he testified that he has posted at least 1,900 messages on this site.\n[46] The Respondent was served with the complaint on April 8, 2005. On April 11, 2005 and again on July 23, 2005, the Complainant wrote to the President of the University of Saskatchewan, the Respondent's employer at the time, providing information regarding the Respondent's activities. On August 4, 2005, the Vice-Provost of the University wrote back to the Complainant informing him that the matter had been investigated by the Human Resources Division of the University and that the position of the Respondent with the University had been terminated on April 30, 2005.\n[47] Following his dismissal from the University, the Respondent moved to the west coast (British Columbia). He said that he then felt frightened and depressed. In September of 2005, he returned to Saskatchewan and admitted himself to the Regina Qu'Appelle psychiatric facility to be treated for depression. While there he wrote, on September 30, 2005, a four page letter to the Commission. In this letter he indicated that his postings on Stormfront were attributable to mental health issues. The letter stated that he ...became delusional and began imagining grand conspiracies behind world events. Part of my delusional thinking was the notion of a `Jewish world conspiracy'. He goes on to add: I emphasize that this was delusional thinking for which I am profoundly ashamed and guilt ridden. Words cannot describe the depth of my shame. I am tormented by it daily. I despise and detest everything I wrote on Stormfront and wish I had never heard of Stormfront. The commission need have no concerns about any future activity on my part on Stormfront or anywhere else.\n[48] He continues: Prior to March 2001, I was a normal decent person without any racist or intolerant attitudes. In 2001 I underwent a destructive personality change that I can now only describe as sick and deranged. That eventually led to my posting on Stormfront. He further adds: In the months since I was confronted with the Human Rights complaint against me the shame and remorse has grown within me to the point where it has become unbearable and resulted in a further mental breakdown.\n[49] He then expresses his remorse and his hope that he will regain his true moral and decent self and concludes with his ...profoundest regret, shame, and remorse to all members of the Jewish community against whom many of my posts were directed. I truly regret to the utmost all that I wrote on Stormfront, especially as it pertains to the Jewish community.\n[50] The Commission never answered this letter and no explanation was given for its failure to do so. The Complainant for his part explained on cross-examination that he could not recall whether he actually saw the letter or whether the Commission had provided him with a summary of its content. He added that he had indicated to the Commission that if the Respondent's letter was sincere that it was of great interest to him. He said that he was essentially willing to negotiate a settlement of the complaint with the precondition that there be a permanent cease and desist order and other appropriate remedies. Nothing resulted from this and there is no evidence of any contact with the Respondent to further discuss the matters raised in the letter.\n[51] During his examination, the Respondent emphatically repudiated the content of this letter and never challenged its admissibility. He referred to a retraction that he posted on Stormfront on February 5, 2006. He further stated that, but for some minor modifications, he now stands by everything he wrote on Stormfront. In the course of his cross-examination the Respondent confirmed his state of mind about his posting on Stormfront and his views about Jews and Blacks. He certainly showed no remorse for these statements and, given the opportunity, he stated that he would enthusiastically repeat them.\n[52] The question of the identity of the author of the postings which form the basis of this complaint as well as the post-complaint postings was not in dispute; the Respondent admits that all these postings are his. The Respondent was a very prolific and prolix author, who in most of his postings camouflaged his ideas under the disguise of academia, using, in many instances, what he purported to be historical references and facts to support his allegations. His postings essentially fall into one of two categories: those that purport to be quasi scholarly articles, and those that constitute direct communications with other participants. The tone of some of these postings, although they did not in any way follow the strict standards of academic writing, could lend an air of legitimacy to their content for a credulous mind.\n[53] The first document submitted in evidence was posted on February 14, 2004, on the Stormfront website. The Respondent was participating in a discussion on a thread entitled A Real Holocaust Coming? He then posted the following: The Jew cannot help being a Jew any more than a rat can help being a rat. He went on to refer to Jews as a parasitic race. He added that no healthy host population can tolerate a parasite feeding on it without eventually rejecting it. Finally, he concluded that no conferences on `anti-Semitism' will help the Jew avoid his long-overdue fate.\n[54] Again on February 17, 2004, he made another posting on a thread entitled Re: A view from the inside (for all anti's). In this posting, the Respondent again refers to Jews as a parasitic race that depends on word weaving, crafty financial dealings, and a total lack of ethics toward non-Jews.\n[55] In a posting dated February 19, 2004, on a thread entitled Your Awakening?, the Respondent explains how he came to espouse the ideas of the White Nationalist Community. He refers to the fact that in the early nineties, he took a teaching job in a Caribbean country:\nI was not a racialist when I moved there but became one while there. Firstly, I discovered that blacks are intellectually inferior to Whites. This was evident everywhere and in all walks of life. I do not mean they were less educated (which they were), I mean they were intellectually inferior at a more fundamental level. In my job I encountered blacks who were well educated on paper but seemed to lack a certain intellectual spark which most, even relatively uneducated whites possess. I also came to see black culture as fundamentally depraved and disgusting. It is only fit for blacks and is certainly not anything a self-respecting white person should associate with or emulate.\n[56] Later in the same posting, talking about an unnamed Jewish author, he refers to him as the weasel Jew author. In his conclusion he affirms Hitler was right about the Jews.\n[57] On March 23, 2004, on a thread which purported to post the political testament of Adolph Hitler, the Respondent, again referring to Jews, wrote: The hatred for that race of parasitic vermin is growing everywhere.\n[58] In another posting, entitled The Greatness of Adolf Hitler, the Respondent wrote on April 9, 2004:\nHitler stood in opposition to international Jewry and Marxism. He regarded Marxism as being the most recent vehicle to secure the long term goal of international Jewry - the destruction of independent nation states. It represented the obliteration of all national and ethnic distinctions and the formation of a worldwide mongrelized proletariat without any ethnic identity or loyalty.\n[...]\nHitler's original intention for the Jews was that they be expelled from Europe voluntarily or involuntarily. The original destination mentioned was Madagascar. [...] Once the war began that became impractical. The only options available were to confine them or allow them to roam free. The latter option was deemed inappropriate since they were regarded as potential enemy combatants, much like the Japanese in North America who were also interned. It cannot be denied that some, perhaps many, Jews were killed deliberately. The exact number may never be determined but that number would almost certainly fall short of the six million figures which has been part of post-war anti German propaganda for over sixty years.\n[59] Referring to the concentration camps used during the Second World War by the Nazis and, in particular, to the infamous Auschwitz camp, he describes it as a labour camp not a death camp and adds that the gas chambers were used to delouse clothing to prevent the spread of typhus - not for the extermination of human beings. He disputes the figures regarding the number of people who died in these camps: We still do not have objective evidence that six million Jews died. The best available evidence is from the Red Cross which indicates that slightly over 400,000 Jews died in the interment(sic) and labour(sic) camps from all causes...\n[60] On another topic, in a thread entitled HIV\/AIDS and Indians in Saskatchewan that the Respondent initiated, referring to the propagation of AIDS within the First Nation population of that province, he wrote on May 2, 2004, Now, I don't really care if AIDS wipes out the whole lot of them. It would make our job easier.\n[61] On July 5, 2004, on a thread entitled Questions from a black man, the Respondent wrote:\nSpeaking for myself only I expect this white nation to comprise most of what is now Canada with most of what is now the US. Non-white immigration would be banned. Non-whites living within our borders would be encouraged to leave or submit to voluntary sterilization. Under such a plan our nation would be 100% White within one generation. It could be accomplished without significant bloodshed if non-whites were willing to co-operate in the endeavour. Blacks could be repatriated to Africa. The foreign aid now being doled out to Israel would instead go towards this repatriation plan. Educated Blacks from America could help Africa get back on its feet (if that is possible). Asians would be sent back to their country of origin. If that were impossible then the sterilization plan would kick in. In no case would a Jew be allowed to remain on our territory. They would be allowed to leave peacefully with whatever goods they could put in a suitcase.\n[62] In responding to a post entitled My feelings on Jews, the Respondent wrote on September 11, 2004:\nYou did not mention their [referring to the Jews] compulsive deceitfulness. Hitler called them the Masters of the Lie and he was right on that. You did not mention their parasitic nature. They despise real work and live only to get money and do not really care how. You did not mention that they gravitate towards all that is disgusting and depraved. You can see this from their art.\n4) You did not mention their involvement in organised crime, drugs, and white slavery.\n5) You did not mention their subversion of all our institutions (mass media, academic, financial, political, judicial, law enforcement) and their subsequent redirection towards Jewish goals.\n6) You did not mention the cancer of Zionism.\nEtc. Etc...\n[63] On a Stormfront thread entitled Did you Know that one million Germans were murdered...after the war, the Respondent contributed this posting on September 12, 2004:\nThe more a person researches the events surrounding WWII (before, during and after) the more one is led to the conclusion that the real holocaust was against the German people and instigated by the Jews. The holohoax story attempts to invert that and portay(sic) the juden as victims of the `evil Nazis'. As time passes we are learning more and more the real truth.\n[64] On September 18, 2004, in a thread he initiated, The `Sacred' Parasite, he again describes the Jews as parasite. On that same day, he also initiated another thread entitled Hanadi Jaradat. According to the Respondent's posting, Hanadi Jaradat was a Palestinian woman who blew herself up in a restaurant in Haifa, Israel, killing and injuring a number of people. Referring to her action the Respondent wrote:\n[...]Her country is occupied by the same parasitic race that controls our formerly White countries. As Dr Pierce used to say: SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH!!. So, she decided to do something about it.\nIt is nearly one year since Hanadi Jaradat struck a blow against ZOG. I know there are WNs who will criticize me for honouring a muslim in this way but I do not honour her as a muslim or arab, as such, but as a dedicated soldier fighting against ZOG. Nor do I suggest we all strap bombs to ourselves and start blowing up Jews. My only intention is to draw attention to her courage and self-sacrifice (literally) and hope for the day when we have a thousand WN [White Nationalist] equally dedicated to destroying our enemy.\n[65] On September 19, 2004, he wrote:\nThe more the Jews try to stamp out anti-semitism the more it will increase. That is guaranteed. It will increase until the Jews themselves realize thay(sic) are the cause of anti-semitism (which will never happen). Just as a healthy body attempts to identify and repell(sic) foreign destructive organisms so too any healthy society will react to the Jew with revulsion and disgust and will desire to have them expelled. The Jews attempt to undermine this healthy response the same way the AIDS virus interferes with the body's rejection of foreign organisms. But for the Jews that will not work. There are too many people aware. We are like the White blood cells in certain people that are immune to the effects of the AIDS virus.\n[66] On that same day, but on another thread, the Respondent posted: As someone (I cannot remember who) once said, when the end of the Jews finally comes they will wish they had the SS there to protect them.\n[67] The Respondent also participated in a thread entitled Re: If it took a police state, which purported to discuss the advantages of establishing a white nation. In one of his many and long postings on this thread, dated September 20, 2004, he stated: NS [National Socialist] policy toward Jews was quite restrained. Hitler was a lot nicer to the Jews than they deserved. His original intention was to simply deport them all. However, nobody wanted them (no surprise there). Later on in another posting he stated in part, in answer to a question asked about whether he would be ready to pay the price of a totalitarian police state for an all white nation: In fact, I would not support it unless it were actively engaged in the expulsion of all Jews from our territory. In another posting on the same subject, in which he was referring to the fracture of our multi-racial countries, he suggested that white nationalists should be ready to seize power by whatever means available. He then added Our people will then be in charge of the existing police state apparatus and will begin the process of cleaning up the mess (expelling the Jews, repatriating the other non-whites, etc.)\n[68] On January 17, 2005, the Respondent posted the following: The Arabs are NOT the new juden. The juden are the juden!! As Dr. Pierce used to say, once we deal with the Jews everything else will just be mopping up. The last posting put into evidence by the Complainant from the period before the Respondent was served with the complaint on April 8, 2005, was posted on March 23, 2005, and it deals with the subject matter contained in a thread entitled Gambling at the Public Library. In this posting the Respondent makes derogatory remarks about Aboriginal persons.\n[69] The next posting put into evidence appears in early February 2006, ten months after the complaint was served and some five months after the letter of apology referred to earlier in this decision. This posting appeared following the Tribunal's decision in Warman v. Kulbashian et al, 2006 CHRT 11, which was issued on January 30, 2006. In this posting, the Respondent, referring to the Tribunal member who rendered the decision, had this to say: Notice that we don't even have White tribunal decision makers but someone who crawled out of some third-world hell hole.\n[70] In the next posting, dated February 27, 2006, the Respondent asserts: We must never forget that communism was, is, and always will be Jewish. It is the best example of what would happen to our people if and when the Jews attain the kind of absolute control of our countries that they so much lust after. In another posting, on March 3, 2006, the Respondent stated :\nThe Jews rely on their shabbos goy helpers to implement their plans. The Jews are simply following their instinct as a parasitic race but their White helpers are making a choice to betray their race. The Jews set up innumerable front organizations to recruit their shabbos goy helpers who, at best, think they are working for some noble cause to help this or that. At worst, they know they have been recruited to the Judaic cause but believe it is their path to riches and\/or power.\n[71] On May 8, 2006, the Respondent's attacks become more spiteful. Referring to a world conspiracy by the Jews, he affirms:\nThe Jews are the poisoners(sic) of all nations. One reason they promote multi-culturalism (which is really multi-racialism) is to create a country of mulatos(sic), whom the Jews find easy to control and a bunch of squabbling ethnic groups whom they can divide and conquer. In a multi-racial country the racial group with the strongest ethic solidarity will rule. The Jews believe, in all likelihood truly, that they have sufficient internal cohesion amongst themselves to rule, especially considering their current grip on the financial, political, educational, and cultural (media) institutions.\nEvery ethnic group must recognize the above to be true. We, as WNs, can form strategic alliances with other national groups but we must be wary of trying to get others to fight our battles for us. In such a case, those other groups will determine the configuration of a final victory. We must determine that configuration ourselves. In practical terms, the final configuration must not involve the breakup of any of our formerly White countries. Rather than trying to create some little White-only national territory, we should have a grande view. Kick the Jews out and have no more to do with them regardless where they end up. Then help the other ethnic groups towards repatriation. ... They do not share our values, which is (sic) demonstrated by their tendency to gang activities and crime in general. And even if they did share our values we do not want them here because we want our territory for the advancement of our own race to achieve our racial advancement.\nWe can establish an agreement among other national groups to ensure the Jews have no safe haven to re-establish another base of operations such as America and Britain. [...]\nFundamentally we (and all ethnic groups and races) must see the Jews as alien poisoners (sic) who always try to get others to do their dirty work. That way they can always claim innocence and do not get their hands dirty. Nor do they have to spend any of their own precious gold. They have openly declared that they would rather destroy the world than have their own national existence threatened (the Samson Option). We must accept that they are serious about that. We must turn that around and say, better that the Jews and Israel be destroyed than have the world destroyed.\n[72] Then on June 27, 2006, the Respondent proposes a National-Socialist Constitution for Canada. This constitution would be based on what the Respondent describes as the seven principles of National Socialism. The seventh principle declares that Adolph Hitler was a gift to the world which was on the brink of a Jewish-Bolshevik catastrophe. This document proposes that, in this imaginary national socialist state of Canada, the citizens be of at least 75% White European extraction. Jews and people of the Jewish faith would be denied citizenship.\n[73] In another posting on July 8, 2006, the Respondent talking about the Complainant had this to say: I think Warman is a Jew simply because of his unrestrained capacity for malevolence. He does not appear to have a White man's conscience. In a posting referring to his case before this Tribunal, the Respondent writes: Hitler said that Jews are the bacillus of social disintegration. Today we might consider them like the AIDS virus and the influx of other non-White populations in our country as opportunistic infections. The disease is multiculturalism and Jews are the cause.\n[74] On the internet site, http\/\/mathdoktor99.htmlplanet.com, the Respondent comments on what he describes as the Jewish world-wide conspiracy. He makes reference to a purported article written by Winston Churchill, which he claims was published in the London Sunday Herald, on February 8, 1920, whose content is clearly anti-semitic. He also refers to a document, allegedly prepared by the International Red Cross in 1947, which numbers the Jewish deaths in the various camps under German control during World War II at 271,000 deaths. He further quotes the headline of an article supposedly published in the Daily Express, of London, on March 24, 1933, and concludes that the Jews were the one who declared war on the Third Reich. He also makes reference to the Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn as having declared the Jew Bolsheviks to be the stranglers of Russia and the genocide against millions of Russians was planed (sic) by Jews in 1919.\n[75] The Respondent's attacks are not limited to the Jewish community; he also writes disparaging remarks against the Black community. In one of his postings on Stormfront, dated August 2, 2006, entitled My Story, he relates his experience in the Bahamas where he had taken a teaching position in 1993:\nThat country is about 98% Negro. The same proportion held among my students, some of whom did have some natural talent in Mathematics. When I went there I was NOT a racialist. In fact, there were times when I forgot I was White. You could say I went native to a degree. I even became deeply tanned to the point where I was quite dark. However, by the time I was there a year I had come to the conclusion that most of the Negroes in the Bahamas were innately stupid. Not all were, of course. I remember a few intelligent conversations among the Negro men in the liquor store, more intelligent than most of the talk among educated Negroes at the College. But, I formed the estimate that the average IQ there was somewhat around 75 to 85 and after six months of accumulated experience there that opinion solidified. Over the next 3\u00bd years that estimate would go up or down a few points but eventually averaged out to about 80. I kept thinking that the average truck driver in Canada has more brains than 99% of the Negroes in that country. So my views on race began to change. I did not think the 80 IQ could be explained culturally, though no doubt some would like to make that case. The Bahamians do not have the same excuse for being stupid as the American Negroes. They are an overwhelming majority in that country and have run their own show since 1973. Slavery was abolished in the Bahamas in 1837, But they are still stupid. Not all but most.\n[76] He then goes on to add:\nIf Negroes were only stupid, collectively speaking, but otherwise innocent we could regard them like children. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I found them to have a natural tendency to violence as a first resort and to be natural born thieves. In the four years I was in the Bahamas I had maybe half a dozen disputes with Negro males over what would normally be considered minor issues. In each case I was threatened with physical violence. They are cowards as well, brave only in packs like hyenas, since each case I did not back down and the other guy scurried away. I found that even the educated among them are natural born thieves.[...] The rule when you are among Negroes : If it isn't nailed down, glued down, or welded down to the floor it will disappear.\n[77] One of the themes of the document revolves around the idea that the Jews are trying to take over every aspect of society and to dominate the world. Quoting from Adolph Hitler, the Respondent divides races into three categories: Those who can create and maintain civilization; those who can maintain but not create civilization; and those who can do neither but are destroyers of civilization. The Aryan (=Whites) people created civilization. Asians and some Semites are able to maintain civilization. Jews and Negroes are destroyers of civilization. The Jews are especially dangerous because not only are they destroyers but of the worst kind, parasites.\n[78] He concludes: [D]o I want to live in a world owned and operated by Jews for the benefit of Jews? Do I want to live in a world controlled by the world destroying parasites or do I want to do something about it? Do I want to just sit and watch while Whites are destroyed as a people with no other alternative but to merge with - and eventually disappear into - the great brown swamp of Third World biomass? I decided to do something about it.\n[79] Finally, on July 27, 2006, the Respondent posted the following on Stormfront: Warman [referring to the Complainant] is just the front man, the performing monkey, for the B'nai Brith and the Canadian Jewish Congress. They run this country and it is sinking into the bottomless pit of Jew Hell.\n[80] In 2006, the Respondent also set up and maintained a website nspcanada where he posted what he purported to be the political program of the National-Socialist Party of Canada (the NSPC). This website is readily accessible to everybody.\n[81] The home page of this website indicates that the NSPC is dedicated, amongst other things, to stopping and reversing the effects of multiculturalism, resisting the Jewish\/Zionist takeover of the most important social institutions of Canada, restoring White sovereignty in Canada, implementing a new constitution for Canada [and] building up the White birth rate to replacement levels so that non-White immigrants are not required for our labour force.\n[82] He mentions that the NSPC is dedicated to the creation of a White racialist state in Canada which would restore the White sovereignty within Canada which has been lost through multiculturalism and Marxist Political Correctness. To accomplish this goal, he recommends various steps which include challeng[ing] by any and all legal means the Jewish influence on our news and entertainment mass media through developing our own media and utilizing the media of cooperating White organizations. He also called for the establishment of local units throughout Canada which can be rapidly transformed into resistance cells as the future need arises.\n[83] The Respondent then goes on to elaborate on the seven points of National Socialism which would form the basis of the constitution of national-socialist Canada. The seventh principle states: Adolf Hitler was the gift of an inscrutable Providence to a world on the brink of Jewish-Bolshevik catastrophe, and that only the blazing spirit of this heroic man can give us strength and inspiration to bring the world a new birth of radiant idealism, realistic peace, international order and social justice for all men.\n[84] Regarding firearm ownership, he states that this will be a fundamental right of law-abiding citizens but adds [n]ever again will Jews control this land! We MUST have a well armed citizen militia to ensure that multiculturalism is never again forced down our throats. Non-citizens (i.e. non-Whites) will not be allowed to own or possess firearms. The only exception to this will be native Indians living on their own reserve lands. They will be allowed firearms for hunting purposes only. The Respondent also refers to multiculturalism as a poison and proposes to clean up the multicultural mess.\n[85] In a National-Socialist Canada, we can read, that loyalty to Zionism and the Zionists entity in Palestine (the terrorist state of Israel) will be regarded as treason to Canada and will be dealt with as such.\n[86] According to the Respondent, homosexuality may or may not be genetically determined. He goes on to add that [a]ccording to the best available science on the subject, something goes wrong in the wiring of the brain during fetal development. He states that homosexuality is clearly a pathology whether recognized by the Psychiatric Association or not. [...] It is the position of the NSPC that homosexuals not be allowed to work in environment where children or young adolescents will be present. They will not be allowed to adopt or care for foster children. They will not be allowed to serve in the military and evidently they will not be allowed to marry as marriage is, according to the Respondent between a man and a woman.\n[87] Under a NSPC Canada, the military would be used to assist other White nations in their defense (sic) against non-White aggression. At the end of their compulsory military service the male citizens would maintain possession of their assault weapons to further the existence of a well armed citizen militia.\n[88] Citizenship under the NSPC would be only for people of at least 75% White European extraction. They cannot be Jews or of the Jewish religion. Only citizens will have the right to vote, to stand for elected office or the judiciary. The residents of Canada who do not qualify for citizenship will be either voluntarily or forcibly repatriated. Aboriginal people will not be citizens, nor will they have the right to vote but they will be given self-government over their own territories.\n[89] The document also states:\nWe are dedicated to peaceful revolutionary struggle for National Socialism and White sovereignty within Canada.\nHowever, it must be remembered that Canada is not currently a free country but is under Jewish\/Zionist control. We are suffering under Judeo-Liberalism and drifting toward Judeo-Fascist tyranny,\nWe support the right of political dissent for all White people in all land. This implies resistance to the current status quo. We must be prepared for all eventualities, as much as that is humanly possible. We propose that our local units structure themselves as resistance cells modelled after the Committees of Correspondence prior to and during the American Revolution.\n[90] The website then goes on to give a list of other pro-white groups with their web address. It also lists the name of companies and businesses that should be boycotted because of what the Respondent qualifies as Zionist connections.\n[91] There are also a number of quotations on different pages of the website where we can read, for example,\nNegroes Back to Africa? Yes!!!;\nNo amount of special programs or incentives can change the basis genetic nature of a race. The only solution to the plague of Negro crime is the repatriation back to Africa.;\nInternational Jewry is the enemy of all humankind and the poisoners(sic) of all nations;\nMulticulturalism is the displacement, marginalization, and eventual destruction of the host population - The White Race!!!\n[92] There is also a series of what we could be described as short commentaries entitled, for example, Zionism is Treason, Removing Negroes Back to Africa? Yes!!!, Jew Tube, Negro Crime. The Respondent also purports to reproduce a series of documents which he presents as being historically correct.\n[93] It is clear that the Respondent wants nothing less than a totally white Canada. He argues that whites and non-whites, including Jews, can never live together in harmony in the same country. He considers Blacks despicable but too feeble-minded to pose a threat to whites. Jews, on the other hand, are considered more clever, but they are dangerous, amoral, vermin, conspiring to take control of the world. The most important themes running through most of his writing are the supremacy of the white race and anti-Semitism.\nIV. THE SECTION 13 COMPLAINT A. INTRODUCTION: Hate propoganda and free speech [94] Freedom of expression is held especially dear in a free and democratic society such as ours. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms makes it one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to all Canadians. It is the foundation on which our democratic and political process has been built. It allows individuals to shape their personal development and in so doing it ensures the fostering of a vibrant democracy where the participation of all, no matter what their ethnic or religious background might be, is not only welcomed but accepted and encouraged. (Canadian (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, at para. 47.)\n[95] It is because of our attachment to this fundamental value that matters, such as those raised in the present instance, present some difficulty. In rendering its decision, the Tribunal must take into consideration two fundamental values which, in some cases, are difficult to reconcile. On the one hand, we have the interest of a democratic society to promote freedom of expression and, on the other hand, we have the importance for the same society to promote the equality rights of all its citizens as well as the inherent dignity of all human beings.\n[96] Some of the ideas expressed by the Respondent in his postings may be seen as forming part of a legitimate political discourse, although they might seem repugnant to the values of a majority of Canadians. This is why we must be careful, when dealing with issues such as these, not to let our judgment be clouded by the general disapproval and the offensiveness of the political ideas advocated by the Complainant. We might not like what he is saying and would prefer not to hear it, but in a democratic society, people are free to express their opinions, unpopular as they might be, as long as it does not demean and humiliate others.\n[97] Although freedom of expression is an important fundamental value, we in Canada value just as much the equality rights of all individuals. Equality means a respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings whatever their colour, race, language, sex or religion. Freedom to express one's idea ceases to be freedom of expression or opinion when it is used to stand in the way of the promotion of equality. Freedom of expression ceases to be a fundamental characteristic of democratic values when it becomes a vehicle for the promotion of hate. (See Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 F.C. 155, at para. 60)\n[98] In Citron et al v. Z\u00fcndel, T.D. 1\/02, 2002\/01\/18, the Tribunal stated, at paras. 153 and 154:\nIn any event, even if we accept that there can be legitimate debate on this topic, we have focussed on the manner in which the Respondent has expressed his views and not the mere fact he chooses to engage in this debate. Our conclusion is based on the way in which these doubts are expressed, and not on the fact that challenges are raised regarding the historical accuracy of these events. Although it might always be hurtful to raise these questions, we accept that the standard for determining the promotion of hatred or contempt must be applied with care so that it remains sensitive to free speech interests.\nIf this truly were a neutrally worded, academic debate, our analysis might be quite different. The tone and extreme denigration of Jews, however, separates these documents from those that might be permissible. We have found that it is the linkage between the author's view of these events and the extreme vilification of Jews as a consequence: it is their denunciation as liars, racketeers, extortionists and frauds that is likely to expose them to hatred and contempt.\n[99] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, at para. 2, the Supreme Court of Canada defined the term hate propaganda as an expression intended or likely to circulate extreme feelings of opprobrium and enmity against a racial or religious group. Hate propaganda or messages lie at the outer margins of the values that form the core of freedom of expression. It is fundamentally inimical to the rationale of freedom of expression. That is why Parliament adopted section 13(1) of the Act. Parliament has clearly indicated, when it adopted this section, that it viewed the activities described therein as contrary to the furtherance of equality. The objective behind this section is obviously one of substantial importance sufficient to warrant some limitation upon freedom of expression. (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, para. 43.)\n[100] In the Taylor case, the Supreme Court concluded that while s. 13 infringed the freedom of expression right, this infringement was justified in light of the international commitments to eradicate hate propaganda, and Canada's commitment to the values of equality and multiculturalism.\n[101] In his closing remarks, the Respondent's representative based part of his argument on fair comment and free speech. Although, I agree that all individuals, including the Respondent, have a right to express by whatever means they choose their political ideas, they must do so in a manner that does not offend s.13(1) of the Act. As the Tribunal stated in Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, at para. 54: While the right to hold and express one's opinions is a cornerstone of a free and democratic society, such a right is not unlimited. In some situations, the protection of society mandates limits on what individuals may say. Calumny against and the calling for the expulsion of Canadian citizens on the basis of their colour or religion cannot be protected by free speech or fair comment.\n[102] Mr. Fromm also requested that the Tribunal not consider the information posted on the National-Socialist Party of Canada website. He argued that this political platform ought to be dealt with in a political arena. I disagree. The importance in our democracy of maintaining free public opinion and discussion is not a right which is absolute. The Courts have recognized that these values are subject to legal limits, under the provisions of the Criminal Code, the common law, the Charter of Rights and Freedom and the Act. Parliament and Canadian society in general have decided to impose legal limits on free public opinion and discussion. They have decided that one cannot promote hate and contempt even if he pretends it to be political speech.\nB. The general purpose of section 13(1) of the Act [103] The complaint alleges that the Respondent discriminated against persons or a group of persons on the basis of religion, race, colour and national or ethnic origin by repeatedly communicating messages over the Internet which would likely expose Blacks, Asians, Aboriginal, other non-whites and Jews to hatred or contempt contrary to subsection 13(1) of the Act.\n[104] Section 13(1) reads as follows:\n13. (1) It is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n13. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[105] Section 13(2) extends this provision to communications made on the Internet:\n(2) For greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication, but does not apply in respect of a matter that is communicated in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a broadcasting undertaking.\n(2) Il demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable mais qu'il ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 les services d'une entreprise de radiodiffusion sont utilis\u00e9s.\n[106] Section 13 of the Act is especially designed to prevent the spread of prejudice and to foster tolerance and equality. In denoting the activity described in this section as a discriminatory practice, Parliament has indicated that it views hate propaganda or messages as contrary to the furtherance of equality. In 1966, the Special Committee on Hate Propaganda in Canada, commonly known as the Cohen Committee, had identified the serious harm caused by hate messages. It noted that individuals subjected to racial or religious hatred may suffer substantial psychological distress, the damaging consequences including a loss of self-esteem, feelings of anger and outrage and strong pressure to renounce cultural differences that mark them as distinct. (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, para. 40.)\n[107] The purpose of section 13 is to remove hate messages from the public discourse and to promote equality, tolerance and the dignity of the person. The views expressed in these messages inevitably result in prejudice, discrimination and can also lead to physical violence against members of the targeted groups.\n[108] Hate messages can also operate to convince their listeners or readers that members of certain racial or religious groups are inferior. The result may be an increase in acts of discrimination or even incidents of violence towards these groups. Hate messages undermine the dignity and self-worth of targeted groups' members and contribute to disharmonious relations among various racial, cultural and religious groups as a result eroding the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multicultural society which is committed to the idea of equality. (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra., para. 41).\n[109] Under section 13(1), the intent to discriminate is not a pre-condition to a finding of discrimination. (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at pages 549-50; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, at pages 931-34). In Warman v. Kulbashian et al, 2006 CHRT 11 (C.H.R.T.), at paragraph 59, the Tribunal indicates:\n[The] language of section 13 is clear, in that it is the effect of messages that has attracted the attention of Parliament. The question to be asked is not whether the conveyor of the message intended to communicate hate or contempt, but whether the message itself is likely to expose persons belonging to the identifiable groups to hatred or contempt. If indeed the newsletter's content was intended to express a supposed political opinion, the message could have been communicated without resort to the extremist and denigrating language that pervades the various editions of the newsletter...\n[110] In Nealy v. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, at para. 45697, the Tribunal stated that the use of the word likely in section 13(1) means that it is not necessary that evidence be adduced to prove that any particular individual or group took the messages seriously and directed hatred or contempt towards others. Nor is it necessary to show that anyone was so victimized. Unlike the other sections in the Act dealing with discrimination, s. 13(1) provides for liability where there is no proven or provable discriminatory impact. As discussed by the Tribunal in Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20, at paras. 46 and 49:\nThe Tribunal alluded to the difficulty involved in determining how many people had received the message and to gauging the impact of the message on these people. This, in the Tribunal's view, justified the extension of liability under s. 13(1) to cases where there is no proven or provable actual discriminatory effect.[...] Section 13(1) makes it a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt. The provision does not state that it is a discriminatory practice to communicate messages that cause others to feel hatred or contempt toward members of the targeted group.\n[111] Again in Taylor, supra, at para. 74, the Supreme Court of Canada added that the truthfulness of the impugned statement did not provide a defence to the discriminatory practice prohibited by section 13(1): One must remember that truth may be used for widely disparate ends, and I find it difficult to accept that circumstances exist where factually accurate statements can be used for no other purpose than to stir up hatred against racial or religious groups.\n[112] Hate messages undermine the dignity and self-worth of the targeted group members and erode the tolerance and open-mindedness that must flourish in a multi-cultural society that is committed to the idea of equality (Winnicki, supra, at para. 50.) Therefore proof of harm is not required. The key is to ensure that only those messages that are likely to expose members of the targeted group to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification are caught by s. 13(1). (Winnicki, supra, at para. 51)\n[113] As the Federal Court stated in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Winnicki, 2005 FC 1493, at para. 30:\nThe damage caused by hate messages to the groups targeted is very often difficult to repair. It insidiously reinforces the prejudice that some people may have towards minorities identified by race, color, ethnic origin and religion, thus prompting and justifying discriminatory practices and even violence against these groups. At the same time, these messages are most likely to affect the perception and self-esteem of all members of these groups, thus precluding their full participation in Canadian society and the achievement of their full potential as human beings.\n[114] How is the likelihood of exposure to harm to be determined? In Citron v. Zundel (No. 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, the Tribunal stated that the most persuasive evidence was the language used in the messages themselves. There is no need for expert evidence on this matter although it could be helpful in certain cases.\n[115] There are three issues that must be considered in determining whether the complaint has been made out:\nDid the Respondent communicate or cause to be communicated repeatedly the material which is subject of the complaint? Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament? Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination?\nC. Did Mr. Tremaine communicate, or cause to be communicated, repeatedly, the messages found on the various websites in issue? [116] The Respondent does not deny that he communicated the material which is the subject of this complaint including the post-complaint material. He also admitted that all of the material was authored and signed either under his real name or under his pseudonym, mathdoktor99.\n[117] His representative took issue with the characterisation of these messages as having been repeatedly communicated. He referred to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Taylor and suggested that the reason the Court found that the communications were repeated in that case was that there was a deliberate effort to call public attention to them. He added that there was no evidence that the Respondent attempted to call attention to or advertised his postings on the Internet and consequently the Tribunal should rule that they were not repeated.\n[118] The requirement that there be repeated communication is a constituent element of s. 13(1) and the Tribunal finds as a fact that there was, in this case, repeated communication of the material posted. In Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453, the Tribunal held that the use of the word repeatedly in s. 13(1) suggests that it is aimed not at private communications with friends, but rather at a series of messages that form a larger-scale, public scheme for the dissemination of certain ideas or opinions, designed to gain converts from the public.\n[119] In this case, the material was posted on the Internet which is designed to facilitate repeated transmission of material posted on a chosen site. The Internet provided an inexpensive means of mass distribution. One of the purposes sought by posting messages on a website is that it will be available for transmission and display by a user who requests it. This characteristic of the Internet satisfies the requirement of repeatedly found in section 13(1). The Respondent did not need to call public attention to his postings, the mere fact of putting them on the Internet which is accessible to almost everyone was sufficient to attain this objective.\nD. Were these messages communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of parliament? [120] The substantive evidence against the Respondent consists primarily of copies of postings on the Internet.\n[121] The Canadian Human Rights Act, as it was originally enacted, did not explicitly deal with Internet communications. As part of the changes to Canadian law effected by the proclamation of the Anti-Terrorism Act, S.C. 2001, c. 41, section 88, on December 24, 2001, the Canadian Human Rights Act was amended to add subsection 13(2), which deals expressly with matters communicated by means of the Internet.\n[122] Since all the messages which form the basis of this complaint were posted after the enactment of section 13(2), there is no issue that they were communicated in whole or in part by means of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament.\n[123] In his closing arguments, Mr. Fromm insisted that the Tribunal should consider postings on an internet site dedicated to persons sharing the same basic ideology, as similar to a private communication. He characterised the postings on Stormfront as in-house conversation. The Tribunal does not accept this argument. In an article written by L. B. Lidsky, Silencing John Doe: Defamation and Discourse in Cyberspace (2000), 49 Duke L. J. 855, cited with approval in the decision of Barrick Gold Corporation v. Lopehandia, [2004] O.J. N\u00b0 2329 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 31, the author states:\nAlthough Internet communications may have the ephemeral qualities of gossip with regards to accuracy, they are communicated through a medium more pervasive than print, and for this reason they have tremendous power to harm reputation. Once a message enters cyberspace, millions of people worldwide can gain access to it. Even if the message is posted in a discussion forum frequented by only an handful of people, any one of them can republish the message by printing it or, as is more likely, by forwarding it instantly to a different discussion forum. And if the message is sufficiently provocative, it may be republished again and again. The extraordinary capacity of the Internet to replicate almost endlessly any defamatory message lends credence to the notion that the truth rarely catches up with a lie.\n[124] Internet has had a profound impact on modern society. It has made accessible to all information which in the past was only available to a few. It has also allowed individuals to exchange ideas and to discuss important issues but it has also raised serious concerns about the content found on many sites. Issues have arisen regarding the preservation of legitimate free speech, on the one hand, and the need to control the proliferation of hate sites, on the other hand. Cyberspace cannot and should not be seen as a frontier society where everything is allowed and where the constraints which limit discourse in the real world have no place. The fact that the user employs a pseudonym does not mean that anything goes. Also, the fact that he is printing his messages on a site which is essentially used by like-minded individuals does not make it a private communication. Once the message has entered cyberspace it can be read by millions of people, it is part of the public domain.\n[125] In this case, the evidence clearly establishes that the websites used by the Respondent were readily accessible to the public. The Complainant testified that to have access to the messages posted on these sites, a person did not have to be a member - although on Stormfront, you could not post a message without being a member. Anyone could easily access the Stormfront and the nspcanada websites, no password required.\n[126] The Tribunal therefore sees no merit in the Respondent's argument on this point.\n[127] The Respondent's representative also expressed the opinion that common sense would suggest that since the postings were made on a website where like-minded people communicated amongst themselves then they were not exposing the targeted groups to hatred or contempt. He also argued that the messages were not likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt since anyone surfing the Internet would have had fair warning of the content of the messages by the nature of the banners on the home page of the sites. Therefore, people had a choice whether to read the messages or not.\n[128] Again, the Tribunal cannot accept this argument. Although, it might be true to conclude that an individual who posts or reads the posting on these sites might be considered an adherent to the opinion they espouse and consequently might already possess feelings of hate and contempt for minority groups, it is conceivable that these feelings might be inflamed further by these messages. In any event, we should remember that the preconceived feelings of the individual who post or reads such posting is not in issue in the interpretation of s. 13. The question is whether the matter communicated is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt. The fact that the banners provided some vague indication of the content of the websites does not put the messages beyond reach of s 13(1).\nE. Is the subject matter of the messages likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination? [129] The issue here is whether the messages are indeed likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination or whether they are simply, as Mr. Fromm has categorized them, strong opinions expressed by the Respondent.\n[130] In defining hatred or contempt, the Tribunal, in Nealy v. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.D. No. 10, at para. 45653, applied the definition found in the Oxford English Dictionary (1971 ed.). Hatred is defined as active dislike, detestation, enmity, ill-will, malevolence. Contempt is the condition of being condemned or despised; dishonour or disgrace.\n[131] In that same decision, the Tribunal further added, at para. 45654 :\nAs there is no definition of hatred or contempt within the [Canadian Human Rights Act] it is necessary to rely on what might be described as common understandings of the meaning of these terms. Clearly these are terms which have a potentially emotive content and how they are related to particular factual contexts by different individuals will vary. There is nevertheless an important core of meaning in both, which the dictionary definitions capture. With hatred the focus is a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of looking down on another or others. It is quite possible to hate someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth or power. None of the synonyms used in the dictionary definition of hatred give any clues to the motivation for the ill will. Contempt is by contrast a term which suggests a mental process of looking down upon or treating as inferior the object of one's feelings. This is captured by the dictionary definition relied on in Taylor...in the use of the terms despised, dishonour or disgrace. Although the person can be hated (i.e. actively disliked) and treated with contempt (i.e. looked down upon), the terms are not fully coextensive, because hatred is in some instances the product of envy of superior qualities, which contempt by definition cannot be. [Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, supra, para. 60]\n[132] Hatred thus refers to extreme ill-will and an emotion which allows for no redeeming qualities in the person at whom it is directed. For its part, contempt describes circumstances where the person is looked down upon.\n[133] How is the likelihood of exposure to hatred or contempt to be determined? Is it sufficient for the Tribunal to have regard to the messages alone and then draw an inference, based on the content, tone and presentation of the messages as to whether they are likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred and contempt? Or must there be other evidence to assist the Tribunal in determining whether the messages are likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt? In his closing arguments, the Respondent's representative stated that there was no evidence before the Tribunal that the messages were likely to expose targeted groups to hatred or contempt as no expert evidence had been called by the Complainant to help the Tribunal answer these questions.\n[134] In Citron v. Zundel, supra, at para. 141, the Tribunal stated that, although expert evidence might be helpful, it is the language used in the messages themselves that will allow it to determine whether the material offends s. 13(1). Similarly, in Warman v. Kyburz, 2003 CHRT 18, the Tribunal, while taking note of the expert's evidence, found that it was evident from the messages themselves that they were contrary to s. 13(1). The fact that no expert evidence was called is not in itself fatal to the complainant's claim.\n[135] The messages submitted in evidence are principally directed at two groups, Blacks and Jews. People of the Black community are portrayed as intellectually inferior, violent, criminal and stupid - in short, they are represented as devoid of any redeeming qualities.\n[136] The messages directed towards Jews characterize them as the enemy of humanity, as a parasitic race, as pure evil, hideous parasites, as a disease, vermin, as deceitful, liars, depraved, criminals involved in organised crime, drugs and white slavery. The Respondent refers to the holocaust as the holohoax which he describes as an attempt to portray the Jews as victims of the Nazis, which he asserts to be an inversion of the truth. He recommends that Jews be deprived of their Canadian citizenship and even expelled from this country. The basic theme of the material is that Jews have no redeeming qualities and they are destroying the white race. The messages reinforce the classic anti-semitic myths that Jews have a disproportionate degree of power and that they pose a menace to the civilized world. They have foisted multiculturalism on White society and are responsible for the damage it has done. In addition they are dangerous Communists Marxists. The tone and extreme denigration of Jews in these messages does not form part of a legitimate political debate, because it is incompatible with the basic tenets of equality enshrined in the Act.\n[137] The messages even insinuate that violence against Canadian minorities and especially Jews is acceptable. They contain in many instances an aggressive overtone.\n[138] In the NSPC website, the Respondent clearly asserts that Jews, Blacks and other non-whites are destroying the country, should be denied citizenship, sterilized and even deported. These messages point out that non-white people bring poverty, crime and corruption to our society. The messages also offer readers reasons to hate them and to be suspicious of them.\n[139] The messages clearly expose the people of the Jewish faith, Blacks and other non-white minorities to hatred and contempt contrary to section 13 of the Act.\nF. Conclusion on the section 13(1) complaint [140] Having looked at these messages in context, I have no doubt that they are likely to expose persons of the Jewish faith, Blacks and other non-white minorities to hatred or contempt. The underlying theme in the Respondent's messages is that Jews, Blacks and other non-whites are destroying the country and that they should either be deported or segregated. They also refer to the threat they represent for white civilization. Members of the targeted groups are described as vermin, a disease, parasites, criminals, scoundrel, embezzlers and liars. They are portrayed as dangerous and, in some cases, intellectually inferior.\n[141] These messages convey extreme ill-will to the point of violence towards the targeted groups. Nothing in these messages allows for any redeeming qualities for members of these groups. The members of the groups have been completely dehumanized. Consequently they may likely be the object of hatred and contempt.\n[142] The Tribunal therefore concludes that these messages are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour or religion under section 13(1) of the Act and that a discriminatory practice has been established.\nG. Remedies [143] Having found that Mr. Warman's section 13 complaint was substantiated, the final issue to be determined is that of remedy. The remedies sought by the Complainant are:\nAn Order that the Respondent cease the discriminatory practice, pursuant to section 54(1)(a) of the Act; An Order that the Respondent pay compensation pursuant to section 54(1)(b) of the Act; An Order that the Respondent pay a penalty pursuant to section 54(1)(c) of the Act.\n(i) Cease and desist order [144] Where a section 13 complaint is substantiated, section 54(1)(a) of the Act empowers the Tribunal to order the Respondent to cease the discriminatory practice. The process of hearing a complaint and, if the complaint is substantiated, issuing a cease and desist order serves to remind Canadians of our fundamental commitment to equality of opportunity and to the eradication of racial and religious intolerance. (See Taylor, supra, at para. 53, and Winnicki, supra, at para. 192.)\n[145] A cease and desist order brings to a Respondent's attention the fact that his or her messages are likely to have a harmful effect. Uncertainty or mistake as to the probable effect of these messages is thus dissipated and consequently their continued promulgation will be accompanied by the knowledge that certain individuals or groups are likely to be exposed to hatred or contempt on the basis of race or religion.\n[146] Messages posted by individuals on the Internet present a particular challenge for the Tribunal in crafting a meaningful remedy. As the Tribunal stated in Warman v. Kyburz, supra, at para. 81: The unique nature of Internet technology, including the jurisdictional challenges arising from the borderless world of cyberspace, as well as the `moving targets' created by the use of mirror sites raise real concerns as to the efficacy of cease and desist orders in relation to hate messages disseminated on the Internet. Notwithstanding this observation, the Tribunal in Kyburz still issued a cease and desist order. The difficulty in crafting a meaningful remedy should not in any way prevent the Tribunal from making such an order if it deems fit to do so.\n[147] In the Z\u00fcndel decision (supra), the Tribunal stated, at para 300:\nAny remedy awarded by this Tribunal, will inevitably serve a number of purposes: prevention and elimination of discriminatory practices is only one of the outcome flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings. There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint. Similarly, there is the potential educative and ultimately the larger preventive benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision.\n[148] A cease and desist order can have both a practical and symbolic effect. On a practical side, it will prevent the Respondent from continuing to communicate over the Internet material of the nature described in this decision. On the symbolic side there is an important value to the public denunciation of the actions which form the subject matter of this complaint and, also, there is an important educational value in such an order.\n[149] Having regards to the postings of the Respondent, the Tribunal is of the view that a cease and desist order is entirely appropriate. It is therefore ordered that the Respondent, Terry Tremaine, cease the discriminatory practice of communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, namely the Internet, material of the type which was found to violate s. 13(1) in the present case, or any other matter of a substantially similar content that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons is identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(ii) Compensation pursuant to paragraph 54(1)(b) of the Act [150] Paragraph 54(1)(b) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may order the payment of special compensation to the victim, of a sum that is not to exceed $20 000, where a victim is specifically identified in the communication that constituted the discriminatory practice and if the Tribunal determines that the Respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. The Complainant is seeking special compensation in the amount of $10 000, from the Respondent.\n[151] The Complainant argues that to order compensation under this section, the Tribunal need only be satisfied that the victim is specifically identified in the discriminatory messages and that the Respondent engaged in the practice wilfully or recklessly. He argues that no other factors should be taken into consideration.\n[152] The first paragraph of section 54 gives the Tribunal the discretion to order one or more of the remedies enumerated therein. The paragraph states that The member or panel may make only one or more of the following orders\/le membre instructeur...peut rendre. (The emphasis is mine.) Subsection 53(3), to which paragraph 54(1)(b) makes reference, also uses the expression may\/peut.\n[153] When may is used in legislation there is rarely any doubt about what the word means (See Interpretation Act, R.S. 1985, c. I-21, s. 11.). It means that Parliament authorizes a person to do something that he would otherwise not be able to do or to do something that would otherwise be legally ineffective. In this case, Parliament as empowered the member or panel of the Tribunal to order certain remedies including special compensation to the victim. When a statutory power is conferred using the word may, the implication is that the power is discretionary and that the person or persons authorized to exercise this power can lawfully decide whether or not to exercise it. This discretion must, though, be exercised judicially and in light of the evidence before the Tribunal. (See Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Dumont, 2002 FCT 1280, at paras. 12-15).\n[154] In this case, paragraph 54(1)(b) provides that compensation may be ordered where:\na victim; is specifically identified in the communication that constituted the discriminatory practice; and the Respondent engaged in the practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[155] The first requirement is that the Respondent pay a compensation to a victim. The Tribunal must determine if the Complainant in this particular case is a victim of the discriminatory practice.\n[156] In her closing arguments the Commission's lawyer addressed this issue. She referred to subsection 40(1) of the Act which states:\n40. (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (7), any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint in a form acceptable to the Commission.\n40. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (5) et (7), un individu ou un groupe d'individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission en la forme acceptable pour cette derni\u00e8re.\n[157] Interestingly, paragraph 40(5)(b) of the Act contemplates specifically a situation such as the present one when it states:\n40(5) No complaint in relation to a discriminatory practice may be dealt with by the Commission under this Part unless the act or omission constitutes the practice\n(b) occurred in Canada and was a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5, 8, 10, 12 or 13 in respect of which no particular individual is identifiable as the victim. (The emphasis is mine.)\n40(5) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, la Commission n'est validement saisie d'une plainte que si l'acte discriminatoire:\nb) a eu lieu au Canada sans qu'il soit possible d'en identifier la victime, mais tombe sous le coup des articles 5, 8, 10, 12, ou 13.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original)\n[158] The Commission, in its closing arguments, rightly added, in light of this subsection, that there is no need to be a victim in order to file a complaint under section 13 of the Act. It also referred to the case of Warman v. Winnicki, supra, where at para. 46, the Tribunal indicated that, under section 13, it was not necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was victimized by the hatred or contempt directed to the targeted group. The Commission concluded by stating that the case law and particularly the Act clearly authorize any individual or group of individuals to file a human rights complaint under this section whether or not they are the victims of the discriminatory practice which is alleged. The Commission did not think that the question of whether or not the Complainant was a victim was an issue in this case.\n[159] The Complainant, for its part, did not present, during the hearing, any evidence which could establish that he was a victim of the discriminatory practice of the Respondent. He didn't have to in order to file his complaint. In his original complaint, the Complainant had sought relief under section 14.1 of the Act for retaliation. At the start of the hearing, he chose to abandon this claim. He cannot now resurrect this claim by seeking special compensation under paragraph 54(1)(b). The Tribunal therefore concludes, for the above given reason, that the Complainant has not met the burden under this paragraph.\n[160] The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Complainant's claim to compensation under paragraph 54(1)(b) is unfounded.\n(iii) An order to pay a penalty under paragraph 54(1)(c) [161] Paragraph 54(1)(c) provides that the Tribunal may order the Respondent to pay a penalty of not more than $10,000. In deciding whether to order the payment of the penalty, the Tribunal must, according to subsection 54(1.1), take into account:\nthe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice; the wilfulness or intent of the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice; any prior discriminatory practices that the person has engaged in; the person's ability to pay the penalty.\n[162] The numerous hate messages posted by the Respondent were highly contemptuous and injurious. They portrayed members of the targeted groups as evil and criminal. They referred to Jews as parasites and vermin. They claimed that Blacks were intellectually inferior to Whites. They called for the expulsion of Jews, Blacks and other non-whites from Canada. These messages are malicious, vicious and extreme in the violent nature of their overtone.\n[163] The active promotion of hatred and contempt towards members of the targeted groups by the Respondent is fundamentally at odds with the goal of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which is to promote a society in which all are free from discrimination and all may benefit from equal opportunity regardless of personal traits such as race, national or ethnic origin, colour, and sexual orientation.\n[164] On the positive side for the Respondent, there was no information that he had engaged in any prior discriminatory practices before he started posting on the Stormfront website in 2004. Also, the fact that for a period of about ten months, after he was served with the complaint, he refrained from posting any messages and that at one point he even disavowed and repudiated all of his messages should be taken into consideration when determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed.\n[165] In terms of the extent of the hate messages, the evidence indicates that the Respondent had posted almost 1,900 messages on the Stormfront site, as of July 28, 2006. Since the Tribunal has not seen nor read all of these messages, it cannot, in all fairness to the Respondent, conclude that they all contain hate messages of the nature of those put into evidence in this case. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot come to the conclusion that the number of messages posted favours a penalty at the highest end of the spectrum.\n[166] The Respondent's wilfulness and intent in engaging in the discriminatory practice, is self-evident from the vicious tone of the messages themselves. His reaffirmation at the hearing that he stood by all his postings, his refusal to utter any remorse and the fact that he has not shown any indication that he has any intent of stopping.\n[167] The Respondent gave evidence regarding his financial situation. He testified that he did not own a car or a house. He has lost his job at the University of Saskatchewan. He testified that he is presently working 20 hours a week at a minimum wage job, clearing about $600 a month. This evidence went unchallenged and the Respondent was not cross-examined on this matter neither by the Commission, nor by the Complainant.\n[168] Taking into account the nature, circumstances, gravity and intentional nature of the communication, and taking all the other factors into consideration, I find that a penalty of $4,000, would be reasonable in these circumstances.\nV. ORDER [169] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the complaint against Terry Tremaine is substantiated and orders that:\nin the present case, or any other messages of a substantially similar content, that are likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. 2 Terry Tremaine shall pay a penalty in the amount of $4,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order, payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of Mr. Tremaine's being notified of this decision.\nsigned by Michel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nFebraury 2, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1104\/8505\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

INTRODUCTION [1] On March 23, 2004, the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR) filed a human rights complaint against www.bcwhitepride.com under sections 13(1) and 13(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The complaint was referred to the Tribunal on January 24, 2006.\n[2] On May 11, 2006, the Commission filed a motion to modify the style of cause and add a party to the proceedings. More specifically, in its motion, the Commission stated that it was seeking to attain a triple objective:\nto modify the name of the respondent from what it is presently, that is www.bcwhitepride.com to the BC White Pride Group associated to the website www.bcwhitepride.com in order to clarify any ambiguity in the event that the complaint is upheld and enforcement would be required; to add White Renegade Group associated with the website www.whiterenegade.com and to add the name of John Beck as a Respondent associated to the said website.\n[3] This motion was first presented to my colleague, Ms. Karen Jensen, who, in a ruling rendered on June 26, 2006, ordered that the motion be decided by the member assigned to hear the merits of the complaint.\n[4] It must be noted here that Ms. Jensen later authorised the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum at the request of the Commission to secure Mr. Beck's attendance at the hearing. Mr. Beck was present throughout the hearing of this motion as well as Mr. Paul Fromm.\n[5] At the commencement of this hearing, the Tribunal asked Mr. Fromm if he was representing the current respondent www.bcwhitepride.com or Mr. Beck. After consulting with Mr. Beck, Mr. Fromm informed the Tribunal that he was acting as Mr. Beck's agent, and not as an agent for www.bcwhitepride.com. The Tribunal thus concludes that, in these proceedings, the respondent, www.bcwhitepride.com is not represented by counsel.\n[6] Furthermore, the Tribunal sought clarification on the part of the Commission as to which parties it wanted to add as respondent. It appears now that the Commission wishes to add four new respondents to the current proceedings, i.e. bcwhitepride.com, namely Mr. John Beck, White Renegade Group, BC White Pride Group and www.bcwhitepride.org.\n[7] In his initial address to the Tribunal, Counsel for the Commission argued that the evidence tendered in the course of this motion could also serve for the merits of the case.\n[8] The Tribunal is of the view that it would be a serious breach of procedural fairness if the evidence heard in the course of a motion to add new respondents was to be part of the evidence on the merits. This would mean that if the Tribunal was to add a new respondent to the style of cause, the latter would be bound by the evidence already tendered and for which, as a respondent, he would not have had the possibility of fully defending himself against.\nII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES [9] The Commission as well as the Complainant submit that www.bcwhitepride.org BC White Pride Group and White Renegade Group as well as Mr. John Beck should be added as parties to the present proceedings and argue that their presence is necessary in relation to the conduct of the present inquiry.\n[10] Mr. Fromm, as Mr. Beck's representative and not as www.bcwhitepride.com's representative, argues that Mr. Beck should not be added as a party and that, in any case, www.bcwhitepride.com is not a legal entity, but an Internet address and has no legal standing.\nIII. ISSUES [11] What the Tribunal has to decide in the context of the present motion is, on the one hand, whether or not Mr. John Beck is the person identifying himself as John in his e-mail exchanges and chat conversations with Rachel and using the alias David Drolet or Renegade1488ca.\n[12] On the other hand, the Tribunal has to determine whether or not BC White Pride Group, White Renegade Group and www.bcwhitepride.org exist and are related to www.bcwhitepride.com, the present respondent, as well as Mr. Beck.\n[13] In this regard, the Tribunal has to determine if adding Mr. John Beck, BC White Pride Group, White Renegade Group and www.bcwhitepride.org as respondents in the present proceedings is necessary to make a full and ample inquiry into the complaint.\n[14] At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal does not have to decide the merits of the case and rule on the content of the bcwhitepride website.\nIV. THE EVIDENCE [15] The Commission called one witness, Mr. Shane Martinez. Although subpoenaed by the Commission, Mr. Beck was not called as a witness. The Tribunal also heard Mr. Bernard Klatt, called as an expert witness by Mr. Fromm.\n[16] Mr. Martinez testified that, in the spring of 2004, while in the Dominican Republic, he conducted an investigation on two websites, namely, www.bcwhitepride.com and www.whiterenegade.com. Mr. Martinez stated in his testimony that what triggered his interest in these websites was a search on the Stormfront website, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist site, according to Mr. Martinez. There, Mr. Martinez came across postings from a user who was using the moniker Renegade, postings which related to issues in British Columbia and Canada in general.\n[17] Mr. Martinez testified that, at the time he was collecting the information, it was not with the intent of filing a human rights complaint. His purpose for collecting the information was to identify the individual involved in the two websites so that some measure of community education and awareness could be brought about to expose that individual for the kind of activities that he was engaging.\n[18] Given that there was no identifying information which appeared on the bcwhitepride and whiterenegade sites, Mr. Martinez was not able to identify the person or persons who had created these sites. However, in order to discover their identity, Mr. Martinez decided to establish an online relationship with the person using the moniker Renegade whose e-mail address was posted at the whiterenegade.com site. Mr. Martinez hoped that, by establishing such a relationship, he would learn more about the person or persons who were operating the website.\n[19] In order to lure the creators of the above-mentioned websites into providing him with the information he was seeking, Mr. Martinez decided to use a ploy, a ruse, a strategy which, he stated, was quite common with respect to the type of investigation he was conducting.\n[20] Thus, Mr. Martinez did not utilize his personal identity in his quest to secure the identity of the creators of the websites but the persona of a fictitious character who was involved in similar topics or shared similar views as those listed on the whiterenegade website so as to build a bond of communication between himself and the person or persons responsible for the whiterenegade website.\n[21] Mr. Martinez thus used the pseudonym Rachel and the moniker Swedish Pride 1488 as contact information. Mr. Martinez wanted to have the person he was corresponding with to believe that he was a woman interested in issues affecting the maintenance of the status of white people in society.\n[22] Mr. Martinez also used pictures of a young woman to give more credibility to his persona. The pictures he used were taken from a website and are those of a woman who, according to Mr. Martinez, was involved in the type of activities and issues that are addressed at whiterenegade.com and bcwhitepride.com.\n[23] Mr. Martinez also testified that when he created Rachel's profile on his Yahoo account, he associated with the character Rachel other features, such as music preferences, which espoused certain beliefs of people interested in the same political issues as the websites he was investigating, as well as her marital status, single so that people would be more inclined to engage in conversation, hobbies, the fact that she was living in Ontario.\n[24] Mr. Martinez, using the moniker Rachel, used the e-mail address swedish4life@cyber-rights.net to establish contact with Renegade through the latter's e-mail address found on the whiterenegade.com website, i.e. whiterenegade@whiterenegade.com. According to Mr. Martinez, when writing to the e-mail address whiterenegade@whiterenegade.com, the e-mail sent was automatically forwarded to a different address, in this case renegade1488ca@yahoo.com.\n[25] Through renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, Mr. Martinez, identifying himself as Rachel and using the e-mail address swedish4life@cyber-rights.net, was able to establish contact with an individual identifying himself at first as John. Mr. Martinez was not only able to communicate with John through e-mails but also through chats. Mr. Martinez was furthermore able to obtain pictures of John. In addition, Mr. Martinez made certain searches on the web in order to get more information as to the identity of John.\n[26] In his testimony, Mr. Martinez explained what information he was trying to preserve in the course of his investigation. He stated that the information he tried to capture, aside from the content of the discussions which were taking place in the e-mails and chat conversations, was the name of the sender, the name of the recipient, the date that the e-mail was sent, as well as the subject matter of the e-mail, the internet provider addresses of the servers through which the e-mail went through the Internet in order to arrive at the destination and from where it was sent.\n[27] At the hearing, Mr. Martinez explained how he went about saving the e-mail correspondence and chat conversations with Renegade. This would include copying and pasting e-mails in a word processing program as well as chat transcripts. Mr. Martinez stated that, while in the Dominican Republic, he saved the documents to an external drive whenever possible. This, he stated, was to avoid corruption of files given the rudimentary nature of the systems he was using and the constant power outages he was experiencing in March 2004 when conducting his investigation.\n[28] In the course of his correspondence with the person at renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, Mr. Martinez was able to save not all but some of the material that relates to the exchange of e-mails and chats. Because of the power outages, some of the chat conversations were lost. Mr. Martinez further testified that, as he was doing his investigative work, he would jot notes down by hand as well, notes that he would later use to compose a general profile of the investigation he was conducting.\nA. The e-mail correspondence [29] Two e-mails between John, a.k.a. David Drolet at renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, and Rachel at swedish4life@cyber-rights.net were filed as exhibits. According to the documents tendered in evidence, these two e-mails exchanges took place on March 8, 2004.\n[30] The relevant information that Mr. Martinez was able to get out of John, a.k.a. Renegade, from these two e-mails is the following:\nJohn states that he does not drink, that he goes to the gym five days a week, that he is 36 but looks 26, that he is a philosopher, athlete, and mentor, that he is in the Pacific time zone, that his birthday is March 8, (1968) that he lives in the Okanagan, that he is from Kelowna, that his nickname on Stormfront is Renegade, that is avatar is a drawing of a little shark,\n[31] Furthermore, in the e-mails, John states about the whiterenegade.com site that it is his own personal online manifesto, that it is not a group, that he had however co-founded a group called BC White Pride, that he helped write much of the content on the site at www.bcwhitepride.com.\nB. Chat discussions [32] Following the March 8, 2004 e-mail exchange, Rachel and John continued corresponding through online chatting on Yahoo Messenger. The chatting took place between Swedishpride1488 - Rachel - and Renegade1488ca - John.\n[33] Transcripts of the chat conversations were put in evidence by Mr. Martinez. The chat conversations, according to the transcripts, took place between March 10 and March 29, 2004.\n[34] The chat conversations refer to pictures sent by Renegade1488ca to Swedishpride1488. They reveal that Renegade1488ca's middle name was David. The transcripts also show that Renegade1488ca had, with the help of his friend and comrade Craig, co-founded BC White Pride, that he loved dogs. The chat transcripts moreover show that Renegade1488ca, a.k.a. John, had never been married and that he was five feet, seven inches tall.\n[35] Mr. Martinez used all the information he was able to gather in the course of the e-mail exchanges and chat talks to create a profile that, he submits, matches Mr. Beck's profile.\nC. The pictures [36] The evidence shows that, in the course of his e-mails exchange with John, a.k.a. Renegade, the latter sent to Mr. Martinez pictures of himself. These pictures were filed as Exhibit PH-4B (black and white pictures) and PH-4E (colour pictures). Two of the pictures represent a man in an athletic posture, and two are of a man coming out of the water. The last one represents a man smiling.\n[37] Asked in the course of his testimony if he saw the person in the pictures in the hearing room, Mr. Martinez pointed to Mr. Beck. Asked if he saw any difference with respect to the pictures, Mr. Martinez pointed out that Mr. Beck had grown a beard.\nD. Additional information [38] Apart from the e-mails, the chat transcripts and the pictures sent to Mr. Martinez using the persona of Rachel, there are other pieces of information which are relevant to the issues to be decided in relation to this motion.\n[39] The Commission filed as exhibits Mr. Beck's income tax reports for the year 2004 and 2005. These reports show that Mr. Beck lives in Kelowna and identify his home address.\n[40] In his testimony, Mr. Martinez asserted that this information, Mr. Beck's address, was provided to him by John when he was conducting his investigation in the Dominican Republic but that, unfortunately, he was not able to save the chat transcript related to that information. Mr. Martinez further stated that John had provided Rachel with his address so that the latter could send him a postcard.\n[41] Mr. Martinez stated in his testimony that when he obtained John's address, he made a reverse check through 411.ca on the address online to see if that address actually existed. The check confirmed the existence of the address. The income tax return forms filed by the Commission with respect to Mr. Beck show that the latter lives at the address that Mr. Martinez asserts he obtained from John in the course of his investigation.\n[42] Finally, it appears from the website pages tendered in evidence by Mr. Martinez that www.bcwhitepride.org is a website that is now situated in the USA and, as www.whiterenegade.com, has been owned since November 24, 2006, that is a few days before the commencement of this hearing, by Hal Turner Radio Network. The documentary evidence also shows that BC White Pride is associated with the website www.bcwhitepride.org.\nV. ANALYSIS [43] In the present proceedings, the Commission wishes to add as respondents Mr. John Beck, B.C. White Pride Group, White Renegade Group and www.bcwhitepride.org. Of these four entities, none were served with the Commission's motion. Mr. Beck was however served with a subpoena duces tecum, ordering him to appear as a witness in relation to the present motion. As stated previously, Mr. Beck attended the present proceedings and made representations through his agent, Mr. Fromm.\n[44] Mr. Beck is a clearly identified individual. As for B.C. White Pride Group and White Renegade Group, they are undefined groups. Www.bcwhitepride.org is a website.\n[45] The Tribunal's Rules of Procedure contemplate the addition of a party to an inquiry on motion of another party. Section 8 (3) of the Rules provide that:\nWhere the Commission, a respondent or a complainant seeks to add a party to the inquiry, it may bring a motion for an order to this effect, which motion shall be served on the prospective party, and the prospective party shall be entitled to make submissions on the motion.\n[46] In Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone v. Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 CHRT 31, the Tribunal stated that the forced addition of a new respondent once the Tribunal has been charged with inquiring into a complaint is appropriate, in the absence of formal rules to this effect, if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint of which the Tribunal is seized and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint, para. 30. This ruling was followed by this Tribunal in Brown and the Canadian Human Rights Commission v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43.\n[47] The evidence presented in relation to the Commission's motion is both testimonial and documentary. It consists of Mr. Shane Martinez's testimony, the file he created with respect to bcwhitepride and Mr. Beck as well as webpages. It also consists of the testimony of Mr. Bernard Klatt, called by Mr. Fromm as an expert witness.\n[48] In his cross-examination of Mr. Martinez, Mr. Fromm attacked Mr. Martinez's credibility as well as the reliability of the documents he prepared in 2004 while he was in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Fromm criticized the way Mr. Martinez went about collecting information on bcwhitepride.com and whiterenegade.com, using deception, impersonation. Mr. Fromm argued that, given Mr. Martinez's ideology and background, he should not be seen as a trustworthy witness.\n[49] The evidence shows that Mr. Fromm and Mr. Martinez have a long history of violent confrontation. Excerpts from a DVD viewed by the Tribunal attest to that. To say the least, they have never entertained a peace-love relationship.\n[50] The Tribunal must say that Mr. Martinez was, at times, in his testimony, evasive, unresponsive and forgetful in relation to questions pertaining to his political views and postings he might have made on certain websites, such as Stormfront. Mr. Martinez's calm and polite demeanour before the Tribunal is in stark contrast with his behaviour in protests, rallies and other events which occurred in Toronto in 2004. His actions, in many ways, are not in tune with what he says.\n[51] Mr. Fromm called as a witness Mr. Bernard Klatt. Mr. Klatt was qualified by the Tribunal as an expert in internet services. In the course of Mr. Klatt's qualification as an expert, Counsel for the Commission challenged Mr. Klatt's credibility and objectivity by suggesting the he was a close friend of Mr. Beck, Mr. Fromm, as well as a friend of Ernst Z\u00fcndel.\n[52] Mr. Klatt acknowledged that he has known Mr. Fromm since 1996, that he has known Mr. Beck since 1998, that he got to know Mr. Beck in the context of media publicity that arose with respect to what was referred to as the Oliver controversy. The Oliver controversy had to do with an individual taking exception to the fact that Mr. Klatt was hosting websites which were considered hateful.\n[53] Generally speaking, Mr. Klatt was, to say the least, evasive in his answers as to his links and association with the White supremacy movement, Mr. Beck and Mr. Z\u00fcndel. As for his ties with Mr. Beck, Mr. Klatt had difficulty remembering the type of conversations he has had with Mr. Beck over the past 8 years. This is quite surprising given their long lasting relation.\n[54] As for his expert evidence, Mr. Klatt expressed the view that the material supplied by Mr. Martinez had significant flaws and drawbacks associated with it, that the value of the material was questionable and raised significant doubts. According to Mr. Klatt, Mr. Martinez could have done a better job in saving the e-mails and the transcripts of the chat conversations which were tendered in evidence, that a more reliable form of evidence in terms of the e-mail exchange and the chat messages could have been provided.\n[55] The Tribunal finds Mr. Klatt's testimony not persuasive enough for this Tribunal to conclude that the content of the e-mails and chat conversations between Rachel and John, as saved by Mr. Martinez, was in any way altered by Mr. Martinez.\n[56] This said, in the present case, the documentary evidence supports Mr. Martinez's testimony. On the one hand, there is no reason for the Tribunal to find that Mr. Martinez tampered in any way with the content of the e-mails and chat transcripts put in evidence. In his testimony, Mr. Martinez clearly explained the process he used to collect the information on www.bcwhitepride.com, BC White Pride and John, a.k.a. David Drolet, a.k.a. Renegade1488ca, that Mr. Martinez believes to be Mr. John Beck.\n[57] The Tribunal thus finds that the content of the e-mails tendered in evidence as well as the chat transcripts are, on a balance of probabilities, truthful and trustworthy and can be relied upon to determine the identity of the entities that the Commission wishes to add as parties to the present inquiry.\nA. Mr. John Beck [58] Although in attendance throughout the hearing of the motion, Mr. Beck was not called as a witness. Thus, there is no direct testimonial evidence establishing conclusively that John Beck is the John, alias Renegade, alias David Drolet with whom Rachel was in contact through e-mails or chat conversations. The link between John Beck and John, and his different alias, can thus only be established through circumstantial evidence.\n[59] The evidence shows that Renegade1488ca, John or David Drolet never identified themselves as John Beck. The record shows John, David Drolet, etc. were the identifiers used by someone who corresponded with Rachel in March 2004.\n[60] Mr. Martinez assumes and strongly argues that the John, David Drolet, Renegade with whom he corresponded, using the alias Rachel, was in fact John Beck. He relies on a number of physical features, such as the height, the color of the eyes, the color of the hair, the shoulder size. According to Mr. Martinez, the profile he created, using information gathered from different sources, fits Mr. Beck's overall description.\n[61] Mr. Martinez is not an expert in forensic identification, nor is the Tribunal. The Tribunal was however able to assess that Mr. Beck's height is about five feet, seven inches when compared to other individuals, that he has blue eyes, and looks like in his late 30's. The Tribunal was also able to compare the pictures tendered in evidence by Mr. Martinez, pictures that were sent to him by John, a.k.a. Renegade. Two of the pictures show a man in a swimsuit in an athletic posture. The facial features, when compared to those of Mr. Beck, strongly resemble those of Mr. Beck.\n[62] That Mr. John Beck is probably the person with whom Mr. Martinez, using the persona of Rachel, corresponded with in 2004 is further supported by other pieces of evidence, such as the fact that Mr. Beck, according to a reverse search on 411.ca done by Mr. Martinez, lives in Kelowna BC. This information, as well as Mr. Beck's address is confirmed by Mr. Beck's 2004 and 2005 Tax Return Summary which was put in evidence by the Commission.\n[63] The Tribunal finds that, in the present case, the circumstantial evidence is strong enough to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. John Beck is the person with whom Mr. Martinez corresponded with in 2004 and to link Mr. John Beck to BC White Pride, whether the group or the website. The Tribunal concludes that Mr. Beck should be added as a party to the present inquiry, his presence being necessary to dispose fully of the complaint.\n[64] This said, it will always be opened for Mr. Beck to show that he is not the John with whom Rachel corresponded with in 2004 and that he is not, in any way, associated with BC White Pride, www.bcwhitepride.com, or www.bcwhitepride.org.\nB. Bcwhitepride.org [65] The evidence shows that Mr. Martinez was able to access a website called www.bcwhitepride.org and download many webpages from the site, webpages which, with regard to their content, resemble, in many ways, pages that used to be on the bcwhitepride.com website.\n[66] A search on BetterWhois.com as well as Whois.net shows that the domain name bcwhitepride.org was created in July 2004. According to Mr. Martinez, this information is reliable given that it is generated automatically.\n[67] In the present context, it appears that bcwhitepride.org is in fact intimately associated with bcwhitepride.com. In the course of his testimony, Mr. Martinez stated that it was not uncommon for someone who creates a website to use different dot, such as .com, .net, .ca, etc.\n[68] Whether or not either or both of these sites are legal entities are issues which still have to be decided. At the hearing, Mr. Fromm indicated that this issue was still a live issue which might be raised in the future.\n[69] Without deciding, for now, whether or not a website is an entity which has legal status or standing, the Tribunal finds that www.bcwhitepride.org is a website that exists and is most probably an offshoot of www.bcwhitepride.com. The Tribunal finds that www.bcwhitepride.org's presence in the present proceedings is necessary to fully dispose of the complaint.\nC. BC White Pride Group [70] The Commission contends that there exists, in British Columbia, a group called BC White Pride. Many exhibits tendered in evidence refer to the existence of such a group.\n[71] For example, one can find many references to BC White Pride on the bcwhitepride.org site. A webpage found on the bcwhitepride.org site contains the following text:\nWelcome to BC White Pride\nThere's a bold new movement being championed in British Columbia\nfocused specifically on educating White people regarding issues of concern such as immigration\n[72] The existence of a group called BC White Pride is furthermore confirmed by John, alias Renegade. In an e-mail dated March 8, 2004 sent to Rachel, John states that whiterenegade.com is his own personal online manifesto and not a group. He however acknowledges having co-founded a group called BC White Pride. In a chat conversation with Rachel on March 10th, 2004, John again refers to the fact that he co-founded BC White Pride with a friend and comrade called Craig.\n[73] The Tribunal finds that, on a balance of probabilities, there exists such a group calling itself BC White Pride and that its presence is necessary to fully dispose of this complaint.\nD. White Renegade Group [74] The Commission contends that there exists, in British Columbia, a group called White Renegade. The evidence does not reveal that such a group exists. It however shows that a website www.whiterenegade.com exists and that it is the online manifesto of John which whom Rachel corresponded.\n[75] It must be noted here that www.whiterenegade.com is not a party to the present proceedings.\n[76] Given the absence of any evidence showing that White Renegade is a group, the Tribunal cannot conclude to the existence of a group called White Renegade. Hence, the Commission's request to add this group as a party in the present proceedings is denied.\nVI. RULING [77] Given that Mr. Beck was present throughout the present proceedings and made submissions through Mr. Fromm as to why he should not be added as a party and given the evidence, the Tribunal orders that Mr. John Beck be added as a party to the present proceedings.\n[78] Given that the evidence shows that BC White Pride Group and www.bcwhitepride.org are entities which exist, the Tribunal orders that they be served with this ruling so that they can, in due course, make submissions on the Commission's motion to add them as parties.\n[79] Given the lack of evidence as to the existence of White Renegade Group, the Commission's request to add White Renegade Group as a party is denied.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario May 18, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1120\/0206\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nCenter for Research-Action on Race Relations v. www.bcwhitepride.com\nDATE AND PLACE OF HEARING:\nNovember 28 to 30, 2006 and April 10 to 13, 2007\nRULING OF THE TRIBUNAL DATED:\nMay 18, 2007\nAPPEARANCES:\nFo Niemi\nFor the Complainant\nGiacomo Vigna\nFor the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nPaul Fromm\nFor the Respondent\n",

Hadjis\n[1] Marc Lemire has requested that I issue a subpoena to be served on Bell Canada for all documents and information concerning the IP Address 70.48.181.203.\n[2] During the examination of Canadian Human Rights Commission employee, Dean Stacey, on May 10, 2007, evidence was adduced regarding postings on the Stormfront.org message board that were made by someone using the account identified as Jadewarr. Mr. Lemire claims that this person is in fact a Commission employee. His conclusion is based on the testimony given by Richard Warman in another Tribunal hearing, as well as a number of documents that have been produced in the present case. According to Mr. Lemire, this evidence demonstrates that the Commission has been actively engaging on message boards with him and other individuals who are respondents in similar human rights cases. This indicates, he argues, that the Commission's activities are going far beyond attempting to ameliorate discrimination, and are impacting the fairness of its procedures, the rights of complainants and respondents both, and the guarantees to Charter rights. In addition, this evidence would contradict the testimony of Mr. Steacy to the effect that the Commission does not participate in message board discussions.\n[3] Apparently, Mr. Lemire has additional documentation in his possession indicating that the IP Address assigned to the computer from which Jadewarr posted was 70.48.181.203. I gather that the Internet Service Provider who assigned this address to the end user was Bell Canada. Mr. Lemire wishes, therefore, to summon a Bell Canada representative to bring all documents and information concerning the IP Address to the hearing, and perhaps definitively establish whether a Commission employee was posting on the message board under the Jadewarr account.\n[4] The Commission has filed a formal objection to the disclosure of this information, pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5. In a letter from its Acting Senior Counsel, Philippe Dufresne, the Commission certifies to the Tribunal that this information should not be disclosed on the basis of the public interest as the disclosure of this information would be prejudicial to the Commission's investigative process.\n[5] The relevant provisions of s. 37 of the CEA are the following:\nSPECIFIED PUBLIC INTEREST\n37. (1) Subject to sections 38 to 38.16, a Minister of the Crown in right of Canada or other official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information by certifying orally or in writing to the court, person or body that the information should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest.\n(1.1) If an objection is made under subsection (1), the court, person or body shall ensure that the information is not disclosed other than in accordance with this Act.\n(2) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a superior court, that court may determine the objection.\n(3) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a court, person or body other than a superior court, the objection may be determined, on application, by\nthe Federal Court, in the case of a person or body vested with power to compel production by or under an Act of Parliament if the person or body is not a court established under a law of a province; or the trial division or trial court of the superior court of the province within which the court, person or body exercises its jurisdiction, in any other case.\n[...]\nRENSEIGNEMENTS D'INT\u00c9R\u00caT PUBLIC\n37. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des articles 38 \u00e0 38.16, tout ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou tout fonctionnaire peut s'opposer \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements aupr\u00e8s d'un tribunal, d'un organisme ou d'une personne ayant le pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements, en attestant verbalement ou par \u00e9crit devant eux que, pour des raisons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, ces renseignements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n(1.1) En cas d'opposition, le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne veille \u00e0 ce que les renseignements ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s, sauf en conformit\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n(2) Si l'opposition est port\u00e9e devant une cour sup\u00e9rieure, celle-ci peut d\u00e9cider la question.\n(3) Si l'opposition est port\u00e9e devant un tribunal, un organisme ou une personne qui ne constituent pas une cour sup\u00e9rieure, la question peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, sur demande, par :\nla Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans les cas o\u00f9 l'organisme ou la personne investis du pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements sous le r\u00e9gime d'une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne constituent pas un tribunal r\u00e9gi par le droit d'une province; la division ou le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance de la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province dans le ressort de laquelle le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne ont comp\u00e9tence, dans les autres cas.\n[...]\n[6] Section 36.1 of the CEA states that the term official has the same meaning as in s. 118 of the Criminal Code, which in turn provides that an official means a person who holds an office or who is appointed to discharge a public duty. I am satisfied that Mr. Dufresne, in his capacity as Acting General Counsel for the Commission, is a person appointed to discharge a public duty, within the meaning of s. 118. I would note, furthermore, that this is not the first time that Commission lawyers have invoked s. 37 to prevent the disclosure of information in this case. At no time has any party argued on those occasions or the present one, that Commission counsel is not an official within the meaning of s. 37.\n[7] Once an official has made an objection under s. 37(1) of the CEA, the court, person or body in receipt of the objection is required to ensure that the information is not disclosed other than in accordance with the CEA (s. 37(1.1)). In hearings before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, the objection may only be determined, on application, by the Federal Court (s. 37(3)(a)).\n[8] One of the interested parties in this case, the Canadian Association for Free Expression (CAFE), submits that the Commission's objection is premature. It contends that the words of s. 37 do not preclude the obtaining of information, only its production as evidence. I disagree. Section 37(1) states that an official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body. The restriction is not limited to production as evidence. Moreover, the Tribunal's power to issue the subpoena being sought by Mr. Lemire is derived from s. 50(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which provides that the Tribunal may summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint. Thus, the subpoena that Mr. Lemire is seeking would compel the Bell Canada representative to attend the hearing and produce the documents relating to the above noted IP Address, not to merely enable Mr. Lemire to obtain information.\n[9] For his part, Mr. Lemire contends that since s. 37(1) states that an official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, the objection can only be made when the Bell Canada witness physically appears before the Tribunal at the hearing.\n[10] I do not agree with this submission either. Section 37(1) is, in my view, explicit in this regard. The phrase before a court, person or body relates to the disclosure of information. It is the act of disclosing the information before the court, person or body, to which the officer may object. In addition, according to s. 37(1), an official may certify the objection orally or in writing. If an objection under s. 37 was only intended to be made in open court, why would the legislator have given officials the option of certifying their objections in writing? Logically, this provision must contemplate the possibility of an official making his or her objection known in advance of the moment when the information is to be disclosed. Mr. Dufresne's objection is therefore not premature.\n[11] Furthermore, Mr. Dufresne's certification in writing of the objection states that the specific information referenced in the subpoena request should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest. In these circumstances, it would be absurd for the Tribunal to summon the witness and compel him or her to produce documents that we know are the object of a s. 37 objection. Given that the witness, according to the subpoena request, would not have any other evidence to present, I do not consider his or her evidence or documents as necessary for the full hearing of the complaint, within the meaning of s. 50(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. As is noted in the text of Alan W. Mewett & Peter J. Sankoff, Witnesses, looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 2004) at 7-17, n. 104, where it is clear that a witness cannot offer any admissible evidence because, for example, any such evidence would be privileged, the subpoena may be quashed.\n[12] Mr. Lemire's request for a subpoena of Bell Canada for all documents and information concerning the IP Address 70.48.181.203 is therefore denied.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

This event involved an exchange which allegedly took place between Ms. Montreuil, the complainant, and one of the respondent\u2019s experts.\n[2] The Tribunal deemed that the event was serious enough to warrant hearing the expert for the respondent concerned, i.e. Dr. Marylin Wilchesky.\n[3] From Dr. Wilchesky\u2019s sworn testimony, it appears that sometime during the morning recess, while Dr. Wilchesky was alone at the back of the hearing room, Ms. Montreuil allegedly approached her and asked her in French whether she was prepared to endure the same torture (suggesting mental torture) as the current witness (Dr. Pierre Assalian), and also added some other remarks about her prospective testimony.\n[4] Dr. Wilchesky testified that she understood from Ms. Montreuil that she was referring to the scrutiny of every document, every word of every document submitted in evidence.\n[5] In her testimony, Dr. Wilchesky stated that she felt she was being pressured not to testify as an expert witness in this matter. She also stated that she sensed dread and found that the remarks made were threatening (the words were threatening), not physically but mentally. She, however, stated that when Ms. Montreuil approached her, she did not feel physically threatened.\n[6] Ms. Montreuil did not deny the essence of the facts reported by Dr. Wilchesky. She did not deny using the word torture when she spoke to Dr. Wilchesky. She contended that, in making these remarks, she wanted to make it clear to Dr. Wilchesky that her testimony would not add anything to Dr. Assalian\u2019s testimony, given that she had signed a joint report with Dr. Dufour and Dr. Assalian.\n[7] The respondent\u2019s counsel argued that Ms. Montreuil\u2019s remarks, specifically the use of the word torture, was a form of intimidation of a person who could potentially testify in this matter.\n[8] The expert witnesses whose services have been retained by a party are supposed to enlighten the Tribunal on technical or scientific points which are not of judicial knowledge. They must be given the utmost respect, as with any other witness.\n[9] Nobody can upset the peace of mind of these witnesses during the proceedings. This cannot serve the interests of justice in any way. To the contrary, improper remarks can only compromise the proper administration of justice.\n[10] In this case, regardless of Ms. Montreuil\u2019s exact words to Dr. Wilchesky on May 17, 2007, Dr. Wilchesky\u2019s uncontradicted testimony indicated that Ms. Montreuil used the word torture in reference to her prospective testimony, that Dr. Wilchesky perceived the words as a threat, and that they aroused some fear in her.\n[11] The Tribunal considers that Ms. Montreuil\u2019s conduct vis-\u00e0-vis Dr. Wilchesky in the hearing room during the morning recess on May 17, 2007, was inappropriate, as were even more inappropriate the words that she was alleged to have used, namely, the use of the word torture in reference to Dr. Wilchesky\u2019s prospective cross-examination.\n[12] It is unfortunate that counsel would perceive the cross-examination of a witness as a form of mental torture and that counsel would share this with a potential witness of the opposing party. Even more unfortunate is the fact that a witness was made to feel that her testimony was not welcome.\n[13] Ms. Montreuil\u2019s intention may not have been to intimidate Dr. Wilchesky. Dr. Wilchesky nevertheless perceived the remarks made as intimidating. In this case, there was absolutely no need for Ms. Montreuil to discuss the prospective cross-examination of Dr. Wilchesky outside the presence of the respondent\u2019s counsel. Had counsel been present, Ms. Montreuil would not have allowed herself to say such things.\n[14] Accordingly, the Tribunal reiterates the order dated May 17, 2007, to the effect that, in these proceedings, Ms. Micheline Montreuil is forbidden to approach the opposing party\u2019s expert witnesses to speak to them unless the respondent\u2019s counsel are present. This order also applied to other persons who the respondent could later call as witnesses in regard to the hearing of this complaint.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario May 8, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1047\/2805\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

On November 25, 2006, the hearing was adjourned, the date of its resumption to be determined at a later time.\n[3] On January 4, 2007, a conference call took place in relation to the resumption of the present hearing. Participating were the Chairperson; the Registrar; Mr. Warman, the Complainant; Ms. Snider, the Commission's Counsel; Ms. Guille, one of the two Respondents; Mr. Fromm, as agent for the Respondent Canadian Heritage Alliance as well as Mr. Kulbashian, as agent for Ms. Guille.\n[4] Initially, the purpose of the conference call was to consider how many days needed to be set aside in order to complete the hearing as well as when the hearing could resume, given that Ms. Guille had stated that she had difficulties freeing herself from her work for more than 2 days in a row in a month and that she would not be able to do so before the month of August 2007, at the earliest.\n[5] At the time, Mr. Warman and Ms. Snider expressed their disagreement with respect to Mr. Guille's request that, given her employment limitations, the hearing only resume in the fall and that it be for a few days here and there.\n[6] During the January 4, 2007 conference call, many possibilities were examined with respect to the resumption of the hearing. It appeared then that Mr. Fromm, Mr. Warman and Ms. Snider were not available in February because of another human rights hearing, that the Tribunal member chairing the hearing was not available in March, April, May and July due to already scheduled or to be scheduled hearings, and had limited availability in June. As for Ms. Snider, she was not available in August.\n[7] Thus, because of the lack of availability of the Tribunal member chairing the hearing as well as of the parties throughout the months of February to August, it became apparent that the hearing could not unfortunately resume before the month of September 2007.\n[8] At the end of the conference call, which lasted for one hour and a half, after having explored and discussed the availability of the parties in the fall, everyone, Ms. Guille and Mr. Kulbashian included, agreed that the hearing could resume in September 2007. Four days were then set aside for the completion of the evidence, i.e. September 4 to 7 and two days, at the end of September, for oral pleadings, i.e. September 24 and 25. Everyone present on the conference call agreed with these dates.\n[9] After the conference call, Mr. Kulbashian and Ms. Guille wrote to the Tribunal stating that they had felt pressured by the Tribunal to agree to the resumption of the hearing in September and asked that the Tribunal reconsider its decision.\n[10] Following the January 4, 2007 conference call, many attempts were made by the Tribunal to arrange a second conference call to deal with dates and disclosure issues. However, given that it became close to impossible to have all the parties available at the same time, the Tribunal ordered that any request that any of the parties wished to submit to the Tribunal be made in writing.\n[11] In a letter sent to the Tribunal, on March 27, 2007, Mr. Kulbashian indicated dates in the months of August, September, October and November 2007 where Ms. Guille would be available to attend the hearing with an indication of how many days in a row she could free herself. Mr. Kulbashian indicated in his letter that, in the month of September, Ms. Guille would be available September 5 to 7, 2007 or September 24 to 26, 2007. Mr. Kulbashian also suggested that the hearing be held in Toronto or Oakville.\n[12] Human rights hearings should not be spread over long periods of time. The Tribunal's Rules of Procedure state that hearings should be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Hearings should thus be scheduled so as to have the hearing completed within a relatively short period of time.\n[13] This said, there may be circumstances where, because of the lack of availability of the Tribunal member chairing the hearing as well as the parties and their counsel, hearing dates have to be set far apart which is the case in the present proceedings. This is not ideal.\n[14] In the present case, the Tribunal considers that Ms. Guille has and has had ample time to make arrangements with her employer in order to be able to be present at the hearing on the already set dates. Ms. Guille cannot hold the present hearing at bay for ever and have her personal situation determine the hearing schedule irrespective of other considerations.\n[15] Mr. Warman and the Commission have indicated that they expect to have completed the presentation of their evidence within two days. At the present time, the only witness left to be heard is Mr. Warman. This said, Ms. Guille has yet to indicate if she will testify or not. Nonetheless, two days have been set aside in case she decides to do so.\n[16] Thus, four days are scheduled for the parties to complete the presentation of their evidence. Given Ms. Guille's time constraints, the Tribunal does not exclude the possibility for the Tribunal, when the hearing resumes, to sit longer hours in order to have the hearing completed within three days.\n[17] Furthermore, taking into consideration Ms. Guille's limited availability in September, i.e. a period of three days either at the beginning of the month or at the end of the month, the Tribunal finds that written submissions are warranted in the present circumstances instead of oral submissions. This measure will in fact eliminate the necessity for Ms. Guille to attend two hearing sessions in the month of September.\n[18] For the above mentioned reasons, the hearing dates previously set with respect to the resumption of the hearing in Toronto, i.e. September 4 to 7, 2007, are confirmed. The hearing dates previously set aside for oral submissions, i.e. September 24 and 25, 2007, are cancelled. The parties will be requested to file written submissions.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario May 29, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1089\/7005 and T1090\/7105\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRichard Warman v.

More specifically, the Tribunal orders that Mr. Warman disclose, if he has not yet done so, to the respondents through the Tribunal:\nany document that mentions the respondents; a list of names of forum accounts that Mr. Warman might have created which gives him the ability to post messages on any Canadian Heritage Alliance forum.\n[4] Further, the Tribunal directs Mr. Warman to provide to the Tribunal speech notes, text or audiotapes related to an event which took place on January 18, 2007 in relation to an anti-racist gathering in Toronto.

CONCLUSION\nI. Introduction [1] On August 8 and October 25, 2003, William Carl Witwicky (the complainant) filed two complaints under Sections 7, 10, 14 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) against Canadian National Railway (the respondent). The complaints allege that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of disability and retaliation in a matter related to employment.\nA. The Facts [2] The complainant grew up in the town of Jasper, Alberta, where he lived for thirty five years. He came from what he described as a railway family. He began working for the respondent on July 2 nd, 1975, as a part-time employee. He got hired on a full time basis on July 22, 1977. He has since been working for the respondent, at the exclusion of a period of eight months, during which he had been dismissed.\n[3] The complainant is a train conductor. Conductors are part of a group of employees commonly called the running trades. These employees operate the trains. The complainant works out of Kamloops, British Columbia, where he also resides.\nII. THE EVENTS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 [4] On December 30, 2001, the complainant was called to work a train from Kamloops to Jasper, Alberta. The trip to Jasper took close to twelve hours. The train arrived in Jasper at 12:15 p.m., on December 31, 2001. Jasper being the final terminal, the complainant booked an eight (8) hours rest period This rest period would have ended at 10:15 p.m. at which time he would be subject to a call for work.\n[5] The complainant received excessive layover pay1 for the period between 11:15 p.m., on December 31, and 6:55 a.m., on January 1, 2002. For this period, he received a compensation of $126.90. During his cross-examination, he said that he first became aware, on March 28, 2002, that he had been paid excessive layover pay for that period. He added that he had offered to return the money, but that the respondent had refused.\n[6] Upon arriving in Jasper, the complainant booked a room at the bunkhouse. The bunkhouse is a facility where employees can book a room to rest before returning to work. While there he phoned his wife with whom he had recently separated. According to his own words, this conversation went sour and she informed him that she was going to file for divorce. He said that this information left him devastated.\n[7] The complainant's sister lives in Jasper. After his conversation with his wife, he went over to her house to talk to her about his marital problems. They discussed his emotional state. He described himself as very distraught and upset. He added that he had been up all night and still hadn't had anything to eat. In his own word he was basically a mess.\n[8] After talking with his sister, he decided to book himself off as unfit for duty. He had decided to stay in Jasper for a few days, as this was his last trip prior to his holidays.\n[9] In order to book himself off, he telephoned the Crew Management Centre (CMC) in Edmonton, Alberta. The CMC oversees the day-to-day assignment of the manpower for the respondent's trains. The CMC works off a computer system referred to as the CATS, an acronym which stands for Crew Accountability and Timekeeping System. This system is used to help the CMC identify which employees are available for work at all time. According to the evidence of Richard Froment, the manager of CMC for Western Canada, the computer system ties into a train line-up and shows at what time the train is scheduled to run. CMC then identifies which employees will be working on those trains.\n[10] Mr. Froment testified as to the procedure used by employees to book on or off the system. Booking off requires that the employee call CMC and tell them that he wants to be placed on a status other than available. The respondent is thereby informed that that employee is not available for work. The dispatcher will enter this information into the system. When this is done, it creates a permanent record that remains in the system for three years. After that period, the information is archived electronically and is available on request.\n[11] The CATS does not show whether an employee booked off at his at-home terminal or at an away-from-home terminal. According to Mr. Froment, if an employee books off at the away-from-home terminal, the system automatically transfers the employee's turn back to his home terminal. By this, he means that the system will indicate that the employee is located at this home terminal. The crew dispatcher will also notify the Chief Rail Traffic Controller who is responsible to line up the manpower at the away-from-home terminal, so that he can find a replacement for the employee booking-off. Mr Froment indicated that booking off at the away-from-home terminal is very rare.\n[12] An employee who has booked off is not subject to be called to work. In order to book-on again the employee has to call the CMC and request to be booked available. Mr. Froment explained that an employee who asks to be booked back on at an away-from-home terminal would, as a rule, be booked back on at his home terminal, although he accepted that it was possible to do it at the away-from-home terminal. CMC has the ability to take the employee's turn and move it to the away-from-home terminal but Mr. Froment added that in his twelve years at the CMC, he had never seen an employee book back on at the away-from-home terminal.\n[13] When booking on or off, an employee must communicate with CMC by telephone. As indicated earlier, these phone calls are handled by crew dispatchers. There are eight crew dispatchers per shift working at the CMC, in Edmonton. Each dispatcher is assigned a specific territory. The employee will call a central number and will be directed to the dispatcher for his region. Mr. Froment explained that two methods are used to record the information when an employee calls in: first, the CATS system will stamp a permanent record into the system when the employee calls and secondly, their will be an audio recording of the call. Mr. Froment added that the crew dispatchers are told to keep the employee on the phone until all the information is taken down and recorded in the system. CMC wants to make sure that all the actions necessary to book an employee off are completed before the dispatcher moves on to another task. This method of recording calls was in place on December 31, 2001. At that time, the system used for recording the calls was described by Mr. Froment as a reel-to-reel system. Each tape would contain approximately one week's worth of data. It recorded the calls as they were received; so finding a specific call on the tape could be difficult.\n[14] It would appear that in the case of the purported conversation between the complainant and CMC on December 31, 2001, no recording could be found. When cross-examined on this point, Mr. Froment acknowledged that a tape of the calls received on that day existed. He also said that he could not explain why a copy of this tape was not provided to the union when requested. Finally, he added that he had not reviewed the tape for that day before the hearing.\n[15] During his cross-examination, Mr. Froment accepted that errors did happen and that employees were not booked-off or booked-on when they should have been. He also indicated that this was normal considering that CMC receives over a million calls per year. He further specified there would be probably six incidents a month on average where an employee was booked off incorrectly.\n[16] A printout of the complainant's work history for December 30, 2001 to January 3, 2002, as recorded on the CATS system, was entered in evidence. There was no record on the work history of the complainant booking off unfit on any of those dates.\n[17] Coming back to the evening of December 31, after his sister had left with some friends, the complainant went out for dinner with a friend. He acknowledges that he had some drinks of alcohol during that evening. He testified that to the best of my recollection it was maybe a total of six or seven drinks.\n[18] Later during the evening, at around 10:30 p.m., the complainant was taken into custody by the RCMP when he was found passed out in a stolen vehicle. According to the complainant's recollection, when he left the restaurant there was a long wait for taxis. He said that he was offered a drive by an individual whom he believed worked at the restaurant. After a couple of blocks the driver abandoned the vehicle and that is where the RCMP officers found him.\n[19] He spent the night of January 1, 2001, in police custody. The next morning, at 7:25 a.m., he provided a statement to the police. According to the police document, this interview ended at 7:52 a.m. The complainant was initially charged with possession of stolen property. This charge was later dropped.\n[20] The complainant was released from police custody on the morning of January 1, 2002, a little before 8:00 a.m. He got a ride with an off-duty RCMP officer to the bunkhouse to retrieve his belongings. He arrived at the bunkhouse a little after 8:00 a.m. He was then told that a supervisor was looking for him to take a call for duty on a train leaving for Kamloops.\n[21] According to David James, who was the on-duty supervisor in Jasper, the complainant was ordered on a train for 7:10 a.m. At the away-from-home terminal, the employee is responsible to provide the CMC with a room number where he or she can be reached. In this particular case, when it came time to call the complainant, he was nowhere to be found. CMC was notified and the MCO (Manager of Corridor Operations) contacted Mr. James at his home to advise him of the situation. Mr. James testified that he made a few phone calls. One to the hospital, in Jasper, and another to the RCMP, to see if they had any knowledge of where the complainant might be, but to no avail. The call to the RCMP was automatically forwarded to the Edson detachment, a town about 160 kilometres away, because there were no on-duty RCMP officers at Jasper at the time. This is surprising since Mr. James testified that he made the calls between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m., and the complainant at that time was still detained at the Jasper detachment. The answer given by the Edson detachment, according to Mr. James, is also surprising since it appears that they did not bother checking with the detachment in Jasper where they would have found an answer to their queries.\n[22] Mr. James added that he also spoke to Larry Hindle, the engineer who had worked the train with the complainant the previous day to see if he knew about the complainant's whereabouts. Mr. Hindle answered that did not know where the complainant was.\n[23] At approximately 8:10 a.m., just before he was getting ready to drive to Jasper, Mr. James got a call from the bunkhouse attendant indicating that the complainant had just showed up. He then asked to speak to the complainant. He said that he asked him where he had been and the complainant answered I spent the night at a friend's place. He also added that he had asked him why he had not let anybody know where he could be reached. The complainant answered I screwed up and would in the future do this.. He finally asked the complainant if he was fit to go to work, to which he answered that he was. Based on this answer and on the fact that the complainant sounded normal, Mr. James told him to get on the train as soon as possible. On cross-examination, the complainant conceded that at no time during this conversation did he mention that he had booked himself off as being unfit the night before, nor did he later contact the CMC to book himself back on, as it would be the normal procedure.\n[24] Later that same morning, Mr. James phoned Mr. Mitch McAmmond, the on-duty train master in Kamloops, and told him that the complainant had been late for his assignment at Jasper. He also informed him that the train had been delayed as a result. He suggested that Mr. McAmmond may want to speak to the complainant upon his arrival in Kamloops.\n[25] The train got into Kamloops at about 7:00 p.m. on January 1, 2002. On arriving at destination, the locomotive engineer, Larry Hindle, and the complainant proceeded to do their time return tie up in the computer room. At that time, according to the complainant, supervisor McAmmond walked through the room. He wished them both a happy New Year and then inquired how the trip had gone. He never questioned the complainant. Larry Hindle corroborated this version of the events.\n[26] The version of Mr. McAmmond is quite different. He testified that when he saw the train arriving, he walked towards it to meet the crew. He said that he saw Mr. Hindle get off and that he waited for the complainant to come off but he never did. Mr. McAmmond got on board the train to see if the complainant was still there but he did not find him. He then went back into the building and asked Mr. Hindle if he knew where the complainant was, Mr. Hindle answered that he did not. He added that he was never able to locate the complainant on January 1, 2002. If the version of Mr. McAmmond is correct, then the complainant would have had to have gotten off the train before it pulled into the station at Kamloops. This certainly would be very unusual and one would expect the respondent to investigate such an incident. It is curious that Mr. McAmmond did not pursue this matter further by interviewing the complainant as to his whereabouts when the train pulled into the station on that day. Considering Mr. McAmmond's recollection of what happened on that day, I will, if it is relevant to my decision, accept the complainant's version of what happened.\n[27] On January 7, 2002, the complainant left for a month and a half vacation to Australia.\nIII. The RCMP Report [28] Constable Benoit Lecuyer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( the RCMP) was one of the officers on duty on the evening of December 31, 2001. At around 10:00 p.m., the detachment received a complaint regarding a stolen pick-up truck. The truck was parked outside a restaurant in Jasper and when the delivery person for the restaurant came out to use it, it was gone. The vehicle was later located in a parking lot in front of a gas station. An individual was passed out in the passenger seat and the engine of the vehicle was still running.\n[29] At around 10:48 p.m., Constable Lecuyer arrived on the scene where the stolen vehicle had been located. He testified that he noticed that there was one male individual, who appeared to be sleeping on the passenger side. As he approached the truck, he said that he could smell a strong odour of alcohol. He added that he tried to wake the male occupant up for approximately five minutes, but to no avail. Constable Lecuyer and another colleague then pulled the individual out of the vehicle in order to proceed to his arrest. According to Constable Lecuyer, the individual was highly intoxicated.\n[30] Constable Lecuyer testified that they were able to identify this person by his British Columbia driver's licence as William Witwicky, the complainant. At the detachment, the complainant was put into a holding cell. During all this time, he was still passed out.\n[31] At around 1:16 a.m., Constable Lecuyer was informed by the cell block guard that the complainant was now awake and standing up. He said that he then approached the cell and tried to determine his level of consciousness. He added that he noticed that the complainant was using the walls of the cell for balance which indicated that he was still intoxicated. He then tried to explain to the complainant where he was and why he was there. The complainant just nodded his head but did not reply. According to the officer, the complainant did not appear to understand what was happening.\n[32] Constable Lecuyer returned to check on the complainant at around 3:01 a.m. and found him wide awake but agitated. He said that he tried to calm him down. The constable again concluded that the complainant was still too intoxicated to understand fully what was happening.\n[33] His next dealing with the complainant was around 7:25 a.m. on the morning of January 1, 2002. He noticed that, at this time, the complainant was calm and in a better condition to understand why he was being detained. He decided at this point to let him out of the cell and proceeded to lead him to the interview room where his rights and police caution were read to him. The complainant advised the officer that he did not want to call a lawyer. He added that he hadn't done anything wrong and that he wanted to apologize for his behaviour. He then proceeded to give a recorded statement to the officer.\n[34] The complainant was later charged with possession of stolen property and released, at around 8:00 a.m., on his own recognizance. The follow-up investigation was conducted on January 2, 2002. It mainly consisted of going back to the restaurant from where the truck had been taken. Constable Lecuyer stated that, during this investigation, he spoke with the owner of the restaurant and two other employees. According to these interviews, the complainant arrived at the restaurant at around 8:00 p.m. with two other individuals. The owner of the restaurant also informed the constable that he did not want to pursue this matter any further. Following this, the constable informed the complainant that the charges relating to stolen property had been dropped.\n[35] The Continuation Report prepared by Constable Lecuyer indicates that on January 9, 2002, Constable Benoit Tessier, a policeman with the respondent, had contacted the Jasper detachment of the RCMP and had requested a copy of the complainant's statement as soon as possible. On January 24, 2002, a transcription of this statement was forwarded to Constable Tessier.\nIV. Follow ups to the events of December 31, 2001 [36] On the complainant's return to Kamloops from his Australian vacation in late February 2002, he contacted Mr. Gary George Kopp, Chairperson for the Local Committee of Adjustment of the United Transportation Union, to see how things were going. Mr. Kopp informed him of a conversation he had with Hans Nederpel, a supervisor with the respondent. He said that Mr. Nederpel had approached him and had brought up the subject of the complainant's conduct on December 31, 2001. According to Mr. Kopp, Mr. Nederpel said that the complainant had a drinking problem and that he wanted to see him in a program for alcohol abuse.\n[37] The complainant was suspended from work on March 22, 2002. A formal investigation of the matter was then undertaken by the respondent. Two employee statements, one of the complainant and the other of Mr. Larry Hindle, were conducted. The first one, with the complainant, was conducted on March 28, 2002, while the second, with Mr. Hindle, took place on April 17, 2002.\n(i) Employees Statements a) The Complainant's Statement [38] The complainant's statement lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., with a break for lunch. The employee statement is not a transcript of everything that is said during the investigation. It is a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the questions asked and the answers given. The statement is prepared by an investigator chosen by the employer. At the end of the investigation, the employee and his representative are asked to read the document and to sign it.\n[39] Mr. Kopp was the complainant's representative at his employee statement. The investigation was conducted by Mr. John Gosse. Before the start of the procedure, Mr. Kopp had requested that certain documents be made available for inspection including [a]ll transactions and\/or all tapes of any conversations between Mr. Witwicky and the involved Transportation Supervisor and\/or any Yardmaster and\/or any other employees of the railroad on the evening and day that the incident took place. Mr. Kopp testified that he was never provided with the tapes requested. He added that he had also objected to the excessive delay in holding this investigation.\n[40] The statement indicates that the complainant arrived in Jasper at 12:15 p.m., on December 31, 2002. He had booked eight (8) hours rest, placing himself ready for duty at 8:15 p.m. He had a room at the bunkhouse. He said that after checking, he went over to his sister's home and there, called his estranged wife. This is a different version of events than what the complainant had testified to at the hearing. He then said that he had called his wife from the bunkhouse before going over to his sister.\n[41] During this conversation, his former wife informed him that she would be asking for a divorce. He said that this information left him emotionally distraught and that he didn't feel mentally capable of doing his job. He added that he then phoned his employer to book himself unfit for work. The complainant said that he spent the rest of the afternoon at his sister's house.\n[42] At around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m., a friend came over to pick him up and they went to a restaurant. He said that he had several drinks there and had something to eat, although later he adds the he had several drinks on an empty stomach.\n[43] During the statement, Mr Gosse asked the complainant to explain, if he had indeed booked himself unfit, why he had been placed on excessive layover pay from 11:15 p.m to 6:55 a.m., on the night of December 31 to January 1st. The complainant answered: It never occurred to me. Now in retrospect I should have contacted them and have it removed.\n[44] Asked by the investigating officer why he had taken the January 1st call, if he had indeed booked unfit the day before, the complainant answered: When I arrived at the station, I found out that I was called for 0710 and that the crew office had held the call for me. The train was there. I felt that it was in my best interest given the fact that I was totally sober and fit for duty, that I was responsible to do my job without delaying the train or getting myself in deeper trouble. I realize that I never should have booked unfit at the away from home terminal but giving my state of mind, I felt it was the right thing to do at the time.\n[45] On the morning of January 1, 2002, at around 8:10 a.m., the complainant spoke with supervisor Dave James who asked him if the was fit for duty and the complainant answered, yes. The record indicates that he did not inform supervisor James that he had booked unfit the day before, nor did he informed him that he had spent the night at the police station. The complainant explained that he didn't think he needed to, since Mr. James had told him that he had talked to the RCMP and that the complainant would have questions to answer on his arrival in Kamloops.\n[46] Asked how he could have said that he was fit for duty on the morning of January 1st 2002, when according to the RCMP reports he was still intoxicated at 3:01 a.m., the complainant answered that by the morning he felt totally sober. He added that he had had several hours to sober up and that he had realized that he should never have booked himself unfit for duty. He felt that what had happened during that evening was an isolated incident and a big mistake which could be explained by the very difficult time he was going through in his personal life. He said that he felt very remorseful and embarrassed by the whole situation.\n[47] The employee statement report was signed by the complainant and by his representative, Mr. Kopp.\nb) Larry Hindle's Statement [48] Larry Hindle is a locomotive engineer. On April 17, 2002, he gave an employee statement in connection with his tour of duty on December 31, 2001, and January 1, 2002, while operating the train from Jasper to Kamloops. The statement was conducted by Mr. John Gosse before Mr. Kopp, who was acting as the complainant's representative, and Mr. Jim Manson, Mr. Hindle's representative.\n[49] Mr. Hindle was the locomotive engineer on train Q103, on January 1, 2003, on the return trip to Kamloops. He indicated that, during this trip, the complainant had operated the locomotive on the stretch between Blue River and Kamloops. Mr. Hindle added that the complainant seemed fine when he arrived for work. He also indicated that he had told him that he had booked himself off unfit for duty on the previous night without giving any explanation as to the reasons why.\n[50] Mr. Hindle also mentioned that upon the train's arrival in Kamloops, he was approached by supervisor Mitch McAmmond with whom he said he exchanged New Year's greetings. He also indicated that the complainant was present during this encounter.\n[51] Finally, in response to a question asked by Mr. Kopp, Mr. Hindle mentioned that he had been interviewed about the events of December 31, 2001, on January 28, 2002, by supervisor Dave James in Jasper. He also added that, at that time, the supervisor had in his possession a transcript of the complainant's statement to the RCMP.\n[52] Following his investigation, Mr. Gosse prepared a summation of these two employee statements. He concluded: In view of the above information and investigation, it is recommended [...] that [the complainant's] employment with the [respondent] be terminated for violation of CROR General Rule G and violation of GOI Section 8, part 3.1 including violations of CN Policy to Prevent Workplace Alcohol and Drug Problems. This summation was forwarded to Eric Blokzyl, the then District Superintendent for British Columbia South. Mr. Blokzyl testified that, because of the severity of the violation, he immediately contacted his superior, Mr. James Fitzgerald, General Manager Operations Pacific Division - British Columbia, to discuss the matter. After this discussion with Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Blokzyl told Mr. Gosse to proceed with his recommendation.\nV. The Events Following the Complainant's Dismissal [53] The complainant was dismissed, on April 19, 2002.\n[54] The Union filed a grievance contesting the complainant's dismissal. It took the position that the respondent had disciplined the complainant on improperly obtained evidence. Consequently, it submitted that the investigation was flawed and requested that the discipline assessed to the complainant be cancelled.\n[55] On July 19, 2002, the complainant was diagnosed with squama cell carcinoma. He had a tumour on his tonsil and it had spread into several lymph nodes in his neck. His medical condition was very serious and his doctor decided to operate immediately to have this tumour removed. On July 24, he underwent a neck surgery to have the lumps removed. After the operation, he received thirty treatments of radiation. These treatments lasted until around the middle of October 2002.\n[56] The complainant's also testified that his dismissal left him devastated and that, at that time, he solicited counselling from the Employee Family Assistance Program (EFAP). He also sought other employment. He filed for unemployment insurance and received these benefits until his cancer was diagnosed, at which time Human Resources put him on sick leave benefits.\nVI. The Reinstatement Contract [57] In October 2002, the vice general chairperson for the United Transportation Union, Mr. Ron Hackle, contacted the complainant. Mr. Hackle told him that Mr. Robert Reny, from the Labour Relations department of the respondent, had indicated that the respondent would be prepared to reinstate the complainant, conditional on him agreeing to the terms outlined in a Reinstatement Contract.\n[58] Several days later, Mr. Hackle contacted the complainant and informed him that he had a deal with the respondent. He explained that the complainant could return to work immediately if he passed the respondent's medical requirements and signed a Reinstatement Contract. The complainant said that he then contacted Mr. Kopp to discuss his options. He testified that although he felt that this was a violation of his human rights, he had no other option but to sign the document if he wanted his job back.\n[59] The complainant signed the Reinstatement Contract on November 2, 2002. The contract was also signed by Barry Henry, the General Chairperson of the United Transportation Union, the complainant's union, and an officer of the respondent.\n[60] A week after he had signed the Reinstatement Contract, the complainant was contacted by a nurse from the respondent's health provider, Medisys. She informed him that he would have to pass a medical before returning to work. On November 16, 2002, the complainant saw the respondent's doctor who did a complete physical examination. The doctor did not require, at this time, that any alcohol or drug testing be administered. He cleared the complainant for his return to work.\n[61] On November 22, 2002, the complainant met Eric Blokzyl, Superintendent Operations, who welcomed him back to work. At around one o'clock in the afternoon, he was put back on the furlough board2. Later, on the same day, at around 5:30 p.m., the complainant got a call from supervisor Mitch McAmmond informing him that he was pulled out of service following the instructions of supervisor Gosse. Supervisor McAmmond told the complainant that he had no idea as to the reasons why he was being pulled off and that he should call supervisor Gosse if he wanted more information.\n[62] The complainant immediately called supervisor Gosse whom, according to the complainant said Mr. Witwicky, I hear you're trying to pull a fast one by trying to get yourself back on the working board. The complainant told him that the had been cleared to return to work by supervisor Blokzyl, to which Mr. Gosse answered that Mr. Blokzyl was not his immediate supervisor, that he was and that he would decide whether the complainant could go back to work or not.\n[63] On that same day, Mr. Kopp testified that he had a conversation with Mr. John Gosse. He stated that Mr. Gosse had asked him if the complainant had provided a blood sample or a urine sample to the respondent's medical provider, prior to being cleared to come back to work. Mr. Kopp answered no.\n[64] Mr. Gosse did not deny removing the complainant from the working board on that day. He explained that the complainant's Reinstatement Contract provided that certain things had to be done before he would be allowed to return to work. Mr. Gosse said that he had not been informed that the complainant had met with Mr. Blokzyl. He added that he pulled the complainant from the working board for a short period of time in order to confirm that he had indeed complied with these obligations under the contract. Once the meeting with Mr. Blokzyl had been confirmed, he put the complainant back on the working board. He added that not more than a couple of hours had elapsed between him pulling the complainant off work and then putting him back on. No pay was deducted from the complainant's salary during this time.\nVII. The allegations of Harassment and Retaliation [65] Most of the facts surrounding the allegations of harassment have to do with the tenuous relationship that existed between the complainant and his supervisor, Mr Gosse. This strained relationship certainly showed during Mr. Gosse's cross-examination by the complainant. Mr. Gosse was a very uncooperative witness with significant memory lapse whenever the questions of the complainant did not seem to please him. He was argumentative and somewhat provocative in the way he answered the questions.\n[66] Mr. Gosse was, at all time relevant to the present case, the Assistant Superintendent, Manager Train Service, for the respondent in Kamloops. His duties were the overall running of the terminal. He was responsible for all the running trade employees. He characterized his position as a frontline supervisor. Mr. Gosse resigned his position with the respondent on June 30, 2006. He now works for Via Rail.\n[67] The first allegation of harassment raised by the complainant occurred on March 14, 2002. The complainant was then representing Mr. Plante, a co-worker, at a formal investigation. During these proceedings, the complainant claims that Mr. Gosse came into the room and stated: I have been reading some very funny stuff about you on the [bathroom] walls. None of the individuals present during this statement could recall this exchange.\n[68] According to the complainant, Mr. Gosse was referring to a document entitled Procedures and Protocols for use of the Jasper Pizza Truck which was a parody of the December 31, 2001 events. The document did not specifically refer to the complainant by name but the events it narrated were certainly referable to what had happened in Jasper. The complainant testified that he found these documents posted on various bathroom walls in the respondent's workplace. The complainant made enquiries to various employees whether they knew where the bulletin had originated from, but to no avail. The complainant provided the respondent with the name of a fellow employee who had been seen with copies of this document which he had handed out to another employee. For an unexplained reason, during its investigation of these allegations, the respondent did not interview this employee.\n[69] It is interesting to note that, during his cross-examination, Mr. Gosse admitted that he had been informed by an employee that this document was being distributed but never investigated the matter further.\n[70] Another incident occurred on January 17, 2003. On this day, the complainant was required to attend a CN medical appointment for drug and alcohol testing. He had obtained proper authority from supervisor J. Power to attend this medical. The complainant took the time off, went to his medical appointment and when supervisor Gosse was informed of this, he penalized the complainant one day's pay. A grievance was filed by the complainant following this incident.\n[71] Mr. Gosse explained that Mr. Power was a supervisor who had come up to Kamloops on loan since they were short of supervisors at the time. He added that he came from Vancouver where they did not have a Furlough Board, so he was not aware of the policies and procedures for employees on the board. He explained that while on the Furlough Board, the complainant was paid a set daily rate. If he was allowed to book for the medical, as requested, he would, under the collective agreement, be paid a different daily rate which would be higher than what he would normally receive on the Furlough Board. Allowing the complainant to book off was, according to Mr. Gosse, contrary to these policies and procedures and that is why he intervened to reverse the decision and take away the part of the payment to which the complainant was not entitled to.\n[72] One month later, on February 17, 2003, the complainant was once again called by Medysis to provide another drug and alcohol test. At that time, the complainant was on what is referred to as the protected Furlough Board. He phoned his supervisor Mr. Gosse to get authorization to attend the appointment. He explained to Mr. Gosse that he was required to attend the medical appointment and that he needed his authorisation to be off because he was on a working board. Mr. Gosse asked him when the appointment was, what it was for and how long it would take. According to the complainant, when informed of the reasons for the appointment, Mr. Gosse started laughing uncontrollably. The complainant added that he felt degraded by his supervisor's conduct.\n[73] According to the respondent, this request was declined on account of the complainant's position on the Furlough Board at that specific time. Mr. Gosse explained that he considered where the complainant was on the Furlough Board and since he was not in a position to be called to work, he decided not allow the request. The respondent further adds that it is its policy that medical appointments be scheduled during employee's time off.\n[74] The complainant stated that he had no choice but to attend this appointment since this was one of the condition set out in the Reinstatement Contract. He explained that if he did not attend he could be fired for not respecting the terms of the contract. According to the complainant, Mr. Gosse told him you can take your chances, Mr. Witwicky and see what happens. Finally, he did not give the complainant authorization to take time off for this appointment.\n[75] In February 2003, the complainant held the position of vice-local Chairperson of Local 691 of the United Transportation Union, in Kamloops. Sometime during that month, he was contacted by a supervisor D. Savage to attend a company-initiated meeting. The complainant informed supervisor Savage that he would attend the meeting provided supervisor Gosse authorised his booking off on company business. Supervisor Gosse did not give his consent and the complainant did not attend the meeting. Following the complainant's refusal to attend the meeting, he was penalized one day's pay.\n[76] The complainant also referred to a mentoring program that the respondent had put in place. According to this program, each employee of the running trades was assigned a mentor. The mentor was somebody the employee could go to if he had a problem. Prior to being terminated, the complainant's mentor was an individual named Elio Marrelli. Upon his return to work after having been dismissed, the complainant learned that his mentor was going to be Mr. Gosse.\n[77] On March 17, 2003, he wrote a letter to Mr. Blokzyl requesting that he be assigned a new mentor. In a letter addressed to the complainant, dated June 10, 2003, Mr. Blokzyl states that the request by the complainant to have a mentor change had been complied with in accordance with your wishes. The complainant testified that there was never any change in mentor and that Mr. Gosse continued to act as such until July 2006.\n[78] The complainant wrote a letter to Mr. Gosse on March 18, 2003, in which he requested that Mr. Gosse stop harassing [him]. A copy of this letter was send to Mr. Blokzyl. Mr. Blokzyl replied to this letter on April 8, asking for more details regarding the allegations contained in the complainant's letter.\n[79] On April 29, 2003, in accordance with the respondent's Human Rights Policy for a Harassment Free Environment, Mr. Roger Worsfold, a Transportation Officer, for the respondent, was mandated to conduct an investigation regarding the complainant's allegations of harassment. For this, Mr. Worsfold conducted an interview of Mr. Gosse and interviewed the witnesses that the complainant had identified, namely Hans Nederpel, Jerry Plante, Jim Manson and Mike Robinson. Following these interviews, he proceeded to interview the complainant. Based on these interviews and on various documents that he had, he concluded that the allegations of harassment were unfounded.\n[80] The allegation of retaliation pertains to a situation regarding an employment opportunity with the Union Pacific Railway, a United States based company, who had canvassed the respondent's employees in the fall of 2003. Union Pacific was short of employees during this period, while the respondent had a surplus of employee in Western Canada. Union Pacific had approached the respondent to see if it would be possible to hire some of these employees to work for Union Pacific in the U.S. Mr. Kopp testified that all Kamloops employees had applied, except one who was needed as a yard master, so the respondent did not want to let him go. The complainant, who had manifested his interest, was denied the opportunity to apply. The explanation given by the respondent was that they could not monitor the complainant's Reinstatement Contract if he was allowed to work in the U.S.\nVIII. Analysis [81] This is not an arbitration proceeding where an arbitrator must decide whether the employer has or not violated the collective agreement. Also, it is not an action for wrongful dismissal. Therefore, it is not in my mandate to determine whether the respondent has shown just cause for its decision to dismiss the complainant following the events of December 31, 2001. The procedure provided by the Act for the treatment of complaints cannot be seen as an alternative for the grievance procedure provided by the Collective Agreement.\n[82] In order to benefit from the protection afforded by the Act, a complainant must demonstrate the involvement of one or more of the proscribed grounds listed in section 3 of the Act. Consequently, the analysis which follows will deal only with issues relevant to the Act.\nA. The Sections 7 and 10 Complaints [83] Mr. Witwicki's complaints are brought pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In contrast to complaints under section 7 of the Act, which relate to employer actions affecting specific, named individuals, section 10 of the Act addresses the discriminatory effect that employer policies or practices may have on an individual or a class of individuals.\n[84] For its part, section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 25 of the Act makes it clear that the term disability includes previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug. Furthermore, it is well-established that the protection of the Act extends to those who are mistakenly perceived to have a disability. (See Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665, at para. 49.)\n[85] As a result of the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R.3 (Meiorin) and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer), the historic distinction between direct and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to the adjudication of human rights complaints. Under this approach, the initial onus is still on a complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in absence of an answer by the respondent. ( See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R 536, at p. 558.)\nB. Was a prima facie case made out? [86] The complainant submits that he was subjected to differential treatment. He alleges that he has been discriminated against on the basis of a perceived disability, namely the perception that he suffered from a substance abuse disorder and that he was perceived as being an alcoholic. The complainant bears the onus of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the respondent perceived him as disabled.\n[87] The evidence before me does not establish that the respondent perceived the complainant to suffer from a substance abuse disorder or that it perceived him as being an alcoholic. The evidence shows that the reason why the complainant's employment was terminated is because the respondent felt that he had violated CROR General Rule G and GOI section 8, part 3.1 including violations of CN Policy to Prevent Workplace Alcohol and Drug Problems. Rule G)(a) of the Canadian Rail Operating Rules (the Rules or CROR), states that [t]he use of intoxicants or narcotics by employees subject to duty, or their possession or use while on duty, is prohibited. Rule 3.1(a), under the heading Responsibility for Safety, declares that [e]veryone (Management, Employees, Contractors, Visitors, etc.), must: a) Report fit for duty, alert and able to perform safely. For specific rules on alcohol, drugs, prescriptions and medication, see CN handbook entitled Policy to Prevent Workplace Alcohol and Drug Problems. These rules were in force on December 31, 2001.\n[88] According to Robert Reny, the respondent's Senior Manager, Human Resources, the reason for these rules is to ensure the employees' health and safety, as well as the safety of the public. In his words, the rules are designed to set very clear expectations for all employees as to what their obligations are. Their objective is to prevent the use of drugs and alcohol and to punish specific conducts on the job. Whether the respondent was right or wrong in its conclusion that the complainant had violated this policy is not for me to decide. This is a matter to be decided by an arbitrator under the grievance procedure provided for in the Collective Agreement.\n[89] The complainant might have some legitimate issues with the time the respondent took in processing its investigation. He might also have some issues with the procedure used by the respondent in investigating the events. But these have no relation to an alleged violation of the Act. In order to benefit from the protections afforded by the Act, the complainant must demonstrate the involvement of one or more of the proscribed grounds listed in section 3 of the Act.\n[90] Having reviewed all of the evidence, I conclude that the complainant has not established that when the respondent dismissed him, it did so because it believed or perceived him to be an alcoholic. I find that the reason why he was dismissed was because the respondent felt, rightly or wrongly, but that is not for me to decide, that he had violated its rules and policies.\n[91] I will now address the issue of the Reinstatement Contract. The complainant is asking that the Tribunal conclude that the terms of this contract created the perception that he is an alcoholic and that this is a discriminatory practice. The respondent argues that the only label which is placed on a person who is subject to a Reinstatement Contract under the policy is that they contravened the work rules.\n[92] To better understand the reasons for the Reinstatement Contract, it is important that we look at the respondent's document entitled Prevention our Safe Choice. Policy to Prevent Workplace Alcohol and Drug Problems - Policy and Guidelines. This policy provides:\nAlcohol\nPossession, distribution or sale of beverage alcohol, and the use of any form of alcohol, is prohibited while on duty (including during breaks on or off CN property), on company business, or on company premises, including vehicles and equipment. Limited exceptions to this restriction will be allowed with prior approval of a Vice-President. This does not limit retail outlets and licensed business establishments form carrying out their normal operations.\nPresence in the body of alcohol above BAC of 0.04 when on duty or on company business or premises, is also prohibited for all employees. In any situation where employees are to be tested with reasonable cause including after an accident or incident, they are prohibited from using alcohol within eight hours of the accident or incident, or until tested or advised that a test will not be necessary.\n[93] This document also defines what a safety sensitive position is. It states that safety-sensitive positions are those which the company determines have a key and direct role in rail operation where impaired performance could result in a significant incident affecting the health and safety of employees, customers, the public, property or the environment. It also establishes that engineers, brakemen and conductors are positions designated as being safety critical.\n[94] The document also provides that if an employee violates its provisions or does not meet the company's satisfactory standards of work performance as a result of alcohol or other drug use, then appropriate corrective actions may be taken. These corrective actions will depend on the nature of the violation and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Some violation, if considered sufficiently serious, can result in dismissal of the employee on a first occurrence.\n[95] The document also provides for the reinstatement of an employee following a policy violation. It states:\nDepending on the circumstances, employees may be permitted to continue their employment with the company. Such employees will be advised of the conditions governing their continued employment, which will include at a minimum, the following:\nAssessment by a substance abuse professional\nCompletion of any recommended treatment and compliance with medically recommended relapse prevention programs after treatment\nAbstinence from using any drugs or alcohol for at least 2 years\nUnannounced testing for a period of a least two years\nNo further policy violations during the monitoring period ;\nMaintenance of job performance according to expectations.\nContinuing employment in safety sensitive jobs will be subject to requirements for medical fitness for duty for that position.\n[96] The policy also states that the respondent could investigate off-duty activities where these involved alcohol or drugs and had an implication for the workplace. As regards to an employee's return to duty following a positive test for alcohol or drugs or any significant policy violation, the policy provides that testing might be required. More specifically the policy states:\nAny employee dismissed after a policy violation, including those not in safety sensitive positions and those who are not diagnosed as having a substance use disorder, may be required to undergo drug and alcohol testing as terms of continuing employment or reinstatement. In these cases, testing will be conducted on an unannounced basis for at least two years and will be done according to the terms of the continuing employment or Reinstatement Contract agreed to by the Company and the union.\nThe test dates will be determined on an unannounced basis through Medical Services. The site manager will be informed that an individual is required to report for a test, and arrangements will be made to complete the collection process as soon as possible after the site management has been notified. The scheduling will remain unannounced to the employee until the collection can be arranged.\n[97] The evidence clearly establishes that the complainant is not an alcoholic. However, would it be possible to argue that, under the respondent's policy, any incident of possession or consumption of alcohol in the workplace or during off-duty activities results in a person being treated as though they were prone to alcohol dependency and therefore, subject to termination? The policy states that if an employee violates its provisions as a result of alcohol use, then appropriate corrective actions may be taken. These corrective actions will depend on the nature of the violation and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Some violation, if considered sufficiently serious, can result in dismissal of the employee on a first occurrence. According to the respondent, the events of December 31, 2001 were of this nature.\n[98] Could we compare the respondent's policy with that of Imperial Oil in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd (2000), 189 D.L.R. (4th) 14? In that decision, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated, at paragraph 92:\nThus, though the social drinker and casual drinker are not substance abusers, and, therefore, not handicapped, Imperial Oil believes them to be substance abusers for the purpose of the policy. In other words, Imperial Oil believes that any person testing positive on a pre-employment drug test or a random drug or alcohol test is a substance abuser. Because perceived as well as actual substance abuse is included in the definition of handicap under the Code, anyone testing positive under the alcohol and drug testing provisions of the policy is entitled to the protection of ...the Code. Imperial Oil applies sanctions to any person testing positive - either refusing to hire, disciplining or terminating the employment of that person - on the assumption that the person is likely to be impaired at work currently or in the future, and thus not fit for duty. Therefore, persons testing positive on the alcohol or drug test - perceived or actual substance abusers - are adversely affected by the policy. The policy provisions for pre-employment drug testing and for random alcohol and drug testing are, therefore, prima facie discriminatory. Imperial Oil bears the burden of showing that they are bona fide occupational requirements.\n[99] Also, is there any similarity with the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Canadian Civil Liberties Assn. v. Toronto-Dominion Bank (1998), 163 D.L.R. (4th) 193, where the court stated at paragraph 24:\nI do not see how one can avoid the conclusion that the Bank's drug testing policy constitutes a prima facie discriminatory practice. I say this because the Bank's policy raises the likelihood of drug dependent employees losing their recently acquired employment. An employment policy aimed at ensuring a work environment free of illegal drug use must necessarily impact negatively on those who are drug dependent.\n[100] I do not believe that these decisions apply to this case. For example, in the Canadian Civil Liberties Assn case, the Court found that the drug testing policy raised the likelihood of drug-dependent employees losing their employment. Consequently, the discrimination was against those employees who were drug dependent. The complainant in this case is not alcohol or drug dependent. Therefore, the respondent's policy does not impact on him in the same manner that the drug testing policy impacted on the employees tested in the Canadian Civil Liberties Assn. case.\n[101] Again in Entrop, the Court accepted that substance abuse was a handicap under the statute and found a prima facie case of discrimination because all users were perceived to be substance abusers under the policy. Through its policy, the employer used drug and alcohol testing to identify employees or prospective employees who had consumed alcohol or drugs and applied sanctions to them based on the assumption about what they were likely to do in the future.\n[102] In this case, the respondent's policy is not directed at identifying all users of drugs or alcohol. Rather, it imposes sanctions against those whose are identified as possessing or consuming drugs or alcohol on the job. There is nothing in the policy preventing employees from using alcohol as long as they do not do so on the job or as long as it does not affect their capacity to perform their duties. (See also, Middlemiss v. Norske Canada Ltd, 2002 BCHRT 5, at par. 25.).\n[103] Turning our attention to the Reinstatement Contract, its purpose was to give details of the conditions under which the complainant could resume his employment with the respondent. According to Article 1 of the contract, its duration was two years from the date of the complainant's signature unless there was medical evidence indicating that follow-up should be extended beyond two years, as determined by the respondent's Chief Medical Officer. Article 2 provided that the complainant had agreed to be medically examined and this included being tested for drugs and alcohol prior to reinstatement. The complainant also agreed to unannounced tests for drugs and alcohol use for a period of two years or more, as may be determined by the Chief Medical Officer.\n[104] Article 3 specified that if the complainant failed to pass the drugs and alcohol testing, he would not be eligible for reinstatement and his file with the respondent would be closed. Article 4 provided that the complainant was expected to fully comply with the requirements of the Policy to Prevent Workplace Alcohol and Drug Problems, the General Safety Rule 1.1. and CROR General Rule G, including complete abstinence from alcohol and drugs.\n[105] Article 5 stated that during the term of the contract, the complainant was to abstain from drugs and alcohol use and to comply with the condition of the contract, failure to do so could result in his discharge or make him ineligible for reinstatement. He was also to be subject to frequent performance observations by his supervisor which would be documented and shared with the Chief Medical Officer.\n[106] Finally, Article 7 provided that the complainant was required to attend a meeting with Eric Blokzyl for the respondent, prior to returning to work. This contract was signed by the complainant, the General Chairperson of the United Transportation Union and a CN Officer.\n[107] The contract was part of a proposal regarding the resolution of the grievance relating to the termination of the complainant's employment. In order to better understand the origin of this document, I intend to go through the process which culminated in its conclusion.\n[108] Following the discharges of the complainant, the United Transportation Union filed a grievance in which it stated its position as follows:\n[I]t is the Union's position that the Company has disciplined W.C. Witwicky based on improperly obtained evidence. Accordingly, the Union submits that the investigation is flawed and request that the discipline assessed to W.C. Witwicky be expunged and he be made whole.\nIn the alternative, and without prejudice to the foregoing, the Union submits that the very fact that the Grievor was released from police custody is evidence of his sobriety. Accordingly, no violation of the rules can be demonstrated, and the Union requests that the discipline assessed be expunged and W.C. Witwicky, be made whole.\n[109] It is interesting to note that nowhere in the grievance is there any mention of a violation of the complainant's human rights or that his dismissal was motivated by a perception that he was an alcoholic. The reason for the grievance is founded solely on what the Union characterises as improperly obtained evidence.\n[110] The grievance was ultimately resolved on the terms set out in a letter from D. Edison, Vice-President - Pacific Division for the respondent, concurred with by B. J. Henry, General Chairman of the Union. In this letter, the respondent agreed to reinstate the complainant, conditional on him agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Reinstatement Contract. The complainant agreed to these terms and conditions on November 2, 2002.\n[111] The fact that the grievance was resolved to the satisfaction of the parties does not prevent the complainant from bringing forward a human rights complaint. Therefore, I must now answer the following question: Is the Reinstatement Contract in violation of the complainant rights under the Act? Arbitrator Michel G. Picher expressed the applicable law in such circumstances in Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration & Dispute Resolution, Case No. 3598, an arbitral award dated December 13, 2006. In this award, he stated that where an employee has been reinstated following a violation of the respondent's drug and alcohol policy, [h]is reinstatement shall be conditional upon his accepting to be subject to full medical assessment for the purposes of determining whether he is subject to any drug or alcohol addiction or dependence. Should the assessment indicate that he is, his reinstatement shall be conditional upon his following any course of treatment that is directed by the assessing authority and any documentary or reporting obligations which might be related thereto. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[112] We will never know what the respondent's reaction would have been had the complainant tested positive or had he breached his obligations under the Reinstatement Contract because the complainant at the beginning and during the duration of this contract abstained from drug and alcohol and never failed any of the tests. In Milazzo v. Autocar Connaisseur Inc., [2003] C.H.R.D. No. 24, paras. 177 to 180, this Tribunal stated:\n177 In accordance with Autocar Connaisseur's drug testing policy, any employee testing positive for either alcohol or drugs will be summarily terminated. Where a prospective employee tests positive, Autocar Connaisseur's offer of employment will be withdrawn.\n178 It will be recalled that Mr. Devlin testified that Autocar Connaisseur was of the view that these actions are necessary because an employee who knowingly comes to work with alcohol or drugs in his system so fundamentally breaches the trust between employer and employee that there is no alternative but to terminate the employment relationship. It may well be that such a course is open to Autocar Connaisseur (at least from a human rights perspective) where employees use alcohol or drugs as a matter of personal choice, and voluntarily breach the company's alcohol and drug policy.\n179 The situation is different, however, in cases where the individual suffers from a condition that qualifies as a disability. In such cases, an employer has an obligation to accommodate the employee to the point of undue hardship, unless it is impossible to do so.\n180 The fact that an employee tests positive in an employer-sponsored drug test does not automatically mean that the employee is disabled. In order to distinguish between employees who suffer from a substance-related disability and those who do not, it may well be necessary to require that the employee submit to a professional assessment by an appropriate health care practitioner. While employers must be sensitive to the role that denial can play in substance abuse disorders, ultimately, the onus is on the employee or prospective employee to demonstrate that they are entitled to the protection of the Canadian Human Rights Act. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[113] In this case, since it wasn't established that the complainant suffered from a disability, real or perceived, the duty to accommodate referred to in the Milazzo case was not triggered. Furthermore, since there was no breach of the Reinstatement Contract, there is nothing for this Tribunal to assess in terms of failure to accommodate.\n[114] In his closing arguments, the complainant referred to the fact that since the Reinstatement Contract provided for blood samples, this was a violation of his human rights. In this case, the blood samples were provided with the consent of the complainant. There was no evidence provided to establish that he was coerced into providing these samples. In these circumstances, I cannot conclude that there was a violation of the complainant's human rights. (See. R. v. Dersch, [1993] 3 S.C.R 768.)\nC. Conclusion Regarding the Complainant's Sections 7 and 10 Complaints [115] Having failed to establish that he was either disabled or perceived by the respondent to be disabled, the complainant has not established a prima facie case of discrimination and accordingly, his section 7 complaint is dismissed.\n[116] Regarding the section 10 complaint, considering the evidence before me, I cannot conclude that the respondent's policy regarding alcohol or drugs in the workplace and the Reinstatement Contract with the complainant violates this section. This is not a situation where an individual suffers from a disability. In such a case, an employer would have an obligation to accommodate the employee to the point of undue hardship, unless it is impossible to do so. What we are dealing with here is a policy which imposes sanctions against those who are identified as possessing or consuming drugs or alcohol on the job. There is nothing in the policy preventing employees from using alcohol as long as they do not do so on the job or in a way that renders them unfit to perform their duties. Accordingly, the section 10 complaint is also dismissed.\nD. The Section 14 Complaint [117] According to section 14, it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. As explained previously, prohibited grounds under the Act include a perceived physical disability such as alcoholism. Considering my conclusion that the complainant has not established that he suffers from a disability, real or perceived, there is no reason for me to consider this matter any further since, if there was harassment, and I am not concluding that there was, it was not on a prohibited ground of discrimination as provided for by section 14.\n[118] The evidence did establish that there was a very strained relationship between the complainant and his supervisor, Mr. Goose. I have no doubt that the complainant was bothered and annoyed by the attitude and behaviour of his supervisor and he might have had reason to be. He might also have had reasons to be exasperated at what he considered as the respondent's lack of response to his complaints but this is not sufficient under the Act. For the Act to be triggered, the alleged conduct must relate to a prohibited ground.\n[119] For this reason, the complaint under section 14 is dismissed.\nE. The section 14.1 Complaint: Has the Respondent retaliated against the Complainant? [120] Section 14.1 of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint.\n[121] This Tribunal has taken two slightly different approaches to the legal framework under which a claim of retaliation should be examined. These approaches are illustrated in two cases: Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] C.H.R.D. No.11 and Virk v. Bell Canada (Ontario), [2005] C.H.R.D. No.2. The primary difference between these two approaches is the emphasis placed on the intention of the alleged retaliator.\n[122] In Wong, the Tribunal determined that given the remedial nature of the Act, the complainant should not be required to prove that the respondent intended to retaliate against the complainant. Rather, the focus of the analysis is on the perception of the complainant and whether or not the complainant could reasonably have viewed the respondent's conduct as an act of retaliation:\n219 According to Entrop, to prove a violation under this section, there must be a link between the alleged act of retaliation and the enforcement of the complainant's rights under the Act. Where there is evidence that the respondent intended the act to serve as retaliation for the human rights complaint, the linkage is established. But if the complainant reasonably perceived that the act to be retaliation for the human rights complaint, this could also amount to retaliation, quite apart from any proven intention of the respondent. Of course, the reasonableness of the complainant's perception must be measured. Respondents should not be accountable for unreasonable anxiety or undue reaction of the complainant.\n220 There have been a number of provincial human rights tribunals that have not agreed with the Entrop analysis. These tribunals have taken the position, that under the retaliation\/reprisal provisions of their legislation, the complainant must prove an intention to retaliate on the part of the respondent. The retaliation\/reprisal provision is not like the other provisions in the legislation that confer rights and should not be interpreted as extending to apparently neutral actions of the respondent that may have an adverse impact on the complainant.\n221 As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board)5, the Canadian Human Rights Act is aimed at eliminating invidious discrimination. The Act is remedial and not punitive and, therefore, the motives or intention of those who discriminate are not central to the concerns of the Act.\n222 In my opinion, the logic of Robichaud tells us that section 14.1 should not be interpreted as requiring a complainant to prove an intention to retaliate. Nor, in my opinion, should section 14.1 be viewed as different in operation from those sections in the Act that confer rights. The language of section 14.1 makes it a discriminatory practice to retaliate. The remedies for a contravention of this section are the same as for any other discriminatory practice under the Act. In this respect, section 14.1 should be contrasted to section 59 of the Act.\n[123] This approach has been adopted in other Tribunal decisions. (See Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, [2004] C.H.R.D. No. 26 and Warman v. Winnicki [2006] C.H.R.D. No. 18).\n[124] The other approach is set out in the Virk case:\n155 Under section 14.1 of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n156 Retaliation implies some form of wilful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint. This view departs in part from those expressed in previous decisions of this Tribunal on the issue of retaliation (Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] CHRT 11; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40).\n157 In Wong and Bressette, the views expressed are to the effect that a complainant does not have to prove an intention to retaliate and that if a complainant reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation to the human rights complaint, this could amount to retaliation quite apart form any proven intention of the respondent.\n158 The burden of proving retaliation rests with the complainant who must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the person against whom he or she alleges retaliation knew of the existence of the complaint, that the person acted in an inopportune way and that the person's misbehaviour was motivated by the filing of a human rights complaint by the complainant. Retaliation being a form of discrimination under the Act, the same evidentiary burden should apply to allegations of discrimination and retaliation.\n159 Thus, proof on the part of the complainant that the person who is alleged to have retaliated knew of the existence of the complaint and that he or she acted in an inopportune way may give rise to a prima facie case of retaliation requiring the alleged retaliator to come forth with a reasonable explanation as to the reasons for his actions. If the explanation given is not credible, the Tribunal should find the allegation of retaliation substantiated.\n[125] This approach has since been applied in Shulyer v. Oneida Nation of Thames, [2006] C.H.R.D. No. 35.\n[126] Whether we apply one or the other of these approaches, the conclusion is the same: there is no evidence to support the allegations of the complainant that the respondent retaliated against him because he had filed a complaint under the Act. The only evidence of retaliation brought forward by the complainant was that he was denied the opportunity to apply for a position with Union Pacific Railway, in the fall of 2003, because he had filed a complaint under the Act. Unfortunately for the complainant, there is nothing in the evidence to support this contention. The only evidence on this issue was put through the respondent's witness, Mr. Blokzyl. Cross-examined on the reason why the complainant's request had been denied, Mr. Blokzyl explained that the respondent felt that it could not properly monitor the conditions of the Reinstatement Contract should he be allowed to work in the United States. There is no evidence that the respondent's refusal had anything to do with the complainant's filing of a human rights complaint. Mr. Blokzyl was not challenged in cross-examination with respect to this allegation and no other witnesses were questioned on this point.\n[127] The complainant has not proven on a balance of probabilities, that the respondent was motivated in its decision to deny his request by the filing of a human rights complaint or that it can be concluded that it intended to retaliate against him because he filed the complaint.\n[128] For this reason the complaint under section 14.1 is denied.\nIX. CONCLUSION [129] For all of the forgoing reason, it is my decision that the complaints of William Carl Witwicky, filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, on August 8 and October 25, 2003, should be and are hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario July 6, 2007\n1 An excessive layover pay is paid to an employee who is at an away-from-home terminal and is not called back on another train within eleven hours. The employee will remain on this excessive layover until he accepts a call to his home terminal.\n2The respondent's workforce is divided into two boards and the employees are divided equally between these boards. One board is referred to as the protecting Furlough Board while the other is referred to as the non-protecting Furlough Board While occupying the protecting Furlough Board, the employee is subject to calls seven days a week, twenty four hours a day, for a period of fourteen day. On completion of a trip, an employee is allowed to take a maximum of twenty four hours rest and during this rest period he is not subject to be called to work.\nOnce the employee has completed his two weeks on the protecting Furlough Board, he is put on the non-protecting Furlough Board for a period of two weeks. During this period, the employee is not subject to being called in for work but he still receives a daily rate of pay. The reason for this workforce organisation is due to the fact that the respondent's had, at a certain time, a surplus of employees and could not guarantee work to everybody at the same time.\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1123\/0506\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nWilliam Carl Witwicky v.

Grant Sinclair\nI. INTRODUCTION\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. The CHRA Inquiry\nB. Legal Principles\nC. Application to the current matter\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] The respondent, Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (MTS) has brought a motion for an order that:\nthe parties are bound by the factual and legal conclusions of a 2004 arbitrator's award (Graham Award) and barring the complainants from leading any evidence inconsistent therewith; the complainant Hando, having submitted a grievance and subsequently withdrawing it from the Graham arbitration, is barred from proceeding with his complaint before this Tribunal; the Telephone Employees' Association of Manitoba (Union) should be added as a respondent to the complaint; and the Union has no standing as a complainant under ss. 40(1) and 40(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nII. BACKGROUND [2] The complainants in this inquiry are the Union and five individuals who are members of the Union, Hando, Mulligan, Giroux, Sirett and Custance. The five complainants were all laid off by the MTS in January of 2003. The Union contested the lay-offs through the grievance process.\n[3] One grievance, filed on behalf of Hando (Hando grievance) was withdrawn by the Union. In so doing, the Union asserted that the withdrawal was without prejuduice to Hando's pursuit of a human rights allegation against MTS with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC). There was no alleged violation of the CHRA in the Hando grievance.\n[4] The Union filed another grievance on behalf of a group of 14 individuals which included Mulligan, Giroux, Siret and Custance (group grievance). The Graham Award dismissed the group grievance.\n[5] The scope of the group grievance narrowed over time leading up to the arbitration. At the time it was signed, it alleged violations of the collective agreement as well as the CHRA. Yet reference to the CHRA was excluded from the grievance synopsis appearing in the Graham Award and it was not discussed elsewhere in the document.\n[6] Similarly, the group grievance in its original form alleged that some of the laid off employees were improperly targetted for layoff due to their record of absence due to illness and\/or the fact that they recently claimed long-term disability benefits. However, prior to arbitration, the Union indicated that it would not be arguing the issue of improper targetting due to record of absence.\n[7] Moreover, the Graham award notes that the Union chose not to proceed with 14 individual grievances in which the individual grivors would attempt to prove that their individual skills abilities, performance and qualifications, waranted that they be retained in preference to other specifically identified employees. While it is unclear if this was ever the Union's intention, the Graham Award suggests it was an option open to it.\n[8] Thus, the group grievance focussed only on the process used by MTS to identify which employees were being laid off, as determined by article 26.03 of the collective agreement. Article 26 essentially states that when identifying which incumbents in a position were to be laid-off, seniority would only become a factor where there were no differences between the incumbents on the basis of skill, ability, performance and qualifications. The implication of this article is that MTS was allowed to lay-off those employees who were judged to be most wanting in the above qualities.\n[9] In the course of determining the grievance, the Graham Award examined MTS's lay-off exercise with a view to determining (1) whether there was compliance with the collective agreement; (2) whether the procedure by which the article 26 standards were applied was fair, appropriate and unbiased; (3) whether the lay-off decision was reasonable.\n[10] In particular, the Graham Award examined a number of allegations by the Union, and evidence in support thereof, that the MTS lay-off exercise was based on incomplete or inaccurate information which led to a flawed comparative analysis of the laid-off employess vis-\u00e0-vis the other incumbents.\nA. The CHRA Inquiry [11] Before this Tribunal, the complainants are seeking to re-activate the discrimination component of the group grievance which was for whatever reason, not pursued at arbitration. The complaints of Mulligan, Giroux, Sirett and Custance filed with the CHRC, make reference to the individual complainants having been deliberately targetted for lay-off by MTS on the grounds that they were perceived to be disabled. The Hando complaint and the complaint filed directly by the Union, are to the same effect.\n[12] Furthermore, in their joint statement of particulars the complainants take direct aim at the comparative analysis conducted by MTS under article 26. For example, in para. 20 of their statement they assert that Sirett, Mulligan, Giroux and Custance possess the skills, abilities and qualifications that were at least equal to or greater than other employees with lesser seniority who were not laid off.\n[13] The respondent MTS says that the complainants should not be allowed to question the validity of the article 26 lay-off exercise, as it was already challenged in the arbitration process and upheld in the Graham Award. Moreover, to the extent Hando was not governed by the Graham Award (he was not a member of the group grievance), Hando should be similarly bound as he abandoned his right to arbitration.\n[14] The complainants reply that the group grievance was a policy grievance focussed on the process; it did not address the comparative analysis as it affected the individual complainants. Moreover, the requisite evidentiary basis for doing so was not put forward. Finally, Hando's grievance deliberately did not contain any allegation concerning any discrimination contrary to the CHRA.\nB. Legal Principles [15] The question of mulitple proceedings in different fora exposes a key tension in the administion of the CHRA. On the one hand, there is abundant jurisprudential doctrine, espoused in cases such as Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] S.C.R. 929 and Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 that would limit an empolyee's right to litigate an employment dispute that has previously been determined, or that could have been determined, by a labour arbitrator. There are clear public policy grounds behind these doctrines, including the need for finality of litigation, and the avoidance of contradictory results.\n[16] On the other hand, there is the apparent expression by Parliament that the recourse set out in the CHRA is cumululative, or concurrent with other forms of recourse. See Sherman v. Canada (Canada Customs and Revenue Agency) 2006 FC 715 at paras. 23-24. In a similar vein, Sopinka J. has described human rights legislation as the final refuge of the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised (Zurich Insurance v. O.H.R.C [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321).\n[17] The Federal Court has held that this Tribunal has the jurisdiction to dismiss a complaint by way of preliminary motion on the grounds of abuse of process, assuming there are valid grounds to do so. Moreover, res judicata is one of the means by which a tribunal can prevent abuse of its process. (C.H.R.C. v. Canada Post 2004 FC 81, at paras, 19, 31).\n[18] Res judicata not only prevents parties from re-litigating issues that have been finally decided between them (issue estoppel). It also serves to prevent litigation by instalment where parties had the opportunity to have the issues between them adjudicated in an earlier proceeding, but chose not to do so in favour of later prosecution. In this latter manifestation, it is often referred to as cause of action estoppel. (Canada Post, at paras. 29-32; Desormeaux v. Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, 2002 CanLII 45932 (C.H.R.T.) at para. 35)\nC. Application to the current matter [19] In the current matter, the record suggests that the Union made a pre-meditated decision not to fully air at arbitration its concerns regarding the potentially discriminatory nature of the lay-offs. It also appears from the material that the Union made a deliberate choice in the group grievance arbitration not to directly impugn the comparative lay-off exercise under article 26 as it affected Sirett, Mulligan, Giroux and Custance. And there does not appear to be any explanation of the Union's decisions in the motion record.\n[20] To the degree that the the arbitration led to general findings in the Graham Award that the comparative lay-off process was in compliance with article 26, the Union and the other complainants now seek to contradict those findings. Presumably by introducing evidence that employee absences were a factor in determing whether an employee would be laid off.\n[21] If the Tribunal were to grant the motion, certainly the individual complainants' ability to present their case as expressed in the statement of particulars could be significantly curtailed if not eliminated. It was the Union that had carriage of the grievances. And in granting the motion the Tribunal would be attaching consequences to decisions taken by the Union, namely, decisions not to go forward to arbitration with the CHRA aspects of their claims. In these circumstances, it would be inequitable to expose these individuals to the application of the doctrine of res judicata.\n[22] As to the respondent's request to add the Union as a respondent, I do not see the need to do so. The Union is already a party to the complaint. I agree with the complainants' position (set out on page 9, para. 31 of the complainants' Supplemental Motion Brief dated June 26, 2007) that the respondent can seek contribution\/indemnification from the Union should the Tribunal find a discriminatory practise by the respondent in which the Union was also implicated.\n[23] The standing of a union to bring a complaint under s. 40 of the CHRA was dealt with by the Tribunal in CTEA v. Bell Canada, [1999] C.H.R.D no.3. There the Tribunal concluded that a union, for the reasons stated in the decision, can file a complaint under s. 40 of the CHRA. In this case, the Union's complaint alleges a breach of s. 10 of the CHRA. The relief the Union is seeking is a systemic order as contrasted to the individual complainants' request for a personal remedy. To this extent the Union's complaint is independent and starts apart from the complainants (although the complainants also allege a breach of s. 10, they do not pursue this by way of remedy), the Union should have the standing to pursue this claim.\n[24] For all of these reasons, the motion of the respondent MTS is dismissed. Any costs relating to the motion should be dealt with, if necessary, by the Tribunal hearing the complaints.\nSigned by\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] The Complainant, Richard Warman, alleges in his complaint that the Respondents, Bobby Wilkinson and the Canadian Nazi Party (CNP), engaged in a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, by communicating repeatedly hate messages through an Internet website. The discrimination is alleged to have been based on disability, religion, race, colour, sexual orientation, and national or ethnic origin. Mr. Warman claims that the messages communicated matter that would likely expose mentally disabled persons, Jews, Hispanics, blacks, gays and lesbians, Roma (a.k.a. gypsies), Pakistanis, Arabs, Chinese, and Japanese, to hatred and\/or contempt.\nA. The Respondents failed to appear at the hearing [2] At the opening of the hearing, which was conducted at the Tribunal's offices in Ottawa, the Tribunal called for appearances. Mr. Warman was present as was the lawyer representing the Canadian Human Rights Commission. The Tribunal asked if the Respondents were in the hearing room. There was no response. The Tribunal's registry officer stepped outside of the hearing room into the waiting area and again asked if the Respondents were present. There was no response.\n[3] The Tribunal then adjourned for 15 minutes. During the break, the staff at the Tribunal's reception desk confirmed to the registry officer that no one had telephoned in on behalf of the Respondents. When the hearing reconvened, there was still no sign of the Respondents or their representatives.\n[4] The Tribunal Registry's record of activity in this case demonstrates that the Respondents were made aware of these proceedings or reasonably ought to have been aware of them. When the Commission notified the Tribunal of its decision to refer Mr. Warman's complaint for hearing, it enclosed with its letter a copy of the complaint together with a form completed by the Commission entitled Summary of Complaint. This form indicated the same address for both Mr. Wilkinson and the CNP. The Commission subsequently informed the Tribunal that the original address given was incorrect (for reasons that I explain later in this decision), and on June 6, 2006, provided the Tribunal with Mr. Wilkinson's new address.\n[5] It is the Tribunal's practice, following the referral of a complaint, to send a number of letters to the parties. In the present case, the first letter, which was mailed on July 7, 2006, asked the parties if they were interested in participating in the Tribunal's mediation process. Although the letter was mailed to the updated address, the Tribunal did not receive any response from the Respondents. The Tribunal, therefore, followed up with a second letter on July 31, 2006. This letter did not elicit a response either. Consequently, the Tribunal retained a process server to serve both letters. In the process server's Affidavit of Attempted Service, which was produced as an exhibit at the hearing, the process server stated that between August 29 and September 12, 2006, he made five attempts to personally serve at Mr. Wilkinson's home over several days at varying times. On each occasion, the process server found no one at home. The documents could therefore not be served. During one of these visits, a neighbour confirmed to the process server that Mr. Wilkinson resided at that address.\n[6] The Tribunal retained a process server to serve a subsequent letter, dated November 23, 2006, inviting Mr. Wilkinson to participate in a case conference call with the Tribunal. The process server indicated in his Affidavit of Attempted Service that he made three attempts to serve the letter at Mr. Wilkinson's address but there was no answer at the door. The process server stated that on the third attempt, he spoke to a neighbour who confirmed that he had just spoken to Mr. Wilkinson and that he was still in his home. The neighbour described Mr. Wilkinson's car and it matched the description of the car parked in the front yard of the home. The process server knocked on the door and identified himself. He announced that he had papers to deliver from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. He could hear someone inside the home telling a dog to be quiet. The process server then placed the documents in a sealed envelope and taped it to the front door.\n[7] Subsequent affidavits from the process server indicate that there was no answer at the door when he made several attempts to serve a letter summarizing the case conference call as well as another letter containing the Notice of Hearing, which indicated the date, time and location of the hearing. Both letters were therefore placed in sealed envelopes and taped to the front door of the dwelling.\n[8] Given this information, and the fact that the Respondents or their representatives failed to present themselves at the opening of the case, I decided to proceed with the hearing in their absence. They did not appear at any time during the course of the one-day hearing, nor did they notify or contact the Tribunal Registry following the hearing.\n[9] The Respondents have not provided the Tribunal with any submissions or other documents. The recitation of the facts in this decision is therefore based solely on the evidence adduced by the Commission and Mr. Warman.\nB. Section 13 of the Act [10] In order to substantiate a complaint of discrimination under s. 13(1), it must be established that:\na person or group of persons acting in concert\ncommunicated telephonically or caused to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament,\nany matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[11] Section 13(2) specifies that s. 13(1) applies to matter that is communicated by means of the Internet.\nC. What is the material that Mr. Warman alleges constitutes hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act? [12] Mr. Warman states in his complaint that the alleged hate messages were found on a message board (or forum) that he claims forms part of the CNP's website. I will be referring to this message board as the CNP Forum. The Internet address of the CNP's website is said to be pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty. The Commission and Mr. Warman allege that Mr. Wilkinson administered and maintained the website, including the CNP Forum, and that he was also personally responsible for some of the impugned postings thereon.\n[13] The alleged hate messages can be divided into two categories. The first consists of material that has been posted on the CNP Forum by someone using the moniker Rocket440, and the second consists of material that has been posted by person(s) using other monikers. As I explain later in this decision, the evidence establishes that the postings by Rocket440 were in fact made by the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson, and that Mr. Wilkinson administered the CNP website (i.e. pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty), including its message board, the CNP Forum.\n(i) What is the material that was posted by Rocket440? [14] The following material was posted by Rocket440 on the CNP Forum. Postings on the CNP Forum were organized under a number of discussion groupings. I have therefore indicated the date of the posting and the name of the discussion under which the posting was made.\na) September 30, 2003 - Name of discussion: The People's Voice [15] On September 30, 2003, Rocket440 made four postings within five minutes of each other. These postings did not form part of a conversation with other people who were also posting messages, as is a common practice on message boards. Instead, each posting appears to have been made up of a large number of email messages that were sent by numerous persons to some unnamed individual. The email messages were grouped within Rocket440's four postings according to year - 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2002-2003. Certain comments were inserted between the email messages, the content of which would suggest that all of this material had been previously posted on some other website. It appears that Rocket440 had copied this material from the other website and posted it on the CNP Forum.\n[16] A total of 49 pages (single-spaced) of these postings were filed by Mr. Warman. The general theme of this material is fairly consistent. I have included a number of excerpts from the passages highlighted by Mr. Warman during his testimony. There are numerous grammatical and typographical errors in the postings, which I have opted not to remove or correct:\nYou MORON! I can tell you this much, you buttfucking jewlover, you'll burn in hell. By protecting the jewish scum, that we know Our Lord Jesus Christ hated so much, you act like the devil himself. You know as well as I do that no one was gassed in Auschwitz, and most of the LIE they call Holocaust is just that, a lie.\nHere in America, we have Niggers who don't want to get a fucking job, their lazy black asses do nothing but collect social security, welfare, and food stamp! We put those monkeys in fucking houses, we pay for their fucking bastard kids, we buy their cars! [...] The NIGGERS! Those porch monkeys don't want to fucking work, they just smoke crack, and leech off an already oxidised system. [...] Sure a few kikes fried in Hitlers rule, who says they didn't ask for it? They served a devine perpase in the war, their skin made nice boots, and they help the medical field out tremendasly! What do the niggers help us do? [...] They drive down the road with fucking jungle bunny music blasting away. They are the scourge of the nation, and yet, nothing is done. You want to kill a nigger? Stop welfare! You want to scare one? Take the bastard to an auction! [...] They are all the time talking about Free Africa send those fucking niggers back there, we don't need them! Fuck, send back all the towel heads, kikes, spics, wetbacks send them all in a big boat, then sink the fucking thing! Watch them scurry like rats fighting each other for survival, then shoot each one who just about makes it! [...] You are a trator to your race and your country if you think that the niggers will ever do shit to benefit mankind other than dieing!\nMessage from the KKK-Colition of USA, Niggers we own you... we owned your grandfathers coons and grandmother coons, and they had your nigger parents and your counsive nigger selfves and therfor I own all you niggers and nigglits so bow down and suck my cock!!! [...] THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WHITE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WERE WROTE BY WHITE MEM FOR WHITE MEN! AND NOT YOU EVIL NIGGERS!

Niggers should be where they astarted, either on a farm picking cotton or in Africa and trying to do things by themselves.\nI pray one day soon that a f\u00fchrer will come and lead our people and rid of all the fucking kikes, niggers, spics, chinks, japs, etc... and our world will be once again the fatherland.\nI strongly urge my government and any other mostly white country to rise up and kill all Arabs, African, Indian asian, or anyother not white person in the world.\nArabs. They are sub-humans who do not deserve to share this planet with us.\nWhy can a nigger who isn't qualified for a job get it just because he's black; that's discrimination to the white man. The only faith I have left in this country is that the KKK and White Power grops all across the nation will fix this terrible mess with genocide.\nb) October 1, 2003 - Name of discussion: America's media controlled by Jews [17] On this date, Rocket440 posted a text that ran for almost two full pages single-spaced, under the discussion entitled America's media controlled by the Jews. The text itself is entitled Three Jewish Newspapers. I have excerpted a number of sections from this text:\nThe suppression of competition and the establishment of local monopolies on the dissemination of news and opinion have characterized the rise of Jewish control over America's newspapers. The resulting policy could hardly be better illustrated than by the examples of the nation's three most prestigious and influential newspapers: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. [...] They are the ones that decide what is news and what isn't, at the national and international levels. They originate the news; the others merely copy it. And all three newspapers are in Jewish hands.\n[...]\nThe New York Times was founded in 1851 by two Gentiles [...]. After their deaths, it was purchased in 1896 [...] by a wealthy Jewish publisher, Adolph Ochs. His great-great-grandson, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., is the paper's current publisher and the chairman of the New York Times Co. The executive director is Joseph Lelyveld, also a Jew (he is a rabbi's son).\n[...]\nThe Washington Post, like the New York Times, had a non-Jewish origin. [...]\nIt was [later] purchased at a bankruptcy auction by Eugene Mayer, a Jewish financier and former partner of the infamous Bernard Baruch, industry czar in America during the First World War.\nThe Washington Post is now run by Katherine Meyer Graham, Eugene Mayer's daughter. [...]\nThe Washington Post Co. has a number of other media holdings in newspapers [...], in television [...], and in magazines, most notably the nation's number-two weekly newsmagazine, Newsweek.\nThe Wall Street Journal, which sells 1.8 million copies each weekday, is the nation's largest-circulation daily newspaper. It is owned by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., a New York corporation that also publishes 24 other daily newspapers and the weekly financial tabloid Barron's, among other things. The chairman and CEO of Dow Jones is Peter R. Kann, who is a Jew. Kann also holds the posts of chairman and publisher of the Wall Street Journal.\nMost of New York's other major newspapers are in no better hands than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. In January 1993 the New York Daily News was bought from the estate of the late Jewish media mogul Robert Maxwell (born Ludvik Hoch) by Jewish real-estate developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman. The Village Voice is the personal property of Leonard Stern, the billionaire Jewish owner of the Hartz Mountain pet supply firm. And, as mentioned above, the New York Post is owned by News Corporation under the Jew Peter Chernin.\nForum Administrator\nc) October 20, 2003 - Name of discussion: Heil Hitler [18] On this date, Rocket440 posted a reply to another participant on the CNP Forum, who had adopted Fuhrer as his moniker. Fuhrer's initial posting on a discussion that he had entitled Heil Hitler was:\nI am High school student who believes in Nazism, and has Adolph Hitler as his Hero.\nThe first posting following this entry on the forum was made by Rocket440, who simply said great. Mr. Warman filed in evidence a whole series of subsequent postings in this discussion attributed to different monikers, but there is no evidence that any of these entries were made by Rocket440.\nd) November 17, 2003 - Name of discussion: Alberta's need for a strong Nazi party [19] On this date, Rocket440 made a posting in a discussion that another participant in the CNP Forum had opened, entitled Alberta's need for a strong Nazi party. He wrote the following:\nNiggers are becoming a household object...but no matter what, parents will always cringe when their sons\/daughters bring home a Nigger.\nWhy is it it's ok to openly advertise the fact that you love Niggers, but a moral sin to even dare put down a Black.\nForum Administrator\/Napkin Monitor\nThe term Napkin Monitor was not explained or defined in the evidence. However, I did receive evidence regarding the functions of a forum administrator, on which I elaborate later in this decision.\ne) November 24, 2003 - Name of discussion: Join the National Nazi Socialist Movement [20] On this date, Rocket440 made what appears to be the initial posting of a new discussion entitled Join the National Nazi Socialist Movement: Info on Joining the National Nazi Movement. The posting begins with the following paragraphs:\nAt a time when only deeds count and words are of little importance\nAdolf Hitler-\nIn a time when racism is so considered an act of utter atrocity, and the thinkings of narrow minded people, why does the white race allow so much of it to be directed towards us?\nIt's perfectly acceptable for one Black to call another Black a Nigger. It's acceptable for Blacks to even have a television station for themselves entitled Black entertainment television. Who could also forget about Black History Month, Kwanza, and even the Black Panthers. It has even stretched into sexuality. Gay pride parade, something most of us are familiar with, well why can't we have a straight pride parade? or heterosexual pride parade? The gay community would not stand for it just as the Black community doesn't stand for the KKK, though the Black Panthers are perfectly acceptable.\nIt's time to take a stand, the last stand. It's time for the 4th coming. Are you not tired of interracial relationships? The white race is being sullied and in a matter of time will completely wiped out. Are you not tired of immigration laws?\nSimply being angry will not stop these great annoyances. We must band together as a single nation of Whites, and reclaim what is due as the master race.\nWe have plans to do it right this time. We will gain power through numbers, and by Government. If we can have members in Government of all states, and Countries there will be no need for war, and even if there is a need no one can declare war on the world. Join us today, and help out in any way you can.\nRocket440 then set out the prerequisites for joining the National Nazi Movement as follows:\n-at least 17 years of age\n-Pure white background\n-Supporter of the Nazi, and socialist movement\n-Prepared to take action\n-Love your race\nPlease post the following vitals in this forum\n-Name\n-Age\n-Location\n-Race\n-Email\nThanks goes out to all supporters.

Canada needs a good kick in the knickers to get itself out of the rut that democracy and equality of peoples has dug us into.\nRocket440's reply was simply:\nCouldn't have said it better myself!\nForum administrator\/Napkin Monitor.\n(ii) What is the material that was posted by persons using monikers other than Rocket440? [22] Mr. Warman highlighted a number of other excerpts from the pages that he viewed and printed from the CNP Forum, which were written by persons using monikers other than Rocket440. Mr. Warman contends that Mr. Wilkinson, as administrator of the website, is liable under s. 13 of the Act for any matter found on the website that offends this provision. Some of these excerpts are as follow:\nOctober 21, 2003 - Posting by 1488 EffeKt 1488 in the discussion entitled Where do you stand?: Blacks: it's a known fact they brings [sic] crime, they are nothing but trouble. Kill them all I say. Jews: Do I even need to say why? Kill em all I say.\nNovember 5, 2003 - Posting by furhrer in the discussion entitled Heil Hitler: In the dawn of Nordic civilization, lesser races used to cringe in their rude huts and pray, `Lord, save us from the fury of the men of the North!' It was THAT kind of man who built Western civilization. If civilization is now to be saved from the swarms of degenerate Jews, their cannibal accomplices and their unspeakably depraved liberal friends, it will be THAT kind of man who saves it, NEVER sneaks.\n(iii) Is the material likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt, within the meaning of s. 13(1)? [23] To be caught by s. 13(1) of the Act, it must be established that the impugned matter is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[24] In Nealy v. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the term hatred involves feelings of extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. The Tribunal added that contempt suggests looking down upon or treating as inferior the objects of one's feelings. The two terms are not necessarily co-extensive. In some instances, hatred may be the result of envy of superior qualities such as intelligence, wealth and power, which contempt, by definition, cannot be.\n[25] The Nealy Tribunal went on to say that the use of the word likely in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary to prove that the effect of the communication will be that those who hear the messages will direct hatred or contempt against others. Nor is it necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was so victimized.\n[26] These findings were later endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892. The Court added that the terms hatred or contempt in s. 13(1) refer to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification.\n[27] I find that the material presented in this case is likely to expose the targeted groups to hatred or contempt within the meaning of s. 13(1). In Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50, the Tribunal analyzed the growing body of s. 13 jurisprudence and observed that there a number of hallmarks of material that is more likely than not to expose members of a targeted group to hatred or contempt. In my view, many of these hallmarks can be found in the material that is before me in the present case.\n[28] One of the hallmarks identified in Kouba is the communication of the idea that members of the targeted group are devoid of any redeeming qualities and are innately evil, or the idea that nothing but banishment, segregation or eradication of the targeted group will save others from the harm being done by this group. The September 30, 2003, postings contain comments reflecting these hallmarks. Many of the messages call for getting rid of minority groups and the death of all Jews and Niggers. Another message urges government to rise up and kill all Arabs, African, Indian, Asian or any other not white person in the world. Elsewhere in these postings, Arabs are said to be non-humans who do not deserve to share the planet with us.\n[29] In Rocket440's posting of November 24, 2003, he calls for the segregation, if not banishment, of all non-whites, by exhorting others to band together as a single nation of Whites, and reclaim what is due to the master race.\n[30] Calls for the annihilation of a targeted group are found in the messages on the CNP Forum posted by persons other than Rocket440. On October 21, 2003, 1488EffeKt1488 wrote, Kill [all Blacks] I say. Jews : Do I even need to say why? Kill em all I say.\n[31] The Kouba decision points out that another common hallmark of hate messages is the dehumanization of targeted groups through comparisons to and associations with animals, vermin, excrement and other noxious substances. Similarly, the use of highly inflammatory and derogatory language, creating a tone of extreme hatred and contempt, is also indicative of hate messages.\n[32] The September 30, 2003, postings are replete with such messages. Blacks are referred to as porch monkeys and are compared to dogs. People of Arabic origin are described as sub-humans. Disparaging language regarding numerous targeted groups is used throughout these texts (e.g. fucking kikes, niggers, spics, chinks, japs, fucking cock sucking jew, kill ass niggers, jews and faggots, niggers and nigglets, towel heads). In Rocket440's postings of November 17 and 24, 2003, he repeatedly referred to Blacks as niggers.\n[33] The trivialization or celebration of past persecution or tragedy involving members of a targeted group are also hallmarks of hate messages. One can find messages of this sort in the September 30, 2003, postings. One remark states that no one was `gassed' in Auschwitz, and most of the LIE they call `Holocaust' is just that, a lie. Another excerpt mocks the victims of the Holocaust and celebrates their victimization by stating a few kikes fried in Hitlers rule [...] they served a divine purpose in the war, their skin made nice boots, and they help the medical field out tremendasly [sic]. Elsewhere in these postings, the slavery of African Americans is mocked: You want to scare one? Take the bastard to an auction, and Niggers we own you ... we owned your grandfather coons and grandmother coons [...].\n[34] Calls to take violent action against a targeted group are also a hallmark of hate messages. There are many such incitements to be found in the material put before me in this case. In the postings of September 30, 2003, there are calls to kill all niggers, jews and faggots, and messages wishing that another participant on the message board burn in a nazi jew burning oven with the rest of those inferior jews and niggers. As I noted earlier, in the posting of October 21, 2003, 1488EffeKt1488 asserts that Blacks and Jews should be killed (Kill them all I say).\n[35] Another hallmark identified in Kouba relates to the portrayal of the targeted group as a powerful menace that is taking control of major institutions in society and depriving others of their livelihoods, safety, freedom of speech and general well-being. The material posted on October 1, 2003, under the discussion America's media controlled by Jews falls within these categories. The article argues that Jews have taken over control of major media outlets in America from Gentiles. It links the evidently undesirable phenomenon of the suppression of competition and the establishment of local monopolies on the dissemination of news and opinion with the rise of Jewish control over America's newspapers. It relies upon purported facts regarding the ethnic and religious backgrounds of persons involved in news media to advance these negative generalizations, which is another hallmark identified in Kouba.\n[36] One could argue that the concentration of media ownership constitutes a legitimate object of public discourse. However, given the context of the other material regarding Jews that Rocket440 had posted on the CNP Forum (e.g. fucking cock-sucking Jew, death to all the Jews, ...burn in a Nazi Jew burning oven with the rest of those inferior Jews and niggers), it is evident that the posting is not a discussion about the state of capitalism in North America, but rather a portrayal of Jews as a menace to Canadian society.\n[37] In sum, therefore, messages found on the CNP Forum, posted by Rocket440 and others, bear one or more of the hallmarks of hate messages, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act. I therefore conclude that this material is likely to expose members of the targeted groups (including Blacks, Jews, Asians, homosexuals, and Latin Americans) to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nD. Were the impugned messages communicated repeatedly? [38] According to s. 13(1) of the Act, the communication of hate messages must occur repeatedly to constitute a discriminatory practice. Mr. Warman testified that any member of the public would have been able to access the CNP Forum via the Internet. Since the messages could be viewed at any time by anyone using the Internet, in my view, they were indeed being communicated repeatedly (see Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11 at para. 62; Schnell v. Micka (20 August 2002: CHRT), para. 129; Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Winnicki; 2005 FC 1493 at para. 32).\nE. Does the evidence establish that the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson communicated or caused to be communicated the impugned messages on the Internet? [39] In order to establish the link between the impugned messages found on the CNP Forum and the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson, Mr. Warman produced discussion excerpts from the CNP Forum as well as from another online forum that is found on a website called Stormfront.org, which is based in the United States.\n[40] One of the discussion participants on Stormfront.org used the moniker MeinStruggle. Participants to this forum could indicate their location in the margin next to their postings. Meinstruggle gave Canada as his location. In a posting on the Stormfront.org forum, dated October 2, 2003, MeinStruggle wrote the following: I am attempting to start my own movement. Visit our board for more info. He then identified the board as pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty, which is the address of the website where Mr. Warman says he viewed the hate messages discussed earlier in this decision, i.e. the CNP Forum.\n[41] On November 23, 2003, a message was posted on the CNP Forum by two Italian Nazi guys, seeking advice on how to immigrate to Canada. Someone using the moniker Rocket440 responded to the message on November 26, 2003, and suggested that they communicate with him directly by email to his email address, bobby.wilkinson@sympatico.ca. At the end of Rocket440's message appeared the words Forum Administrator\/Napkin Monitor.\n[42] Bell Sympatico is an Internet Service Provider that is operated by Bell Canada. Mr. Warman testified as to his understanding that Bell Sympatico allows its clients to whom it provides Internet access, to use a small amount of space on its website (sympatico.ca) where they can establish their own small Internet website. These small websites are typically registered under the client's email address. Mr. Warman claims that he gained this understanding from the evidence that was adduced in another Tribunal case in which he was involved, Warman v. Winnicki, File T1021\/0205. These client websites can be accessed via a Bell Sympatico website known as www3.sympatico.ca. On December 8, 2003, Mr. Warman submitted the name bobby.wilkinson to this website, and a web page identified as the Index of \/bobby.wilkinson\/ appeared. There were no folders or files listed under the index, but Mr. Warman testified, based on his understanding of how this Bell Sympatico service functioned, that for the index to exist, there must have been an active Bell Sympatico client using the name bobby.wilkinson. Given the Respondents' absence from the hearing, Mr. Warman's evidence on this point was not contradicted.\n[43] On November 29, 2003, Rocket440 posted a message on the CNP Forum, in response to a posting by someone from Toronto who had just joined the forum. Rocket440 replied, Welcome! I'm from Ottawa, but I visit T.O. regularly. He signed off his message again as the Forum Administrator.\n[44] Mr. Warman produced a printout of what he described as the home page of the Canadian Nazi Party's website and forum. It consists principally of a table of contents listing the various topics of existing discussions that were present on the CNP Forum. At the top of the page, there is an image of a Swastika. At the end of the home page is a link on which a visitor can click to Contact [the] Administrator. Mr. Warman testified that by clicking on this link, his email program automatically generated a window for a new email message, the addressee of which was bobby.wilkinson@sympatico.ca.\n[45] Mr. Warman stated in his evidence that the last time he had managed to view the CNP Forum on the Internet was on December 21, 2003. When he attempted to access the website on February 23, 2004, he was denied entry. Instead, a system message from ezboard appeared stating that the website was Banned and Locked Down! The message went on to say:\n(canadiannaziparty) has been locked down in accordance\nwith ezboard's Terms of Use\nReason: hate speech\n[46] Mr. Warman testified that ezboard is an Internet web hosting service that is available from a website known as ezboard.com. It enables users to set up websites and forums for free. I gather from the wording of the CNP Forum's Internet address that this message board was hosted by ezboard.com (i.e., pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty).\n[47] On August 28, 2004, MeinStruggle made a posting on the Stormfront.org forum. The title of his posting was Calling All Aryans in Canada, Please Help. He stated in his first paragraph:\nMy name is Bobby, I formerly ran the Canadian Nazi\/Socialist forum off of ezboard until it was shutdown due to Hate Speech. This was early last year, and the forum was shutdown around January of this yr.\nThe shutdown date falls between the date when Mr. Warman was last able to view the CNP Forum (December 23, 2003) and the date when he was denied entry to the website (February 23, 2004).\n[48] In the same August 28, 2004, Stormfront.org posting, MeinStruggle wrote the following paragraph referring to a human rights complaint having been filed against him but served on his grandfather:\nThis morning a letter arrived addressed to my grandfather (whom which the home in which I operated this site belonged to) ...now here's the good part addressed to my grandfather but flat out accusing me of being a bigot, and uttering hate speech, which violates section 13(1) of the human rights act. Remember addressed to my grandfather the internet connecting is in my name, and the email address used for correspondence on the forum was in my name, as well as the user name on ezboard. All allegations pertaining to this case are directed at me, but addressed to my grandfather?\n[sic throughout]\n[49] The Commission filed documents at the hearing indicating that Mr. Warman's complaint in the present case was initially served by error on someone named Robert P. Wilkinson, who is not one of the Respondents. A memorandum to the Commission's file prepared by one of its human rights investigators, dated November 3, 2004, states that she had been contacted by a lawyer representing Robert P. Wilkinson. The lawyer explained that his client was the grandfather of the Respondent, Bobby James Wilkinson. He added that the younger Mr. Wilkinson had been living at his grandfather's home, and that the grandson owned a computer that he kept in the basement. On November 8, 2004, the Commission received a letter from the lawyer confirming that his client, Robert P. Wilkinson, is not the same person as Bobby James Wilkinson, whose website and on whose computer the material complained of originated.\n[50] The Commission apparently learned subsequently that the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson had at some point thereafter moved out of his grandfather's house. Consequently, the Commission hired a process server to trace his new address. On May 29, 2006, the process server notified the Commission that he had located Mr. Wilkinson at an address in the Ottawa area. This information was eventually conveyed to the Tribunal. It was at this new address that the Tribunal's process server attended to serve the letters referred to earlier in this decision.\n[51] Based on all of this evidence, I draw the following inferences. To begin with, someone named Bobby was posting on the Stormfront.org message board under the name MeinStruggle. Bobby claimed to run a message board of his own, which had the Internet address pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty. This is the Internet address that appears on the printouts of the CNP Forum's pages, where Mr. Warman found and viewed the alleged hate messages. Bobby declared on Stormfront.org that his message board had been shut down by ezboard in a period that is consistent with the date when Mr. Warman testified that he could no longer access the website. I therefore conclude that Bobby was the CNP Forum's administrator.\n[52] The forum's administrator (i.e., Bobby) posted messages on the board using the moniker Rocket440 and had an email address comprised of the name bobby.wilkinson. The August 28, 2004, posting on Stormfront.org by Bobby (a.k.a. MeinStruggle) together with the information provided by Robert P. Wilkinson's lawyer lead me to conclude that the same individual (Bobby) is the grandson of the person mistakenly served with Mr. Warman's complaint (Robert P. Wilkinson). The grandson's name is Bobby Wilkinson.\n[53] I have already determined that a number of the messages posted by Rocket440 (i.e., the forum administrator, Bobby Wilkinson) constitute hate messages within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act, as do several other messages posted on the CNP Forum under different monikers. While the evidence does not suggest that Mr. Wilkinson authored the posts issued under the monikers other than Rocket440 (i.e. it has not been shown that he communicated this matter), he may still be found to have engaged in a discriminatory practice under s. 13 if he caused these messages to be communicated. I have determined that Mr. Wilkinson was the administrator of the CNP Forum. Mr. Warman filed in evidence an excerpt from ezboard.com's online help page regarding the role of forum moderators on message boards. This document indicates that message board administrators apparently have the ability to edit or delete postings or the content of entire discussions. The administrator may also set the forum security settings so that posts are screened before they can be viewed by the public.\n[54] On the basis of this evidence, I conclude that Mr. Wilkinson, as the CNP Forum's administrator, had the means to ensure that the impugned postings made by other participants were never viewed publicly or were subsequently removed. Moreover, since Mr. Wilkinson personally contributed to some of the discussion groups in which these postings were made (e.g. the discussion in which 1488EffeKt1488 posted the October 21, 2003, message), Mr. Wilkinson must have viewed them. He nevertheless allowed these messages to remain publicly posted. As such, I am satisfied that Mr. Wilkinson caused these messages to be communicated within the meaning of s. 13 (see Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, at paras. 111-2.).\n[55] In my view, therefore, a prima facie case of discrimination by the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson has been established. These inferences, if believed, are complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent Bobby Wilkinson (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at 558 (O'Malley). Given Mr. Wilkinson's absence from the hearing, no answer to the case made against him was provided, nor does any such answer or explanation emerge from the evidence that was produced by the other parties in this case.\n[56] Furthermore, no evidence has been presented to me to contradict the inference that the individual named Bobby Wilkinson who has been served with numerous documents in these proceedings is the Bobby Wilkinson who administered the CNP Forum and who posted messages on this forum under the moniker Rocket440.\nF. Has a case of discrimination been established against the Canadian Nazi Party? [57] Mr. Warman has named the Canadian Nazi Party as a party in his complaint. He points out that the CNP Forum was found on a website whose name incorporated the words Canadian Nazi Party (i.e. pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty). The actual name used to describe the CNP Forum on the website was National Nazi and Socialist Forum. When Mr. Wilkinson posted messages on the Stormfront.org message board in October 2003, he stated, I'm attempting to start my own movement. Please visit the board for more info. The Internet address given in the messages was that of the CNP Forum.\n[58] On the CNP Forum's main page, one could view a list of links to the forum's various discussions. One of those discussions was entitled Join the National Nazi Movement - Information on joining the National Nazi Socialist movement. Clicking on the link brought the visitor to another page, at the bottom of which the Prerequisits [sic] for joining the National Nazi Movement were set out, as follows:\nAt least 17 years of age\nPure white background\nSupporter of the Nazi and socialist movement\nPrepared to take action\nLove your race.\nThe page then asks the visitor to provide the following vitals:\nName\nAge\nLocation\nRace\nEmail\n[59] No evidence was led demonstrating that the Canadian Nazi Party exists as a legal entity. The only mention of this name in the evidence is found in the above-noted Internet address. Elsewhere on the website, there is some mention made of the National Nazi Movement and the National Nazi Socialist Movement.\n[60] It is a discriminatory practice for a group of persons acting in concert to communicate or cause to be communicated repeatedly hate messages over the Internet (ss. 13(1) and 13(2) of the Act). The group of persons contemplated in these provisions need not necessarily be organized within a distinct entity having a formal legal status (see Nealy v. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450 at D\/6464).\n[61] On the home page of the website, there is a list of the various main discussions found on the CNP Forum. One of the discussion topics is entitled Members. The description given of this discussion is Member of the Nazi\/Socialist Party. Mr. Warman entered into evidence a printout of a posting on this discussion by Rocket 440. The subject heading of the posting is Welcome to our newest member, following which is listed the name of an individual, his age, his background (Scottish), his gender (male), his location (Toronto) and email address. Mr. Warman notes that this information matches precisely the details requested on the Join the National Nazi Movement form.\n[62] However, in my view, this evidence establishes nothing more than that this supposed new member filled out the questionnaire on the CNP Forum website. Even if one were to accept that this individual was an actual member of Mr. Wilkinson's movement, s. 13 of the Act contemplates more than the mere existence of a group of persons. The persons must be acting in concert to communicate or cause to be communicated the impugned messages. There is no evidence that this supposed new member was in any way involved in the communication of the messages, nor is there any evidence, for that matter, of any meetings, gatherings or organizational structure of any sort, associated with this alleged group.\n[63] Mr. Warman pointed out that the website's home page lists the monikers of the moderators for the CNP Forum discussion groups. There are two monikers listed: Meinstruggle (presumably Mr. Wilkinson) and Landser88, whose actual identity if he is someone other than Mr. Wilkinson, cannot be determined from the evidence before me. In my view, this information is not sufficient to demonstrate that two or more individuals were acting in concert to administer and\/or moderate the content of the CNP Forum, through which the impugned hate messages were caused to be communicated. I am not persuaded that the Canadian Nazi Party ever existed in any form nor that it was anything more than Mr. Wilkinson's alter ego. The evidence does not establish that anyone other than Mr. Wilkinson acting alone administered the website.\n[64] The complaint against the Canadian Nazi Party has therefore not been substantiated and is dismissed.\nG. Remedies [65] The Commission and Mr. Warman request that the Tribunal issue several orders pursuant to s. 54 (1) of the Act.\n(i) An order that the discriminatory practice cease (s. 54(1)(a)) [66] Section 54(1)(a) empowers the Tribunal to order a respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or prevent it from occurring in the future.\n[67] Accordingly, I order Mr. Wilkinson to cease and desist from communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, and particularly the Internet, any matter of the type contained in the messages at issue in this case that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(ii) Penalty (s. 54(1)(c) [68] The Tribunal may order a respondent who engaged in a discriminatory practice set out in s. 13 of the Act, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000, pursuant to s. 54(1)(c). Section 54(1.1) enumerates several factors that the Tribunal must take into account when deciding whether to make such an order:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice;\nThe wilfulness or intent of the respondent, any prior discriminatory practices that he or she has engaged in, and his or her ability to pay the penalty.\nThe Commission and Mr. Warman have requested that a penalty of $6,000 be imposed against each of the respondents.\n[69] Commission counsel stated, in her final arguments, that the content of the hate messages was both vicious and extreme. She pointed out that not only did the messages attribute numerous and varied criminal acts to the [targeted] groups, described them as corrupt and devious, but some messages went so far as to openly advocate the extermination of Jews, Blacks and other non-whites. She concluded that this ought to weigh heavily in favour of the assessment of a significant penalty. The evidence, in my view, supports this submission.\n[70] I would add, further, that it does not matter whether Mr. Wilkinson actually authored some of the hate messages, including those of September 30, 2003. It was ultimately he who decided to post this material on the message board, irrespective of its origin. Besides, Mr. Wilkinson wilfully caused to be communicated repeatedly all of the impugned hate messages by establishing and administering the CNP Forum on which the messages were placed (see by analogy, Warman v. Kulbashian, supra, at para. 144).\n[71] I have no direct evidence before me of Mr. Wilkinson's ability to pay a penalty, although from the fact that he was residing in the basement of his grandfather's home until some time between 2004 and 2006, it may be inferred that he is a relatively young person of modest means. I note as well that no evidence was introduced demonstrating that Mr. Wilkinson had engaged in prior discriminatory practices.\n[72] Taking all of these factors into account, I order Mr. Wilkinson to pay a penalty of $4,000. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date on which this decision is served on Mr. Wilkinson.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

It argues that this document contains privileged information protected by section 34 of the Employment Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c. 44, which states:\n34 (1) Information obtained by the Commission under this Act is privileged and shall not knowingly be, or permitted to be, communicated, disclosed or made available without the written consent of the person from whom it was obtained.\n(2) No member of the Commission or person employed by it who obtains information that is privileged under subsection (1) shall be required, in connection with any legal proceedings, other than proceedings relating to the administration or enforcement of this Act, to give evidence relating to that information or to produce any statement or other writing containing that information.\n(5) No information obtained by the Commission or a Tribunal under this Act may be used in any proceedings under any other Act without the consent of the employer concerned.\n[3] The Respondent further argues that any information contained in this document would not be relevant and would constitute hearsay evidence.\n[4] I will deal briefly with the second argument. The production of documents is subject to the test of arguable relevance, not a particularly high bar to meet. There must be some relevance between the information or document sought and the issue in dispute. There can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that all relevant evidence is available in a proceeding such as this one. A party is entitled to get information or documents that are or could be arguably relevant to the proceedings. This does not mean that these documents or this information will be admitted in evidence or that significant weight will be afforded to them.\n[5] Does section 34 of the Employment Equity Act prevent the disclosure of this document? The purpose of the Employment Equity Act is to ensure equal representation in the workplace of persons who fall within the four designated groups -- women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, and visible minorities. Pursuant to its mandate under section 22, the Commission may initiate an employment equity compliance review audit on any employer subject to the Employment Equity Act. Subsection 34(1) provides that information obtained by the Commission from employers during an audit is privileged and shall not knowingly be communicated, disclosed or made available without the consent of the person from whom it was obtained.\n[6] The Respondent argues that the public benefit to be fostered by ensuring that the information contained in the Interim Report remains confidential is to promote a full and frank exchange of information between employers and the Commission.\n[7] In considering the public interest in keeping information confidential, it is necessary to consider the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Employment Equity Act. Both are quasi-constitutional in nature: see Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571, Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536. The purpose of Employment Equity Act is to bring about equal representation in the workplace of members of designated groups. While the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to give effect to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices. Both purposes as we can see are very similar and they both seek to attain very important social goals.\n[8] The Complainants are not seeking disclosure of the documents or information provided by the Respondent to the Commission, which information would be privileged under section 34 of the Employment Equity Act. Rather, the document requested is the Interim Report, a document prepared by the Commission, which is an Appendix to the Final Report, prepared by the Commission. The Final Report was disclosed without any objections neither by the Commission, nor by the Respondent.\n[9] The Respondent argued that some part of the Interim Report contained information which had been provided to the Commission and was therefore protected under section 34 of the Employment Equity Act. The Respondent provided a copy of the Interim Report to the tribunal in which it had highlighted the passages which, according to them, made reference to such information. I have had the opportunity to review this document and the highlighted passages.\n[10] Upon considering the evidence before me, I come to the conclusion that, putting aside the passages that have been highlighted, there is no reason why the document should not be disclosed to the Complainants.\n[11] I therefore order that the Respondent provide forthwith to the Complainant a copy of the Interim Report in Appendix D of the Employment Equity Compliance Review Report, dated May 26, 2004 and that the following information, which is privileged under section 34 of the Employment Equity Act, be blanked out :\nPage 3 - Section entitled II Audit Methodology and Status\nPage 4 - The first line in the first paragraph of Section B. Employer Accomplishments\nPage 10 - The paragraph following the heading Methodology for 2002 Employment Systems Review\nPage 10 - The First paragraph following the heading - Areas Selected for the Assessment of MTS's Employment System Review\n[12] The conditions contained in Chairperson Sinclair's Order of June 29, 2007, apply to this Order.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJuly 16, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1161\/4306\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTelecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc., Barbara Custance, Carmen Giroux, Chuck Hando, Kathleen Mulligan, Janice Sirett v.

The Respondent took specific issue with the Complainants' solicitor's argument in a letter dated July 6, 2007, in which they suggested that the Respondent had a duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship.\n[2] The solicitor for the Respondent argued that these allegations constituted additional allegations which had the effect of amending the complaints.\n[3] Having reviewed the Complaints and the Statement of Particulars and Amended Statement of Particulars, I note that in every one of these, the Complainants referred to a perceived disability. This being the case, I fail to see how the Respondent would be prejudiced by the allegations or the arguments contained in the letter of July 6, 2007.\n[4] On the issue of undue hardship and accommodation, I think it is important that we review the law as it relates to human rights. The complaints are brought pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Act. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In contrast to complaints under section 7 of the Act, which relate to employer actions affecting specific, named individuals, section 10 of the Act addresses the discriminatory effect that employer policies or practices may have on an individual or a class of individuals.\n[5] Section 3 of the Act designates disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Furthermore, it is now well-established that the protection of the Act extends to those who are mistakenly perceived to have a disability. (See Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665, at para. 49.)\n[6] Since the Supreme Court decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also called Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also called Grismer], the conventional distinction between direct discrimination and indirect discrimination has given way to a unified approach to processing human rights complaints. According to this approach, it is incumbent first on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in favour of the complainant, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. To do this the Complainant must satisfy the Tribunal that the Respondent has acted in a discriminatory manner in regards to the Complainant's disability or perceived disability.\n[7] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the onus shifts to the Respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that there is a bona fide justification for the discriminatory policy or standard. Thus, the Respondent must prove that:\nit adopted the standard for a purpose or goal rationally connected to the performance of the job. The focus at this step is not on the validity of the particular standard, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose, such as the safe and efficient performance of the job. Where the general purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the job, it will not be necessary to spend much time at this stage; it adopted the particular standard in good faith, in the belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the legitimate work-related goal, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. At this stage, the focus shifts from the general purpose of the standard to the standard itself; the impugned standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish its goal, that is, the safe and efficient performance of the job. The employer must demonstrate that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others affected by the standard without suffering undue hardship. It must ensure that any procedure that has been adopted to assess the issue of accommodation considers the possibility that it may unduly discriminate on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Moreover, the substantive content of a more accommodating standard offered by the employer must be adapted to each case. Subsidiarily, the employer must justify why it has not offered such a standard.\n[8] The Meiorin and Grismer decisions include parameters for determining whether a defence based on undue hardship has been established. In Meiorin, the Supreme Court pointed out that the use of the term undue infers that some hardship is acceptable. In order to meet the standard, the hardship imposed must be undue. It may be ideal from the employer's perspective to choose a standard that is uncompromisingly stringent. Yet the standard, if it is to be justified under the human rights legislation, must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[9] Considering the state of the law and considering the fact that the Complainants have referred to perceived disabilities from the start, I reject the Respondent's argument that the letter of July 6, 2007, raises new grounds.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario July 16, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1161\/4306\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nTelecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc., Barbara Custance, Carmen Giroux, Chuck Hando, Kathleen Mulligan, Janice Sirett v.

Treasury Board of Canada\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2007-02-05\nNeutral citation\n2007 CHRT 3\nFile number(s)\nT1154\/3606\nDecision-maker(s)\nJensen, Karen A.\nDecision type\nRuling\nDecision Content\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL TRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nBRIGITTE LAVOIE\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nTREASURY BOARD OF CANADA\nRespondent\nRULING\n2007 CHRT 3 2007\/02\/05\nMEMBER: Karen A. Jensen\n[1] This is a ruling on a preliminary motion to dismiss a complaint against the Respondent, Treasury Board of Canada, without a hearing. The Complainant, Ms. Brigitte Lavoie, filed a complaint against Treasury Board alleging that its new Term Employment Policy is discriminatory. The Policy does not allow maternity and parental leave time to count towards the three year cumulative service requirement needed to advance from term to indeterminate (permanent) employment status in the Federal Public Service.\n[2] Treasury Board argues that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint because, as a result of a settlement in a previous complaint, there is no longer a live controversy to be resolved. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, applies, and the complaint is moot.\nBackground [3] Ms. Lavoie was hired on a one year contract with Industry Canada as a programmer-analyst in August 2000. Her contract was renewed in August 2001, and again in August 2002. On August 19, 2002, Ms. Lavoie went on maternity leave. She returned to work from her leave on or about August 5, 2003.\n[4] Prior to her return to work, Ms. Lavoie was informed by her employer that she would be given an opportunity to compete for several permanent (indeterminate) positions within Industry Canada. Those who were unsuccessful would be given three weeks to find a new position. Ms. Lavoie was unsuccessful in the competition for the indeterminate positions. Her contract with Industry Canada ended in August 2003, and was not renewed.\n[5] Prior to her departure on maternity leave, Ms. Lavoie's employment was subject to a Treasury Board Policy regarding Term Employment. That Policy stipulated that where a person had been employed in the same department as a term employee for a cumulative period of five years without a break in service longer than sixty days, the department was required to appoint the employee indeterminately at the level of his or her substantive position. Time spent on unpaid leave counted towards the cumulative five year working period that was required to become an indeterminate employee. Maternity and parental leave were considered to be unpaid leave.\n[6] While Ms. Lavoie was on maternity leave, however, the Treasury Board Term Employment Policy changed. The five year requirement was reduced to three years, but time on unpaid leave no longer counted towards the cumulative working period. Were it not for the fact that she was on maternity and parental leave for a year, Ms. Lavoie would have qualified, under the new Treasury Board Policy, for an indeterminate position.\n[7] In July 10, 2003, Ms. Lavoie filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Industry Canada alleging that the new Treasury Board Policy was discriminatory. She also alleged that the way in which Industry Canada handled the competitions for the indeterminate positions was discriminatory. Among the remedies that she requested was an appointment to an indeterminate position in Industry Canada.\n[8] On October 20, 2003, Ms. Lavoie entered into a settlement agreement with Industry Canada in which she agreed to withdraw her complaint in exchange for certain concessions. Specifically, Industry Canada granted her an indeterminate position as a programmer-analyst effective November 17, 2003. Ms. Lavoie agreed that the settlement constituted full and final compensation for all of the incidents alleged in her complaint against Industry Canada. In the settlement agreement, however, Ms. Lavoie reserved the right to file a complaint against Treasury Board regarding the new Term Employment Policy.\n[9] On January 19, 2004, Ms. Lavoie filed another complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, this time against Treasury Board, in which she has alleged that the new Term Policy is discriminatory. Although one of the consequences of the allegedly discriminatory Policy has been remedied since she now holds an indeterminate position with Industry Canada, Ms. Lavoie claims that she continues to suffer other negative consequences as a result of the Policy for which she has not received compensation. In addition, she seeks an order from the Tribunal requiring Treasury Board to amend its Term Employment Policy to permit maternity and parental leave to count towards the cumulative working period.\nAnalysis [10] The Respondent argues that by virtue of the settlement of October 2003, with Treasury Board, the Complainant relinquished the right to claim any personal remedies flowing from the allegations made in the first complaint. Given that the allegations and the relief claimed in the first complaint are similar, if not identical, to those in the second complaint, the Respondent argues that the Complainant cannot claim a personal remedy in the second complaint. The Respondent also bases its argument on the principle of the indivisibility of the Crown.\n[11] Thus it is argued that, even though the Complainant reserved the right to file a complaint against Treasury Board regarding the Term Employment Policy, there is no longer a live controversy between the Complainant and the Respondent because the Complainant does not have a personal interest in the resolution of the complaint. Without that, Treasury Board argues, the complaint is moot and should not be heard by this Tribunal. Finally, the Respondent argues that the allegations regarding the discriminatory nature of the new Policy have been conclusively determined in other forums and thus, there is no public interest in having the Tribunal examine this issue.\n[12] For the following reasons I find that these arguments are without merit.\n[13] Firstly, the Act does not require a complainant to pursue a personal remedy against the respondent in order to bring a complaint. Indeed, the Act does not require the complainant to be the victim of the alleged discriminatory practice. Section 40 of the Act stipulates that any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file a complaint with the Commission. Moreover, section 53 of the Act provides the Tribunal with the authority to issue orders, in the event that the complaint is substantiated, that are not necessarily of a personal nature, but serve a broader public purpose in their remedial goals. Therefore, it is not necessary that the complaint be filed in pursuit of a personal remedy in order for the Tribunal to have the jurisdiction to hear it.\n[14] Secondly, this Tribunal has held that a change in circumstances following the filing of a complaint or the settlement of the personal interests in a complaint does not necessarily deprive the Tribunal of the jurisdiction to hear the complaint (Parisien v. OC Transpo 15 July 2002; CHRT, at para. 42; and Kavanagh v. Canada (Correctional Services) 31 August 2001; CHRT, at paras. 7-9). Rather, these may be issues that will go to the question of the appropriate remedy in the event that the complaint is substantiated.\n[15] It appears from the complaint form that Ms. Lavoie is asking for additional remedies that were not claimed in the first complaint. Whether she is barred from doing so in light of the settlement that she obtained from Industry Canada is an issue to be determined by the Tribunal in the event that the complaint is substantiated.\n[16] In the settlement agreement, Ms. Lavoie specifically reserved the right to file a complaint against Treasury Board with regard to the new Term Employment Policy. The question of whether the new Policy is discriminatory has not therefore, been settled. Furthermore, I agree with the submissions of counsel for Ms. Lavoie that there has, to date, been no binding determination regarding the precise question that has been put before this Tribunal in Ms. Lavoie's complaint. Other than Braconnier v. Treasury Board, 2006 CRTFP 109, none of the authorities provided by the Respondent deal with the Policy in question in this complaint. In Braconnier, the arbitrator did not deal with the question of whether the new Policy was discriminatory since he found that he did not have jurisdiction to deal with this issue as a result of s. 7 of the Public Service Labour Relations Act. Thus, the question of whether the Treasury Board Policy on Term Employment is discriminatory is a live issue that has yet to be decided.\n[17] For all of these reasons I find that the Respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the issues raised have been settled and are now moot cannot succeed. The motion is therefore, dismissed.\nSigned by\nKaren A. Jensen\nOTTAWA, Ontario February 5, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1154\/3606\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBrigitte Lavoie v.

Jensen\n[1] On March 18, 2003, Sandy Lipp (n\u00e9e Culic) brought a complaint against Canada Post Corporation alleging that Canada Post had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability. In its decision dated January 24, 2007, the Tribunal considered five allegations. Of the five allegations, the Tribunal found that three were substantiated. With regard to one of the two allegations that were not substantiated, the Tribunal found that Ms. Lipp had established a prima facie case. However, the Respondent demonstrated that the requirement was a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[2] The Tribunal held that it had the authority to award legal costs and ordered that Canada Post pay the reasonable costs to Ms. Lipp of retaining counsel both prior to and during the hearing in relation to the discriminatory practices that were alleged and found to be substantiated in the complaint. The Tribunal directed the parties to attempt to come to an agreement on the quantum. However, jurisdiction was retained on this issue in the event that the parties were unable to reach such an agreement.\n[3] The parties notified the Tribunal that they could not come to an agreement. A hearing on this issue was held by videoconference on July 16, 2007.\n[4] Counsel for Ms. Lipp argued that s. 53(2)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act authorizes the Tribunal to provide full indemnity for the legal costs incurred by Ms. Lipp. Section 53(2)(c) stipulates that if the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal may make an order that the person who engaged in the discriminatory conduct compensate the victim for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[5] Counsel for Ms. Lipp cited Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 29 in support of her argument. In that case, the Tribunal held that where a complaint is substantiated, the task of the Tribunal is to attempt, insofar as may be possible, to make whole the victim of the discriminatory practice, subject to principles of forseeability, remoteness and mitigation. The Tribunal stated that a victim of a discriminatory practice could hardly be said to have been made whole if she were unable to seek reimbursement for the legal expenses associated with the pursuit of her complaint.\n[6] Counsel for Ms. Lipp argued, therefore, that the Tribunal should award full indemnity for all of the legal costs incurred in preparing for the hearing, representing Ms. Lipp during the hearing and in preparing the final written argument. This amounted to a total of 165 hours and a total legal bill of $52,197.75. In the alternative, counsel for Ms. Lipp stated that the Tribunal should assess costs on the basis of the degree of success achieved by the Complainant and by the amount of time spent on each allegation was substantiated. She argued that assuming that the discussion of each issue in the decision corresponds roughly with the time spent in preparation for and at the hearing, roughly 84% of the time spent and costs incurred were on the allegations which were substantiated. Therefore, reasonable legal costs would amount to 84% of the total expenses incurred.\n[7] Counsel for Canada Post argued that according to the Act, and the wording of the Order in the present case, the costs for which compensation is to be provided relate only to those allegations of discriminatory conduct that were substantiated. Given that not all of the allegations in the present case were substantiated, compensation for all of the legal expenses incurred cannot be awarded.\n[8] Counsel for Canada Post argued that the general rule in civil litigation is that the successful party is awarded costs on a party and party basis, which is assessed according to the tariffs established in the relevant jurisdiction. This usually amounts to 30-50% of the total legal costs incurred. He stated that if a victim of sexual assault can only hope to be reimbursed for 30-50% of his or her legal costs in the civil courts, there is no reason why a victim of discrimination should expect to be reimbursed for the full quantum of his or her legal costs.\n[9] Counsel for Canada Post argued that the Tribunal should consider the time spent on the successful allegations and reimburse the Complainant for 30-50% of that time. He stated that, in his view, 50% of the hearing and preparation time was spent on the substantiated allegations. Ms. Lipp should, therefore, be awarded 50% of that, or 25% of the total legal expenses incurred.\n[10] There are no hard and fast rules about how to assess reasonable legal costs in a human rights complaint.\n[11] In Brooks v. Department of Fisheries and Oceans 2005 CHRT 26, the Tribunal adopted the practice of the Federal Court on the assessment of costs and stated it was using the Federal Court Rules as a guideline in this regard. The respondent in that case applied for judicial review of the Tribunal's award on costs. In its decision on the application, the Federal Court did not comment on the Tribunal's use of the practice of the Federal Court on the assessment of costs, but held that the Tribunal had erred in failing to properly take into account the offers to settle that were made in that case (Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks 2006 FC 500, at para 25).\n[12] In Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces 2006 CHRT 49, the Tribunal stated that there was nothing in the Federal Court's decision in Brooks that required the Tribunal to apply or even to refer to the Federal Court Rules when making an award of costs. In Mowat, the Tribunal decided not to refer to the Federal Court Rules. Rather, three sources were considered: the description of the legal services set out in the legal accounts submitted for Ms. Mowat; the quantity of evidence and number of exhibits submitted at the hearing relating to the sexual harassment allegation which was found to be substantiated, relative to the total evidence and exhibits for the dismissed allegations; and the Bill of Costs submitted by each party calculated on a party and party basis.\n[13] In the Nkwazi case, the Tribunal ordered that the Complainant be reimbursed for reasonable legal costs incurred on a solicitor and client basis, since the Respondent's conduct that gave rise to the litigation, as well as its conduct during the litigation, was so reprehensible, scandalous and outrageous, that such an order was warranted.\n[14] In my previous decision in the present case, I stated that I did not think that the Tribunal had the statutory authority to order costs on a solicitor and client basis (Culic v. Canada Post Corporation 2007 CHRT 01, at para. 318). Moreover, I would now add that even assuming the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to order solicitor client costs, the Respondent's conduct in the present case does not come close to the scandalous nature of the Respondent's conduct in Nkwazi. Therefore, such an order would not be appropriate in the circumstances.\n[15] In my view, the Tribunal's authority under s. 53(2)(c) to award compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice means that compensation must be limited to that portion of the costs that may be allocated to the preparation for and litigation of the substantiated allegations.\n[16] While I agree, in general, with the approach of the Tribunal in Mowat, I see nothing in the statute that requires the Tribunal to assess those costs on a party and party basis. On the contrary, depending upon the facts of the case, such an award might well be inappropriate. As the Tribunal noted in Nkwazi, supra, not every human rights complaint involves monetary issues. Individuals with complaints relating to the denial of access to services, for example, may not have sustained any financial loss, and thus will have no prospect of a monetary remedy beyond, perhaps, a nominal award for their pain and suffering. Most complainants in human rights cases are people of very modest means. Therefore, they might well be discouraged from bringing complaints if faced with the likelihood of paying large legal bills for which they will receive only very modest indemnification.\n[17] This is particularly so in light of the fact that in recent years the Canadian Human Rights Commission has chosen not to participate in many hearings before the Tribunal. Complainants, most of whom have no legal training whatsoever, often now find themselves facing off against very experienced legal counsel for the Respondent. It is not surprising that many choose to retain legal counsel.\n[18] In the present case, Ms. Lipp chose to retain legal counsel on the eve of the hearing. Therefore, the legal costs incurred were limited to a modest amount of preliminary preparation, representation during the hearing and work on the written submissions that were provided to the Tribunal on August 21, 2006.\n[19] Ms. Lipp was successful in substantiating three of the five allegations raised in her complaint. While I do not agree that 84% of the time spent during the hearing and in closing submissions was devoted to dealing with the substantiated allegations, I also do not agree with the Respondent that it was only 50%. The three substantiated allegations involved complex factual circumstances and required careful analysis and presentation. However, I agree with counsel for the Respondent that the first allegation, which involved an issue of systemic discrimination in the scheduling process at Canada Post and which was not substantiated, occupied a good deal more time in the hearing and the closing submissions than counsel for Ms. Lipp allowed.\n[20] Based on my review of the evidence and the submissions of the party, my estimation of the time and resources devoted to dealing with the substantiated allegations is 65%. This is the percentage of the costs that I think were incurred as a result of the discriminatory practices. Ms. Lipp is therefore entitled to 65% of the legal costs that she incurred. That sum is $33,928.54.\n[21] Pursuant to s. 53(1)(c), Canada Post is ordered to pay Ms. Lipp the sum of $33,928.54 in compensation for reasonable legal costs incurred as a result of the discriminatory conduct.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] The complainant in this case is Brian Rick Moore. He works for Canada Post Corporation (CPC) in the Vancouver Mail Processing Plant (VMPP).\n[2] Mr. Moore filed a complaint dated July 12, 2001 with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against CPC. He alleges that CPC contravened ss. 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The prohibited ground of discrimination is disability.\n[3] On the motion of CPC, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) was added as a respondent to his complaint.\n[4] There are two elements to his complaint. First, Mr. Moore alleges that CPC discriminated against him by permanently assigning him to the Manual section and reclassifying him from a PO5 to a PO4, at a lower wage rate, because of his disability; and\n[5] Second, Mr. Moore claims that in 1999, CPC adopted a policy that adversely differentiated between permanently, partially disabled (PPD) employees and other employees by limiting the shift bid choices of PPD employees. This resulted in Mr. Moore having to work the graveyard shift (12 a.m.-8 a.m.) in 2001 and 2002, which caused him physical and emotional difficulties.\n[6] Mr. Moore claims damages for lost wages and other benefits resulting from being reassigned and reclassified and for the difficulties he experienced because he had to work the graveyard shift. And for both elements, he claims damages for the loss of the right to be free from discrimination.\nII. DECISION [7] For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal has concluded that Mr. Moore has not substantiated the first element of his claim. As to the second element, the Tribunal concludes that CPC did engage in a discriminatory practise. But Mr. Moore has not demonstrated that, but for the discriminatory practise, he had the seniority to successfully bid on the day shift or afternoon shift. Accordingly, the Tribunal has not made any award of compensation.\nIII. FACTS (i) 1981-1994 [8] Mr. Moore was first hired by CPC in May 1981 as a mail handler. This job consisted of sorting parcels and mail bags into containers, dispatching mail and transporting mail containers to loading areas.\n[9] In April 1989, Mr. Moore injured his back lifting a heavy mail bag. He was off work for about 3 weeks and when he returned to work, he was on modified duties.\n[10] Mr. Moore's return to work was based on an Occupational Fitness Assessment (OFA) completed by his doctor, Dr. Taylor, dated November 7, 1989. In the OFA, Dr. Taylor indicated that Mr. Moore was able to perform his usual duties but may require adjustment of his workload from time to time because of his back problem. On November 11, 1989, he returned to full duties.\n[11] In May 1990, CPC reclassified all the Mail Handler PO2 positions to Despatcher, PO5.\n[12] In September 1992, Mr. Moore again injured his back while at home. He was off work until November 1992, returning to modified duties outside of his PO5 duties.\n[13] Dr. Taylor completed another OFA for Mr. Moore on June 30, 1993. In this assessment, he indicated that Mr. Moore was restricted to standing for not more than 15 minutes, he should avoid any bending or twisting and was restricted to lifting not more than 25 pounds. Dr. Taylor also indicated that Mr. Moore was fit to return to work full time but on modified duties within these restrictions.\n[14] In August 1993, seeking to better understand Mr. Moore's fitness for work, CPC's medical consultant, Dr. Haakonson, requested additional medical information from Dr. Taylor.\n[15] Dr. Taylor provided this information on August 14, 1993. His assessment was that Mr. Moore had a history of lower back problems and was prone to injury. He also outlined what he considered to be Mr. Moore's work limitations.\n[16] This information was given to Dr. Haakonson. He reviewed Dr. Taylor's medical assessment and concluded that Mr. Moore should be designated as permanently, partially disabled with the following work limitations:\nStanding - not more than 30 minutes at one time, Bending and twisting - must avoid repetitive forward bending, Lifting from the waist - not more than 55 pounds, Lifting waits to head - not more than 55 pounds, Carrying - not more than 55 pounds.\nHe advised the Director, Plant Operations on August 26, 1993, of Mr. Moore's restrictions and recommended that Mr. Moore be assigned to permanent work within these restrictions. He also wrote to Mr. Moore telling him of the designation and limitations and also that the specified limitations would be used to determine his position.\nA. Temporary Modified Duties \/ PPD Restrictions [17] There are two categories of injured workers at CPC. The employee who is injured but is expected to recover within a short period of time and who will be assigned temporary modified duties. And the PPD employee who has been assessed as having a permanent partial disability and who is assigned to work within specified PPD restrictions.\n[18] The procedure for employees who require temporary modified duties is that they would provide a note from their doctor. If the medical note is sufficient, they are assigned the appropriate modified duties by their supervisor. If CPC requires more information, the supervisor would request that the employee obtain a more detailed medical note, usually an OFA which would indicate the nature of their injury, and give an estimate of how long modified duties are required.\n[19] Most temporary modified duties are for two to three months, but could be extended for up to six months. In such case, a further medical assessment would be required.\n[20] If the need for modified duties continues beyond six months, the matter is discussed with CPC's Occupational Health Services (OHS). Additional medical information (AMI) would be requested and reviewed by the CPC's medical consultant. The extension may be granted or the employee may be designated as PPD if so warranted by the medical information.\n[21] If an employee is classified as PPD, CPC's medical consultant will provide to the Director, Plant Operations, a field summary setting out the PPD restrictions. He will pass this on to inform the employee's manager or supervisor so that the PPD employee will be assigned work appropriate to the restrictions.\n[22] The PPD restrictions are ongoing in the absence of any new medical information. If a PPD employee brings in new medical information, this would be given to the CPC medical consultant who would decide whether the PPD restrictions should be modified or removed. If so, a new field summary would be issued.\n[23] In October 1993, Mr. Moore met with his supervisor and manager to discuss his assignment as a PO5 within his PPD restrictions. He was assigned to operating motorized equipment (forklift) which was one of the PO5 duties of the rotation of duties. Mr. Moore was to operate the forklift to the exclusion of all of the other PO5 rotation of duties.\n[24] Mr. Moore worked on the forklift from October 1993 until December 1994. Apparently, this caused considerable resentment among Mr. Moore's co-workers who felt that he was getting special treatment. They believed that if he was fit enough to work on the Despatch dock, he should work more of the PO5 rotation. Some of his co-workers took this up with Mr. Moore's manager and requested that Mr. Moore be assigned elsewhere.\n[25] In December 1994, Mr. Moore's supervisor asked him to step down from the forklift duties because of these complaints. He voluntarily agreed to do so to reduce the tensions and he was assigned to Letter Carrier Pre-sort (LCP) which is in the Manual section.\n(i) 1995-1998 [26] Mr. Moore worked in LCP for about six weeks, but he felt that he was not getting the opportunity to work on the motorized equipment in LCP. So he asked to return to the Despatch dock.\n[27] His supervisor agreed and Mr. Moore returned to the PO5 rotation in early 1995 on modified duties. The PO5 rotation of duties on the Despatch dock were as follows:\nNorth fork: loading & unloading annex trailers.\nWell fork: unloading trucks and transporting mail between the receiving & dispatch dock\nRover fork: transporting & organizing the containers of mail on the dispatch-dock\nAMF Fork: loading and unloading Airmail trailers to and from the airport\nCity Fork: loading 5 ton trucks and organizing monotainers and mail on 1st floor.\nCity Mono Dumper: dumping monotainers of City mail down the chute\nForward Mono Dumper: dumping monotainers of forward mail on belt\nTransport pallet lifter: transporting mail form the dispatch-dock mainly to and from 1st, 3rd, and 4th floor via elevator.\n3rd Fwd pallet lifter: transporting fwd mail on the 3rd floor, and between the 3rd and 2nd floor via elevator.\n4th floor pallet lifter: transporting monotainers of mail on the 4th floor.\nLetter Carrier Presort: manually breaking down and sorting mail bags and bundles of mail from monos\nDock cleanup: mostly sorting and breaking down heavy domestic, USA and International mail coming from the airport\nRelief Positions: these relief positions are used to cover any absentee due to a regular day off, sick leave or vacation etc.\nThe rotation list was prepared at least six weeks in advance and each employee would rotate through the list\n[28] Mr. Moore testified that the only job that he could not do was the dock cleanup. He said he was able to do the other jobs on the PO5 rotation, sometimes with self-accommodation, when necessary.\n[29] It was common practice on the Despatch dock to trade jobs. Usually, Mr. Moore was able to trade the dock cleanup job for another job with a co-worker. If he was unable to trade the dock cleanup which happened occasionally, Mr. Moore would advise his supervisor and he would be relieved from this duty.\n[30] Mr. Moore worked the PO5 rotation from early 1994 to early June 1998. On June 14, 1998, he went on sick leave because of back pain. He went to see Dr. Taylor on June 24, 1998 who completed another OFA. Dr. Taylor indicated restrictions on walking, lifting, carrying etc, which essentially were the same as Mr. Moore's restrictions from August 1993. Dr. Taylor said that Mr. Moore could return to work on June 29, and that he could resume his PO5 duties in two to three months.\n[31] Mr. Moore did return to work on June 29, but was assigned to the Manual section, S\/L Prime, one of the most sedentary jobs in the VMPP. He was there for about two weeks and then went on vacation for five weeks, returning to work on August 17, 1998 to his regular PO5 duties.\n[32] However, on September 24, 1998, he went on sick leave again because of back pain. He returned on September 29 and worked for about one hour on the Despatch dock but could not continue because of his back pain. He was assigned again to, S\/L Prime.\n[33] At the request of CPC, Mr. Moore obtained another OFA from Dr. Taylor on October 6, 1998. In this OFA, Dr. Taylor indicated that Mr. Moore was not to operate the forklift, as bouncing would aggravate his back. Dr. Taylor indicated that Mr. Moore could return to the PO5 rotation within his limitations in 15- 28 days.\n(ii) Occupational Health Services Memoranda [34] Following Dr. Taylor's June 24, 1998 OFA, there were a series of memorandums from Sharon Harlos, the OHS nurse to various Superintendents between June 1998 and November 1998. In her June 30, 1998 memo, Ms. Harlos inquired whether Mr. Moore had returned to work and she was advised that Mr. Moore had returned to work on June 29, 1998 and was assigned to S\/L Prime.\n[35] On July 22, 1998, the OHS nurse asked for an update on Mr. Moore's status and was told that he was on annual leave for another month.\n[36] In a September 25, 1998 memorandum to Ms. Harlos, Andrew Langdon, Area Superintendent, said that Mr. Moore had been off from June 14-25, was on modified duties in S\/L Prime until July 13 when he went on annual leave. He returned on August 17, 1998 to his PO5 duties.\n[37] Mr. Langdon noted that Mr. Moore booked off sick on September 24 because of his bad back and was still off on September 25. Mr. Langdon went on to say that Mr. Moore indicated to him that if he were to return, he would require modified duties indefinitely. Mr. Langdon suggested to OHS that Mr. Moore be asked to complete an OFA if he is not able to return. And perhaps, given Mr. Moore's condition, CPC should explore the possibility of a permanent reassignment for him.\n[38] Mr. Langdon also had a discussion with Mr. Moore sometime in early October 1998 about assigning him permanently to Manual because of his limitations. Mr. Moore recalled this discussion. He said that Mr. Langdon asked him if he was interested in being reassigned to Manual and becoming a PO4. Mr. Moore told him that he was not interested, but if he changed his mind, he would let him know.\n[39] On November 2, 1998 Ms. Harlos wrote to Martin Osborne, Area Superintendent, asking whether Mr. Moore was working up to his PPD restrictions. If he was not back to his previous restrictions, he needed to be reassessed. Mr. Osborne's reply was that Mr. Moore was not back on PO5 duties.\n[40] This exchange led to Mr. Moore's OFA in November 9, 1998, in which Dr. Taylor reaffirmed his previous recommended restrictions and added that Mr. Moore was to avoid operating the forklift and pallet lifter. If this was so, Mr. Moore would be restricted from doing more than half of the PO5 duties.\n[41] Mr. Moore testified that by the end of 1999, he still did not feel that he was capable of going back to his PO5 duties. He continued to see Dr. Taylor for his back problems in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. He also said that because his back was so sore, Dr. Taylor sent him to a physiotherapist who treated him over the period from December 2000 to 2003. During that period he experienced back pain although he was doing one of the most sedentary jobs at the VMPP.\nB. Prelude to Mr. Moore's Permanent Assignment to S\/L Prime and PO4 [42] In 1998, Neil McClure was A\/Manager, Production Control & Reporting. His job was to ensure that the VMPP operated to meet its delivery commitments to its customers. His many responsibilities included work schedules, annual leave, vacation, equal opportunity, scheduling, health and safety and consultations with CUPW with respect to these matters.\n[43] At that time, there were problems with CPC meeting its customer commitments. CPC had to bring in casual workers and pay overtime to process the mail. In his wanderings around the plant, Mr. McClure noticed that at one point, there were only four or five persons working in City Parcels on the day shift, but the work schedule showed 25 positions.\n[44] When Mr. McClure asked why there were so few people working there, he was told that employees had bid into City Parcels but were not able to do the work. So they had to be accommodated elsewhere, and most of them had been assigned to S\/L Prime. Mr. McClure was concerned about this because CPC was spending a lot of extra money on overtime and casual hours to meet customer commitments.\n(i) The 1999 Shift Bid [45] The collective agreement between CPC and CUPW provided that CUPW could request that an annual shift bid be held for certain groups of employees in the VMPP. The bidding process took place between September and November for shift assignments which commenced on the second Sunday of the following calendar year.\n[46] The collective agreement also provided for consultation between CPC and CUPW relating to changes in the system of work and other matters. In August 1998, CUPW requested a shift bid and advised CPC that it was available for consultation relating to CPC's staffing proposals.\n[47] Mr. McClure first raised his concerns about the imbalance, particularly on the day shift at the first consultation with CUPW on October 2, 1998. He pointed out that, there were 118 PPD employees at the VMPP. Of these employees, approximately 43% worked on the day shift. (4 p.m.-12 a.m.).\n[48] Mr. McClure suggested two options that CPC was considering. One would allow employees to bid only into sections where they could be accommodated. The other would allocate employees on modified duties evenly, over all three shifts.\n[49] The reason for this imbalance was because of the shift bid procedures that were in place. Employees would bid into a work center that involved heavy work. They did so knowing that they could not do the work and would have to be accommodated elsewhere, for example, in Manual where the work is easier.\n[50] But they would have enough seniority in that work center to successfully bid for their preferred shift, usually #2 shift or #3 shift. When accommodated they would bring their bids with them to their accommodated position.\n[51] The effect was two-fold. It resulted in too many employees in one work center and insufficient number in another. Secondly, it created animosity among able-bodied employees who worked in the work center where the accommodated employees were assigned, who had more seniority.\n[52] At the next consultation on October 21, 1998, CUPW agreed that PPD employees could not bid into a section where they could not be accommodated. But CUPW wanted to review the situation for each PPD employee. CPC agreed to give CUPW a list of PPD employees showing where they had bid and where they were accommodated.\n[53] The question of PPD employees and shift bids was again discussed at the October 28, 1998 consultation. CPC indicated that there were about 120 PPD employees. Approximately 50% had bid into positions where they could not be accommodated and had asked to be assigned to other areas.\n[54] On December 1, 1998, CPC provided CUPW with a list of employees who could not be accommodated in the section\/work center in which they had bid. The list included Mr. Moore and showed his current bid result to be Despatch dock, #3 shift and his accommodation S\/L Prime, #3 shift.\n[55] At the next consultation on December 7, 1998, CUPW asked and CPC agreed that the current staffing of PPD employees would remain the same for 1999 because employees had not been given sufficient notice of CPC's proposal to change the shift bid procedures. But for the 2000 shift bid. PPD employees could only bid into areas in which they could be accommodated.\n(ii) CPC\/CUPW 1999 Memorandum of Agreement [56] Following the 1998 consultations, CPC and CUPW entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated January 8, 1999. The MOA set out procedures for accommodating PPD employees after s. 54.02 of the collective agreement was applied.\n[57] Under the MOA, CPC and CUPW were to consult on the appropriate placement of PPD employees into positions where they could be accommodated. PPD employees would be carried over complement and considered part of the work schedule for which they were assigned and would be assigned to any vacancy in the work schedule where they were being carried over complement.\n[58] Upon assignment, PPD employees would be red circled within their work schedule. This meant that, if PPD employees were accommodated and assigned to a position with a lower rate of pay, they would continue at their former pay rate until the rate for their accommodated position reached that level. This was to ensure that PPD employees would not suffer any wage loss because of the accommodation.\n[59] As to future shift bids, PPD employees would bid their seniority only into the work schedule where they were being accommodated. PPD employees could apply to have their situation reassessed if their physical limitations changed.\n[60] The accommodation of disabled or injured employees was an ongoing issue between CPC and CUPW. It was solely CPC's decision as to where a PPD employee would be accommodated. CUPW could not veto the decision. It could only grieve it if it disagreed.\n[61] CUPW wanted a process which would allow it to consult and give its input into accommodation decisions to PPD employees. The MOA allowed input of CUPW in the accommodation process.\n(iii) The 2000 Shift Bid [62] On September 29, 1999, CPC wrote to CUPW about its 2000 shift bid proposal. PPD employees who were assigned to a specific area in last year's bid would remain in that section unless their PPD status changed. And their seniority would decide the shift they would work. All other PPD employees would bid only in an area where they could be accommodated and seniority would govern.\n[63] There were a number of consultations in the Fall 1999, leading up to the last consultation on November 2, 1999. At that time, CPC had provided CUPW with an up-to-date list of PPD employees and their PPD restrictions in relation to the annual bid. There were 50 PPD employees, and for each one, the list showed how they were to be dealt with. Mr. Moore was listed as being accommodated in S\/L Prime and shown as red circled.\n[64] CPC was to notify these employees by letter which would identify their PPD status, limitations and which areas they would be allowed to bid for a position.\n[65] The new shift bid for 2000 procedure was announced to the employees both by CUPW and by CPC. In its November 3, 1999 Bulletin, CUPW announced that CPC and CUPW had spent considerable time at consultations, reviewing how to accommodate disabled employees. PPD employees would be contacted by the CUPW to confirm their placement and\/or bidding restrictions based on their limitations.\n[66] For CPC, Mr. McClure sent a letter dated November 12, 1999 to all VMPP employees outlining the changes for the 2000 shift bid. He also sent a letter to individual PPD employees as to their situation.\n[67] Mr. McClure sent Mr. Moore a letter dated November 15, 1999, in which he advised Mr. Moore that he had been permanently assigned to the Manual section since he was being accommodated in that area. His shift bid choices were Manual Prime #1, #2 or #3 shifts. He was also advised that his PO5 wage rate was red circled until the PO5 rate reached the PO4 rate.\n[68] As to why Mr. Moore was permanently reassigned, Mr. McClure said that CPC considered that his PPD limitations prevented him from doing any PO5 duties on the Despatch dock. And that Mr. Moore had been working in S\/L Prime since September 1998.\n[69] It is clear that CUPW was not involved in the decision to accommodate Mr. Moore in S\/L Prime in September 1998. It is also clear, that although CUPW had input into the accommodation for PPD employees through the consultation, CUPW did not make the decision with CPC to permanently assign Mr. Moore to Manual and reclassify him from PO5 to PO4.\nC. Mr. Moore's Grievances [70] After receiving Mr. McClure's November 15, 1999 letter, Mr. Moore contacted CUPW and completed an internal grievance form in which he claimed that his rights under the collective agreement had been violated. The reason he gave was that CPC had reclassified him from PO5 to PO4 without his consent by assigning him permanently to the Manual section because he was PPD. He concluded by stating that at this time, I do not feel confident at returning to my previous modified duties on the RT&D (Despatch dock), but would like the right to exercise my options in the future.\n[71] CUPW filed a formal grievance dated January 5, 2000. In the grievance, CUPW set out that in its November 15, 1999 letter, CPC improperly reclassified Mr. Moore from PO5 to PO4 and improperly changed his status. The remedy sought by CUPW was that Mr. Moore retain his PO5 status and be paid as a PO5.\n[72] In his February 1, 2000 letter to Mr. Moore, Mr. McClure officially confirmed his permanent reassignment to Manual S\/L Prime and that his wage rate would be red circled until the catch up to the PO4 rate.\n[73] CUPW filed a second grievance on behalf of Mr. Moore dated May 19, 2000. In this grievance, CUPW alleged that CPC improperly reduced Mr. Moore's rate of pay from PO5 to PO4. CPC was to compensate Mr. Moore for all lost wages and benefits and maintain Mr. Moore's rate of pay at the current level.\n[74] Both grievances were withdrawn by settlement agreements between CUPW and CPC. The January 5, 2000 grievance on June 13, 2003; the May 19, 2000 on February 6, 2001.\n[75] In his internal grievance form and in both CUPW grievances, Mr. Moore's accommodation to S\/L Prime was never challenged. Mr. Moore appeared to be content to work as a PO4 and receive the PO5 wage rate. It was only when his wage rate was red circled did he become concerned. But his concern and that of CUPW related to the change in his rate of pay, not the accommodation to S\/L Prime.\n[76] Ken Mooney was the CUPW grievance officer at the time and was responsible for grievances and arbitrations. He testified that CUPW withdrew the grievances because it had concluded that the grievances would not be upheld at arbitration.\n[77] There was arbitral jurisprudence that if an employee cannot perform the duties of a higher classification, the employer should not have to pay the wages of the higher classification. Mr. Mooney said that he had specifically discussed these arbitration decisions with Mr. Moore. When CUPW withdrew Mr. Moore's grievances in 2001 and 2003, a number of years had passed since Mr. Moore had done PO5 duties. And Mr. Moore had not provided any current medical evidence showing that he could return to work as a PO5.\nD. The 2000 and 2001 Shift Bids - Mr. Moore to the Graveyard Shift [78] Mr. Moore's 2000 bid form restricted his shift bid to Manual Prime #1, #2 or #3 shifts. He had consistently worked the #3 shift as a PO5 and from the time he was accommodated in S\/L Prime in September 1998.\n[79] For the 2000 shift bid, there were 292 positions available for bid in the Manual section distributed over the four work centers\/schedules: Manual Prime (S\/L and O\/S); FSM, LCP and City Finals. Of these, Mr. Moore was restricted in bidding for 158 positions or 54% of the total. Other employees in the Manual section were able to bid on all of the positions. In spite of the limitations, Mr. Moore successfully bid for his preferred #3 shift, afternoons.\n[80] In 2001, CPC separated Manual into S\/L and O\/s into two schedules (except on the #2 shift where they remained combined). Mr. Moore's shift bid was restricted to S\/L Prime, #1 and #3 shifts and Manual Prime #2 shift.\n[81] For the 2001 shift bid, there were 301 positions in the Manual section, but the number of positions available to Mr. Moore was 119 or 40% of the total. This was because S\/L and O\/S were now two schedules.\n[82] Mr. Moore did not have the seniority for the #2 or #3 shifts and the result was that he was bumped from #3 shift to #1 (graveyard) shift for 2001.\n[83] For Mr. Moore, his 2002 shift bid results were the same. In 2002, there were 278 positions in Manual. Mr. Moore was restricted to bidding for 84 or 30%. Again he ended up on the graveyard shift for that year.\n[84] In 2003, CPC restructured the VMPP. A number of sections were consolidated with the S\/L Prime so that the number of positions that Mr. Moore could bid on was increased. This allowed Mr. Moore to get the shift of his choice. So in January 2003, Mr. Moore returned to S\/L Prime #3 shift, where he remains today.\nE. Has Mr. Moore Established a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [85] In a human rights case before this Tribunal, the complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, i.e. credible, is complete and sufficient for a decision in the favour of the complainant, in the absence of a reasonable answer from the respondent. The respondent's answer should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004; Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6)\n[86] In his complaint, Mr. Moore alleges that CPC discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability. I cannot emphasize enough that failure to accommodate is neither a prohibited ground of discrimination nor a discriminatory practise under the CHRA. There is no free-standing right to accommodation under the CHRA.\n[87] The duty to accommodate only arises in the context of s. 15(2) of the CHRA and only when a respondent raises a bona fide justification by way of defense to an allegation of discrimination. For Mr. Moore to show a prima facie case, he must rely on something other that the failure of CPC to accommodate him.\n[88] Mr. Moore's allegations of discrimination against CPC are:\nCPC discriminated against him because of his disability by permanently reassigning him to the Manual section and by reclassifying him from PO5 to PO4; CPC differentiated adversely in relation to him by restricting his shift bid choices because of his disability.\nTo establish a prima facie case, Mr. Moore must show that his reassignment and reclassification contravened either s. 7(a) or s. 7(b) of the CHRA.\nF. Prima Facie Case - S. 7(a) of the CHRA [89] In terms of s. 7(a), it is clear that CPC did not refuse to employ Mr. Moore. It could be argued however, that CPC refused to continue to employ Mr. Moore as a PO5 by reclassifying him to PO4.\n[90] But CPC maintained Mr. Moore's PO5 rate of pay as a PO5 from September 1998 to January 2000, even though he was doing PO4 work. Mr. Moore did not ask at any time during this period to return to his duties.\n[91] It was only after November 15, 1999, when Mr. Moore was advised by Mr. McClure that he would be permanently assigned to Manual and red circled, that he raised an objection through his grievances.\n[92] In so doing, Mr. Moore never disputed the accommodation. By his own admission in his 1999 internal grievance form, Mr. Moore was not confident that he could return to his duties on the Despatch dock. At this point in time, CPC did not refuse to continue to employ Mr. Moore as a PO5. He could not do PO5 work then.\n[93] At the hearing before the Tribunal, Mr. Moore testified that his back had improved sufficiently to allow him to return to his PO5 duties in January 2000. Coincidentally, this is the same time he was officially reassigned and reclassified. But Mr. Moore never asked to return to PO5 duties. He did not speak to his supervisor or anyone else at CPC that he was ready to do so. Nor did he offer any medical evidence that he could do so.\n[94] Mr. Moore's explanation was that he believed his reclassification to PO4 removed the possibility of being able to resume his PO5 duties. But Mr. Moore could have taken steps to return to his PO5 duties if he felt capable. The collective agreement contains detailed provisions for transferring jobs and in fact, imposes an obligation upon an employee who wishes to do so to file a written application with their immediate supervisor indicating his\/her desire to transfer.\n[95] It was also Mr. Moore's evidence that he continued to see Dr. Taylor regarding his back problems in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. And on Dr. Taylor's recommendation, Mr. Moore went to physiotherapy between 2000 and 2003 because of his back was so sore. At no time in those years did Mr. Moore ask Dr. Taylor for medical assessment that would allow him to return to PO5 duties.\nIV. CONCLUSION [96] I find that when CPC reclassified Mr. Moore to a PO4 and reassigned him to Manual in January 2000, Mr. Moore was not capable of PO5 duties at that time. Nor does the evidence demonstrate that he could do PO5 work at any time thereafter.\n[97] I accept the proposition that has been enunciated in the arbitral decisions if an employee is not capable of performing the essential functions of his\/her job, an employer is justified in reclassifying the employee to a lower rated position. (see Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association v. OPEIU, b1 LAC (4th) 109; Chamberlin v. 599273 Ontario Ltd., 11 C.H.R.R. D\/110)\n[98] CPC did not refuse to continue to employ Mr. Moore by reclassifying him to PO4. Mr. Moore has failed to establish a prima facie case under s. 7(a) of the CHRA. This aspect of Mr. Moore's complaint has not been substantiated.\nA. Prima Facie Case - S. 7(b) of the CHRA [99] Did the reclassification and reassignment of Mr. Moore give rise to a prima facie case under s. 7(b) of the CHRA? I think not. It is not adverse differentiation to lower the wages of a disabled employee to correspond to the value of the work performed.\n[100] Further, as compared to those able-bodied PO4 employees who are doing PO4 work, Mr. Moore was paid the same. As for those employees receiving PO5 pay, their situation was not comparable to Mr. Moore. They were doing PO5 work and Mr. Moore was not.\n[101] For these reasons, Mr. Moore has not shown a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 7(b) of the CHRA because of his reclassification.\nB. Prima Facie Case? - Restricting Mr. Moore's Bidding Rights, s. 7(b) of the CHRA [102] Mr. Moore as a PPD employee was restricted to bidding only on some, not all of the positions in the Manual section. Able-bodied employees in the Manual section were not so restricted. Mr. Moore was so limited because of his disability. This is enough to establish a prima facie case on this aspect of his complaint.\n[103] The obligation is then on CPC to show that this restriction amounted to a bona fide justification and Mr. Moore was accommodated to the point of undue hardship as mandated in s. 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[104] CPC's proffered justification was that it was experiencing serious problems in meeting its customer commitments. This was because PPD employees would bid into work centers where they could not do the work and required accommodation in another work center. This led to an imbalance in some sections in the VMPP and not enough employees in other sections. Thus, CPC adopted the policy that an employee could only bid into the work section or schedule where they could be accommodated.\n[105] But CPC had the obligation to show that Mr. Moore was not capable of doing the work in any of the Manual work centers except S\/L Prime. There is no specific evidence that when Mr. Moore's shift bid was restricted, CPC made an assessment of Mr. Moore's ability to work in any of the Manual work centers other than S\/L Prime.\n[106] Rather, it appears that the decision was made on impressionistic evidence, namely, that Mr. Moore had been accommodated in S\/L Prime for a number of years. This is not a sufficient answer to meet Mr. Moore's prima facie case. This being the case, I conclude that CPC has engaged in a discriminatory practise.\nV. REMEDY [107] Mr. Moore asked for $2,500 as compensation for the loss of the right to be free from discrimination for the restrictions on his right to bid during the 2001 and 2002 shift bids; $2500 for the reckless way in which CPC reassigned and reclassified him and restricted his bidding rights; and $1,500 for the physical and emotional difficulties he experienced as a result of being bumped to the graveyard shift in 2001 and 2002.\n[108] The Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the CHRA to award compensation for the loss of the right to be free from discrimination. As to his claim for reckless conduct by CPC, I find that CPC took the decision to reclassify and reassign Mr. Moore as part of the overall business strategy to deal with its failing obligation to meet customer commitments. Consequential to this was the CPC's policy to assign employees where they could be accommodated. I do not find that, in doing so, CPC acted in reckless manner.\n[109] As to Mr. Moore's claim for physical and emotional difficulties, the Tribunal can recognize this through an award for pain and suffering. Mr. Moore's evidence is that working the graveyard shift made it very hard for him to sleep when he was off work. He says that he could only sleep three to four hours. Dr. Taylor recorded in his April 27, 2001 notes, insomnia, working graveyard shift permanently, whereas not sleeping well and gets palpitations. He prescribed Mr. Moore medication to aid his sleeping.\n[110] Mr. Moore also testified that graveyard shift affected his home life. It made him moody and confrontational in family affairs. This caused a lot of people to get uptight when they were around him at home. He said he felt like he was in a daze for most of the time except maybe on the weekend when he could catch up with his sleep.\n[111] I accept that Mr. Moore experienced some physical and emotional difficulties as a result of working the graveyard shift. But to receive any compensation Mr. Moore must show there was a serious possibility that, but for the discrimination, he would have obtained the #3 shift (his first choice) or the #2 shift (his second choice). (Sangha v. McKenzie Valley Land and Water Board, 2006 CHRT 9 at para. 216; Brooks v. Canada, 2006 F.C. 1244, paras 40-45).\n[112] Mr. Moore did not present any evidence that his seniority would have carried him beyond the #1 shift. For this reason an award for pain and suffering is not appropriate.\nA. Mr. Moore's S. 10 Complaint [113] In his complaint, Mr. Moore also alleged a contravention of s. 10 of the CHRA. But he did not point to any evidence to support this allegation or make any final submissions on this question. I assume he has abandoned this allegation. If not, it has not been substantiated.\nB. Liability of CUPW [114] As to any liability of CUPW on the question of reassigning and reclassifying Mr. Moore and limiting his shift bid, it is true that CUPW participated in the consultations that led to the MOA. But it was CPC that had the final decision as to Mr. Moore's fate. CUPW's role was to consult to ensure if possible that PPD employees were properly accommodated. CUPW did not make the final decision.\n[115] I conclude that CUPW has no liability arising out of Mr. Moore's complaint.\nSigned by\nJ.

It argued that these conversations had been taped without the knowledge and consent of Mr. Barnett and Mr. Roffey. The respondent added that the action of the complainant constituted a recording of private conversations between individuals done without their consent. It further argued that these taped conversations violated paragraph 7(b) of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 and paragraphs 5(1) and (2) of the Canadian Evidence Act, R.S. 1985, c. 5. Counsel for the respondent finally added that the probative value of the information contained on these tapes is outweighed by the prejudicial effects that its introduction would have on the respondent, although she never identified what these prejudicial effects were.\n[3] I have reviewed the authorities on this matter and have come to the conclusion that the tapes and the transcripts should be admitted into evidence for the following reasons.\n[4] In the decision R. v. Pleich (1980), 55 C.C.C.(2d) 13, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that taped conversations should be treated much like testimony from a witness who had overheard a conversation and made accurate notes. Audiotapes are original evidence that can provide cogent and convincing evidence. A tape has no memory problem and will better disclose exactly how words were used and the manner in which they were spoken than a witness who was a party to the conversation many years ago.\n[5] In the criminal context there are statutory provisions governing the authorization of intercepted private communication and their subsequent admissibility as evidence. Such is not the case in a civil matter. If the complainant had been deemed a government actor for the purposes of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the reception of this covertly tape recorded evidence could have been the subject of an attack on the grounds that the respondent's charter rights to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure had been infringed. But the Charter does not apply in this case since the parties are not government actors.\n[6] Outside criminal matters, most of the cases regarding covertly tape recorded evidence have arisen in labour relations situations. Labour relation boards have long espoused a policy that such evidence is not admissible because of the paramount importance of maintaining trust and informality in the parties' ongoing relations. Such is not the case in this matter. This is not a situation of labour relations and certainly not a matter where the trust and informality of the ongoing relationship of the parties still exist.\n[7] I have reviewed the legislative provisions raised by counsel for the respondent and I conclude that they are not relevant to the decision I have to make on the issue of admissibility. I refer the parties to subparagraph 50(3)c) and paragraph 50(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Act which reads as follows:\n50 (3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may:\n(c) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law.\n(4) The member or panel may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reasons of any privilege under the law of evidence.\n[8] No decision or argument was presented which would show that such evidence would be inadmissible in a court of law. Applying the best evidence rule, the tapes, in all cases where they are not consistent with the transcript, will have precedence.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 8, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT832\/8203\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBarbara Tanzos v.

INTRODUCTION [1] On December 8, 2001, Barbara Tanzos (the complainant) filed a complaint under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) against AZ Bus Tours Inc. (the respondent). The complainant alleges that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice on the grounds of sex and disability, in a matter related to employment.\n[2] No preliminary motion or objections were raised at the hearing.\nA. THE FACTS [3] The respondent is a charter bus company. It started its operation in 1998. It is in the business of providing highway passenger bus transportation between destinations primarily within the province of Ontario. The majority of its business, at the time relevant to this matter, was day runs to the Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario. It also chartered buses to other destinations outside of Ontario.\n[4] The complainant began her employment with the respondent on May 21, 2000, as a bus driver. From October 2000 until March 2001, she was on sick leave. She returned to work on March 7, 2001, under certain medical restrictions. On October 18, 2001, her employment with the respondent ended.\n[5] The complainant's principal employment duty was to drive a passenger bus between Toronto and Orillia, Ontario. In particular, she was required to drive passengers between various pick-up locations in Toronto and the Casino Rama, in Orillia. She was occasionally required to drive a bus between other locations, on charter trips. On Casino Rama runs, passengers would disembark upon arrival at the casino and spend several hours there. It took approximately one hour and thirty minutes for her to drive from Toronto to the Casino Rama. It took her approximately two hours to drive from Casino Rama to various passenger drop-off locations and then to the respondent's garage on Weston Road, in Toronto.\n[6] The respondent keeps track of the hours worked by its bus drivers on a bi-weekly time sheet. These time sheets include a column marked Total Working Hours. This column refers to the period of time beginning when an employee arrives at the respondent's business premises prior to his or her first trip of the day, and ends after the employee returns the bus to the garage after his or her last trip of the day.\n[7] The evidence shows that the drivers are paid on a per trip basis by the respondent. A compensation tariff sets out the pay. As of March 5, 2001, the compensation tariff showed that a single trip of less than twelve hours and thirty minutes was paid $100.00; trips of more than twelve hours and thirty minutes were paid $110.00. The compensation tariff also has provisions for double or triple trips. The respondent also paid a bonus of ten dollar a day to full-time drivers after one year of full service.\n[8] According to the evidence of Terry Barnett, the General Manager of the respondent at all time relevant to this matter, work was allocated to the drivers on a seniority basis. The dispatcher was responsible for assigning the work to the drivers. The work would first be allocated to various crews of drivers for a period of six weeks. After the work was assigned to the crews, what was left was allocated on a daily basis by the dispatcher to the employees to whom work had not yet been assigned.\n[9] On October 7, 2000, the complainant, on her doctor's recommendation, applied for sick leave due to stress, chest pains, chronic headaches, etc. Her sick leave was approved by the respondent on October 9, 2000. On March 7, 2001, her doctor gave her clearance to return to work part-time three days a week and also recommended that she not work night shifts.\n[10] Following her return, the complainant testified that she only got called to work for the first time on March 18. This situation worried her because she had been informed that the respondent was in the process of hiring new drivers and she was not getting any work. Her understanding was that, on her return from sick leave, she was still a full-time employee but, because of her medical limitations, she could only, on her doctor's order, work three days a week, and not at night.\n[11] Seeing that her work situation was not improving, she decided, on March 24, 2001, to call Ron Roffey, the respondent's Operations Manager at the time, and asked him why she was not getting any work. She taped this call with Mr. Roffey. At the hearing, the respondent objected to the introduction in evidence of this taped conversation and of its transcript. It also objected to the introduction of another taped conversion, this time with Terry Barnett. We will come to this conversation with Mr. Barnett later. I made an oral ruling accepting the tapes and the transcription into evidence. A written ruling concerning this objection is issued with this decision.\n[12] Here are excerpts of the transcription of the complainant conversation with Ron Roffey, on March 24, 2001:\n[...]\nBarbara Why am I not getting any work?\nRon Well I have no idea.\nBarbara I am put to the bottom of the list and all the work goes to the full timers, well how am I suppose to work my way back to full time.\nRon Well when there is work available you will get if.\nBarbara But that's not how it works.\nRon How should it work Barb.\nBarbara You mean to tell me when someone goes on sick leave and they come back, they don't have a job.\nRon I didn't say you didn't have a job.\nBarbara But I am suppose to have three days work.\nRon Who says that.\nBarbara The doctor said, instead of being full, so if I came back full time you wouldn't have any work for me.\nRon If there is work available you will get if. There is no work available.\nBarbara Then lay me off. If you can't hold me on, if there is no work available, you have to lay me off.\nRon We do have work, but as I say when there is work available you will get it.\nBarbara But you can't hold me on like this, I am suppose to have three days a week. That is being unfair to me. You know exactly how it works.\nRon I don't understand what your problem is, other than the fact that Eddie [the Respondent's dispatcher] didn't detail you this week.\nBarbara I only had one day work in three weeks, since the day I called you.\nRon You only had one days work?\nBarbara In three weeks, since the day I called you.\nRon I can't very well lay you off when I am hiring people can I?\nBarbara Well that's up to you, like what are going to do with me. You can not give me one days work in a month, how am I suppose to live.\nRon Well what do you want to do Barb?\nBarbara What are you going to do for me.\nRon I'll talk to Eddy and tell him to detail you at least three days a week.\nBarbara That's right.\nRon If it's available.\nBarbara Its but, ok, no it's if I get three days a week or you lay me off, that's what I want one, I want or the other.\nRon I can't lay you off when I am hiring people.\nBarbara Well you gonna have to do something, because this is not right. You can't be hiring people and not having me work that doesn't make sense.\nRon Well as I say not everybody is working right now. But its going to get busier and then you will be working.\n[...]\nBarbara You know for three weeks work one days work. You can't...you know.\nRon I don't understand why Eddie's had only had one days work I have to look into it, he's not here right now, but I will look into it and I'll...\nBarbara I least have to have three days a week as a full time person being put back to work by doctors ok, at least I should be available to step back into the job that I left.\nRon But you are stepping back other than that you'll...\nBarbara Only one day work in three weeks that's a joke.\nRon Well if, the other thing you got to look at too, is the other people here, like...\nBarbara I know the other people.\nRon I understand what you are saying but not everyone is working right now.\nBarbara I just came down Hwy 11 and I counted 10 buses going to the casino.\nRon Yeah they are normal runs.\nBarbara That's right, so every body is working, we have part timers and we have full timers.\nRon Not everybody is working right now.\n[...]\nBarbara I am not stupid I know how the system works if you want to get rid of me than lay me off, if not get me to work.\nRon I don't want to get rid of you.\nBarbara Well that's what it feels like, wouldn't you think that.\nRon As I say I don't know what the problem is let me look into it and I'll see that you get more.\nBarbara Please do.\n[...]\n[sic throughout]\n[The underlining is mine.]\n[13] After her conversation with Mr. Roffey, the complainant testified that she was called to work for four consecutive days from March 26 to March 29, 2001. Her bi-weekly time sheets indicate that some weeks she would get three days of work and even more, while on other weeks she would not get any work. From March 7, 2001 to the end of her employment on October 21, 2001, she worked approximately 99.5 days, an average of 3.1 days per week. More precisely, her bi-weekly time sheets show that she worked:\nFrom March 7 to March 24 one day\nFrom March 25 to April 22 four days\nFrom April 23 to May 6 five days\nFrom May 7 to May 20 five days\nFrom May 21 to June 3 five days\nFrom June 4 to June17 six days\nFrom June 18 to July 1 seven days\nFrom July 1 to July 15 eight days\nFrom July 16 to July 29 nine days\nFrom July 30 to August 12 seven days\nFrom August 13 to August 26 six days\nFrom August 27 to September 9 ten days\nFrom September 10 to September 23 nine days\nFrom September 24 to October 7 seven and half days\nFrom October 8 to October 21 seven days.\n[14] On September 6, 2001, the complainant met with Terry Barnett to discuss her situation. The following are excerpts of this meeting. Ron Roffey was also present during this meeting:\nTerry When you were off sick, whatever it was. [...] I remember that there was a discussion that you wanted to work only four days a week or three days a week.\nBarbara I, no the doctor, I have the doctor's note in my car, the doctor sent me back to work that I am to work three days a week.\nTerry OK that legated the fact that you are a full time employee that put you in the part time.\nBarbara I am full time. No, see section 239 in the labour law when someone as full time driver or someone full time period goes on sick leave and comes back to work with a doctor's note and doctor says...\nTerry Long after your sick note Barbara I was under the impression from dispatch and I have to check it out that you switch from full time to part time that you had no interest in working 5 days a week.\nBarbara No, I wasn't capable of working 5 days a week.\nTerry Even after your sickness pass by you will not be capable of working\nBarbara No that's not true, that's not true because I had a conversation with Ron, I said how do I get back to work full time.\nTerry Is Barb full time now?\nRon That's what we are debating its under investigation.\nBarbara Yeah\nTerry Okay\nBarbara I had a conversation with Ron that as a full time driver returning to work part time from doctor's order.\nTerry Uhuh\nBarbara Right, I was wanting work that he had to give me work or lay me off.\nTerry HmHm\nBarbara He wouldn't lay me off because he was hiring drivers\nTerry HmHm\nBarbara And right, also he's telling me there's no work available but he is hiring drivers and leaving me at home like not to work.\nTerry Okay, I was, let me make it very clear to you I was under the impression (a) that you were part time.\nBarbara No\nTerry I will debate that issue with you, but I will never debate anything until I investigate, I only got involve in this last night.\nBarbara Right.\nTerry Second thing is if you have statutory time as require by sick leave that legates (?) your full time period. So I am going to move on to when I consider you back on full time. So like a collective agreement if you go off sick six months when you come back you lost six month of seniority because you were off for sick time.\nBarbara But.\nTerry So if we're going to deem you to be full time. I don't know how long you were off but I'll have to check it out.\nBarbara Just under 5 months\nTerry Okay well that 5 months will be added to your period we would make you eligible for a full time employee. For example under entitlement of your benefits or your clothing allowance if you are off for 5 months that 5 months will be added to when you come back before you are eligible for the clothing allowance.\nBarbara But another issue is I did come back as a full time driver put to work part time because my ....\nTerry Okay, that is a debatable issue cause when I check with dispatch I know they are going to tell me that you wanted to work part time not full time.\nBarbara I'll tell you right now I have him recorded alright.\nTerry I am not worried what he said I worry what the other members of dispatch tell me...\nBarbara No, no the issue is I am full time.\nTerry Cause its Eddie who is the...\nBarbara No then that's the case I have a problem with. I have a discrimination against him. I have a discrimination I have lost a lot of potential income with this company right, I was suppose to be put back to work as a full time employee, he was suppose to accommodate me three days a week and recognize me as full time employee and he didn't I had a conversation with Ron I have proof.\nTerry Hold on, then, then you know the whole issue with me, the way I work I simply go by a set of guidelines of rules and regulations.\n[...]\nTerry You can, you can feel whatever frustration you feel.\n[...]\nTerry You can pursue any avenue that you so choose to pursue because that's your choice as an employee and me as an employer will fight base on the information I have in my hands.\n[...]\nTerry No, no, let me finish, let me finish, cause I sense you are getting frustrated and I don't want you to be frustrated.\nBarbara Well no because I lost a lot of money in this company for not being recognize as...\nTerry You make a hold bunch of statements, you first of all say my people discriminate against you and I have never heard of this before I have a concern about that as a general manager of this company.\n[...]\nTerry If you want to pursue that, pursue it, that's your choice I will pursue it too, I have lawyers and I have all kinds or resources cause I go by the book.\nBarbara And so am I.\nTerry And that's fine, but don't try to force your way on.\n[...]\nTerry Listen to me first of all, don't'force me down a panel without me doing some investigation I don't work that way.\nBarbara That's fine\nTerry I will commence my investigation and report to you my findings.\nBarbara Yes and we will have a meeting because there are two other drivers and I wish to have a meeting with you. With a whole bunch of situations going on here. We will set up a date, now is not the time to really have the meeting.\nTerry We won't set up a date you will ask me when I would like to have a meeting and you will tell me what it's about prior to even having that meeting.\n[...]\nTerry And if you have a problem you got resources, you got the government, Labour Canada, go see them and explain to them and I will deal with them I am not going to deal with renegade drivers who have complaints about my dispatcher I will not.\nBarbara No, of course not because I had, I had, I went to Ron three times ok, he said he would look into it and he would say I'll see that you get work if it's available.\nTerry Well I see very clearly I think Ron is considering you as I am considering you which I will continue to argue that you are classified as part time.\n[...]\nBarbara Now another issue is, I'll make it clear to you I didn't come back to work and say I am only part time. I came back to work with a doctor's note saying I can work part time and he recommends that I don't' work nights.\nTerry This is not a pick and chose type of operation. [...] I will not provide that type of work.\n[...]\nBarbara I worked days last year, so I come back to work I said I am not able to work nights [...]\nTerry You don't have that choice Barbara, in the grand scheme of how a bus company works in relationship of Labour Canada we have a duty to provide work we don't have a duty to accommodate by the hours which you believe you can work.\n[...]\nTerry As far as I am concern at this point of time you are a part time employee.\n[...]\nTerry That's my interpretation right now.\n[...]\nTerry That's my instruction for Ron yesterday and that's only going off the top of my head without doing an investigation.\n[...]\nTerry We have rules and guidelines which determine a full time employee.\n[...]\nTerry You may have been one at one time.\n[...]\nTerry I am not arguing that.\nBarbara And I have a doctor's note, have you seen the doctor's note?\nTerry No I haven't seen anything.\nBarbara Ok then you'll have to.\nTerry A doctor's note doesn't legate (?) the difference between full time part time classifications it only simply says work restrictions that are put on.\n[sic throughout]\n[ The underlining is mine.]\n[15] At the hearing, Mr. Barnett testified that he personally never saw or asked to see the complainant's medical notes. He added that these notes had most likely been handed off to the Operations Manager who, at the time, was Ron Roffey. Mr. Roffey was not called as a witness at the hearing and no reasonable or acceptable explanation for his absence was given, other than the statement by counsel that he could not be located. Mr. Barnett also testified that when the complainant went off on her extended sick leave, her status was changed from full-time to part-time. He added that a new full-time employee was hired to occupy what he described as the vacant position.\n[16] The complainant testified that she never intended to change her status to that of a part-time employee. She added that what she was looking for was to be accommodated as per her doctor's instructions and eventually work herself back to working full-time, by which she meant returning to a five-day work week. The respondent's position was that the doctor's note had the effect of relegating her to a part-time status. Mr. Barnett testified that a full-time employee is an employee who is available five days a week. When he or she is not capable of working five days a week, then he or she is considered a part-time employee and work will be allocated to that employee on an availability basis.\n[17] On September 21, 2001, Terry Barnett wrote to the complainant. In this letter, he referred to the meeting of September 6th and specified: As I indicated to you at that time, I was aware that earlier in the year your status had changed from full-time, as mentioned to me by dispatch. Unaware that it was for medical reasons I assumed that this change in status was by your own choice. Regarding the complainant's request for a $10.00 per day bonus offered to full-time drivers after one year of employment, he stated that this bonus was for full-time drivers only. He further stated Since your medical restriction limits your ability to work in a full time capacity, you cannot be eligible for this bonus.\n[18] Regarding her status, the letter reads: Your doctor's letter of March 7th states that you may return to work in a part-time capacity [...] In any case, you can return to full time duties when your doctor gives you a clean bill of health and you can resume a five (5) day work week without restrictions. Although I have not yet confirmed the number of days you have worked since March 7th, I am aware that dispatch has provided you work. By your calculation, from May 28th to Aug 31st 2001 you have worked 55 days. Given your restrictions, this indicates that the company has tried hard to accommodate your needs. As we approach the low season and the company will be required to adjust the daily use of equipment and manpower it may become even more difficult to meet your doctor's restrictions.\n[19] Mr. Barnett testified that the respondent would assign work to the complainant on a regular basis as much as it could, considering her needs for accommodation. He added that the approach he favoured was one of common sense and that is why her status would remain that of a part-time driver until such time where there would be no restrictions to prohibit her from doing her job full-time.\n[20] Finally, in the concluding paragraph of his letter of September 21, 2001, Mr. Barnett added: [d]ue to your overall concerns about the amount of work you have been receiving and given the fact that we are heading into our slow season combined with the reduction of outside work as result of the American tragedy, I am open to considering a mutually agreed lay-off to give you the needed time to rehabilitate yourself.\n[21] After having received this letter, the complainant submitted to the respondent a new note from her doctor. This note, dated September 28, 2001, indicated that the complainant could return to work five days a week but maintained the restriction concerning night work as this causes worsening of her medical condition.\n[22] The complainant wrote a letter to Mr. Barnett on October 1, 2001, in which she explained that she would not consent to a mutually agreed lay off, as he had suggested in his September 21, 2001, letter. Mr. Barnett answered on October 16, 2001, until you sign up and are available for 5 days work per week without any restrictions you will as all part time drivers be detailed by dispatch subject to work availability.\n[23] The complainant's employment with the respondent ended on October 17, 2001. According to the respondent, the complainant voluntarily resigned her position, although in her opening statement, counsel for the respondent did suggest that the complainant was laid-off for economic reasons but no evidence was tendered to support this assertion. The complainant, for her part, asserts that her termination was a direct result of Mr. Barnett's letter of October 16, 2001.\n[24] In a letter to the Human Rights Commission, dated July 4, 2002, in response to the question whether the respondent had a policy accommodating employees with medical restrictions, Mr. Barnett offered the following answer: A comprehensive Policy & Procedures Manual was created by Management and was subsequently approved by an Employee Committee with some minor changes. Specifically, the policy has no language that deals directly with employees with medical restrictions but a common sense approach has been used recognizing the legal requirement to do so. With over 30 years in the coach and public transit business, I'm well aware of a duty to accommodate as best as possible. [The underlining is mine.]\n[25] During his cross-examination, Mr. Barnett testified to what he understood was the duty to accommodate an employee with a disability considering the respondent had, what he described, as a seniority-based system. He stated: I can't give you [the complainant] a piece of work that somebody else who is ahead of you in seniority [has] simply because of accommodation restrictions. He felt that the respondent's duty to accommodate required that it give the complainant as many hours as [it could.]\nB. LEGAL ANALYSIS [26] In order to benefit from the protection afforded by the Act, the complainant must demonstrate the involvement of one or more of the proscribed grounds listed in section 3 of the Act.\n(i) The section 7 complaint [27] Ms Tanzos' complaint is brought pursuant to section 7. Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 3 of the Act declares that a disability is a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[28] The complainant alleges that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the grounds of sex and disability, in a matter related to employment. No evidence was tendered to establish a discriminatory practice on the ground of sex, this decision will therefore deal solely with the issue of discrimination on the ground of disability.\n(ii) Was a prima facie case made out? [29] As a result of the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R.3 (Meiorin) and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer), the historic distinction between direct and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to the adjudication of human rights complaints. Under this approach, the initial onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made, and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in absence of an answer by the respondent. (See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R 536, at p. 558.)\n[30] In a complaint under the Act, the burden of proof is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. In cases of circumstantial evidence, the test may be formulated as follows:\nAn inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses\n(B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto), Carswell, 1987, at p. 142; Uzoaba v. Canada (Correctional Services), [1994] C.H.R.D. No. 7, at p. 40.)\n[31] What is the appropriate test to be applied when determining a prima facie case? In Canadian Human Right Commission v. Attorney General of Canada, 2005 FCA 154, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the legal definition of a prima facie case does not require the complainant to adduce any particular type of evidence to prove that she was a victim of a discriminatory practice. A flexible test is more appropriate.\n[32] According to Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des Droits de la personne et des Droits de la jeunesse) v. City of Montr\u00e9al, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665, at p. 701 [also referred to as Mercier], in order to establish a prima facie case, a complainant has to (a) prove the existence of a distinction, exclusion or preference in the decision not to employ or continue to employ; (b) that the distinction is based on a real or perceived disability; and (c) that the distinction, exclusion or preference had the effect of nullifying or impairing the complainant's right to the full and equal exercise of human rights and freedoms.\n[33] A key issue in this case is whether or not the complainant has a disability or was perceived by the respondent as having a disability.\n[34] The evidence regarding the complainant's alleged disability consists of a request for sick leave on October 7, 2000. The application for sick leave indicated that it was requested by the complainant's doctor due to stress, chest pains, chronic headaches. The request was granted by the respondent. A letter, dated March 2, 2001, from the Markham Headache and Pain Treatment Centre addressed to Dr. Adrian R. Woodrow, the complainant's treating physician, indicates that the complainant is suffering from post traumatic cervicogenic headaches and cervical myofascial pain. An MRI scan of her cervical spine also revealed some early degenerative changes in the cervical spine and two cervical herniated discs. There is no evidence that this letter was provided to the respondent. On March 7, 2001, the complainant's doctor provided the complainant with a note to confirm that she could return to work but with a restriction, that she work part-time - three days per week. The note also added the limitation that she should not work nights as it will be detrimental to her present medical condition. There is no evidence that the respondent challenged the necessity of these restrictions. Finally, on September 28, 2001, the complainant provided the respondent with another medical note, this time from Dr. Mayer Yacowar, which indicates that she could return to work full-time but maintained the limitation that she should not work nights, adding after midnight.\n[35] Although, the complainant did not call as a witness her treating physicians or any other medical expert to testify as to her medical condition, I nevertheless conclude that she did establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[36] When she returned to work on March 7, 2001, the complainant was suffering from a medical disability, as evidenced by her doctor's note. This medical evidence remained unchallenged and during her cross-examination, counsel for the respondent never questioned the complainant about her medical condition. The evidence even confirms that the respondent accepted that the complainant had medical limitations or restrictions. Mr. Barnett in his letter of September 21, 2001, for example, states: In any case, you can return to full time duties when your doctor gives you a clean bill of health and you can resume a five (5) day work week without restrictions. [The underlining is mine.] Again, in his letter of October 16, 2001, he states until you sign up and are available for 5 days work per week without any restrictions you will as all part time drivers be detailed by dispatch subject to work availability. [The underlining is mine.] If the respondent felt that the complainant did not suffer from a medical disability it could have asked for a second medical opinion. It chose not do so.\n[37] The existence of a discrimination having been established prima facie, the respondent can now justify the impugned standard by establishing the following, on a balance of probabilities:\nThe respondent adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job at issue;\nThe respondent adopted that particular standard with the sincere belief that it was necessary in order to fulfill that legitimate work-related purpose;\nThe standard is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill that legitimate work-related purpose. In order to establish that the standard is reasonably necessary, the respondent must show that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant without the respondent suffering undue hardship. The respondent must establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation.\n(See: Grismer, at paragraph 20).\n(a) The two first steps of Grismer? [38] Counsel for the respondent argued that it was essential for the respondent to have a business operation that operates safely and securely seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. She stated that, to do this, the respondent needed full-time employees who could work five days a week and who were available for night shifts. Counsel added that the only choice left in a case such as the present was to consider the complainant as a part-time employee and allocate work to her on an availability basis.\n[39] In their evidence and final arguments, the parties did not see fit to address the first two requirements of Grismer. We can infer from this that they acknowledged that the standard adopted by the respondent had a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job at issue.\n[40] We can also infer that the respondent adopted this standard in good faith, believing that it was necessary to ensure the operation of its business.\n(b) Did the respondent establish that it would be impossible to accommodate Ms Tanzos without causing the respondent undue hardship? [41] According to the respondent, the doctor's notes submitted by the complainant did not clearly state what her actual condition was. It further argues that her real condition was never known or made known to the respondent. The respondent adds that it nevertheless accommodated the complainant and complied with the doctor's recommendations without compromising its obligations to distribute work to the rest of the workforce.\n[42] As the evidence indicates, the complainant's request was, at first, that she be allowed to return to her full-time job working three days a week, only daytime hours. In October 2001, the doctor's note indicated that she was now available to work five days a week but again only daytime hours. Other than Mr Barnett's assertion that this is not typically done since the respondent's business operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, no evidence was lead to establish how the complainant's request constituted undue hardship. Mr. Barnett, the respondent's only witness, testified that this was the norm in the business, but he gave no evidence to support this conclusion.\n[43] To establish that a standard is reasonably necessary an employer must demonstrate that it is impossible to accommodate the complainant without imposing an undue hardship. Therefore the onus is on the respondent to show that it made efforts to accommodate the complainant's disability up to the point of undue hardship. (See Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission, (1990), 72 D.L.R.(4th) 417, at p. 439).\n[44] The Supreme Court in Meiorin, at paragraph 64, advises courts of law and administrative tribunals to consider various ways in which individual capabilities may be accommodated. The employer should determine whether there are different ways to perform the work while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate work-related purpose. The skills, capabilities and potential contributions of the individual complainant and others like him or her must be respected as much as possible.\n[45] In this case, the standard emphasizes the need to have employees available to work five days a week and, if necessary, for night shifts. The fact that this standard excludes certain classes of persons is not discrimination if the respondent can establish that it is reasonably necessary to meet the appropriate objective and if the accommodation was incorporated in the standard. Exclusion is only justifiable where the employer has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship. (See Grismer, at paragraph 21).\n[46] The search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry. There is obviously a duty on the complainant to assist the respondent in securing an appropriate accommodation. (See O'Malley, supra, at p. 555.) This does not mean that, in addition to bringing to the attention of the respondent the facts relating to discrimination, the complainant has a duty to originate a solution. While the complainant may be in a position to make suggestions, the employer is in the best position to determine how the complainant can be accommodated without undue interference in the operation of its business. When an employer has initiated a proposal that is reasonable and would, if implemented, fulfill the duty to accommodate, the complainant has a duty to facilitate the implementation of the proposal. If failure to take reasonable steps on the part of the complainant causes the proposal to founder, the complaint will be dismissed. The other aspect of this duty is the obligation to accept reasonable accommodation. The complainant cannot expect a perfect solution (See Central Okanagan School Distric No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970).\n[47] The respondent, as I have already indicated, has the obligation to demonstrate that it has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship. To determine what constitutes undue hardship it has to establish that it considered and reasonably rejected all viable forms of accommodation. It has to demonstrate that it was impossible to incorporate individual aspects of accommodation without causing it undue hardship.\n[48] The use of the adjective undue indicates that some degree of hardship is acceptable; it is only the hardship that is undue that can excuse the employer from its duty. The respondent did not persuade me that respecting the complainant's medical limitations would require a substantial reorganization of all of the duties to the point where it would cause undue hardship. The respondent alleges, without persuasive evidence to support its argument, that the accommodation requested by the complainant would negatively affect its operations. No persuasive evidence supports this conclusion.\n[49] On at least two occasions, the complainant met with representatives of management to express her concern about her working hours and to see how a solution could be found. What she was seeking was the opportunity to show that she could, with accommodation, perform the tasks of bus driver. She had requested, on her doctor's recommendation, to work three days a week. In response, the respondent put her in a part-time position with work being assigned to her on an availability basis. In September 2001, she indicated that her doctor had authorized her to return to work five days a week but had kept the restriction on her availability for night work. The respondent still refused to return her to her full-time status, indicating that it would not do so as long as the limitations on her working hours were not lifted. Again no evidence was given to indicate what undue hardship was caused to the respondent if it accepted to accommodate the needs of the complainant.\n[50] Although it never contested the medical conditions of the complainant and the restrictions imposed by her doctor, the respondent acted as if this did not concern it and that its duty to accommodate the complainant was a very limited and narrow obligation. If the respondent felt it had insufficient information to decide what accommodation was needed, it could have enquired with the complainant's doctor if the restrictions imposed were temporary or permanent; whether they required accommodation; what type of duties the complainant could do and those she should avoid; how long should this accommodation be in effect; what date was she going to be medically re-assessed; what, if anything, should the employer do to assist the complainant's successful return to work.\n[51] It follows from the evidence that the respondent has failed to discharge the onus imposed on it to demonstrate that it was unable to accommodate the complainant's disability without undue hardship. An uncompromisingly stringent standard, as the one put forward by the respondent, may be ideal from an employer's perspective. Yet, if it is to be justified under human rights legislation, the standard must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\n[52] The respondent was aware of the complainant's disability. It was on notice that accommodation was required. It led no evidence with respect to its efforts to try to accommodate the complainant other than to treat her as a part-time employee. This was not sufficient to meet its burden.\n(iii) Conclusion on the section 7 complaint [53] Considering the factual situation of this case, I find that the complainant was discriminated against on the basis of a disability, contrary to section 7 of the Act.\nC. DAMAGES [54] In her Statement of Particulars, the complainant is seeking the following relief :\nCompensation for lost wages; Compensation for pain and suffering; and The reimbursement of certain expenses.\n[55] Section 53(2) of the Act provides that if the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal may make an order, against the respondent who is found to be engaging or to have been engaging in a discriminatory practice, including, amongst other relief, any of the following terms:\n53(2) [...]\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n53(2) [...]\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\ne) d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n53(4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\n53(4) Sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 48.9, le membre instructeur peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l'indemnit\u00e9 au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu'il estime justifi\u00e9s.\n(i) Compensation for loss of wages [56] The complainant is claiming lost wages for the respondent's failure to accommodate her medical condition. She also claims lost wages for the respondent's failure to put her back to work five days a week as of September 28, 2001. The evidence of her lost wages is not the clearest and the respondent, for its part, never challenged this evidence, nor cross-examined the complainant about her claims to lost wages. I will therefore, as best as I can, determine what I consider to be a reasonable amount for lost wages.\n[57] The evidence indicates that from March 7, 2001, to September 28, 2001, the complainant worked eighty five (85) days, an average of 3.1 days per week, therefore for this period there appears to be no lost wages. If the respondent had accommodated the complainant on the basis of three days a week, she would not have been paid more than what she received for that period.\n[58] For the period after September 28, 2001, where she was able to work five days a week, the evidence indicates that she worked 11.5 days up to October 21, 2001, her last day of work with the respondent. During that period she should have worked 15 days. Her loss of salary for that period is therefore equivalent to 3.5 days of work. Taking into consideration that for a day's work of twelve hours or less, she would have been paid, according to the evidence, one hundred dollars a day, her loss of salary for that period is $350.00.\n[59] According to her Record of Employment, the complainant was dismissed on October 21, 2001. This was not a mutually agreed to lay-off as the respondent alleged. The evidence is clear that the complainant did not want to be laid-off but since, the respondent was unwilling to accommodate her, she felt that she had no choice. The complainant therefore has the right to claim loss wages following her dismissal.\n[60] For the year 2000, her last full year of employment with the respondent her total earnings, according to her Individual Income Tax Return, was $24,594.00. Her total earnings for the year 2001, was $19,729.00, which included $5,740.00, in employment insurance benefits. Part of these benefits was paid while she was on sick leave but no evidence of what amount this represented was submitted at the hearing. If the complainant had worked five days a week, at $100.00 per day, for the remainder of that year, she would have worked an extra 40 days, which would mean a total of $4,000.00 in salary. Taking into consideration the fact that she received employment insurance benefits and also other eventualities that might have affected her earning capabilities, it would be reasonable to assess her loss of income for this period at $3,000.00.\n[61] For the year 2002, her total income was $19,485.00, a difference of $5,109.00 with her income in 2001. I fix the amount of her lost wages for the year 2002 at $5,109.00.\n[62] For the year 2003, her total income was $21,368.00, a difference of $3,226.00 with her income in 2001. Her total loss of income for the year 2003 is set at $3,226.00.\n[63] In conclusion, the complainant is entitled to $350.00 lost wages for the period preceding her dismissal in 2001. She is also entitled to $3,000.00 for lost wages for the remainder of the year 2001. For the year 2002 and 2003, I fix her loss of income at $5,109.00 and $3,226.00, respectively.\n[64] The complainant also claims for lost wages during Good Friday and Easter Sunday, which she said should have been paid. She also claims that she has a right to a ten dollar a day bonus paid to full-time drivers after one year of service.\n[65] I order that the complainant be paid $200.00 for Good Friday and Easter Sunday. In regard to the $10.00 a day bonus, the evidence shows that the complainant began working for the respondent on May 21, 2000. If she had worked continuously, she would have started receiving the bonus on May 21, 2001. But from October 2000 until March 2001, she was on sick leave. For that period, she was not accumulating seniority and this period cannot be counted to establish the date from which she would have had a right to the bonus. She returned to work on March 7, 2001 and worked until October 18, 2001, when she was dismissed. As of October 7, 2001, she would have held her position as a full-time employee for one year and should have been entitled from then on to the ten dollar a day bonus. From October 7, 2001 to the end of the year, she should have worked approximately fifty days. I therefore order that she be paid the bonus for this period, which amounts to $500.00. For 2002 and 2003, since no evidence was produced to establish that the bonus was still in existence, I will make no order.\n[66] Regarding the complainant's claim for a Christmas bonus, no evidence was presented supporting this claim and therefore I will make no order for its payment.\n[67] Under paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, the complainant is therefore entitled to $12,035.00, for loss of salary following the respondent's discriminatory act. This amount seems reasonable given the quality of the evidence submitted and the complainant's duty to mitigate her loss.\n(ii) Compensation for pain and suffering [68] The complainant is also claiming compensation for pain and suffering under paragraph 53(2)(e). Again, I must say that the evidence submitted in support of this claim is somewhat weak and is certainly not enough to justify an amount in the higher scale provided under the Act. While subsection 53(2) of the Act gives discretion to the Tribunal with regard to granting various remedies when a complaint proves to be founded, such discretion must be exercised judiciously in light of the evidence before the Tribunal. In this case, the complaint is allowed and nothing in the complainant's testimony indicates any reason to refuse awarding her compensation for pain and suffering. (See Dumont v. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2002 FCT 1280).\n[69] I agree that the respondent's decision did cause the complainant pain and suffering, if only in terms of anxiety. I therefore award $3,000.00 as compensation for pain and suffering.\n(iii) The reimbursement of certain expenses [70] The claimant also made various claims for the reimbursement of certain expenses but no evidence having been presented to support these, it is impossible for this Tribunal to make any order regarding their reimbursement.\n(iv) Interest [71] Interest is payable with regard to all indemnities awarded in this decision (subsection 53(4) of the Act). Interest shall be calculated in accordance with subsection 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-01-04), simple interest calculated on a yearly basis based on the official rate set by the Bank of Canada. Interest shall accrue from the date of the complaint until the date the indemnity is paid.\nII. CONCLUSION [72] I find that the complainant was discriminated against on the basis of a disability contrary to section 7 of the Act and I order the respondent to pay to the complainant $15,035.00 in lost wages and pain and suffering, plus interest from the date of the complaint until the date the indemnity is paid, at the rate set out above.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 8, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT832\/8203\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nBarbara Tanzos v.

INTRODUCTION [1] On August 15, 2003, Suresh Khiamal (the Complainant) filed a complaint under Sections 7, 10, and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) against Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation (the Respondent). The Complainant alleges that the Respondent has engaged in discriminatory practices on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, age and disability in a matter related to employment.\n[2] Both the Complainant and the Respondent were represented by legal counsel. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) was not present.\nII. BACKGROUND FACTS [3] The Complainant, born December 4, 1948, is 58 years old. He is a Canadian citizen of East Indian origin. He immigrated to Canada in 1979 from South Africa. He worked as a licensed mechanic in South Africa from 1970 to 1979, and commenced work with the Respondent on February 20, 1980 as a second class mechanic. Within a few months, the Complainant obtained his license in Canada and was promoted to first class mechanic. Throughout the hearing, his position was referred to as one of a heavy duty mechanic.\n[4] The facts giving rise to the complaint took place at the Respondent's Edmonton, Alberta Garage (the Edmonton Garage). There are two areas at the Edmonton Garage where heavy duty mechanics perform their employment duties. The first is the Service area, where Greyhound buses are serviced in terms of being inspected for roadworthiness, washed, gassed up, and generally maintained. The second is the Hoist area, where buses are mechanically overhauled and literally put up on a hoist for more substantive mechanical repairs such as brake repair, wheel alignment and the like. Heavy duty mechanic work in the Hoist area is more physically demanding.\n[5] There have been many management changes in personnel and style in the time the Complainant has worked for the Respondent. At times, there has been more than one Foreman, and at times there have been none. The role of Supervisor, and the employees who have performed as supervisor, have also changed over time.\n[6] Throughout his employment with the Respondent from 1980 forward, the Complainant was appointed to the Lead Hand position often, and for long continuous periods. His pay stubs show that when he performed Lead Hand duties, he was paid an extra $1.00 per hour. Although he worked in both the Service area and the Hoist area, he has primarily worked in the Service area particularly in recent years.\n[7] The Lead Hand's duties are similar to the Foreman's in that the Lead Hand supervises other mechanics to ensure that the work that needs to get done is completed, allocates resources and assigns mechanics to certain duties, corresponds with the dispatcher, uses the MCMS computer maintenance system, and handles the responsibility for the buses being ready for and keeping to their schedules. The primary distinguishing differences between the two positions is that a Lead Hand does not discipline, nor does payroll, nor deals with supervisors in a greater managerial sense. Leadership skills are essential.\n[8] The Edmonton Garage is a unionized environment. The Complainant is a member of the Amalgamated Transit Union (the Union), and held the position of shop steward for many years. During his term of employment, the Complainant filed many grievances, some of his own and several for other workers, and was thereby familiar with the grievance process. A collective agreement, as amended from time to time, has been in place throughout the subject period.\n[9] At the time of the filing of this complaint, the Complainant was the most senior mechanic at the Edmonton Garage. Seniority is a factor in holiday time choices, and may be a factor in whether a person is given training and courses by the Respondent or through the Union, and is a factor but not determinative in obtaining a promotion from heavy duty mechanic to a foreman position.\n[10] When a mechanic is promoted to the position of Foreman, he loses his Union membership, and is not allowed to touch mechanic's tools except in the case of a real emergency. Under the collective agreement in place at the time of the complaint, a Foreman could return to his mechanic's duties with his seniority intact if he was laid off from that position, but not if he was terminated by the Respondent.\nIII. OVERVIEW OF THE COMPLAINANT'S ALLEGATIONS [11] The complainant's allegations can be organized as follows:\nAllegation #1 deals with the complainant's application for the position of Night Shift Maintenance Foreman, and the respondent's decision not to hire him for this position. The complainant alleges that the respondent's decision was tainted by discrimination on the ground of disability, age, race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. Allegation #2 deals with a series of incidents, or aspects of his workplace experience, that in the Complainant's view constitute harassment on the ground of race. Allegation #3 focuses on one of the above incidents (i.e. the respondent's refusal to approve training and courses for the complainant), and asserts that this refusal constituted adverse differentiation and the denial of employment opportunities, based on race.\nIV. THE LAW A. Prohibited Grounds of Discrimination [12] Section 3 of the CHRA designates race, national or ethnic origin, colour, age and disability as prohibited grounds of discrimination.\nB. The Complainant's Burden and the Respondent's Burden [13] The Complainant has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 (O'Malley)\n[14] The Federal Court of Appeal has established in Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, that the Tribunal must not take into account the Respondent's answer in determining whether a prima facie case has been made out.\n[15] In the event that the complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, it is incumbent upon the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory practice that is not a mere pretext for discrimination. (Lincoln at para 23).\nC. Section 7 [16] Under s. 7, it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ any individual (s. 7(a)), or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee (s. 7(b)), on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[17] According to the Ontario Board of Inquiry's decision in Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, where it is alleged that the respondent's refusal to employ the complainant was discriminatory, a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by presenting evidence that:\nthe Complainant was qualified for the particular employment; the Complainant was not hired; and someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint subsequently obtained the position.\n[18] That said, the Shakes approach is not a rule of law, but merely an illustration of the principle established in O'Malley. Shakes should not be applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case. (Lincoln, para. 18; C.H.R.C. v. Canada (A.G.) 2005 FCA 154, paras. 25-26).\nD. Section 14 [19] Under s. 14 of the CHRA, it is a discriminatory practice, in matters related to employment, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[20] Where an allegation of harassment is made under s. 14, the complainant must demonstrate that the impugned conduct:\nrelated to a prohibited ground of discrimination; was unwelcome; and was persistent or serious enough to create a negative work environment.\n(See Morin v. A.G. Canada, 2005 CHRT 41, para. 246)\nE. Section 10 [21] Section 10 of the CHRA is engaged where an employer pursues a practice that tends to deprive an individual of an employment opportunity on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nF. Evidentiary Assessment [22] Discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para. 7 (F.C.A.)).\n[23] An inference of discrimination may be drawn from circumstantial evidence, provided that the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses. (See Chopra v. Canada (Health and Welfare) (2001) 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (CHRT) at para. 286.)\n[24] Finally, in Kasongo v. Farm Credit Canada, 2005 CHRT 24, at paragraphs 29 and 30, the Tribunal underscored the need for an objective approach; adjudicators should be cautious in relying on perceptions of the parties that may be distorted because of personality characteristics, such as a high degree of sensitivity or defensiveness.\nV. ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINANT'S ALLEGATIONS A. ALLEGATION NO. 1 - THE NIGHT SHIFT MAINTENANCE FOREMAN JOB POSTING OF JULY 2002 [25] The complainant alleged that:\nhis disability; his age; and his race, colour or national or ethnic origin played a role in the respondent's refusal to employ him for the above-noted position.\n[26] To facilitate the analysis, each of the above grounds will be examined in turn, in order to determine whether the complainant has made out a prima facie case.\n[27] Where a prima facie case has been established, consideration will be given to the respondent's explanation.\n(a) Refusal to Employ Based on Disability - The Prima Facie Case [28] The Complainant testified that he has diabetes. His evidence is that he has neuropathy in his feet. However, no medical evidence was led at the hearing as to the severity of his diabetes and its impact on his health, nor the timing of his first diagnosis and consequent medical treatment.\n[29] The Complainant testified that he believes Steven Watson and everyone at his workplace knows he has diabetes because they would have seen him taking insulin. However, he gave no specific evidence of when or where the two supervisors who interviewed him for the Foreman position (Chuck Seeley and Steven Watson) did, in fact, see him taking insulin prior to or at the time of the July 2002 job posting and interview process. He suggested they might have seen him in the lunch room or in the men's washroom. However, the evidence indicated that Mr. Seeley was in a wheel chair and rarely took his lunch in the lunch room, or used the same washroom.\n[30] The Complainant further testified that he did not raise the issue of his diabetes during the interview process for the Foreman's position, nor in either of the brief conversations he had with Steven Watson about the job on the work floor. In other words, the Complainant did not self-identify as having a disability at the time period relevant to this complaint, nor did he ask the Respondent to accommodate him in this regard.\n[31] The Complainant's evidence on this point was evasive, weak, and non-specific. Based on the foregoing, I conclude that he has failed to establish on a prima facie basis that his disability played a role in the respondent's decision not to hire him for the Night Shift Maintenance Foreman position in July 2002.\n(b) Refusal to Employ Based on Age-The Prima Facie Case [32] At the hearing, the Complainant testified that he was born on December 4, 1948, and therefore was 53 years of age at the time of the July 2002 posting. Mr. Kenneth Mullan (the successful candidate) testified that he was born on January 19, 1959, and therefore was 43 years of age at the time of the July 2002 posting. Mr. Mullan's birth certificate was filed in the proceedings and corroborated his testimony as to his age.\n[33] In the Complainant's letter of application, he did not mention his age or birth date, nor did he self-identify at the interview process or at any time relevant to this complaint as wanting to be accommodated for this reason.\n[34] There was no evidence led that age was a relevant factor to the position of Maintenance Foreman at the Edmonton Garage. At age 53, the Complainant was still many years away from the normal age of retirement. There was no attempt by the Complainant to bring his age to the attention of the Respondent at the time of the job interview or other times relevant to this complaint. There was no evidence that age was a subject of discussion in either the Complainant's or Mr. Mullan's job interviews, nor that the age difference between the two men was apparent at the time.\n[35] I find that the Complainant has not made out a prima facie case that his age played a role in the respondent's decision not to hire him.\n(c.1) Refusal to Employ Based on Race, Colour, National or Ethnic Origin - The Prima Facie Case\n[36] The Complainant testified that this was the first time that he had applied for a promotion to Foreman since arriving at the Edmonton Garage in 1980. He testified that this was because he did not feel that the Respondent was ready for a coloured foreman as yet, and that he was physically fit, could do the heavy duty mechanic's job easily, and he earned more money than a foreman because he worked overtime.\n[37] When asked what had changed to prompt him to apply in 2002, the Complainant responded, my health, my age, and said that he was unaware of any employment equity initiatives at the Edmonton Garage. He also testified that he would take the position today if it was offered to him, and that at the time of the hearing there was an open position for one foreman.\n[38] The Complainant testified that when he applied for the position, he first asked Steven Watson questions about the wage, the benefits package, and everything else but that Mr. Watson did not know anything about it. He decided to apply anyway, as he felt that it would be much lighter work for him due to him getting older and his health not being up to par.\n[39] A copy of the written application submitted by the Complainant was introduced into evidence, and the contents read out and confirmed by the Complainant in part as:\nEquipped with 22 years of experience as a mechanic\/lead hand I am applying for the position of maintenance foreman.\n[40] In fact, at the time, the Complainant had 32 years of experience because he had 10 years' experience in South Africa prior to being hired by the Respondent.\n[41] The written application also stated:\nI have reviewed the qualifications needed for the position and have the qualifications for all items listed on the job posting. If any further information is needed, I will furnish it upon your request.\n[42] The Complainant did not submit any further resume or proof of qualifications, nor was he asked by the interviewing supervisors, Chuck Seeley or Steven Watson, to do so.\n[43] When asked about the lack of information he provided, the Complainant testified that the supervisors knew everything about him because he had been at the Edmonton Garage for 22 years, and that Mr. Watson knew all about his certifications.\n[44] In my view, it would be surprising if Mr. Watson had full recall of the certifications the Complainant had shown him in 1989, thirteen years prior to the interview. Having said that, I find that Mr. Watson would have been fully conversant with the Complainant's job performance over many years as a heavy duty mechanic in both the Service and Hoist Areas, his relationship with co-workers and his ability as a Lead Hand.\n[45] The Complainant also testified that his interview only took about three minutes, and that although Mr. Seeley had lined paper and pen in front of him (the supervisors and the Complainant were across the desk from each other), he took no interview notes in his presence.\n[46] The Complainant called Mr. Mullan as a witness. In Mr. Mullan's testimony he stated that his interview was also not lengthy, less than half an hour. He recalled being asked about how he would conduct himself as a manager, but that it was an informal interview because he knew the supervisors having been working there for 5 years at the time. He vaguely recalled Chuck Seeley taking notes during the interview, but little was asked of him about his work experience. Like the Complainant, he testified that he felt that the interviewing supervisors knew him well enough that his expertise was not in question and was not the subject of discussion.\n[47] The Complainant is of East Indian ethnicity. Mr. Mullan is white.\n[48] As was mentioned above, under the Shakes approach, a prima facie case may be made out by demonstrating that the Complainant was qualified for the particular employment; that the Complainant was not hired; and that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint subsequently obtained the position.\n[49] In that the Complainant was not hired in this case, and in that Mr. Kenneth Mullan, the successful candidate, lacks the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of this complaint, the issue is whether the Complainant was qualified for the Foreman's position, and whether Mr. Mullan was no better qualified than the Complainant.\n[50] Mr. Mullan testified that he was a union shop steward at the time of the application for the position, but had no Lead Hand experience in the employ of the Respondent. He testified that he commenced work for the Respondent in 1997, and worked there as a Class A1 mechanic only until his promotion to Foreman in August 2002.\n[51] His experience as a licensed mechanic spanned only 5 years at the time of the posting as compared with the Complainant's thirty-two years. As a foreman, all were agreed that a person no longer does any mechanic duties. However, I accept evidence given by the Complainant that knowledge of mechanic duties is essential to doing the Foreman's job well as you are dealing with mechanics, drivers and dispatch all the time who need supervision, guidance, and assistance.\n[52] Cooperation with co-workers and management was also, by all accounts, an important part of the Foreman's job. Numerous witnesses said that the Complainant worked well with his co-workers. He in fact was very friendly with some, and maintained appropriate business relations with others. With management, the only reported tensions were with his supervisor, Steven Watson. Gary Peach, who is now retired, but at the relevant time was the Dispatcher located in downtown Edmonton, dealt with the Complainant on the telephone on a daily basis as Lead Hand. He was very complimentary of the Complainant's cooperation, knowledge and helpfulness on an ongoing daily basis over years of interaction.\n[53] Nizar Dalla (an area maintenance manager out of Calgary), Richard Baker (at one time a Foreman at the Edmonton Garage), Steven Pejkovic, Gary Peach, and Jace Loewen all testified that the Complainant was highly skilled and conscientious at his job, interacted well with co-workers, and had leadership qualities. On the other hand, Richard Baker, Gary Peach, and Steven Pejkovic testified that Mr. Mullan was not as knowledgeable as the Complainant, nor as cooperative, nor as competent.\n[54] Mr. Mullan had commenced work for the Respondent in 1997, and therefore had 17 years less seniority at the Edmonton Garage than did the Complainant. Mr. Mullan did have previous relevant work experience. At the time of the job competition, Mr. Mullan had been the Union Shop Steward for approximately 1\u00bd years. The Complainant had also served as Union Shop Steward for several years previously.\n[55] Based on the above, I find that there is sufficient evidence that the Complainant was qualified for the position of Foreman, and that Mr. Mullan was less qualified or no better qualified than the Complainant.\nImproper Use of Discipline Record\n[56] The Complainant also adduced evidence that, despite his equal or superior qualifications, his candidacy for the job was hampered by improper consideration of his past disciplinary record. In this regard, he testified about a conflict in the workplace that he feels was improperly considered by the respondent in determining whether he had the necessary interpersonal skills to be Foreman.\n[57] On March 11, 1992, (ten years prior to the disputed Foreman job competition) an argument took place at the workplace between the Complainant and his supervisor Steven Watson. According to the complainant, there were words between the two of them, but there was no physical contact. At the time of the argument, the complainant had been using an exacto knife to scrape an inspection sticker off a bus window.\n[58] Mr. Watson filed a formal workplace complaint against the Complainant arising out of the argument. The Complainant testified that, in the workplace complaint, Mr. Watson falsely accused the Complainant of threatening him, by poking Mr. Watson with his finger during the argument and having knives in his possession that Mr. Watson found intimidating.\n[59] There was evidence that the incident was held against the Complainant ten years later during the Foreman hiring process, and that it was viewed as an example of the Complainant not getting along with his superiors in management. The evidence suggested that it was a factor in the respondent's decision not to hire the complainant, even though it should have been ignored because it had occurred so far in the past. It would seem to be the complainant's assertion that because of his race, the respondent dug deeply into his employment history to find a reason not to hire him. In this way, he could be passed over for the job despite his superior qualifications.\nConclusion\n[60] I conclude, based on all of the above, that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination on the ground of race with respect to the 2002 Foreman job competition.\n(c.2) Refusal to Employ Based on Race, Colour, National or Ethnic Origin - The Respondent's Explanation\n[61] The Respondent has presented a number of explanations for why Mr. Kenneth Mullan was offered the position of Foreman in the July 2002 competition:\nMr. Mullan was, despite the complainant's evidence, the best candidate for the job; Hiring Mr. Mullan for the Foreman position allowed the Respondent to accommodate his physical disability; The decision to hire Mr. Mullan was made by individuals in the Calgary office who presumably had no personal knowledge of the candidates; To the extent that the Complainant was treated unfairly in the job application process, this was due to personal animosity between the Complainant and Steve Watson, that had nothing to do with discrimination.\n[62] The Respondent also presented explanatory evidence in regard to the Complainant's allegation that the 1992 workplace conflict was used against him in the hiring process.\n[63] All of these explanations shall be considered in turn.\nMr. Mullan was, despite the complainant's evidence, the best candidate for the job;\n[64] In comparing the work experience of Mr. Mullan to that of the Complainant, the Respondent notes that the latter only submitted a short letter of application, with no detail given as to qualifications or experience, and stating that he had only 12 years of experience with the Respondent as a Lead Hand. Again, however, the evidence tendered at the hearing did not support this statement, as the Complainant had been appointed Lead Hand throughout the 22 years he worked there, and I have found that his experience as a Lead Hand in the employ of the Respondent exceeded 12 years.\n[65] The respondent sought to challenge the Complainant's suggestion that he was not accorded a fair interview. A piece of paper purporting to be questions asked of the Complainant during the interview process was introduced into evidence, and identified by Mr. Chuck Seeley as having been handwritten by him during the interview of the Complainant. It was similar in terms of the questions asked to other documents introduced purporting to be the interview notes of other interviews conducted of other candidates for the subject job posting and other Foreman job postings. Complainant's counsel challenged the authorship of the document, and challenged when the document was created.\n[66] Ultimately, given the evidence as to both the Complainant's interview and Mr. Mullan's interview, I do not see anything turning on this point. I find that the piece of paper purporting to be a record of the Complainant's interview, was in fact authored by Chuck Seeley. It is possible that the notes were taken during the interview; however it is just as possible that they were written up afterward. Thus the paper does not serve as conclusive evidence of equal treatment during the interview process.\n[67] The Respondent also tried to challenge the Complainant's qualifications relative to Mr. Mullan by impugning his computer skills. Several witnesses testified that about one year previous, the Respondent had introduced a new computer system called MCMS for maintenance purposes at the Edmonton Garage. All the mechanics had to learn to use it to complete orders, pull up their time, complete electronic time cards on it, and access some maintenance assistance manuals. It was necessary to use this system as both a Lead Hand and as a Foreman. Mr. Mullan testified that this was discussed during his interview, that the supervisors indicated that they felt he knew the system as well as anyone else working with the new program, and that if he had any difficulties they could help him.\n[68] In Mr. Watson's testimony, he says he questioned the Complainant's competency with the MCMS system at the time, and felt he was slower and less capable with MCMS than some others. The Complainant had testified, however, that he was fully capable on the system as he used it daily as a Lead Hand. I accept the evidence of the Complainant on this issue, that he had sufficient competency on the MCMS system for the job of Foreman and his abilities at least equalled those of Mr. Mullan.\n[69] Mr. Watson also testified as to Mr. Mullan's work experience. He acknowledged that Mr. Mullan was a Class A1 mechanic at the Edmonton Garage, and never a Lead Hand. He further testified that Mr. Mullan had been a heavy duty apprentice mechanic for his immediately previous employer, a general helper apprentice mechanic before that, and a service person at Edmonton Transit before that. In brief, the respondent was unable to demonstrate that Mr. Mullan was more qualified than the complainant, so this explanation must be rejected.\nHiring Mr. Mullan for the Foreman position allowed the Respondent to accommodate his physical disability\n[70] The respondent also put forward the explanation that under the Employment Equity Act, it had an obligation to accommodate disabled workers. Placing Mr. Mullan, who suffered from arthritis, in the less physically demanding job of Foreman served to accommodate his disability.\n[71] At the time of the job posting, Ken Mullan was absent from work on disability due to his arthritic condition. His arthritis was evident, as he had been off work several times for several months at a time. The Respondent was obviously aware of this. However, in Mr. Mullan's testimony at the hearing, he was adamant that his arthritic condition did not prevent him from doing full heavy duty mechanic duties, and specifically said that he did not self-identify as disabled, nor ask to be accommodated for the Foreman job posting. He testified that he really wanted the job, and that he emphasized his enthusiasm in the interview, because he wanted to advance himself.\n[72] Mr. Mullan further testified that when he was terminated from the Respondent's employ after having been a foreman for about one and one-half years, he wanted to return to his heavy duty mechanic position. He stated that at that time, he felt fully capable of performing as a heavy duty mechanic, but he was not given the chance to go back `on the floor'. He has since changed his occupation on doctor's advice, but at the relevant time period, this was his mind set and his capability as he judged it.\n[73] Mr. Mullan's evidence on these points was not controverted by either of the interviewing supervisors, Steven Watson or Chuck Seeley. No one from the Respondent's Calgary office gave evidence.\n[74] As a result, I find this alternate explanation of the Respondent's-that it hired Mr. Mullan as Foreman in an effort to accommodate his disability-to be pretextual.\nThe decision to hire Mr. Mullan was made by individuals in the Calgary office who presumably had no personal knowledge of the candidates\n[75] The respondent also tried to portray its actions in a non-discriminatory light by asserting that the ultimate decision to hire Mr. Mullan over the Complainant was made by the Calgary office, and not by anyone at the Edmonton Garage. However, I find that the actual decision was really made by Steven Watson with Chuck Seeley's concurrence. The Respondent chose to only have Steven Watson testify as its representative, and no one from the Calgary office appeared to give evidence. It is clear from Mr. Seeley's and Mr. Watson's evidence taken together that they had made up their minds to offer the position to Mr. Mullan before calling the Calgary office, and that they presented their interview findings in such a way as to effectively direct that Mr. Mullan be hired.\n[76] It is my view that this is not a satisfactory or reasonable explanation.\nTo the extent that the Complainant was treated unfairly in the job application process, this was due to personal animosity between the Complainant and Steve Watson, that had nothing to do with discrimination.\n[77] The Respondent states that there is a history of conflict between Supervisor Steven Watson and the Complainant. It characterizes this as the Complainant having complained to other employees about Mr. Watson and his abilities as a manager, causing problems between the two men. The Respondent stresses that the conflict between Mr. Watson and the Complainant is not based on a prohibited ground, but rather is based on personal differences.\n[78] The evidence of both Mr. Watson and the Complainant is that, at one time, they were close personal friends outside of work as well as at the workplace. Although Mr. Watson commenced at the Edmonton Garage in 1973, and the Complainant commenced in 1980, Mr. Watson worked his way up through the ranks. The Complainant arrived at the Edmonton Garage as a fully licensed mechanic. Mr. Watson was apprenticed to the Complainant and worked under him. The Complainant took his own time to assist Mr. Watson to gain his mechanic's certification. They worked on cars together at a friend's farm after work often, and went out to eat together. Their personal relationship soured, however, after Mr. Watson became the Complainant's superior.\n[79] Given their previous close personal relationship, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the tensions that arose between them were non-discriminatory in nature.\n[80] I find that the personal conflict between the Complainant and Steven Watson improperly influenced Mr. Watson's handling of the hiring process for Night Foreman in the Summer of 2002. Mr. Watson's and Mr. Seeley's interview of the Complainant was very brief. Mr. Watson asked the questions, and he did not explore the Complainant's qualifications adequately, nor ask him for further information that the Complainant offered to give. Mr. Watson exaggerated the qualifications of Mr. Mullan when he presented the interview outcomes to the Calgary decision-makers, with Mr. Seeley going along.\n[81] Similarly, I find that Mr. Watson sought to undermine the Complainant's candidacy by using the 1992 workplace conflict against him. There was evidence from Steven Watson that any employee had the right to look at his own personnel records in Mr. Watson's office upon request. Upon a review of his personnel records, any employee has the right to destroy or cause to be destroyed any disciplinary or similar records after a five year time period. Accordingly, while it is true the workplace conflict occurred, it occurred ten years prior to the Complainant's application for promotion to Foreman; it was therefore remote in time and irrelevant to the job competition. Despite the foregoing, there was evidence it was an incident that Steven Watson continued to hold against the Complainant personally. In the context of their soured friendship, this is more than likely.\n[82] The evidence supports the conclusion that Mr. Watson did not want to be dealing with the Complainant on a more frequent basis as supervisor to Foreman, due to the personal conflicts between the two men in the past and the consequent suspicion and animosity between them. The Complainant, for his part, felt victimized by supervisor Steven Watson's animus toward him, which would appear on the evidence to be justified.\n[83] However, there has to be a nexus between the conduct under scrutiny and a prohibited ground of discrimination. The nexus can be inferred through circumstantial evidence, but the inference of discrimination must be more probable than other possible inferences. Failing that, there may be other workplace, union, and civil remedies open to the Complainant, but the standard needed to establish a human rights complaint will not have been met.\n[84] Liability under the CHRA is not engaged where the complainant's negative workplace experiences are due solely to a personality conflict with a supervisor. (See Hill v. Air Canada (2003), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/456 (C.H.R.T.), paras. 132, 164-165, 169 and the cases cited therein.)\n[85] In this case, I find that the prima facie discrimination in the hiring process is satisfactorily explained by the personal animosity existing between the Complainant and Mr. Watson. This animosity is based on the interactions and respective career paths of the two men, and has nothing to do with the complainant's race, colour, or national or ethnic origin-or for that matter his age or disability. The inference of personal animus based on workplace history is more probable than any possible inference of discrimination on a prohibited ground.\n[86] Since the respondent has provided a reasonable explanation, Allegation No. 1 is dismissed.\nB. ALLEGATION NO. 2 - HISTORIC AND ONGOING HARASSMENT BY CO-WORKERS AND MANAGERS\n[87] The Complainant has presented evidence of eight incidents or aspects of his workplace experience which he alleges form a pattern of harassment based on race, within the meaning of s. 14 of the CHRA. These eight incidents or aspects will be examined in turn.\n(i) Workplace harassment by then foreman, Bruce Morrison, commencing 1984 [88] The Complainant gave evidence regarding workplace harassment by then foreman, Bruce Morrison, against him commencing in or about 1984 and continuing over several years. The Complainant made a formal human rights complaint against the Respondent in 1990 also based on age, race and disability, which was investigated and ultimately dismissed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in 1994. The Complainant testified that Mr. Morrison was responsible for demoting him from Lead Hand, that he made racially based remarks behind his back, and denied him courses that white mechanics got.\n[89] It is the Complainant's position that although his 1990 CHRA complaint was dismissed, it should still be looked upon in this hearing as evidence of discrimination dating back nineteen years previous to the filing of the present complaint. On this issue, I agree with the Respondent that this matter is too remote in time from the present matter to be properly adduced as a factor in the present inquiry. Therefore I cannot give it consideration as a single act of harassment, nor as part of a pattern of harassment.\n(ii) False accusations of making threats against Mr. Watson on March 11, 1992 [90] As was mentioned earlier, on March 11, 1992, an argument took place at the workplace between the Complainant and Steven Watson. According to Mr. Watson, during this exchange the Complainant threatened him by angrily poking him with two fingers, while holding an exacto knife in the same hand. Steven Watson ultimately filed a formal complaint against the Complainant, which he said he agonized over somewhat as they had been good friends at one time. He states that he was influenced in his decision by others superior to him, who convinced him that he had to take these formal steps to promote respect in the workplace for him and his position. The formal complaint at the time stated that the Complainant had small knives in his possession that Mr. Watson found intimidating. However, during the hearing Mr. Watson confirmed that the Complainant had an exacto knife in his hand that he had been using for work, not small knives.\n[91] With respect to this incident, two documents in particular were introduced. One document introduced by the Respondent was put forward as containing corporate records (referred to as Form 6s) indicating that the Complainant was disciplined for this incident, and reciting the incident as Mr. Watson had outlined it, except for the reference to the small knives in the Complainant's possession. The Form 6s are a commonly used form at the Edmonton Garage that are employed for a variety of reasons. On the form it shows to whom copies of the Form are to be sent. When it comes to disciplinary matters, the person being disciplined would normally receive a copy. The Form 6s introduced indicate that the Complainant would have received a copy.\n[92] However, in the Complainant's testimony, he stated that he was not disciplined nor did he ever receive the Form 6 reprimand introduced into evidence. The Form 6 evidence was put to the Complainant during cross-examination, and Complainant's counsel objected to their introduction. She submitted that the Respondent was under an obligation to disclose all of the Complainant's employment records, and had not previously disclosed these particular documents.\n[93] I allowed the documents to be put to the Complainant on the basis that Form 6 documents relating to a 1992 incident might not necessarily have been considered relevant prior to the hearing. In that the complainant gave statements under oath, that the documents tended to refute, I allowed Respondent's counsel to introduce them as credibility was an issue in the hearing. At the cross-examination stage, they were introduced as exhibits for identification only, as there was no evidence that the Complainant had seen them previously and he testified therefore that he could not identify them.\n[94] Subsequently, the documents were introduced as corporate records, kept in the normal course of business, through Steven Watson.\n[95] Another document relating to this incident was introduced by the Complainant, that was identified as a copy of a contemporaneous written complaint outlining the event's particulars and authored by his supervisor, Steven Watson, that had been ripped up and retrieved by the Complainant and others from the trash. The Complainant had kept the document in the intervening years.\n[96] Steven Pejkovic testified for the Complainant about the March 11, 1992 incident. He said that he has never observed the Complainant to be physically aggressive toward anybody at the garage over the years. However, he also testified that he was not present at the time of the March 11, 1992 incident, and that he could not confirm the incident. The Respondent did not call any witnesses as to the incident (other than Mr. Watson).\n[97] I prefer the evidence of Steven Watson. He was quite emotional when remembering that he agonized over whether to report the matter which would bring disciplinary action upon the Complainant, because of the closeness of their friendship in earlier years. He admitted that the small knives notation, which appeared in the initial documentation, was wrong, and had a clear memory of the details. This contrasted with the Complainant's blanket denial. I find that this incident did take place as outlined by Steven Watson, and that the Complainant did receive a reprimand.\n[98] However, I do not accept the Complainant's position that he was falsely accused and that this is an example of ongoing managerial harassment of him on a discriminatory basis. The evidence reveals that this incident had no connection with the Complainant's race, and originated rather from a personal animosity that had arisen between the Complainant and Steven Watson, which they both denied on the stand, but which was evident in their respective testimonies. Therefore, I cannot attach significance to this incident in my harassment analysis.\n(iii) Complainant's 2000 holiday scheduling [99] The Complainant alleges that his year 2000 summer holiday application was tampered with. Holidays are governed at the Edmonton Garage by the Collective Agreement. The Complainant testified under cross-examination that he did not file a grievance with respect to this incident. He testified that there have been no other holiday `incidents' since that time. He did state that there were other holiday incidents that preceded this one, but gave no details or timelines, and there was no corollary evidence given on the point. Therefore, the only matter for me to consider is the 2000 one.\n[100] In April 2000 the Complainant applied for holidays from June 17th to June 30th, 2000. By virtue of his seniority, he should have been assigned his first choice. He had already bought airline tickets and made plans to vacation in the United States. There is no dispute that the application was tampered with. A copy of the handwritten bid was introduced as evidence, which clearly showed the year 2000 had been crossed out and 2001 handwritten in over it. No evidence was adduced as to who might have been responsible for this tampering. The Complainant testified that he did not do it, and I accept his evidence on this point. He would not have put his desired vacation plans in jeopardy, and risk someone else being assigned his preferred holiday time.\n[101] The Complainant did state that at the relevant time, he handed his application to the then second supervisor at the Edmonton Garage, Chuck Seeley. He also testified that Steven Watson phoned him to point out that he had bid for the wrong year. Although he did not file a grievance through his Union, the Complainant did go to Keith Hutchings, then on the Union Executive, and a Senior Labour Relations Manager. Upon their intervention, the Complainant was given the holidays he requested, but it appears he would not have without their intervention. The time had already been given to the second in seniority, and that assignment had to be changed.\n[102] The Complainant says that this is an example of workplace harassment of him by management. Given that the Complainant gave his bid to his supervisor, Chuck Seeley, and that the evidence before me was that the only other person who had the bid was supervisor Steven Watson, I find that his holiday bid was tampered with by someone in management.\n[103] Moreover, management did not act appropriately to rectify the situation once they were made aware that the Complainant had not altered his bid. The Respondent did give the Complainant the holidays that he was entitled to ultimately, but only after he sought out intervention at a higher level within the company. His direct supervisors denied him his entitlement despite what quickly became a very evident error on the face of his holiday bid. Someone deliberately changed his bid, and his immediate superiors, being Steven Watson and Chuck Seeley, did not react appropriately when made aware of the conflict. This should not have required union intervention to correct.\n[104] However, in order to constitute harassment within the meaning of s. 14, the incident needs to be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Nothing in the evidence suggests that the tampering with the complainant's holiday application, or management's response thereto, was based in whole or in part on the complainant's race.\n(iv) Steve Watson's threat on July 23, 2002 to fire the Complainant if he won the Foreman Position [105] At the time of his enquiries about the job competition for Night Shift Maintenance Foreman, the Complainant states that he was told by supervisor Steven Watson that he would fire him if he got the position, because he would no longer be in the Union. Mr. Watson denies saying this. However, the Complainant's witness, Euclide Plamondon, a serviceman in the Edmonton Garage, testified that Mr. Watson said this in his presence to the Complainant. Mr. Plamondon's memory of the statement was, If you take the job, I will fire you. You won't be in the union anymore. I accept Mr. Plamondon's evidence on this point. He had a clear memory of the circumstances of the statement, his reaction, and the reaction of the Complainant.\n[106] A great deal of time was spent at the hearing on the question of whether, in fact, the Complainant could be fired or terminated if he had been hired as Foreman. Whether he could in fact be fired or not once he was no longer in the Union, is irrelevant to the complaint which is based on what was said to him. I accept the evidence of the Complainant and Mr. Plamondon that the threat was made by Steven Watson, and was done openly on the work floor in front of Mr. Plamondon.\n[107] However, the Complainant's further testimony on this point was curious. Mr. Plamondon testified that he did not feel that Steven Watson was joking when he made the comments; he felt Mr. Watson was serious. However, the Complainant testified that he did not believe that Mr. Watson was that serious, and that he thought Mr. Watson was joking. If the Complainant received this comment as a joke, it calls into question whether he truly perceived the comment as being unwelcome. He applied for the job in any event.\n[108] That being said, even if the Complainant viewed Mr. Watson's threat as an unwelcome communication that served to poison the work environment, it has not been demonstrated that the threat was connected to the Complainant's race, or that it was based on any other prohibited ground of discrimination. Therefore the threat incident cannot be viewed as an instance of harassment.\n(v) Ken Pauli October 4, 2005 incident [109] The Complainant testified that on October 4, 2005, another mechanic, Ken Pauli, harassed him at work by calling him names including stupid and lazy and everything else. He was Lead Hand, it was a statutory holiday, and Mr. Watson was away that week. Nizar Dalla, a manager from Calgary, was on duty later that day. The Complainant testified that he felt that Mr. Watson took the week's holidays and condoned Ken Pauli to harass me. Explaining further, he testified that he believed that [Mr. Watson] got Ken Pauli to harass me. His reasoning was that he had never had problems with Ken Pauli previously.\n[110] The Complainant was advised by Marcia Reynolds in the Respondent's Human Resources Department to file a complaint in writing about the incident, which he did. Subsequently, he was aware that Ms. Reynolds did carry out an investigation and that he received a letter from Ms. Reynolds stating that Mr. Pauli admitted harassing him and acting against the Respondent's relationship policy that is widely posted at the Edmonton Garage and other of the Respondent's work sites. Race was not investigated, just harassment. He testified that he felt race was an issue, but he did not state that at the time of his workplace complaint. He also felt that Mr. Pauli's conduct was really a retaliation from Mr. Watson for his having filed a human rights complaint. (However, he did not make a formal allegation at the hearing, or beforehand, of retaliation under s. 14.1 of the Act.)\n[111] The Complainant testified that this was the only incident I had with anybody on the floor in the garage and that this was a singular incident. In his testimony, Mr. Watson denied any prior knowledge of Mr. Pauli's conduct, and confirmed that he was away on holiday at the time of the incident. There was no evidence of Mr. Watson's involvement with this incident, either by encouraging it or condoning it. The investigation of the Complainant's workplace complaint against Ken Pauli did not involve Mr. Watson. At best, the Complainant's belief was pure conjecture that Mr. Watson was involved in putting Mr. Pauli up to harassing him when Mr. Watson would be away on holidays.\n[112] Moreover, the only evidence the Complainant presented suggesting that race was a factor in Mr. Pauli's behaviour was the Complainant's stated belief that race was an issue, even though he did not state this at the time of his workplace complaint.\n[113] In view of the above, I find that the Complainant has not demonstrated that this incident can be considered an instance of harassment within the meaning of s. 14.\n(vi) Denial of training and courses [114] The Complainant testified that on numerous occasions he requested specialized courses but did not get them. The issue of courses and training can be grieved through the Collective Agreement but the Complainant did not do this, although he testified that he did talk to a Union Executive member, Nelson Holst, about the issue.\n[115] The Complainant alleges that he has been denied the opportunity to take courses or receive training that has been offered to other workers, and that this denial over time has both hindered his career advancement and directly interfered with his ability to perform certain specialized functions at work. Together with general allegations of discrimination in allocation of courses, the Complainant says he was denied the opportunity in 2001 to obtain his Class 2 licence (an upgrade from Class 3), and that when he took a newly required Air Conditioning course in 2003 and failed it, he suspects that Supervisor Steven Watson influenced the instructor to give him a failing grade.\n[116] There was little evidence from the Complainant that he did not have adequate training over his years of employment. However, there was evidence that he was not given longer courses that he requested or that he felt he needed to do his work with current competence. In particular, in or about 2001, there was a new requirement that mechanics needed an upgrade from a Class 3 to a Class 2 license in order to carry a passenger when testing buses. The need to carry passengers would arise when a mechanic would carry an apprentice or another mechanic with him or her when testing the bus for vibrations or the like. It was not disputed that several mechanics achieved their Class 2 license, but when the Complainant asked Steven Watson to take the course, he was told that they had sufficient numbers with the new classification. He never did get this training, and to date cannot now test buses unless he gets somebody with a Class 2 license to go with him. As the most senior mechanic at the garage, often with Lead Hand duties, this is a real restriction on his ability to do duties he could do previously. Many mechanics who work under the Complainant as Lead Hand, have these Class 2 Licenses now.\n[117] The Complainant also testified that when he was working more in the Hoist area, he was working on engines but not given any courses on engines. He also mentioned a 2003 electronics course offered to learn about a computerized analyzer to analyze what is wrong with the bus engine. He stated that whether you work in the Service area or the Hoist area, or any part of the workplace, you still need to use that analyzer. He was denied this opportunity.\n[118] Another example given by the Complainant was an Air Conditioning (AC) course that the Complainant asked to take from about 1999 forward, and was finally offered in 2003 only after he told a union executive board member that it was being denied to him. He had considerable experience working with AC units on the buses. He considers the course very relevant and essential to his career. According to current Alberta government regulations, you can only work on AC units if you pass this course and hold the appropriate HRAI certificate.\n[119] It was a one week course, with a final open-book examination, and the Complainant failed the course. The course was taught by one Peter Jasmin, who was independent of the Respondent. The Complainant saw Steven Watson talking with Peter Jasmin, and although he could not hear what they were saying, he believed they were talking about him. The Complainant blames interference by Steven Watson for his failing the course. He did not grieve the matter through the Union, nor complain to the Respondent, because he was embarrassed. The result is that although he has worked on AC units since 1970, he can no longer do so.\n[120] The Complainant did not give any evidence as to whether he has asked to take the course again, or re-write the examination. The inference from his evidence is that he did neither.\n[121] I do not accept the assertion made by the Complainant that Steven Watson interfered with the AC course and influenced the instructor to give the Complainant a failing grade. Therefore, I find that the Complainant has not made out a prima facie case of harassment with respect to this matter.\n(vii) Denial of overtime [122] The Complainant testified that he had been denied overtime opportunities. The evidence led in his direct testimony was that he told Steven Watson some time ago that he wanted to retire soon, and build up his pension before doing so by working some overtime. He testified that Mr. Watson's response was No. There is no overtime. He further testified that other white mechanics could work overtime. He elaborated by saying that he worked quite a bit of overtime previous to Mr. Watson becoming foreman.\n[123] When asked to be specific about the denials, he testified that if he had asked for overtime two years ago, Mr. Watson would have refused to grant it to him, but that this had changed about one year to a year and one-half ago. He stated that there is a shortage of mechanics so this is not an ongoing issue now.\n[124] Despite the fact that several people were called as witnesses for the Complainant who did work for the Respondent in the relevant time period, and continue to work for the Respondent, none of them testified as to their own overtime experience nor as to overtime generally available at the Edmonton Garage. The only evidence led was by the Complainant and Steven Watson.\n[125] Although the Complainant may have at times been denied overtime when he asked for it, his evidence was unclear on the dates and time periods involved. The complainant did not present enough evidence demonstrating even on a prima facie basis that his race played a role in any decisions made to deny him overtime.\n(viii) Historical and ongoing workplace harassment [126] The Complainant led little evidence on this point outside the ambit of the specific events and allegations already highlighted. He stated that the whole thing is racial discrimination because my race, my age, and disability. His evidence essentially was that there is discrimination everywhere, and that wherever you go in the blue-collar trade, it is the same thing. He stated that it is the same kind of behaviour, the same mentality, the same culture, the same. This appears to be the defensive filter through which the Complainant views any workplace, including the Edmonton Garage where he has worked for 26 years.\n[127] When asked about the ongoing nature of his complaint, the Complainant testified that there is name calling behind the back. It is never in front of me... He said he knows this because people tell me about [it]. However, the Complainant's testimony on this aspect lacked any specificity, and he did not give evidence as to who told him this, or when, or provide any details as to either the nature of the talk, or what he was told about it.\n[128] I find that the Complainant has not made out a prima facie case on this general alleged manifestation of harassment. The evidence is not complete or sufficient.\n[129] Nor do I find that all eight incidents or aspects considered together constitute harassment within the meaning of s. 14 of the CHRA. As was mentioned above, to constitute harassment there must be a connection between the pattern of unwelcome conduct and a prohibited ground. No such connection has been established in regard to any of the eight incidents or aspects. Nothing in the evidence suggests that such a connection can be inferred in regard to the group of eight as a whole, or in regard to a sub-group thereof.\n[130] Allegation No. 2 must be dismissed.\nC. ALLEGATION NO. 3 - DENIAL OF TRAINING AND COURSES [131] I have already dismissed the Complainant's allegation that Steven Watson harassed him by influencing an instructor to fail him in the AC course. However, more generally, the complainant has also asserted that the Respondent's conduct in regard to the denial of training and courses constitutes a discriminatory practice under both ss. 7(b) and 10(a) of the CHRA.\n[132] This allegation is supported by the fact that the Complainant was denied the Class 2 license course, as well as the Electronic Analyzer course, and that for several years he was denied the opportunity to take the AC course. All these courses are essential to the Complainant being able to keep up his competency levels and to potential career advancement. In fact, the lack of courses has compromised the Complainant's ability to do his work at the Edmonton Garage despite his seniority and experience. All of the courses at issue were offered to other mechanics in the Edmonton Garage, often those who continued to work under the Complainant's direction.\n[133] In view of the foregoing, I find there is prima facie evidence that the Respondent differentiated against the complainant adversely in the approval of courses and training. Similarly, there is prima facie evidence that the Respondent in the person of Steven Watson did pursue a practice affecting courses and training that deprived the Complainant of employment opportunities.\n[134] However, in order to satisfy the prima facie burden, the evidence must be complete and sufficient to justify a decision in the Complainant's favour. In the current matter, there is no evidence linking the adverse differentiation or denial of employment opportunities to a prohibited ground of discrimination. Instead, the evidence indicates that the personal conflict between the Complainant and Steven Watson improperly influenced Mr. Watson's decisions relating to the courses and training that were made available to the Complainant. As I have said before, on the evidence, I find that this personal conflict had nothing to do with the Complainant's race, age or disability.\n[135] In view of the above, Allegation No. 3 must be dismissed.\nVI. DECISION [136] For all the foregoing reasons, the complaint is dismissed. No costs are awarded to the respondent as this is not provided for in the CHRA.\nSigned by\nKerry-Lynne D.

Jensen\n[1] The Chalk River Technicians and Technologists - 404 (CRTT), have requested an Order substituting CRTT-404 for the Complainant, Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 404 (OPEIU) in a complaint filed against Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). The Respondent has consented to the motion.\n[2] The complaint, alleging a violation of s. 10 of the Act, was lodged in May 2002, by OPEIU.\n[3] OPEIU was the bargaining agent for a unit of clerical and administrative employees of AECL at its Chalk River location in 2002, when the complaint was lodged. In June of 2004, the Canadian National Committee of OPEIU exercised its right to autonomy under the OPEIU Constitution and became the Canadian Office and Professional Employees' Union, Local 404 (COPE). COPE instructed Local 404 to change its name and letterhead, and the employer was advised of the Local's new name. Thereafter, COPE, continued to deal with AECL on behalf of the employees in the bargaining unit, but under the name of COPE, without objection from the AECL.\n[4] A second complaint, alleging a violation of s. 11 of the Act, was filed on November 14, 2005, by COPE. The two complaints were referred to the Tribunal and it was agreed that they would be dealt with together.\n[5] In April 2006, COPE was replaced, by order of the Canada Industrial Relations Board, by CRTT as the bargaining agent for the unit.\n[6] COPE authorized CRTT to settle and withdraw both complaints on its behalf.\n[7] CRTT and COPE have entered into Minutes of Settlement with AECL resolving the two complaints. OPEIU was provided with the Notice of Motion to change the name of Complainant and has not responded.\n[8] It is clear from the Affidavit of Suzanne Sheridan-Cole, who was the vice-president of OPEIU when the s. 10 complaint was filed, that COPE stepped into the shoes of OPEIU and assumed all of its responsibilities and obligations with respect to representing the interests of the members of the bargaining unit. Thereafter, CRTT stepped into the shoes of COPE and assumed the latter's legal obligations when it became certified as the new bargaining agent.\n[9] Section 36 of the Canada Labour Code provides that a successor union assumes the responsibilities of the predecessor union as bargaining agent for the purposes of the collective agreement.\n[10] The Tribunal has granted amendments to complaints in order to clarify the legalities of the situation and where no prejudice will result to the respondent (Gaucher v. Canada (Armed Forces) 2005 CHRT 1). The Tribunal has also granted motions to substitute a party where it was satisfied that although the party had changed in status, it continued to exist as an amalgamated company and had assumed all of the legal rights and responsibilities of the previous party (Bozek v. MCL Ryder Transport Ltd. 2002 CanLII 45937 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[11] In the present case, the Tribunal finds that substituting the name of CRTT for OPEIU in the s. 10 complaint is appropriate for the following reasons:\nCOPE, CRTT and AECL all consent to the motion;\nAs it was entitled to do under the OPEIU Constitution, COPE has assumed the responsibilities held by OPEIU;\nUnder the Canada Labour Code, CRTT is the successor in law to the representational rights possessed by COPE;\nThere is no apparent adverse impact on the rights of the alleged victims, nor has anyone suggested as much.\n[12] CRTT has not asked that it be substituted as the complainant in the s. 11 complaint. This is presumably because COPE and CRTT participated in the settlement negotiations and COPE authorized CRTT to settle the matter on its behalf.\n[13] Therefore, the request to change the name of the Complainant in the s. 10 complaint to CRTT is granted.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] George Vilven and Robert Neil Kelly were pilots with Air Canada. Mr. Vilven was employed by Air Canada from May 26, 1986 to September 1, 2003, when his employment with Air Canada was terminated. Mr. Vilven turned 60 on August 30, 2003. Mr. Kelly joined Air Canada on September 11, 1972 and his employment with Air Canada ended on May 1, 2005. He attained 60 on April 30, 2005.\n[2] Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly were required to retire from Air Canada at age 60 in accordance with the mandatory retirement age provisions of the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan which is incorporated into the collective agreement between Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA), the union that represents Air Canada pilots.\n[3] The relevant section of the Pension Plan provides that every pilot's employment with Air Canada shall be terminated no later than the first day of the calendar month following which the pilot reaches 60.\n[4] Both Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly want to continue flying as pilots with Air Canada. Both filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC); Mr. Vilven on August 5, 2004 and Mr. Kelly on March 5, 2006. In their complaints, they alleged that Air Canada discriminated against them on the basis of age, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) by requiring them to retire at age 60. Mr. Kelly also filed a complaint against ACPA, alleging a contravention of ss. 9 & 10 of the CHRA.\n[5] The Tribunal granted interested party status to ACPA in relation to Mr. Vilven's complaint. It also granted interested party status to the Fly Past 60 Coalition (Coalition) which is a group of pilots or former pilots of Air Canada who are united in their goal of eliminating the mandatory retirement age at Air Canada. At the request of the parties, the Tribunal joined the three complaints and all were dealt with at the one hearing.\n[6] The Coalition filed a Notice of Constitutional Question in which it challenged the constitutionality of s.15(1)(c) of the CHRA alleging that it contravened s.15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (Charter) and was not justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\nII. DECISION [7] For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal has concluded that the complaint of Mr. Vilven against Air Canada and the complaints of Mr. Kelly against Air Canada and ACPA have not been substantiated and are therefore dismissed. The Tribunal finds that age 60 is the normal age of retirement, within s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, for persons working in positions similar to the positions of the complainants. As such the mandatory retirement policy of Air Canada does not constitute a discriminatory practice under the CHRA. The Tribunal also finds that s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA does not contravene s. 15(1) of the Charter.\nIII. FACTS A. Mr. Vilven [8] Mr. Vilven was hired as a Pilot in Training by Air Canada on May 26, 1986. He was qualified as a Second Officer on a B-727 aircraft on September 11, 1987. Under the collective agreement, pilots use their seniority rights for professional advancement, which includes the aircraft that they will fly, the status that they will hold (Captain, First Officers or Relief Pilots) and the base from which they will fly.\n[9] Mr. Vilven used the seniority that he accrued during his tenure at Air Canada to move from being a First Officer on a B-727 aircraft, to eventually becoming a First Officer on an A340 based in Vancouver, effective August 1, 2000. Mr. Vilven chose not to become a pilot in command of an aircraft, but instead to use his seniority to remain a pilot on an A340 and to obtain a base in Vancouver where he could be near his family.\n[10] Mr. Vilven's last flight with Air Canada took place on August 24, 2003, just short of his 60th birthday, en route from Seoul to Vancouver, piloting an A340.\n[11] Under the terms of the Pension Plan in effect on September 1, 2003, Mr. Vilven was credited with 17.3334 years of allowable service with Air Canada. He was also credited with 5.5833 years pre-employment military service, for a total of 22.9167 allowable years of service for purposes of calculating his pension. Under the pension option he selected, Mr. Vilven now receives a pension payment of $6,094.04 per month until the age of 65 and of $5,534.33 after age 65 until his death.\n[12] Since the termination of his employment with Air Canada, Mr. Vilven has continued to pursue his flying career. He flew with Flair Airlines from April 2005, until May 2006. He holds a valid airline transport pilot's licence with the highest category and standing of instrument rating. It is valid to December 1, 2007. Mr. Vilven ceased flying for Flair Airlines in order to prepare for the hearing in this matter.\nB. Mr. Kelly [13] Mr. Kelly was hired by Air Canada on September 11, 1972, as a DC-8 Second Officer. He flew a number of aircraft in various positions until he was promoted to Captain on January 16, 1992. Mr. Kelly used his seniority within Air Canada to advance from being pilot in command on a B-727 to being pilot in command on an A340.\n[14] Mr. Kelly's last flight with Air Canada took place just short of his 60th birthday, on April 30, 2005, en route from Hong Kong to Toronto piloting an A340-500.\n[15] Under the terms of the Pension Plan in effect on May 1, 2005, Mr. Kelly was credited with 32.6667 years of allowable service with Air Canada for purposes of calculating his pension. Under the pension option he selected, Mr. Kelly now receives a pension payment of $10,233.96 per month until the age of 65 and of $9,477.56 after age 65 until his death.\n[16] Following his termination from Air Canada, Mr. Kelly has continued to pursue an active aviation career, and has continuously held a valid air transport pilot's licence with Category 1 Medical Certification.\n[17] In 2005, he flew as a contract First Officer on a B757\/767 aircraft with Skyservice Airlines to Europe and the Caribbean. He continues to fly as a contract Captain with Skyservice on B757 equipment on international flights.\n[18] Mr. Kelly's most recent Category 1 Medical (No Waivers) was obtained on October 11, 2006. His most recent Licence and Instrument Rating Renewal was obtained on November 16, 2006 at an Air Canada B767 simulator in Toronto.\nC. Pilot Careers at Air Canada [19] Air Canada is a major international and interline carrier, flying domestic flights in Canada to several continents and regularly operating flights to 33 foreign states (including the United States).\n[20] Air Canada offers the highest paying pilots jobs in Canada, with the best benefits and large amounts of interesting and lucrative long haul international flying. Its fleet has the largest, technologically-advanced aircraft in Canada, which pilots strive to fly. Flying for Air Canada is seen by many pilots as the best job for a commercial airline pilot in Canada. The number of pilot jobs at Air Canada has remained relatively stable between 2,500 and 3,000 for a number of years. The number of applicants for pilot jobs at Air Canada far exceeds the number of positions available.\n[21] Pilots at Air Canada have been represented by ACPA since November 1995. Prior to that time, they were represented by the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association from 1945. Most of the terms and conditions of pilots' employment at Air Canada are set by the collective agreement between ACPA and Air Canada.\nD. The Pension Plan [22] Air Canada pilots are covered by a very generous pension plan. It has two parts: the first is the Registered Retirement Pension Plan governed by the Income Tax Act and the federal Pension Benefits Standards Act; the second is the Supplemental Pension Plan. It provides pensions higher than the maximum permitted by the Income Tax Act. These supplemental pensions are funded by payments from Air Canada's general revenues. The pension plan benefits are part of the compensation package negotiated on behalf of Air Canada pilots by ACPA.\nE. Seniority [23] Seniority is very important to Air Canada pilots. Many important elements of a pilot's career are bid upon and awarded based on seniority. Thus, seniority dictates the pilot's status (i.e. Captain, First Officer or Relief Pilot), income, the base from which the pilot flies, the choice of schedules between pilots in the same positions, priority for vacations and protection against layoff. The career progression of a pilot and the salary that he or she earns is very much tied to seniority.\nF. The Regulation of the Airline Industry [24] Canada has no maximum licensing age for airline pilots. To be licensed in Canada, pilots must successfully pass a medical examination approved by Transport Canada. Pilots under the age of 40 must undergo a medical examination once a year. Pilots over the age of 40 must undergo a medical examination twice a year.\n[25] Air Canada is subject to the standards and recommended practices developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) because Canada is a signatory (i.e. a Contracting State) to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). ICAO is a United Nations organization charged with fostering civil aviation safety and the development of world-wide standards for licensing pilots.\n[26] ICAO has developed and adopted both standards and recommended practices for the maximum age of pilots flying commercial aircraft internationally. Age 60 was the maximum age for a pilot in command under the ICAO standards in effect at the time of Mr. Kelly's retirement. The ICAO standards in effect at the time of Mr. Vilven's retirement recommended, but did not require, that pilots acting as co-pilots on international flights not fly past their 60th birthday.\n[27] A contracting state is free to adopt a maximum age for pilots that is lower than the ICAO standard. However, such lower maximum age will only apply to pilots licensed by the contracting state. It will not apply to foreign pilots from ICAO members who need only comply with the ICAO maximum age to fly into the contracting state.\n[28] In March of 2006, ICAO passed an amendment to its maximum age standard for pilots. This new ICAO standard, which became effective on November 23, 2006, establishes 65 as the maximum age for pilots. It also establishes a standard that if one member of a multi-pilot flight crew is over 60, the other must be under 60. ICAO also recommends that First Officers cease international commercial flying at age 65.\nIV. THE ISSUES\nwhere does the burden of proof lie under s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA? To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, do the complainants have to show that they have not reached the normal age of retirement within s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA? Or is the burden on the respondents to show that age 60 is the normal age of retirement for s. 15(1)(c) purposes? if the onus is not on the complainants to establish the normal age of retirement, have they otherwise established a prima facie case of discrimination based on age? if so, have the respondents demonstrated that age 60 is the normal age of retirement for pilots working in similar positions to the position of the complainants so that s.15(1)(c) applies? if s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA does apply, does s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA contravene s. 15(1) of the Charter. If so, is s. 15(1)(c) justified under s. 1 of the Charter? if s. 15(1)(c) contravenes the Charter, is the mandatory retirement age of 60 a bona fide occupational requirement (BF0R) under ss. 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA?\n[29] In addressing these issues, the Tribunal has considered the evidence as it was at September 1, 2003, the date when Mr. Vilven's employment was terminated. And for Mr. Kelly, May 1, 2005, the date when he was terminated. The reason for this is that the respondents should be accountable only for decisions made on the basis of the facts that existed when the alleged discriminatory acts occurred.\nA. Who has the onus? [30] In Ontario Human Rights Commission et al v. The Borough of Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Subsequently, in Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, the Court clarified that a prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient for a decision in favour of the complainant, in the absence of a reasonable answer from the respondent. Once a prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable explanation.\n[31] In Stevenson v. Air Canada [1984] 2 F.C. 691, which involved a challenge to s. 14(c) [now s. 15(1)(c)] under the Canadian Bill of Rights, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that s. 14(c) circumscribed or limited the protection provided under the CHRA. Only those who have not reached the normal age of retirement can complain about the termination of their employment on the basis of age.\n[32] Nowhere in Stevenson does the Court discuss the burden of proof with respect to establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Indeed, the terms prima facie and burden of proof are not used at all in the decision. This is understandable because the complaint had been dismissed by the Commission so that the Court was not called upon to review the burden of proof as it related to the prima facie case.\n[33] Moreover, Stevenson pre-dates the Supreme Court's 1985 decision in O'Malley. In O'Malley, the Court found fault with the Ontario Board of Inquiry for requiring the Commission and the complainant to establish that the employer had not acted reasonably in all the circumstances of the case. That burden, it was said, must fall squarely on the shoulders of the employer since it is the employer who will be in possession of the necessary information to show undue hardship and the employee will rarely be in a position to show its absence. The Court stated that the assignment of the burden of proof to the appropriate party is as essential element of the process.\n[34] The importance of following the prima facie test set out in Etobicoke and O'Malley, and respecting the shifting burdens of proof has been underscored in recent Federal Court of Appeal decisions (Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, para. 18; Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2005 FCA 154, para. 26).\n[35] Indeed, Mr. Vilven testified during the hearing that he experienced considerable difficulty in attempting to obtain information about the ages of retirement and the mandatory retirement policies in other airlines in Canada and around the world. He stated that when he called and explained the reasons for his request, there was often resistance on the part of officials from other airlines to providing him with the information he requested. Air Canada, on the other hand, with some effort, was able to obtain a considerable amount of data regarding the retirement policies and ages of airlines in Canada and around the world.\n[36] It could be argued, as did the respondents, that a textual analysis of s. 15 of the CHRA comparing ss. 15(1)(a) and 15 (1)(c) of the CHRA, would support the conclusion that the burden should be on the complainants. Where the employer is to bear the burden in s. 15, it is expressly stated.\n[37] Section 15(1)(c) is ambiguous as to the assignment of the burden. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that ambiguities in the CHRA must be interpreted by the Tribunal in a manner that furthers, rather than frustrates, the Act's objectives. (Bell Canada v. C.T.E.A., [2003] 1 S.C.R. 884, para. 26; C.H.R.C. v Canadian Airlines International Ltd., [2006] 1 S.C.R. 3). The chief objective of the CHRA is the promotion of equal opportunity unhindered by discriminatory practices (s. 2). It is a scheme for identifying and remedying discrimination.\n[38] In light of the disadvantage that complainants generally have accessing informational and financial resources, assigning complainants the onus of demonstrating that they were not retired in accordance with the normal age for similar positions would frustrate the goal of identifying the presence of discrimination - or for that matter, its absence. It is certainly not the construction of the CHRA that best ensures the attainment of its objects. (C.N.R. v C.H.R.C. [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at p. 1134.)\n[39] The goal of determining whether discrimination occurred is best ensured by assigning respondent-employers the onus of demonstrating that the complainants were retired in accordance with the normal age for similar positions.\nB. Have the complainants and the Commission established a Prima Facie case of discrimination under ss. 7, 9 and 10 of the CHRA? [40] Section 7 of the Act stipulates that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Age is one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination mentioned in s. 3 of the Act.\n[41] As stated in the Joint Statement of Facts, the sole reason for the complainants' termination was the application of the mandatory retirement age provisions. At Air Canada, when a Captain or a First Officer reaches the age of 60, his\/her employment is terminated; the pilot must then retire. The termination of the complainants' employment with Air Canada on the basis of the mandatory retirement policy is sufficient evidence to conclude that the complainants have established a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 7 of the Act.\n[42] Section 9 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employee organization, on a prohibited ground, to act in a way that would deprive an individual of an employment opportunity, or limit employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect the status of the individual. ACPA agreed to the inclusion of the mandatory retirement provisions in the Air Canada Pension Plan, which is incorporated by reference into the collective agreement. Mandatory retirement adversely affected Mr. Kelly's employment status. Therefore, a prima facie case of discrimination has been established with respect to Mr. Kelly's s. 9 complaint against ACPA.\n[43] Under s. 10(b) of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for an employer or an employee organization to enter into an agreement affecting any matter relating to employment that deprives an individual of any employment opportunity on a prohibited ground. ACPA and Air Canada entered into an agreement with respect to mandatory retirement which affected the employment of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Vilven. Accordingly, a prima facie case has also been established with respect to the s. 10 complaints.\nC. Have the respondents demonstrated that age 60 is the normal age of retirement within s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA? [44] The term normal age of retirement in s. 15(1)(c) is identified in relation to the term employees working in positions similar to the position of the individual who filed the complaint. This raises the following two questions:\nWhat is the proper comparator group to identify the positions that are similar to that occupied by the complainants? What is the normal age of retirement?\n(i) The Proper Comparator Group [45] Air Canada argued that the proper comparator group under s. 15(1)(c) is pilots flying internationally for carriers such as Air Canada, or legacy carriers. Air Canada would define legacy carriers as long-established, major international carriers that rely heavily on international flight in their business models. Legacy carriers are often the flag carrier for the country in which they are based.\n[46] Air Canada maintained that it is the only legacy carrier in Canada. All of the other Canadian carriers operate substantially fewer aircraft than Air Canada and the nature of their operations would not qualify them as legacy carriers. Therefore, Air Canada argued that the comparison has to be made to pilot positions in the other major international carriers around the world.\n[47] ACPA took a somewhat different tack, namely, that the selection of the appropriate comparator group should be one that shares similar terms and conditions of employment with those of Air Canada pilots. ACPA also argued that the comparison must be limited to other Canadian air carriers since s. 2 of the CHRA limits its application to matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament.\n[48] The Commission argued that neither of the comparator groups suggested by the respondents is appropriate. It was impossible to define what the normal age of retirement is because of the wide range of ages at which pilots retire both in Canada and internationally.\n[49] The Fly Past 60 Coalition argued that there was no basis in the statute for interpreting similar positions to mean positions that have similar work conditions, or positions within legacy carriers. The Coalition argued that a similar position to that of the complainants is the position of an airline pilot, be it a pilot in command (Captain), or a co-pilot (First Officer), with airlines that fly similar (but not necessarily identical) aircraft to those of Air Canada.\n[50] The Tribunal rejects ACPA's argument that the comparison should be limited to individuals occupying positions with airlines within the Canadian federal jurisdiction. Section 15(1)(c) does not purport to regulate individuals or air carriers beyond its legislative scope. It simply invites a comparison to those in similar positions.\n[51] Further, there are good reasons not to limit the comparison to positions within Canada. As the Tribunal noted in Campbell v. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602 (C.H.R.T.), the danger of a comparison of positions within Canada alone is that it would result in Air Canada setting the industrial norm for the normal age of retirement. This would mean that Air Canada could effectively determine the application of s. 15(1)(c).\n[52] The Tribunal agrees with the Coalition that there should be no differentiation between Captains and First Officers. There was substantial agreement among the witnesses who discussed the two positions that, although the Captain, as pilot in command, has ultimate responsibility for the safety of the aircraft, the positions are otherwise very similar.\n[53] In the Tribunal's view, the best approach to determining the appropriate comparator group is to characterize the essential feature of the position. The complainants' evidence established that the essential feature of their position was that they flew on regularly scheduled international flights on wide-bodied aircraft, to many international destinations, with a major international airline. A major international airline is an airline that is often the dominant carrier in the country, employing a significant number of pilots and where regularly scheduled international flights make up a significant portion of its operations.\n[54] It was clear from the complainants' evidence that the prestige and status that came with working for a major international airline, whether that is called a legacy airline or a flag carrier or any other name, was an essential feature of the position.\n[55] From this, the Tribunal has concluded that the appropriate comparator group i.e. employees working in positions similar to the position of the complainants', is pilots who fly with regularly scheduled, international flights with a major international airlines.\n(ii) What is the normal age of retirement? [56] There are two approaches that the Tribunal can look to in order to answer this question: the normative approach and the empirical approach. The normative approach is suggested by the French version of s. 15(1)(c) which makes reference to the application of a rule in force for this type of job. It reads: Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires le fait de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi d'une personne en appliquant la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d'emploi.\n[57] This normative approach asks one to search for the existence of a rule governing the maximum age of retirement in the airline industry. In the Tribunal's opinion, the ICAO maximum age provision qualifies as such a rule or standard because it governs the same community of international carriers that the Tribunal has chosen as comparators to determine positions similar to the complainants' position.\n[58] In September of 2003 and May of 2005, the ICAO standard for pilots in command required retirement at age 60. ICAO recommended, but did not require the retirement of First Officers at age 60.\n[59] The empirical approach leads to a consideration of the statistical evidence presented at the hearing relating to the retirement ages for both commercial airline pilots in Canada and foreign commercial pilots.\n[60] Air Canada is the only major international carrier in Canada where pilots fly on regularly scheduled international flights. Although Jazz is the second largest carrier in Canada, it operates flights solely within Canada and the United States. It is a regional carrier, not a major international carrier.\n[61] None of the other 6 Canadian airlines could be considered to be major international carriers. Skyservice, Air Transat, Harmony, Canjet and Zoom are charter airlines and WestJet is a low-cost carrier that does only limited international flights. Combined, these airlines employ only 885 pilots as compared to almost 3,000 pilots employed by Air Canada.\n[62] Having concluded that the appropriate comparator group is major international airlines, these Canadian carriers fall outside of that group and therefore, cannot be used for the purpose of determining what the normal age of retirement is for positions similar to that of the complainants.\n[63] The parties produced as part of their Joint Statement of Facts, a Schedule that included 22 foreign international carriers that have regularly scheduled international flights. However, complete data was not available for 12 of these airlines.\n[64] The total number of pilot positions in the major international airlines for which there was complete data was 25,308 in 2003. In 2003, when Mr. Vilven retired, 80% of those positions required mandatory retirement at age 60 or younger.\n[65] The parties agreed that the total number of pilots employed by these airlines has not changed substantially over the years. Therefore, we can assume that there were also roughly 25,308 pilots employed by the major international airlines outside of Canada (for which there was complete data) in 2005, when Mr. Kelly retired.\n[66] Between 2003 and the end of 2006, only two of the major international airlines requiring mandatory retirement at age 60 or younger, increased their age of mandatory retirement to 63 and 65. These changes occurred in November 2006 following the changes in the ICAO standards in that same month.\n[67] There was no evidence to indicate that prior to 2006, there were any changes to the mandatory retirement policies of any of the other major international airlines that had mandatory retirement policies of age 60 or younger.\n[68] It is reasonable to conclude that in 2005, when Mr. Kelly retired, retirement at age 60 or younger was required in 80% of the major international airlines for which data was available.\n[69] This data reveal that age 60 was the mandatory retirement age for the majority of positions that were similar to that of the complainants at the time of their retirements in 2003 and 2005. This was the normal age of retirement for the purposes of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA. The result is that Air Canada's mandatory retirement age policy is not a discriminatory practice under the CHRA.\nD. Does s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA Contravene the Charter? [70] In its Notice of Constitutional Question, the Coalition raised the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, arguing that s. 15(1)(c) contravened s. 15 of the Charter and is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter. If this is so, the Coalition argued, then the Tribunal should refuse to apply s. 15(1)(c), which would deprive the respondents of this defense to the complainants' prima facie case. The respondents did not dispute the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to deal with the constitutionality of s. 15(1)(c). It should be pointed out that the Tribunal's decision on this question is limited to the facts of this case.\n(i) Previous Challenges to Human Rights Legislation that Permits Mandatory Retirement. [71] The present case constitutes the first time that a Charter challenge to s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA has reached the Tribunal stage. There are, however, two decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada that examined the constitutionality of similar provisions in provincial human rights legislation. Those are McKinney v. University of Guelph [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, and Harrison v. University of British Columbia [1990] 3 S.C.R. 451.\n[72] McKinney examined the constitutionality of s. 9(a) of the Ontario Human Rights Code. It was released at the same time as Harrison, which dealt with the constitutionality of s. 8(1) of the British Columbia Human Rights Act. Both provisions permitted mandatory retirement. In Harrison, a majority of the Supreme Court declared that, for the reasons provided in McKinney, the constitutionality of s. 8(1), which limited age protection to those between the ages of 45 and 65, was unimpeachable.\n[73] In McKinney, the appellants who were university professors at the University of Guelph, were forced to retire at age 65 pursuant to the University's mandatory retirement policy. In their appeal, the appellants posed two separate constitutional questions to the Supreme Court of Canada:\ndid the University's mandatory retirement policy violate the Charter; and, did s. 9(a) of the Ontario Human Rights Code violate the Charter by sheltering the mandatory retirement policy?\n[74] As to the university's mandatory retirement policy, the majority of the Court found that the Charter does not apply to universities because a university is not part of government. But, assuming the Charter did apply, the policy contravened s. 15(1) of the Charter. However, it was justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[75] The Court then turned its attention to the second constitutional question that was posed to it: did s. 9(a) of the Ontario Human Rights Code violate the Charter? It is this second analysis involving the constitutionality of s. 9(a) of the Code that is relevant to the case before the Tribunal.\n[76] Section 9(a) of the Code limited the protection of the Code to those between the ages of 18 to 65. The majority held that this provision violated the right to equality under the Charter since it permitted the forced retirement of employees at age 65, but was constitutionally valid under s. 1 of the Charter.\n[77] Although very differently worded, s. 9(a) of the Ontario Code (which has since been repealed) and s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA are comparable: both are permissive, both exempt mandatory retirement policies from conduct that would otherwise be considered to constitute prima facie discrimination.\n(ii) Does Section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA Contravene s. 15(1) of the Charter? [78] In McKinney, the majority found that s. 9(a) of the Ontario Code violated s. 15 of the Charter because it deprived the claimants of a benefit under the Code on the basis of their age, a ground specifically enumerated in the Charter. Although that concluded his analysis of s. 15, Justice La Forest noted that, for a variety of reasons, age distinctions are not viewed in the same light as distinctions based on other prohibited grounds such as race or gender.\n[79] He stated that, while we must guard against laws having an unnecessary deleterious impact on the aged based on inaccurate assumptions about the effects of age on ability, there are often solid grounds for importing benefits on one age group over another in the development of broad social schemes and in allocating benefits. (McKinney at p. 297).\n[80] At the time that McKinney was decided, however, such considerations regarding the nature and scope of the rights under s. 15 were dealt with under s. 1 of the Charter. Since McKinney was decided in 1990, the law regarding the analysis of discrimination claims under s. 15 of the Charter has evolved. This evolution can be seen in two subsequent decisions in which the Supreme Court set out the governing standard for s .15(1) of the Charter: Law v. Canada [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 and Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General) [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429.\n[81] Considerations regarding the nature and scope of s. 15 have been addressed within the analysis of that section by focusing on the purpose of that provision. The purpose of s. 15 is to assure that human dignity is not harmed by arbitrary distinctions created by the law or government action.\n[82] In Law, the Court stated that the overriding concern with protecting and promoting human dignity infuses all elements of the discrimination analysis. Human dignity is harmed when individuals are marginalized, ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced when laws recognize the full place of all individuals and groups within Canadian society (Law, supra, at para 53).\n[83] Law involved an application by Nancy Law, a surviving spouse, for survivor benefits under the Canada Pension Plan. Under the eligibility criteria, able-bodied surviving spouses without dependent children and who were under 35 at the death of their spouse, were not eligible for survivor benefits. Ms. Law was 30 at the relevant time. She challenged the age criterion, claiming that it violated s. 15 of the Charter.\n[84] The Court acknowledged that, like other surviving spouses of all ages, Ms. Law might be vulnerable, economically and otherwise, immediately following the death of a spouse. However, the Court stated that the purpose of the impugned CPP provisions was not to remedy the immediate financial need experienced by widows and widowers, but rather to enable older widows and widowers to meet their basic needs during the longer term.\n[85] The Court held that younger widows were in a better position than widows who were over the age of 45 to find work and become financially secure again. The Court stated that although the law imposed a disadvantage on younger spouses, it was unlikely to be a substantive disadvantage, viewed in the long term. When the dual perspectives of long-term security and the greater opportunity of youth were considered, the Court stated the differential treatment did not reflect or promote the notion that younger widows were less capable or less deserving of concern, respect and consideration.\n[86] In Gosselin, the appellant challenged a provision of the Quebec Social Assistance scheme that provided that the base amount of social assistance payable to people under 30 was about 30 per cent less than the base amount payable to those 30 or older. Under the program, those under 30 could increase the base amount by participating in certain educational or work experience programs. Ms. Gosselin challenged the validity of the program under s.15 of the Charter claiming age discrimination.\n[87] The Court held that Ms. Gosselin had not established that the government treated her as less worthy than older welfare recipients, simply because it conditioned increased payment on her participation in programs designed to integrate her into the workforce and to promote her long-term self-sufficiency.\n[88] The Court stated that unlike race, religion, or gender, age is not strongly associated with discrimination and arbitrary denial of privilege. Age-based distinctions do not automatically evoke a context of pre-existing disadvantage suggesting discrimination and marginalization in the same way that other enumerated grounds might. Indeed, such distinctions are entirely reasonable and non-discriminatory provided they do not treat people as less worthy of respect or concern or contribute to negative stereotypes relating to age.\n[89] The question then is whether, as a result of the age-based distinction in s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA, the complainants' dignity was affronted or they experienced negative stereotyping relating to their age.\n[90] For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal finds that, although the provision deprives the complainants of the opportunity to challenge the mandatory retirement policy in their workplace, the loss of this opportunity does not violate their dignity or fail to recognize them as full and equal members of society.\n[91] In arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal has applied a purposive and contextual approach to the discrimination analysis, as suggested in Law. This approach focuses on three broad inquiries:\ndoes the impugned law draw a distinction between the claimant and others on the basis of personal characteristics; is the claimant subject to differential treatment on an enumerated or analogous ground; and does the differential treatment impose a burden which reflects or reinforces a negative disadvantage or stereotype; or has a negative effect on the individual's dignity or self-worth. (Law, p. 548-9). It is the third question that is central to this aspect of the Tribunal's inquiry.\nDoes the distinction created by s. 15(1)(c) contribute to or reinforce stereotyping or pre-existing disadvantage experienced by the complainants?\n[92] One of the most compelling factor favouring a conclusion that differential treatment imposed by legislation is discriminatory is pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability to stereotyping (Law, at para. 63). While it is clear that airline pilots, as pilots, do not constitute a group which suffers from negative stereotyping or pre-existing disadvantage, the more appropriate focus of the analysis here is whether the complainants, as members of the group of older workers whose employment has been forcibly terminated, are subject to pre-existing disadvantage or negative stereotyping.\n[93] The disadvantages suffered by older workers have been noted in the case law. For example, in McKinney, La Forest J. stated that barring specific skills, it is generally known that persons over 45 have more difficulty finding work than others. They do not have the flexibility of the young, a disadvantage often accentuated by the fact that the latter are frequently more recently trained in the more modern skills (at p. 299). Moreover, while social security and private pension schemes may afford some financial redress, many older people have need of additional income, a situation that is becoming apparent as people live longer (at p. 300).\n[94] In her dissenting reasons in McKinney, Wilson J. noted that there is a stereotype that older people are unproductive, inefficient, and lacking in competence. (at p. 413)\n[95] There was no indication that the complainants experienced these age-related disadvantages or negative stereotyping. On the contrary, the evidence was that as senior pilots, the complainants were fully up-to-date in the latest technology and skills required to fly some of the most sophisticated aircraft in a major international airline.\n[96] Very soon after their retirement from Air Canada, both were able to get work as pilots with other airlines that did not have mandatory retirement policies. Mr. Kelly testified that when he was returning his Security Pass to Air Canada following his last flight, he ran into a former colleague who offered him employment with Skyservice Airlines. He readily accepted the offer.\n[97] The acceptance of employment with Skyservice meant that Mr. Kelly was able to supplement the $124,000 income that he was receiving from his Air Canada pension with what he earned as a pilot with Skyservice. At $72,000 per annum, Mr. Vilven's retirement income was less at retirement than Mr. Kelly's because Mr. Vilven started work at Air Canada later. However, Mr. Vilven was able to supplement his pension income with the earnings he received working as a pilot with Flair Airlines.\nDoes s. 15(1)(c), in purpose or effect, have a negative impact on the complainants' dignity?\n[98] The purpose of s. 15(1)(c) is to strike a balance between the need for protection against age discrimination and the desirability of those in the workplace to bargain for and organize their own terms of employment (Campbell v. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602 (C.H.R.RT.) at para. 5483). The provision does not mandate mandatory retirement; it is permissive and allows parties like Air Canada and ACPA to negotiate contracts that include a mandatory retirement provision.\n[99] Mandatory retirement policies are usually in place where the employees have considerable bargaining power, most commonly through trade union representation. Indeed the overwhelming majority of mandatory retirement policies are found in unionized workplaces. Labour economists Jonathan Kesselman and Lorne Carmichael, testifying on behalf of the Commission and Air Canada respectively, agreed that jobs in unionized workplaces are considered to be the good jobs, that is, jobs that pay well, have a high degree of security, operate with a strong seniority system and have good pension plans.\n[100] In the present case, ACPA and Air Canada agreed to retirement at age 60 in exchange for the rich compensation package, including a pension plan that put Air Canada pilots in an elite group of pensioners. Mr. Harlan Clarke, Manager Labour Relations Flight Operations at Air Canada, identified an important characteristic of a mandatory retirement policy, namely, that employees, including Air Canada pilots, are not faced with the indignity of retiring because they have been found to be incapable of performing the requirements of their position or because of failing health. Rather, retirement at age 60 for pilots is the fully understood and anticipated conclusion of a prestigious and financially rewarding career.\n[101] The complainants testified that they were fully aware, when they began their employment with Air Canada, that they would be required to retire at age 60. They testified that becoming a pilot with Air Canada was every pilot's goal; the pay was excellent, the work was interesting and there was significant prestige associated with the position. However, they also knew that this would not last indefinitely and that all pilots at Air Canada were required to retire at age 60.\n[102] Nevertheless, when they reached age 60 and had to retire from Air Canada, the complainants experienced a blow to their self-esteem. Both complainants testified that they missed the prestige and exciting work they had as Air Canada pilots. Mr. Kelly testified that he missed the friendships that he had at Air Canada.\n[103] There is no doubt that the termination of employment has a profound impact on the self-worth and dignity of an individual (Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, at p. 368). As difficult as that situation might be for the complainants, an assessment of the impact of the termination of their employment on the complainants' dignity must be viewed in the broader context of their careers.\n[104] The case law dealing with allegations of age discrimination under the Charter reflects the view that one should be careful about assessing the impact of age distinctions on human dignity based solely on isolated moments in time (Law, para. 102; Gosselin, at para 32, McKinney, at p. 297).\n[105] Professor Carmichael testified that age distinctions are viewed differently by most people than distinctions based on grounds such as gender and race. Unlike gender and race, we all become older with the passage of time. For that reason, young workers generally do not resent the fact that an older employee working beside them is paid more than them as long as they believe that they will be treated the same when they reach a similar stage in their career. Age-based distinctions are seen as fair and do not offend human dignity because we can all expect to reap the benefits and bear the burden of the distinctions at some point in our lives.\n[106] According to Professor Carmichael, the complainants, throughout their careers at Air Canada, reaped the benefit of the mandatory retirement rule that their union had negotiated on their behalf. As a result of the departure of 60-year old pilots from Air Canada, the complainants were able to progress through their careers at a more rapid pace.\n[107] In addition, the pilots' status, income, the base from which they flew, the choice of schedules and the pension plan benefits they received, among other things, were negotiated on the basis of the mandatory retirement provision. Having reaped the benefit of mandatory retirement, it should not be perceived as unfair to require the complainants to ultimately bear the burden of that policy.\n[108] The complainants may be unhappy about ending their rewarding careers as pilots with Air Canada. But that situation cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be seen in the context of a system that was designed to assign the responsibilities and benefits of being an Air Canada pilot over different stages in the pilots' careers. All pilots in Air Canada understand that they will share these benefits and burdens equally at the appropriate stages in their careers.\n[109] The denial of the right to challenge the final stage of that system - retirement at age 60 - as a result of s. 15(1)(c) does not communicate the message that the complainants are not valued as members of society, nor does it necessarily marginalize them. It simply reflects the view that it is not unfair to require the complainants to assume their final responsibility as Air Canada pilots. This message cannot reasonably be viewed as an affront to their dignity.\n[110] For these reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the complainants' right to equality under s. 15 of the Charter has not been violated by s. 15(1)(c) of the CHRA. Having come to this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider s. 1 of the Charter, or whether Air Canada's mandatory retirement policy is a bona fide occupational requirement under ss. 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the Act.\n[111] The complaints of Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly are dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis Date: August 17, 2007 Citation: 2007 CHRT 37\n[1] The Respondent, Marc Lemire, has made a motion for the adjournment sine die of the present proceedings, pending the determination by the Federal Court of several claims of public interest immunity made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, pursuant to s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (CEA).\n[2] On May 9 and 10, 2007, Mr. Lemire\u2019s legal counsel, Barbara Kulaszka, called two Commission employees to testify at the hearing into the complaint. Ms. Kulaszka had indicated that these individuals and one other witness, who has since testified, would be her last witnesses. Her case would then have been closed. The other parties had stated that they did not intend to adduce any additional evidence. The Tribunal had therefore already set dates for final argument.\n[3] During Ms. Kulaszka\u2019s questioning of the abovementioned Commission employees, the Commission objected numerous times to the disclosure of the information being sought, on the grounds of a specified public interest, pursuant to s. 37(1) of the CEA. In addition, subsequent to these hearing dates, the Commission invoked s. 37 in its objection to Mr. Lemire\u2019s request for the issuance of a subpoena (see my ruling in this regard, Warman v. Lemire, 2007 CHRT 21).\n[4] On May 17, 2007, Mr. Lemire filed a Notice of Application to the Federal Court, Court File no. T-860-07, for a determination of the Commission\u2019s claims of public interest immunity, in accordance with s. 37(3) of the CEA.\n[5] In making the present adjournment request, Mr. Lemire submits that it is the normal and expected procedure where a s. 37 objection has been made before a court, person or body other than a superior court, for that instance to adjourn its proceedings while the determination of the matter is before the superior court. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal pointed out in Re Attorney General of Canada et al. and Sander, 1994 CanLII 1658 at para. 84:\nThus, when an objection to disclosure under s. 37 is made at trial by the Crown in a court other than a superior court, the trial proceedings should be adjourned so the objection may be determined in a superior court.\n[6] The Court reiterated this point in R. v. Sander, 1995 CanLII 1229 at para. 29 (B.C.C.A.):\nWhere the trial is in Provincial Court, an application under s. 37 operates to interrupt the trial, to remove to another court the determination of an issue ordinarily determined by the trial judge.\n[7] Mr. Lemire points out that determinations by the superior court, made pursuant to s. 37 of the CEA, constitute separate and independent inquiries, not interlocutory appeals or reviews of the lower tribunal\u2019s ruling. He adds that the Tribunal in the present case did not make any ruling with respect to the Commission\u2019s s. 37 CEA claim other than to state that once the immunity is invoked, the matter was out of its hands. The question could only be further addressed by the Federal Court, on application.\n[8] It is well established that administrative tribunals are masters of their own proceedings and, as such, they possess significant discretion in ruling upon requests for adjournments. Tribunals such as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, which exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, must use their discretion in keeping with the principles of natural justice (Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at paras. 15-17).\n[9] I share the view expressed in Baltruweit and Leger v. Canadian National Railways Company , Ruling No. 1, CHRT File T527\/2299, (Nov. 26, 1999), that the Tribunal should not apply the three-stage test set out in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v. Canada [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311, when dealing with adjournment requests. The RJR-Macdonald test is suited to situations where a supervisory court is asked to stay the proceedings of a lower court or tribunal, pending an appeal or judicial review application. That is not the case with regard to the present motion.\n[10] The Commission and the Attorney General of Canada oppose the adjournment request. They point out that the information being withheld by the Commission relates to investigative and other actions that the Commission has taken pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). They contend that given the limitations of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutional matters, and the absence of any jurisdiction to inquire into the manner in which the Commission investigates complaints or discharges its mandate under the CHRA, the information being withheld by the Commission is not relevant to the issues of this case and is not required in order to adjudicate the complaint. The Commission also argues that this information constitutes a small amount of evidence in issue. On this latter point, I fail to see how the size or magnitude of the evidence should have any bearing on the question.\n[11] This is not the first time that the Commission and the Attorney General have raised the scope of the evidence as an issue. Similar objections were made at the early stages of the hearing and, after some debate, I ruled that evidence regarding the Commission\u2019s activities relating to s. 13 of the CHRA, is admissible for the purposes of challenging the constitutionality of this provision. The question of whether any of this evidence should be considered by the Tribunal in ultimately determining the constitutional issues of this case was deferred to final argument. All the parties have proceeded through this hearing based on this understanding. It should be noted, nonetheless, that the Commission and the Attorney General have, from time to time, reaffirmed their positions that this evidence is ultimately of no relevance. On these occasions, I have reiterated that debate on this question is reserved for final argument.\n[12] The Tribunal has a duty to conduct its proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedure allow (s. 48.9(1) CHRA). In my view, it would be unfair to Mr. Lemire and a denial of natural justice to require him to close his case when there is a possibility that the s. 37 application may be determined in his favour, thereby making potentially relevant evidence available to him. This is evidence that Mr. Lemire sought to introduce in a timely manner. Section 50 of the CHRA grants him a full and ample opportunity to present evidence at the inquiry. If it turns out that the s. 37 public interest immunity applies, the evidence at issue is inadmissible. But closing the Tribunal inquiry before the Federal Court has given its answer pre-judges the question of relevance and admissibility, and renders useless any relief that Mr. Lemire may obtain from that Court.\n[13] Any delay in the completion of this case is regrettable. I am convinced that all parties look forward with some earnest to a pronouncement on all of the issues before the Tribunal. Mr. Lemire points out that had the Commission invoked public interest immunity under the common law, instead of making an objection under s. 37 of the CEA, the Tribunal could have addressed the disclosure questions directly. Any challenges to the Tribunal\u2019s findings would have been dealt with through judicial review. David M. Paciocco makes this point in The Law of Evidence, Third Edition, (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2002) at 222, where he notes:\nPrior to the amendments [brought about by the Anti-Terrorism Act, 2001, S.C., c.41, s 43], courts found that section 37 had not displaced the common law. The amendments have not changed this. What this means is that it is still open to the Crown to object to disclosure under the common law. An objection under the common law will not trigger the section 37 process. Most importantly, although the section does not provide for provincial courts to hear an objection made under section 37, this does not preclude the provincial courts, either in the course of a preliminary inquiry or a trial, from hearing a claim for immunity under the common law. In fact, such a procedure is to be encouraged. This will save the inconvenience of adjourning the matter to be heard in the superior court of the province, as is required by the section.\n[14] The examples given by the author in this excerpt arise in the context of the criminal law. All of the jurisprudence relied upon by Mr. Lemire in his motion, in fact, relates to criminal trials. The Attorney General argued that these authorities are therefore distinguishable on this ground alone. However, neither the Attorney General nor the Commission produced any decisions (civil or criminal in nature) to counter the findings in those cases with regard to the practice of adjourning proceedings pending s. 37 determinations. Furthermore, I fail to see why deciding whether to adjourn a proceeding pending a determination by a superior court should depend on whether the trial at first instance is criminal or civil in nature. Section 37 makes no such distinction.\n[15] I am therefore granting the adjournment sine die being sought by Mr. Lemire. Had any of the parties indicated that they had any other evidence to adduce, aside from that which relates to the s. 37 objection, I would have continued the hearing pending the outcome of the Federal Court application, but that is not the case.\n[16] The parties should take note that if the delay engendered by the s. 37 application becomes prolonged, the public interest in an expeditious inquiry may require that the Tribunal re-visit its decision to defer making a definitive finding on the relevance of the evidence sought. Case management conference calls will therefore be conducted by the Tribunal on a regular basis to follow up on the progress of the s. 37 application before the Federal Court. The Tribunal expects the parties to cooperate and act with due diligence towards the hearing of the application.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION\nA. The Facts\nB. Legal Analysis\nII. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] On May 17, 2002, Maureen Tanzola (the complainant) filed a complaint under sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) against AZ Bus Tours Inc. (the respondent). The complainant alleges that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of sex in a matter related to employment. More specifically, she alleges that the respondent treated her in an adverse differential manner as compared to her male colleagues. She further claims that there were several incidents where Mr. Ron Roffey, the respondent's Operations Manager, harassed her because she was a woman. The complainant further asserts that the respondent transferred her to its Toronto division, a three hours commute from her home, and reduced her work hours, forcing her to resign.\n[2] The respondent denies the complainant's allegations.\nA. The Facts [3] The respondent is a charter bus company. It started its operation in 1998. Originally its main purpose was to transport passengers from Toronto to the Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario. Subsequently, it started to operate charter services to all points in Canada and the United States.\n[4] The respondent has two operating divisions for its charter service to the Casino Rama. The main office is in Toronto, where the majority of the respondent's bus fleet is parked. The respondent also has a small division in Orillia. Both divisions provide the same services to the same clients going to the same destination, the Casino Rama. The charter services that goes beyond Toronto and Orillia operates exclusively out of Toronto. Mr. Terry Barnett, the General Manager of the respondent at the time, testified that the scheduling of drivers in Toronto was done by dispatch, while the scheduling of drivers in Orillia was done by the supervisor of that division with the assistance of the Toronto dispatcher.\n[5] The complainant's husband, Tim Tanzola, was until 1999 the supervisor of the Orillia division. He was then replaced by John Westwood. John Westwood occupied the position of supervisor until 2003, when he was dismissed by the respondent. The Orillia supervisor reported to Mr. Ron Roffey, who answered to Mr. Terry Barnett, the General Manager. Mr. Barnett testified that neither Mr. Westwood, nor Mr. Roffey, would have had any authority over the decision to terminate the employment of an employee. That decision was his.\n[6] The complainant worked for the respondent as a bus driver from October 1997 to November 2001. Until 2001, she worked out of Orillia.\n[7] The complainant testified that things started to go badly for her at work during the year of 1999. I note that this corresponds with the period when her husband resigned his position as supervisor of the Orillia division.\n[8] During that year, the respondent instituted a safe driving bonus which was to be awarded to drivers who had an accident-free year. The amount of this bonus was $1,000.00. The complainant testified that she did not receive the bonus because, according to the respondent, she had been involved in an accident. She further testified that several male drivers, although they had also submitted accident reports, received the bonus. She identified three drivers, Jean-Guy Desmarais, John Westwood and her husband, Tim Tanzola, all of whom had received or been offered the bonus although they had been involved in accidents. In her documents, she referred to several other drivers who had also received the bonus in similar situations, but none were called as witnesses.\n[9] Although, the complainant may be convinced that she should have received her safe driving bonus, she has failed to establish how the respondent's decision not to award her the bonus is a discriminatory practice under the Act. Mr. Barnett testified that this bonus was discretionary and he was adamant that the reason why the complainant did not receive it was because she had been involved in a preventable accident and nothing else. The complainant has not been able to establish that this decision was made on the basis of sex and that other female drivers, for example, had also been denied the bonus.\n[10] Next, the complainant testified to an incident which occurred on July 3, 2000, when a bus she was driving broke down on its way to Orillia. She called the Toronto office and spoke to the dispatcher giving him directions to where the change-off bus should be brought. Ron Roffey brought the change-off bus. When he arrived at the location where the complainant was stranded with her bus, she testified that he started yelling at her and making disparaging remarks in front of the passengers. According to her, there had been some confusion in the direction the dispatcher had given Mr. Roffey and Mr. Roffey was blaming her for this. She testified that he told her: Your directions suck in front of the passengers. She further added that his rude behaviour brought her to tears and that she had had a difficult time regaining her composure and felt humiliated.\n[11] A week after this incident, a letter, which stated that she had been insubordinate to a superior, was placed in her personal file. No explanation of her insubordination was given at the hearing. She testified that after this incident, she told Mr. Barnett that in the future she would deal directly with him rather than going through Mr. Roffey.\n[12] The complainant testified that several former employees of the respondent could support her allegations that Mr. Roffey had made derogatory remarks about women, but none were called as witnesses. She testified that she personally had never heard Mr. Roffey make these remarks. Mr. Tanzola, the complainant's husband, told the Canadian Human Rights Commission's investigator during an interview held on March 29, 2005, that he couldn't honestly say that he heard Mr. Roffey say anything derogatory towards the complainant or other women. He added that he knew that his wife had had run ins with Mr. Roffey but added that lots of drivers had run ins with Ron - male or female. He was hard nose and had a disrespectful way of treating people. (The underlining is mine.) At the hearing, Mr. Tanzola again confirmed that he had not personally been witness to Mr. Roffey making these kinds of remarks.\n[13] The only evidence on this point was that of John Westwood, who testified that he had overheard Mr. Roffey making remarks of this kind during a phone conversation or when he was at the respondent's head office in Toronto. He did not elaborate on when these incidents had occurred or about their frequency, but added well, I just took it with a grain of salt from the person who is saying it, because I thought it was just terrible the way he handled himself in regards to men and women, not just women, you know, and I thought it's-to me it was degrading to hear a person in that position talk about employees like that. (The underlining is mine.)\n[14] It is impossible to draw any definite conclusion from this very scanty evidence. The fact that Mr. Roffey may have been a difficult manager to work with and that he may have been discourteous and rude in his dealings with his employees, male or female, is not sufficient to conclude that the respondent discriminated towards the complainant or other women employees on the basis of sex.\n[15] The complainant was on sick leave from December 2000 to March 2001. In March 2001, having no intention to return to work for the respondent, she submitted her resignation. However, she testified that Terry Barnett told her that she could return to work whenever she felt ready. She eventually returned to work in June 2001, as a part-time driver. According to Mr. Barnett, Mr. Westwood, the Orillia supervisor, would have been responsible for her rehiring.\n[16] The complainant testified to another incident which occurred on July 14, 2001, when she was required, by an Inspector of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, to have the bus she was driving inspected. The Inspector found a problem with the rear tires and ordered the bus out of service. She said that she then called the respondent's offices to inform her employer about the situation. She spoke with Terry Barnett who told her what to do. She testified to a conversation she had later with a certain Greg Larson, who at the time was a dispatcher with the respondent. She said that he had told her that Ron Roffey had made some remarks concerning this incident. Greg Larson having not been called as a witness, his alleged comments regarding remarks made by Ron Roffey constitutes hearsay and are not admissible in this particular case.\n[17] The complainant also commented on another incident which occurred on July 26, 2001. On that day Mr. Roffey asked her why she had crossed without coming to a complete stop, what she described as a dead railway track on Weston Road. She replied that the tracks were no longer in service and that the bus was empty. Mr. Roffey told her that all buses are required to stop at unguarded railway crossings and told her that she should consider the conversation as a verbal warning. The complainant's husband and Mr. Westwood testified that they never stopped at that crossing. Be that as it may, I cannot draw a conclusion of discrimination from this incident.\n[18] She testified that in August 2001, her supervisor, John Westwood, came to her home and told her that Mr. Roffey was not happy about him rehiring the complainant. According to her testimony, he told her that he had been directed by management to terminate her employment. When she asked him why, he told her that he did not know the reason. John Westwood testified that he personally did not want to fire the complainant but being 64 years old and his wife being very ill, he felt he had no choice but to go along with management.\n[19] At the time of the hearing the complainant's relationship with Mr. Westwood seemed to be excellent. Their relationship did not look so harmonious in 2001. During the fall of 2001, Mr. Westwood's rapport with the complainant seemed to deteriorate fast. At the hearing, the complainant and Mr. Westwood suggested that Mr. Westwood had been forced to take an antagonistic approach towards the complainant.\n[20] An example of the bad relationship between the two is demonstrated by a note dated October 18, 2001. On October 16, 2001, the complainant was required to participate in a driver's training course. According to the note, Mr. Westwood was very disappointed with the complainant's behaviour during this course. He indicated that she had acted in a very unprofessional manner and that he had received numerous comments about her attitude. Mr. Westwood told the complainant that he wanted to see improvement in her behaviour. Copies of this note were sent to Mr. Barnett and to Mr. Roffey. During the hearing, Mr. Westwood tried to soften his interpretation of this event. He basically explained that the complainant's attitude during this course had more to with her sense of humour than with what he had characterised as unprofessional conduct in his notes.\n[21] He also alleged that the note of October 24, 2001, and other notes pertaining to the complainant, had been written by the Toronto office and had been imposed on him. He supported this allegation by stating that it was not his practice to typewrite letters; he would normally write his notes by hand. Although this might be possible, it remains that Mr. Westwood signed the notes. Also, the nature of the information contained in them is not conducive to a conclusion that Mr. Westwood had no involvement whatsoever in drafting them. In his evidence, Mr. Barnett admitted that it could be that Mr. Westwood sent some handwritten notes to Toronto so that they could be typewritten, since the Orillia division did not have the necessary secretarial support.\n[22] The complainant testified that on October 21, 2001, she was told by the respondent's dispatcher that Terry Barnett had told him that her employment had been terminated. She said that she then phoned her supervisor, Mr. Westwood, to see if she had been fired. According to her evidence Mr. Westwood took such a fit. He told her to get on the bus and drive. She added that he was yelling and screaming at her. This reaction of Mr. Westwood is certainly not indicative of a good working relationship between the complainant and him.\n[23] Two days later, Terry Barnett told the complainant that there had been a mistake in identity between her and Barbara Tanzos, a co-worker, whose employment with the respondent had just been terminated. On October 24, 2001, Mr. Westwood wrote a memo to the complainant in which he apologised for the anger he had displayed on October 21, 2001. He also wrote: Maureen, you are a good driver and have helped the Orillia Division out in an emergency many times, for which I am grateful. But, you have a problem controlling your anger, which I have witnessed, and been the recipient of many times. In his note, he also referred to other incidents in which the complainant had been involved and asked for a written response from her.\n[24] The complainant never responded. She explained at the hearing that she did not answer because she felt that there was really nothing to answer. They were making this up and I figured to dignify that with an answer would give them some more of my supposed bad temper on paper so that they would include it in their paper trail.\n[25] On November 6, 2001, Mr. Westwood wrote back: due to the lack of a response from you...I have decided to take the following action. To this note was attached a memo to Mr. Roffey, with a copy sent to Mr. Barnett. In this memo, Mr. Westwood made the following statement: For approximately two years, I have had numerous conflicts with Maureen due to her anger and resentment of management personnel. Until recently, her driving career was untarnished. After serious consideration and a continued respectful relationship between the Orillia drivers and myself, I recommend a transfer for Maureen to Weston Road [Toronto], effective November 9th, 2001. The complainant testified that because of her transfer to the Toronto division, she now had a daily commute of three hours from her residence to her new place of work.\n[26] Regarding the complainant's transfer to the Toronto division, during her examination of Mr. Westwood, the complainant tried to have him admit that the reason for this decision was to give Ron Roffey the opportunity to terminate her employment. Mr. Westwood's first answer was at the time they thought they can give you full time at Weston Road. When pressed by the complainant who asked him: But in your belief you don't believe that Ron Roffey was legit in saying that he was going to give me full-time hours in Toronto; it was a way to get me away from you so that he could deal with it. Is that correct?, he answered hesitantly and not very convincingly I might add: That's quite possible. At the time it did seem...if that was the intention-I think his intention was what you just said, but I didn't believe that at the time.\n[27] At the hearing, Mr. Westwood testified that the numerous conflicts he was referring to in this note, were those with the management in Toronto and not necessarily conflicts that he had personally with the complainant. Throughout his testimony, Mr. Westwood's recollections of the events were for the most part vague and unclear. He also seemed to be very timid in his assessment of the complainant's attitude during the time when he was supervisor of the Orillia division, to the point of being apologetic. He put the blame for this situation solely on management, by which he meant Ron Roffey and Terry Barnett. It is important though to remember that Mr. Westwood had had his own problems with the respondent; problems which led to him losing his job. He had even started a legal action for wrongful dismissal against the respondent and had eventually signed a settlement agreement with them. He certainly had what we could characterise as an axe to grind with AZ Bus Tour since he felt that it had treated him unjustly. This certainly had an effect on his appreciation of the facts.\n[28] Although it might be true that Mr. Westwood might have been unenthusiastic in respect of certain decisions taken by management in regards to the complainant, he nevertheless signed the memos directed to her, which memos were written, as we have seen, with uncompromising words. He did not convince me that, at the time, he did not agree with the assessment these notes made of the complainant. I believe that he agreed that the complainant had an anger problem and that she was being resentful of management. He did testify that when he took over the role of supervisor of the Orillia division from Tim Tanzola this made things a bit awkward for the complainant. He added that at that particular time she was hoping that Tim would stay as supervisor and that she was hurt with her husband resigning from that position. He again stated that her relationship with Mr. Westwood, at the time, was rather awkward, but he testified that they eventually worked it out. It is possible that they have now worked things out, but that did not seem to be the case in 2001.\n[29] The complainant made reference to a memo written by Mr. Westwood which was circulated to the Orillia division drivers on November 2, 2001, regarding part time drivers going on rotating shifts. She testified that when her husband was the supervisor of the Orillia division there was never any rotating shift. She added that during that time [w]e worked out our specific shifts according to kind of mutual wants and likes and dislikes. Some liked to work afternoons, some liked to work days, and, as I stated, my husband and I split shifts, one worked days, one worked nights. She testified that John Westwood was well aware that by implementing this rotation, he was forcing her out of work. She explained they knew with my husband working days that I had to work nights or with him working nights I had to work days and if they rotated these shifts I wouldn't be able to any longer be employed at that company. Although, it is possible that this new organisation of the work rotation caused the complainant and her husband some inconvenience, I fail to see how it relates to the allegations of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is true that, as she testified, while her husband was supervisor, they had been able to establish a work routine which satisfied their family needs and that the changes which were being introduced jeopardised this but she has not convinced me that these changes were made solely for the purpose of discriminating against her.\n[30] The complainant's employment with the respondent ended on November 9, 2001.\nB. Legal Analysis [31] The present procedure is not a wrongful dismissal action. What I am concerned with is the allegation by the complainant that she was discriminated against on the ground of sex in a matter related to employment. I must answer that question by inquiring whether or not the respondent treated the complainant in an adverse differential manner as compared to her male colleagues or whether she has been harassed because of her sex.\n[32] It is clear that the complainant felt a lot of frustration during her employment with the respondent, at least from 1999 to November 9, 2001. It is also clear that she is convinced that she was treated unjustly by the respondent. But this is not sufficient to support the allegations that she is making that she has been discriminated against on the ground of sex contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[33] Section 7 makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ, or to continue to employ, an individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Sex is included amongst the prohibited grounds of discrimination enumerated in section 3 of the Act. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In contrast to complaints under section 7 of the Act, which relate to employer actions affecting specific, named individuals, section 10 of the Act addresses the discriminatory effect that employer policies or practices may have on an individual or a class of individuals. There is no evidence that would allow me to conclude that the respondent violated section 10 of the Act.\n[34] As regards to the section 7 complaint, the complainant alleges that in the course of her employment, the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of that section, by directly or indirectly differentiating adversely in relation to her, on a prohibited ground of discrimination, namely sex.\n[35] To be successful, complainants in human rights cases must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson's Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28.)\n[36] The complainant has not met this burden. It was never established that the respondent engaged in any form of discriminatory practice towards the complainant during the course of her employment. The evidence failed to establish that there existed at the respondent's place of business an inequality stemming from employment policies and practices and that the complainant herself had been discriminated upon on the basis of sex.\n[37] Nothing in the evidence establishes that the respondent's policies and practices stereotyped or prejudiced against female drivers. On the contrary, the evidence showed that both male and female employees were required to meet the same requirements and qualifications. The evidence did not establish that male drivers were treated more favourably than female drivers. The policies and practices of the respondent did not create any barriers for female employees to obtain and maintain the standard of work that male employers performed.\n[38] The complainant's allegations do not establish a link between the way she claims that she was treated and the fact that she was a woman. In order to proceed to further analysis, I would have to be satisfied that the complainant had met her first hurdle and that she had established a prima facie case of discrimination. The complainant has not met this burden.\n[39] The purpose of the Act is not to punish what a complainant might feel is wrongdoing on the part of his or her employer, but to prevent discrimination. There is no evidence of discrimination in this case.\nII.

Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent has made a motion requesting an adjournment of the re-hearing into a portion of the complaint.\n[2] On December 3, 2004, the Tribunal that originally heard the evidence regarding the complaint in this case issued a decision finding that the allegations of racial discrimination in the Respondent's job competition process were substantiated (Brooks v. Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 2004 CHRT 36). The Respondent filed an application for judicial review by the Federal Court of the Tribunal's decision.\n[3] The Tribunal also concluded in its decision that the Complainant would not have obtained an indeterminate position, even if the competition had been properly conducted. The impact of this finding was that the Complainant was denied his claim for instatement in the position he had applied for and any resulting lost wages. Consequently, the Complainant also applied for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision, but solely with regard to this particular finding.\n[4] On October 18, 2006, Justice Michael A. Kelen rendered his judgment dismissing the Respondent's application for judicial review but allowing the Complainant's (Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks, 2006 FC 1244). The Court held that the Tribunal had applied the wrong legal test in finding that the Complainant would not have obtained a permanent position in the absence of discrimination. The Court, therefore, set aside this finding and referred the matter back to the Tribunal for re-determination by a differently constituted panel, based on the record already before the Tribunal. The Court also directed that the parties be given the opportunity to make representations to the Tribunal on the issue. Accordingly, the Tribunal recently informed the parties that a date (probably in the months of April or May 2007), will be selected for this re-hearing, which is not expected to last for more than one day.\n[5] On November 17, 2006, the Respondent appealed the Federal Court's judgment to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Respondent has now made a motion to the Tribunal requesting that the re-hearing be adjourned pending the disposition of the appeal by the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[6] According to Section 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railways [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para. 17). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n[7] The Respondent has not persuaded me that any natural justice concerns of this sort are present in this case.\n[8] The Respondent has raised the possibility that the Federal Court of Appeal may overturn the decisions of the Federal Court and the Tribunal, in whole or in part, with the possible result that there will be a finding that discrimination never took place. If, in the meantime, the Tribunal has re-heard the matter sent back for re-determination by the Federal Court, any resulting decisions would be rendered null and void. The time and effort expended by the parties in this process will have been for naught, particularly if, as the Respondent suggests in its written submissions, the assumption should be that the Tribunal will arrive at the same conclusion [after the re-hearing] as it did earlier. This situation, it is argued, would bring the administration of justice into serious disrepute.\n[9] But why should any such assumptions be made? It is equally possible that the differently constituted Tribunal panel will arrive at another conclusion than the previous panel and that the Federal Court of Appeal will uphold the decision of Federal Court, in which case, if the present adjournment is granted, the re-hearing process will have been postponed unnecessarily for months or perhaps years. The process will have to start up again at that point and the ultimate resolution of the complaint will be even further delayed. This would hardly constitute an expeditious conduct of Tribunal proceedings.\n[10] There is no way to predict what the final outcome of the proceedings in this case will be. However, in order for the Respondent to obtain an adjournment, it must establish that allowing the proceedings to follow their normal course, which includes following through with Justice Kelen's order for a re-hearing, will result in a denial to the Respondent of natural justice. The Respondent has failed to establish that any such prejudice would necessarily come to it.\n[11] The Respondent's motion is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

CONCLUSION 21\nI. BACKGROUND [1] Sandra Graham, the complainant in this matter, has worked for Canada Post Corporation (CPC) since 1977 and has worked in various positions at the Winnipeg Mail Processing Plant (WMPP). On June 4, 2001, she assumed the position of superintendent in the Urban Transportation Services Unit (UTS) on an acting basis. Her substantive position at that time was supervisor in UTS. Ms. Graham did so in order that the superintendent, Dave Smook could temporarily leave his position to represent management in a joint initiative of CPC\/CUPW known as the Appendix AA project.\n[2] When Ms. Graham took over as acting superintendent, WMPP was about to launch the Appendix `AA' project, which involved significant changes to CPC's parcel pickup\/delivery service. As acting superintendent in UTS, she had a very large responsibility for the implementation of the project.\n[3] On May 21, 2002, Ms. Graham did not go to work, and remained absent until November 2005, when she returned to full time work. She claimed that she was totally committed to the project and was determined to see it successfully completed. But she said, the stress, the long hours and lack of management support caused her to burn out. She became ill and could no longer work.\n[4] On September 12, 2003, during the time she was off work, Ms. Graham filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Her complaint followed some months after she had asked a co-worker at CPC to intercede on her behalf with senior CPC management to try and resolve the difficulties she was having with her manager because of her absence.\nII. MS. GRAHAM'S ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION [5] In her complaint, Ms. Graham alleged that:\nCPC had discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her temporary disability; CPC treated her in an adverse differential manner by failing to accommodate her disability; both contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). CPC terminated her status as acting superintendent because of her disability, but she did not specify which sections of the CHRA were contravened; and in her Statement of Particulars filed for the Tribunal hearing, Ms. Graham added another allegation, namely, that her disability and her inability to work was caused by CPC's inability to provide sufficient staff and support for her to carry on her duties.\n[6] As a preliminary question, the Tribunal has also addressed whether there was evidence before the Tribunal upon which it could reasonably conclude that Ms. Graham had a disability at the relevant time.\n[7] Ms. Graham would not produce any medical documentation outlining the nature of her disability as part of her pre-hearing disclosure obligations and chose not to present such medical evidence at the hearing. Throughout, she has taken the position that this information was confidential and should not be given to CPC. It was left to the Tribunal, in the absence of such evidence, to determine whether Ms. Graham had an illness that prevented her from working during the relevant period and whether this illness constituted a disability under the CHRA.\n[8] Ms. Graham's final argument was very wide-ranging and was marked by a lack of precision and focus in identifying both what she considered to be CPC's discriminatory practices and the supporting evidence. Her final argument was of little or no assistance to the Tribunal in terms of drafting a decision in response to her complaint. Accordingly, the Tribunal's decision has addressed the four allegations of discrimination set out in her complaint and Statement of Particulars.\nIII. DECISION [9] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that Ms. Graham suffered from a disability during the period in which she was absent from work.\n[10] With respect to Ms. Graham's claim that CPC failed to accommodate her temporary disability, and that CPC treated her in adverse differential manner, and her claim that CPC did not support her with sufficient staff, thereby causing her disability, I have concluded that Ms. Graham has not established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[11] As to her claim that CPC terminated her acting superintendent position because of her disability, I find that Ms. Graham has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. However, CPC was unable to discharge its duty to accommodate Ms. Graham because of her failure to facilitate the accommodation process. In the result, Ms. Graham's complaint of discrimination against CPC has not been substantiated and her complaint is dismissed.\nIV. FACTS (i) The Appendix AA Project [12] In May 2001, Mr. Dave Smook, the UTS superintendent, asked Ken Gordon and Ms. Graham, both UTS supervisors, if either was willing to take on the superintendent job on an acting basis while he worked as the management representative on the CPC\/CUPW joint Appendix AA project. Mr. Gordon was not interested. He believed that it would involve considerably more work than he was doing as a supervisor. He had a life outside the post office. Ms. Graham thought it would be a tremendous opportunity to do so and accepted the position willingly.\n[13] Ms. Graham took over as acting superintendent on June 4, 2001. Prior to leaving the unit, Mr. Smook attempted to train Ms. Graham on the responsibilities of the superintendent position. But because he was focused on other more pressing issues, Ms. Graham could only observe and there was little time to practice what she had observed before Mr. Smook left.\n[14] Ms. Graham said that at the time she accepted the acting superintendent position, the project had not yet been implemented. Even though she did not know what all of her specific responsibilities would be, she was willing to take over the job and make the project work. She took the job knowing that it would be much more work than she was previously doing as a supervisor. Ms. Graham also accepted the acting superintendent position because she thought that it would assist her in her career goal of obtaining a superintendent position.\n[15] The purpose of the Appendix AA pilot project was to determine the feasibility of bringing back into UTS, the urban expedited parcels and small and medium customer pickups and eliminating that portion of the delivery service that was done by outside contractors.\n[16] CUPW was in favor of this change because it meant more jobs for its members at the WMPP. CPC wanted this change hoping it would bring its parcel delivery service up to industry standards and make it more competitive with other parcel delivery companies.\n[17] In addition to contracting-in the parcel delivery system, the Appendix AA project introduced other major changes, including moving from an item-based system to a stop-based system and introducing the dynamic workday rather than static shifts. The operation also moved from a six day to a seven day operation.\n[18] A dynamic workday meant that mail service couriers, i.e. the drivers who picked up and delivered the parcels, no longer worked a fixed hour shift. For example, a driver might make deliveries in the morning and not go out again until late afternoon or early evening. It did not matter how quickly a driver did their job, their day would still be maximized. Depending on the volume, a driver may work more hours on a Monday, less hours on Tuesday, etc.\n[19] Another change introduced by the Appendix AA project was the labeling, keying and sequencing of the parcels. This was done by computers so that the drivers would no longer sequence their routes. The sorting the parcels and loading the delivery trucks was now done postal clerks who worked in the newly created composite section.\n[20] The implementation of phase 1 of the Appendix AA project began in October 2001 and covered the downtown area, about half of the city of Winnipeg. The implementation of phase 1 caused a lot of stress in UTS because the project was new, the operational criteria were being developed and revised as the project moved forward.\n[21] Initially, there was considerable resistance from the drivers. They were upset that their workday was disconnected. Also they were unfamiliar with the new procedures. The contracting-in resulted in a major increase in volumes, which together with the normal increased pre-Christmas volumes created even more stress and unhappiness among the drivers.\n[22] Another reason the drivers were unhappy was because they lost a lot of control over their work. Prior to Appendix AA project, the drivers would decide the sequence of their deliveries. This was now done by a computer sequencing system and this decision process was taken away. Further, many drivers had delivered to the same businesses for years and had developed a relationship with them. Now they did not necessarily continue to deliver to these customers.\n[23] According to Ken Gordon and Thomas Zarzycki, both UTS supervisors, the period from October 2001 to just before the implementation of phase 2 in February 2002 was particularly stressful for both the supervisors and the drivers.\n[24] Because the drivers were unfamiliar with the new procedures, they would call the supervisors, which meant the supervisor spent considerable time on the phone dealing with the drivers' problems. So they could not always get their other work done within their regular hours. Supervisors also had to deal with customer calls which increased because they were unfamiliar with the new procedures and that consumed more of the supervisors' hours than previously.\n[25] Phase 2 of the Appendix AA project, which brought in the rest of the city, came in February 2002. Mr. Gordon and Mr. Sylvester testified that there was less pressure and stress in UTS. By that time, the drivers, the customers and the supervisors had become more knowledgeable\/familiar with the new system, the Christmas volumes had passed, and the bugs in the system had been worked out.\n(ii) Ms. Graham and the Appendix AA Project - June 4, 2001-February 2002 [26] When Ms. Graham was promoted to the position of acting superintendent, she was determined to find a way to have the drivers enjoy their jobs, and be able to see supervisors leave after their eight-hour day and feel satisfied that the job had been well done. As acting superintendent, she was responsible for the supervisors and ensuring that they carried out their duties on a daily basis. She was not directly responsible for the drivers. That was for the supervisors.\n[27] At first Ms. Graham was not totally familiar with all the duties and responsibilities of the job. But gradually, she said she was becoming comfortable in the job, somewhat stressed but confident that they would succeed through phase 1.\n[28] But as phase 1 progressed, Ms. Graham felt under more pressure because of the compressed timeline to implement the phase and because she believed the resources were not there. Sometime after the very hectic Christmas period, she began to have the physical symptoms of the flu and she was not getting better. She had been working long hours, seven days a week and was very tired.\n[29] Because of the long hours that she was working, she began having trouble prioritizing her daily duties. She could not focus on one thing and even the simplest things were overwhelming to her. There were occasions when she felt she was a failure. She was not being supportive of the people for whom she was responsible.\n(iii) Ms. Graham and phase 2 of the Appendix AA Project - February 2002-May 21 2002 [30] Dan Sylvester took over as UTS manager of Operations in January 2002. He had been with CPC for 20 years and had previously been a manager in UTS. When he took over, phase 1 was about completed and UTS was moving to implement phase 2 in early February 2002.\n[31] Mr. Sylvester met with Ms. Graham on February 5, 2002 to discuss the 2002 Winnipeg Operations Business Plan, her Performance Improvement Plan and Annual Competencies Review. The Performance Plan deals with detailed objectives specific to areas requiring improvement and performance objectives including personal development objectives. The Annual Competencies Review is designed to identify training needs with respect to specified competencies.\n[32] Ms. Graham testified that at this meeting, she told Mr. Sylvester that she was overworked and stressed and was feeling sick. Mr. Sylvester did not recall that Ms. Graham, at that meeting, had raised any concerns about being overworked or being sick. She also testified that at this meeting, she persisted in her belief that phase 2 required more supervisory hours.\n[33] On February 28, 2002, Ms. Graham wrote to Mr. Sylvester and asked to return to her substantive position as a UTS supervisor. She said that as the acting superintendent, she had given her all and done what she could to make the project a success. But she was insulted by the rating given in her 2001 performance appraisal, that CPC did not consider her best to be good enough. She felt that CPC's expectations were unrealistic given the current staffing for the implementation of the Appendix AA project.\n[34] Mr. Sylvester agreed that she could do so and he would post the position for acting superintendent assignment on the CPC Career Network. But Ms. Graham felt that it would take at least one to two months to get a replacement and that person would likely be someone who would not be familiar with the UTS operation. She was concerned that it would have a negative effect on the Appendix AA project to have someone new come in at this stage. She wanted to persevere, even though she was burned out. She was focused on the success of the project and she cared about UTS. So two days later, Ms. Graham called Mr. Sylvester and told him that she would stay as acting superintendent.\n[35] Mr. Sylvester said that one of the things that he had discussed with Ms. Graham was delegation of some of her duties to her supervisors, which as superintendent, she could do. But all that Ms. Graham requested was to return to her previous supervisor position and never asked to be otherwise accommodated.\n[36] In March 2002, Ms. Graham gave a powerpoint presentation at a meeting of UTS supervisors and management. One of her proposals was that more supervisors should be added to UTS. Mr. Sylvester recalled Ms. Graham's powerpoint presentation in which she asked for more supervisory resources. He discussed her proposal with his director, Fred Pollard, who questioned the need for more supervisors and concluded that no more supervisors should be added.\n[37] Prior to January 2002, there was one superintendent and four supervisors in the UTS unit. It appears from the documentary evidence that by February 2002, the number of supervisors in UTS had increased to six. They were: T. Zarzycki, L. Macario, K. Gordon, B. Friesen, N. MacLean and P. Hamel.\n[38] Mr. Sylvester again met with Ms. Graham on April 26, 2002. As a manager, Mr. Sylvester would meet with those he supervised every quarter. He did this so he could spend some time on one on one coaching and it allowed him to share successes with the employees.\n[39] Mr. Sylvester knew that Ms. Graham was working long days but he didn't track her hours. He provided a lot of flexibility and as superintendent, she could basically set her own work hours. Mr. Sylvester testified that at that meeting, Ms. Graham did not indicate that she was sick nor ask for any accommodation.\n(iv) Ms. Graham's absence from work and Sylvester\/Graham communications - June 2002 [40] On May 21, 2002, Ms. Graham went off sick. Diana Quilty, a very good friend of Ms. Graham, who also worked at the WMPP, testified that Ms. Graham was very committed to the Appendix AA project and wanted to make sure that it succeeded. After phase 2 came in, Ms. Quilty noticed that Ms. Graham was becoming increasingly stressed and on edge. She tried to convince Ms. Graham to take some time off but Ms. Graham continued to go to work on a regular basis.\n[41] On that day, Ms. Graham called Ms. Quilty and asked her to come to her home because she was very sick and needed help. She found her lying on the floor and could not get up. She could not go to work.\n[42] Mr. Sylvester learned of Ms. Graham's absence from work when Mr. Tom Zarzycki called him and told him that Ms. Graham was not in, she hadn't been in the last couple of days and asked if Mr. Sylvester had heard from her. Mr. Sylvester said he hadn't and would try to track her down because it was unlike Ms. Graham not to contact anyone at UTS that she would be absent from work.\n[43] He tried to contact Ms. Graham on her cell phone, with no success. So he sent her an e-mail and asked her to call him. He was concerned about her and he wanted to know how she was, not only as an employer but also he said, as a friend. Shortly after that, Mr. Sylvester did get a voice mail message from Ms. Graham that she wasn't feeling well and she would be off the remainder of the week and the next week.\n[44] When Mr. Sylvester learned that Ms. Graham would be off the rest of the week and the next week, he was concerned that maybe there was something major wrong. He presumed she would be seeing her doctor. He followed up with a letter dated May 27, 2002 to Ms. Graham, in which he indicated that he had information that she would be off work for a while. He enclosed an Occupational Fitness Assessment form (OFA) and asked to have her doctor complete and return it by June 3, 2002. The purpose for sending the OFA form was so that he could understand Ms. Graham's work restrictions and limitations and provide an accommodation if necessary.\n[45] Ms. Graham arranged an appointment with her doctor, Dr. Ibbitt, who did a number of tests. The test results showed that there was nothing physically wrong with Ms. Graham and Dr. Ibbitt concluded that she would do fine with rest and that her symptoms would be alleviated.\n[46] Dr. Ibbitt completed the OFA dated May 30, 2002, which did not provide any details of Ms. Graham's illness or set out any work limitations\/restrictions. He did indicate that Ms. Graham could return to work in seven days. The OFA was received by CPC's Occupational and Health Services (OHS) on June 3, 2002.\n[47] Mr. Sylvester expected Ms. Graham to return to work on June 6, 2002. When she did not, he wrote to her on June 6, pointing out that her doctor had indicated she would be off for seven days. He had no details of her absence or any leave that she was requesting. He also indicated that he had tried numerous times to contact her by phone and e-mail but she failed to contact him directly. Letters sent by Xpresspost was the only way he could communicate with her and ensure that she received the letters.\n[48] In this letter he also told Ms. Graham that he was moving her out of the acting superintendent position and reassigning her to the relief supervisor position until the next job bid or her return to her previous supervisor position. He did this, he said, because it was in the best interest of her illness and the Appendix AA project. She was replaced by Tom Zarzycki in June 2002.\n[49] Ms. Graham testified that she left a message on the UTS voice mail that she would be reassessed by Dr. Ibbitt on June 6, 2002. She also testified that whenever there was a change in her status, she would leave voice mail messages for Mr. Sylvester at his office or on the UTS voice mail. There were various reasons why she would not contact him personally. Her sleeping patterns were disrupted. Her ability to act rationally was out of kilter. She was not confident in speaking with him personally because she did not feel that he would be supportive.\n[50] When an employee is absent from work, CPC's policy is that the employee should call their supervisor or if not available, someone else and tell them when they expect to come back to work. When they return, they usually provide a medical note if it was more than a short absence. If the length of the absence is not known, the OHS would ask for an OFA to be completed by their doctor which provides some indication of the nature of the illness or injury, the estimated return to work date, whether there are any work limitations and whether there is a need for accommodation. This is given to the OHS.\n[51] When Ms. Graham was reassessed on June 6, 2002 by Dr. Ibbitt, he completed a medical absence certificate saying that Ms. Graham had been under his care from June 6, 2002, she was off for medical reasons and she would be able to return to work on June 10, 2002. Ms. Graham said that she either sent this certificate to Mr. Sylvester directly or to the OHS.\n[52] When he wrote the June 6 letter, Mr. Sylvester had not yet received the medical certificate from Dr. Ibbitt indicating that Ms. Graham would be off until June 10. Ms. Graham agreed that as of June 6, 2002, had she been in Mr. Sylvester's position with the information he had, she would have considered an employee away without leave (AWOL) at that point in time. But when he received Dr. Ibbitt's medical certificate, he would have had the proper documentation to indicate that her leave had been extended to June 10. And she said that she did leave a voice mail at the numbers Mr. Sylvester provided in his letter and on the UTS voice mail as to her current status.\n[53] Ms. Graham was not able to return to work on June 10. She wrote to Mr. Sylvester requesting annual leave because she had medical appointments and they could not be postponed. Mr. Sylvester replied on June 11 and confirmed her leave status to be - sick leave up to and including June 7, 2002, and - annual leave from June 10-14. He wrote again to Ms. Graham on June 13 requesting that she report to work at 7:00 p.m. on June 16, as the UTS Night Supervisor.\n[54] Mr. Sylvester followed this up with a letter dated June 17, 2002, indicating that he had received her voice mail message the previous evening that she would be scheduling a medical appointment and would be off for the rest of the week. He requested that her doctor complete and return another OFA by June 19 so that he could understand her work restrictions\/limitations. He also asked her to advise her doctor that CPC can provide modified\/alternative duties.\n[55] Ms. Graham was seen and treated at the St. Boniface General Hospital Emergency Department on June 19, 2002. The attending doctor gave her medical note saying that she would need two to four weeks off due to illness. The two to four weeks was the estimated time that it would take to get an appointment with a specialist.\n[56] On June 21, Mr. Sylvester wrote to Ms. Graham saying that he had received the doctor's certificate from St. Boniface Hospital saying that she would be off work for two to four weeks due to illness. Again he asked that she submit the OFA which he sent on June 17 and return it by June 24. He reiterated that the OFA was necessary to understand her work restrictions and limitations and also she should tell her doctor that CPC has modified\/alternative duties.\n[57] At this point, Ms. Graham had not returned to work. And Mr. Sylvester still did not know the nature of her illness or whether she required modified\/alternative duties. He said that Ms. Graham was communicating with him but only by voice mail and at odd hours such as 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. Although in his letters Mr. Sylvester gave Ms. Graham three numbers at which she could call him, she never did.\n(v) Sylvester\/Graham communications - July 2002 [58] Ms. Graham did not return the OFA Mr. Sylvester had requested on June 17. His next letter to Ms. Graham was on July 3, 2002. He requested that her doctor now complete the OFA by July 5. As a reminder, he asked her to advise her doctor that CPC has modified\/alternative duties. But if he did not receive the OFA by July 5, he would have no choice but to put her on AWOL status.\n[59] On July 10, 2002, Mr. Sylvester wrote to Ms. Graham enclosing her mid year review. Mr. Sylvester said that normally he would meet personally with her to discuss the review. But because Ms. Graham was off, he couldn't do this. He did tell her that when she returned to work, he would gladly meet with her to discuss her appraisal.\n[60] Mr. Sylvester persisted in his letter writing and on July 19, 2002, wrote to Ms. Graham that the note received by him from the St. Boniface Hospital indicated that she would be off two to four weeks. Therefore she should have reported for work on July 18\/19. Because she did not report to work on those days, nor call in to report her absence, he would put her on AWOL status and without pay for those two days.\n[61] Ms. Graham's response was that Mr. Sylvester was already aware of her situation through her voice mails. In fact, in his July 23, 2002 letter to Ms. Graham, Mr. Sylvester acknowledged that Ms. Graham had left him two voice mail messages, one at 11:46 p.m. and at 2:20 a.m. that she had an appointment with a specialist on July 25, and that she would have the OFA completed at that time.\n[62] He apologized in his letter that Ms. Graham felt inconvenienced and harassed by his requests for information, but he had no alternative but to proceed in this way by sending her letters by Xpresspost. He asked that she provide the OFA by July 25. And in the meantime, she would remain on AWOL status without pay from July 18.\n[63] In July 2002, in the course of her medical treatment, Ms. Graham had consulted with Shannon McGunigal, a therapist\/social worker at St. Boniface Hospital and asked her to provide a note concerning her condition. Ms. McGunigal wrote a note dated July 30, 2002, stating that Ms. Graham was being seen for psychiatric care at the St. Boniface Hospital outpatient clinic and could not return to work at this time. She had a scheduled appointment with Dr. Calhoun on August 12, who would provide CPC with the appropriate documentation and assessment following the appointment.\n[64] Ms. Graham realized that CPC might not accept this because Ms. McGunigal was not a doctor. But she felt she had to submit something before her next appointment or she might lose her job. She asked Ms. Quilty to take this note to Neil Spiring, a CPC employee, and the divisional Vice-President of APOC, whom she knew well and trusted. Ms. Graham was very concerned to keep confidential any information relating to her medical condition and expected that Mr. Spiring would call Mr. Sylvester, and tell him that Ms. Graham had an upcoming appointment and not to put Ms. Graham on AWOL status. Mr. Spiring did speak to Mr. Sylvester and also faxed Ms. McGunigal's note to Mr. Sylvester at the UTS office on August 2. Ms. Graham was very upset about this especially because the fax machine in the UTS office was generally accessible.\n[65] Ms. Quilty had also spoken to Mr. Sylvester and told him that she was a good friend of Ms. Graham and that she was taking care of Ms. Graham. She also asked Mr. Sylvester to stop sending the letters because they were having a detrimental effect. She told Mr. Sylvester that Ms. Graham needed time to get better and needed time away from work. She said that Mr. Sylvester's response was that this had nothing to do with her. He wanted to talk to Ms. Graham personally.\n[66] Mr. Sylvester testified that he had discussions with Dave Smook, APOC President, and with Neil Spiring as to the process that he was following with Ms. Graham. He said that their view was that there was nothing else he could do.\n(vi) Sylvester\/Graham communications - August 2002 [67] The day before, on August 1, Mr. Sylvester had written to Ms. Graham telling her that he had not received any further written medical information and she would remain on AWOL status without pay. He asked her to provide medical information by August 2 or he would expect her at work on this date. If she did neither, he would have no alternative but to continue to take the necessary disciplinary action up to and including discharge from CPC.\n[68] When Mr. Sylvester received the note on August 2 from Ms. NcGunigal, he asked OHS to confirm whether this was sufficient medical information. OHS said no because it was not from a medical practitioner. OHS decided that Mr. Sylvester should write to Ms. Graham and ask her doctor to complete an AMI (Acquisition of Medical Information). He did so on August 8, 2002 and asked her to have her doctor return the AMI by August 26.\n[69] OHS also wrote to Dr. Laura Calhoun on August 8, requesting that she complete the AMI for Ms. Graham so that OHS could assess her functional abilities. Dr. Calhoun was the specialist at St. Boniface Hospital with whom Ms. Graham had an appointment on August 12. In their letter, OHS specifically noted that suitable modified duties could be made available for Ms. Graham if such accommodation was necessary.\n[70] On August 12, 2002, Dr. Calhoun wrote to Mr. Sylvester that Ms. Graham had been off sick from June 18 for medical reasons and advised him that a detailed medical report would follow. In fact, Dr. Calhoun did complete the AMI and a detailed medical report on August 12 and it was received by OHS on August 15.\n[71] On August 22, 2002, Dr. Lori Koz from OHS sent a field report to Mr. Sylvester regarding Ms. Graham. The field report set out Ms. Graham's fitness for work but did not reveal her medical condition as is the normal practice of OHS. The field report was based on the medical assessment from Dr. Calhoun and indicated that Ms. Graham was temporarily unfit for work and her potential return to work date was approximately six months.\n[72] After he received the field report, Mr. Sylvester stopped all his communications with Ms. Graham. He did so on the basis of the field report from OHS. Ms. Graham's AWOL status without pay was changed to reflect Dr. Calhoun's assessment in her August 12, 2002 letter that Ms. Graham was off work since June 18 because of medical reasons.\n(vii) Ms. Graham's attempts to resolve her employment situation - October 2002-January 2003 [73] On October 31, 2002, Ms. Graham wrote a letter to whom it may concern that Ron Kohut, one of her sources of support and a good friend with whom she shared a common work history at CPC, had offered to act on her behalf. Mr. Kohut was a supervisor in Depot B, Letter Carrier Depot.\n[74] He wrote a letter on October 22, 2002 to Mary Traversy, Vice-President, Human Resources for CPC. He outlined in detail Ms. Graham's work background at CPC, her difficult medical circumstances and how she felt about how she was treated by Mr. Sylvester in his attempt to communicate with her, which in her view, caused her even more distress. He requested Ms. Traversy's intervention to help resolve the situation whereby Ms. Graham would receive what she was entitled to.\n[75] Ms. Traversy replied on November 28, 2002 to Ms. Graham, and said that she had asked Roy Nias, General Manager, Mail Operations, Prairie Region, to review this matter. Ms. Traversy replied to Ms. Graham on January 21, 2003. In her letter, she referred to the Attendance Management Program and specifically Ms. Graham's concerns about the number of letters Mr. Sylvester had sent her requesting information on her condition. She pointed out that although the number of Mr. Sylvester's letters was somewhat excessive, her absence had been handled within the guidelines of that Program.\n[76] As to Mr. Sylvester returning Ms. Graham to her substantive position and ending the acting superintendent job, Ms. Traversy said that was done in accordance with current CPC policy, and also to ensure continuity in the CPC operations.\nV. REASONS FOR DECISION (i) Has Ms. Graham established a prima facie case of discrimination? [77] In a human rights case before this Tribunal, the complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, i.e. credible, is complete and sufficient for a decision in the favour of the complainant, in the absence of a reasonable answer from the respondent. The respondent's answer should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004; Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6).\n[78] As noted earlier, Ms. Graham's allegation of discrimination against CPC are:\nthat CPC failed to accommodate her temporary disability; that CPC treated her in adverse differential manner by failing to accommodate her temporary disability; that CPC terminated her status as acting superintendent because of her disability; and that CPC caused her disability and her inability to work by its failure to provide sufficient staff and support for her to carry on her duties.\n(ii) Did Ms. Graham have a disability at the relevant time? [79] An allegation of discrimination under the CHRA, must be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Thus it must be determined whether there was prima facie evidence that Ms. Graham suffered from a disability during her absence from work commencing on May 21, 2002.\n[80] The pertinent evidence includes:\nMs. Quilty's evidence was that on May 21, 2002, Ms. Graham called her to come to her home because she was very sick and needed help.\nMr. Sylvester's statement was that it was unlike Ms. Graham not to contact anyone at the UTS that she would be absent from work.\nMs. Graham's voice mail message to Mr. Sylvester was that she was sick and would be off work for one to two weeks.\nDr. Ibbitt's May 30, 2002 OFA form that she had been ill since May 21 and could only return to work on June 6.\nDr. Ibbitt's June 6, 2002 medical absentee certificate that, for medical reasons, Ms. Graham could not return to work until June 10.\nSt. Boniface Hospital staff member's June 19, 2002 note indicating that Ms. Graham had been seen and treated at the St. Boniface General Hospital Emergency Department and would be off work for two to four weeks due to illness.\nMs. McGunigal's July 30, 2002 note indicating that Ms. Graham was referred to the St. Boniface Hospital outpatient clinic for psychiatric care and could not return to work at this time.\nDr. Calhoun's August 12, 2002 letter to Mr. Sylvester advising that Ms. Graham has been off work since June 18 for medical reasons.\nThe August 22, 2002 OHS Field Report indicating that Ms. Graham was temporarily unfit for work, and that she would not be returning to work for approximately six months.\n[81] Disability in the legal sense consists of a physical or mental impairment, which results in a functional limitation or is associated with a perception of impairment. A chronic or debilitating condition that periodically causes an individual to become significantly incapacitated and interferes with their ability to do their job, is a disability within the meaning of the CHRA (see Desormeaux v. Ottawa, 2005 FCA, 111, paras. 13, 15).\n[82] This evidence strongly supports the conclusion that Ms. Graham had a medically-based inability to participate in the workplace. I find that prima facie, she suffered from a disability during her absence starting in May 2002.\n(iii) Ms. Graham's allegations of discrimination a) Failure to accommodate her disability [83] As to Ms. Graham's complaint that CPC discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her disability, I cannot emphasize enough that failure to accommodate is neither a prohibited ground of discrimination nor a discriminatory practice under the CHRA. There is no free-standing right to accommodation under the CHRA.\n[84] The duty to accommodate only arises in the context of s. 15(2) of the CHRA and only when a respondent raises a bona fide justification by way of defense to an allegation of discrimination. For Ms. Graham to show a prima facie case, she must rely on something other than the failure of CPC to accommodate her.\nb) Adverse differential treatment [85] With respect to her claim that CPC treated her in an adverse differential manner because of her disability, Ms. Graham did not point to any evidence that showed adverse differential treatment. It is not for the Tribunal to sift through the evidence to make this case for her.\n[86] For these two claims, Ms. Graham has not established a prima facie case of discrimination.\nc) Causing her temporary disability [87] Ms. Graham alleged that, while she was still carrying out her duties in the acting assignment, CPC failed to provide her with sufficient staffing resources to implement the Appendix AA project. The resulting stress of managing an understaffed project caused her to be temporarily disabled.\n[88] It is not clear whether the CHRA makes it discriminatory for an employer to cause an employee to become disabled. Putting that question aside, however, Ms. Graham's allegation assumes that she was disabled prior to going absent from work. Unfortunately, she did not present any evidence suggesting that prior to going on sick leave, she had a disability within the meaning of the CHRA. Or if she did, CPC's failure to accede to her request was the cause of her temporary disability. Accordingly, her allegation that CPC caused her to become disabled must fail.\nd) Terminating her acting superintendent position [89] Finally, there is the question of whether CPC's termination of her acting assignment contravened s. 7(a) of the CHRA, in that it amounted to a refusal to continue to employ. While the termination of her acting position did not sever the employment relationships, it constituted a loss of a temporary position and her reversion to a pre-existing and less advantageous position.\n[90] The loss of this acting assignment was linked directly or indirectly to her disability. CPC's decision to terminate her acting position was based on her absenteeism, which in turn was caused by her disability. Thus, she has established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[91] The obligation then rests on the CPC to demonstrate that it accommodated Ms. Graham to the point of undue hardship. In the accommodation analysis, there is also a duty on the complainant. The Supreme Court of Canada stated in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2. S.C.R. 970 at pp. 16-17, stated that the search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry. Along with the employer, the complainant must assist in securing an appropriate accommodation. That is, to facilitate the search for an accommodation, the complainant must do his or her part as well. And in determining whether the duty of accommodation has been fulfilled the conduct of the complainant must be considered.\n[92] In this case, Mr. Sylvester, in his letters to Ms. Graham, repeatedly asked her if she had any work limitations\/restrictions and pointed out that CPC provided alternative or modified duties for employees who can not perform their regular duties. He also asked her to advise her doctor, when completing the OFA, of CPC's policy of accommodation.\n[93] Ms. Graham did not do her part. Although she did leave voice mail messages from time to time indicating her status and she did provide medical assessments, neither she or her doctor responded to Mr. Sylvester's request for information as to her work limitations or restrictions. It was only on August 25, 2002 when OHS received Dr. Calhoun's AMI that CPC learned that Ms. Graham was temporarily unfit for work and her potential return was approximately six months.\n[94] It was not possible in these circumstances, given this lack of information, for CPC to devise an appropriate accommodation for Ms. Graham. Further, Ms. Graham's position of acting superintendent was crucial to the successful implementation of the Appendix AA project. It could not await her indeterminate return to the workplace. CPC had no choice but to replace her as acting superintendent.\nVI. CONCLUSION [95] I have concluded that Ms. Graham's complaint of discrimination against CPC has not been substantiated for the reasons set out in this decision. As a result, her complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ. Grant Sinclair\nOTTAWA, Ontario October 2, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1093\/7405\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nSandra Graham v.

The complainant objects to Dr. Dufour being qualified as such on the grounds that she does not have the required qualifications to be recognized as an expert in psychology and sexology. As for the Commission, it also objects to qualifying Dr. Dufour as an expert and contends that she should only be considered as a fact witness for her involvement in the complainant's assessment in May 2006.\n[2] The Tribunal heard Dr. Dufour regarding her qualification as an expert. According to Dr. Dufour's testimony, she has a doctorate in psychology obtained in 2002 from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and she is a member of the Ordre des psychologues du Qu\u00e9bec. Dr. Dufour does not have any postdoctoral education, apart from attending a few scientific activities - a conference and a professional development course. She does not have any scientific publications to her credit in psychology or sexology, or any scientific presentations in these areas for scientific conferences. She does not have any professional affiliations other than her membership with the Ordre des psychologues du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[3] Indeed, Dr. Dufour is a clinical psychologist in private practice. She testified at the qualification proceeding that since 1998 she has seen a number of people for gender dysphoria disorders, first as a psychotherapist-sexologist, then as a psychologist-sexologist. She also testified that for over 10 years she has worked as a volunteer for a half-day every week at the Human Sexuality Clinic at the Montreal General Hospital, supervised by Dr. Pierre Assalian.\n[4] According to Dr. Dufour, these consultations accounted for approximately 60% of her professional practice. On this point, Dr. Dufour states that she sees between 30 and 40 people with gender dysphoria disorders in group therapy every two weeks. These people come from the program implemented by the Montreal General Hospital's Human Sexuality Clinic, supervised by Dr. Pierre Assalian. Moreover, she says that every week she sees between 10 to 15 people with gender identity disorders. In the course of her practice, Dr. Dufour says she has seen between 400 and 500 persons with gender identity disorders.\n[5] To be recognized as an expert, individuals must establish that they have a particular expertise in a given field. This expertise must be supported not only by a solid professional practice but also scientific knowledge establishing that the professional is capable of critical and reasoned thinking in regard to different points of view that may prevail in a given field.\n[6] In this case, the Tribunal considers that Dr. Dufour's academic career and professional profile are inadequate for her to be recognized as an expert in the field of human sexuality or sexology, disciplines which indeed do not have specific professional training as there is no agency responsible for overseeing this professional field. However, the Tribunal does recognize that Dr. Dufour has extensive experience in treating individuals who are afflicted with gender dysphoria and who have sexual identity disorders. On this point, the Tribunal recognizes that Dr. Dufour has specific knowledge of the clientele that consults her regarding these disorders.\n[7] It is the Tribunal's opinion that Dr. Dufour has the qualifications necessary to testify not only with respect to her assessment of the complainant in May 2006 but also to share her clinical experience with the Tribunal in the areas of gender dysphoria and sexual identity disorders and to comment on her assessment of the complainant in light of this experience. Dr. Dufour is not however authorized to give opinions on the subject or to comment on the literature on gender dysphoria, transsexualism, transgenderism, transvestism and other disorders relating to sexual identity.\n[8] The Tribunal therefore recognizes Dr. Dufour as a psychologist-sexologist having specific knowledge from her practice with persons afflicted with gender dysphoria or with sexual identity disorders, such as transsexuals and transvestites, and authorizes her to offer testimony not only about her involvement in the complainant's case but also about her own experience in treating people who consult her for sexual identity or gender dysphoria disorders. However, she cannot offer opinions in regard to the scientific literature and scientific hypotheses relating to gender dysphoria or sexual identity disorders, because the Tribunal does not recognize her as an expert.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario October 16, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1047\/2805\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nMicheline Montreuil v.

JOHNSTON\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nCANADIAN ARMED FORCES\nRespondent\nRULING\n2007 CHRT 42 2007\/10\/17\nMEMBER: Athanasios D. Hadjis\n[1] The Respondent has filed a Notion of Motion dated June 28, 2007, seeking an order dismissing the complaint initiated by the Complainant, Sheldon W. Johnston, for want of prosecution. The Respondent alleges that since the complaint was referred to the Tribunal, the Complainant has shown blatant disregard for the Tribunal's timelines, while at the same time, the Respondent and the Tribunal have made all reasonable efforts to move the complaint forward. The motion was supported by a sworn affidavit signed by Cindy Komodowski, a legal assistant with the Federal Department of Justice in the Saskatoon Office.\n[2] The Respondent also filed with the Tribunal an Affidavit of Personal Service signed by a process server in Alberta, stating that the Complainant had been personally served with the Notice of Motion on July 9, 2007, at his address in Taber, Alberta. On July 16, 2007, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Complainant notifying him that his deadline for filing submissions in reply to the motion was August 1, 2007. This letter was left at the main entry door at the Complainant's address by process server on July 26, 2007. The Complainant has not as yet filed any reply submissions nor has he since communicated in any manner with the Tribunal.\n[3] For the reasons given below, I am granting the Respondent's motion and dismissing the complaint.\nI. Factual Background [4] The facts recited below are derived from the Tribunal's file regarding this complaint and from the evidence in Ms. Komodowski's affidavit, which is uncontroverted given the Complainant's failure to reply to the motion.\n[5] The Complainant filed his complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on January 25, 2002. He alleged that from June 1999 onwards, the Respondent discriminated against him, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, by refusing to employ him as a Military Chaplain and a Reserve Entry Scheme Officer on the basis of his religion. He also alleged that the Respondent pursues a policy or practice that discriminates against him and others like him on the basis of his religion (Christian and Missionary Alliance\/Church of God in Canada), contrary to s. 10 of the Act.\n[6] On June 11, 2003, the Commission notified the Tribunal Chairperson that it was only referring the s. 10 aspect of the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry, having decided that the s. 7 component of the complaint should be dismissed. On June 27, 2003, the Commission informed the Tribunal that it would not be participating at the hearing into the merits of the complaint.\n[7] On July 7, 2003, the Complainant filed a judicial review application before the Federal Court regarding the Commission's decision to dismiss the s. 7 portion of the complaint. At the request of both the Complainant and the Respondent, the Tribunal directed that the hearing process regarding the referred complaint not proceed pending the outcome of this judicial review.\n[8] The initial documentation that had accompanied the complaint when it was referred to the Tribunal indicated that the Complainant's postal address was in Castlegar, British Columbia. However, at some point thereafter, the Complainant moved to Swift Current, Saskatchewan. He did not notify the Tribunal Registry of this change. Instead, the Tribunal only came to learn of the move from the new address that appeared on the Complainant's judicial review application, a copy of which the Respondent had forwarded to the Tribunal.\n[9] The Complainant apparently discontinued his judicial review application in February 2004. On May 6, 2004, he advised the Tribunal of the discontinuance, adding that he was awaiting a ruling from the Tribunal about the conclusion of his case against the Respondent. In keeping with the Tribunal's practice with regard to all complaints, the Tribunal offered the parties the opportunity to voluntarily attend a mediation session organized by the Tribunal. A mediation questionnaire in this regard was sent to the parties by the Tribunal on May 28, 2004. The parties were asked to reply by June 18, 2004. At the request of the Respondent, this deadline was later extended to July 26, 2004. The Respondent replied that it was interested in participating in the mediation and provided its dates of availability.\n[10] Unfortunately, the Complainant did not respond to the Tribunal's letter, even by the extended July 26th deadline. On August 5, 2004, the Tribunal sent the Complainant a message by email reminding him of the matter and explaining to him that he could reply either in writing or by telephone. He responded by email on August 10, 2004 indicating his willingness to attend a mediation session. He claimed that he had responded earlier but that his email message must not have gone through.\n[11] On November 30, 2004, the Tribunal conducted a case management conference call with the parties, during which the parties were directed to file written summaries of the issues in the case and the remedies being sought. The summaries were intended to assist the parties in determining the scope of the mediation discussions. Respondent counsel informed the Tribunal in a follow-up letter dated December 23, 2004, that he was attempting to contact the Complainant to try to resolve the case in advance of a mediation, but that the Complainant's telephone number was no longer in service. Neither the Respondent nor the Tribunal had been provided with any new contact information from the Complainant.\n[12] On January 17, 2005, the Complainant filed his written summary with the Tribunal. He also advised the Tribunal that his new address was now in Surrey, British Columbia. On February 21, 2005, the Respondent filed its reply summary.\n[13] On February 25, 2005, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal that he was now residing at an address in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. He also notified the Tribunal that a lawyer from Vancouver, David Mossop, was now representing him with regard to the complaint. At Mr. Mossop's request, the Tribunal granted him until April 21, 2005, to apprise himself of the file and to expand upon the Complainant's summary if he found it necessary.\n[14] On May 4, 2005, the Tribunal conducted another case management conference call, during which the parties undertook to hold discussions and advise the Tribunal if they still wished to proceed with the mediation. A schedule for disclosure was also established. The Complainant was to file his statement of particulars and complete his documentary disclosure by July 29, 2005, and the Respondent, by August 26, 2005. As of May 13, 2005, both parties had advised the Tribunal that they wished to participate in a mediation session organized by the Tribunal.\n[15] On May 17, 2005, however, the Complainant sent an email message to the Tribunal indicating that his lawyer had withdrawn from the case. The Complainant indicated that he was nonetheless still interested in mediating the complaint. The Tribunal therefore canvassed the parties for a date and venue for the mediation. The parties agreed that it be conducted in Vancouver (as the Complainant had apparently moved back to British Columbia) on July 22, 2005. The Tribunal advised the Complainant of the date, time and address where the meeting would take place by a letter that was sent by courier service as well as by email to the Complainant's email address.\n[16] On Friday, July 22, 2005, the Chairperson of the Tribunal, who was to preside over the mediation, as well as the Respondent's counsel and four of its representatives attended at the designated location and time for the mediation. The Complainant did not appear. It was therefore decided by those present to conclude the mediation. According to Ms. Komodowski's affidavit, the Complainant contacted Respondent counsel later that day and indicated that he was now available to attend the mediation. However, the Tribunal Chairperson as well as a number of the Respondent representatives had already left for the airport to return home. The Respondent's counsel and some of its representatives, who had not yet boarded their flights, agreed to change their travel plans and stay until the next day to meet with the Complainant, in the interests of moving this matter forward. The parties did in fact meet on Saturday, July 23, 2005, but a resolution was not reached.\n[17] Given that the case did not settle, the Tribunal advised the Complainant on July 26, 2005, that the hearing into the complaint would commence on October 24, 2005. In addition, another case management conference call was set down for September 1, 2005. The Complainant replied by email requesting that an earlier conference call be scheduled for a date falling between August 1 to 5, 2005, and a time between the hours of 8 am and 12 noon Ottawa time. He also indicated that he would not be available in October for the hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal organized a conference call on August 4 at 11 a.m., Eastern Time. However, at the designated time, the Complainant did not dial into the conference call even though the Tribunal had provided him with detailed instructions shortly before the call.\n[18] On August 10, 2005, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Complainant advising him that the deadline for him to submit his statement of particulars and documentary disclosure, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, was extended to September 16, 2005. In light of the Complainant's unavailability in October, the Tribunal requested that the Complainant provide his dates of availability by August 26, 2005.\n[19] On September 1, 2005, the Complainant sent an email message to the Tribunal stating that he would like to know the status of the hearing process. He indicated his preferred venue for the hearing. He did not, however, make any mention of dates of availability.\n[20] In addition, the Complainant did not file his statement of particulars and other disclosure documents by September 16, 2005, as the Tribunal had required of him in its letter of August 10, 2005.\n[21] In fact, following the email of September 1, 2005, the Tribunal did not hear a word again from the Complainant until October 16, 2006, over 14 months later, when he sent a short email to the Tribunal Registry Officer assigned to his file. He stated in his message that he had never received any follow-up to his last communication with the Tribunal. He made no mention of his failure to provide, over the course of more than a year, his statement of particulars, his disclosure materials, and his dates of availability.\n[22] In response to the Complainant's email message, the Tribunal contacted all of the parties to organize a conference call. On November 2, 2006, the Tribunal wrote by email to the Complainant to request that he select from a list of proposed dates for the call. The Complainant replied by email on November 13, 2006. He indicated a date when he was available and advised the Tribunal of his new telephone number and address in Taber, Alberta. The Tribunal responded by email on the same day, informing the Complainant that the Respondent was not available on the date he had selected. A set of new dates was therefore proposed. The Complainant was asked to confirm his availability by November 14, 2006.\n[23] The Complainant did not respond by this deadline. On November 19, 2006, the Tribunal sent an email to the Complainant reminding him that his response had yet to be received. He did not reply. On November 21, the Tribunal's Manager, Operations called the telephone number that the Complainant had recently provided. There was no answer. The Tribunal called again on November 22. A woman answered and explained that the Complainant would call back later that day. The Complainant never returned the call.\n[24] On December 20, 2006, the Tribunal sent an email message to the Complainant reminding him that he had yet to reply regarding his availability for a conference call. He was asked to contact the Tribunal by email or by collect telephone call, to confirm his availability. There was still no response.\n[25] On January 9, 2007, a Tribunal Registry Officer called the Complainant's telephone number and his spouse answered. He was not available, so the Officer asked her to tell the Complainant that he should respond to the Tribunal's email of December 20, 2006. He never responded. The Registry Officer therefore called his residence again, on April 4, 2007. His spouse answered. She said that she had passed the previous message on to the Complainant. The Tribunal asked her to relay the message again to the Complainant. He still did not reply.\n[26] Consequently, on May 15, 2007, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Complainant, which was delivered by process server to his residence and served on his wife, on May 19, 2007. The letter highlighted the attempts that the Tribunal had made to contact the Complainant, to which he had not responded. He was accordingly asked to confirm, by May 31, 2007, the dates when he would be available for a one-week hearing during the months of September to December 2007. He was also advised that failing confirmation of his availability, the Tribunal would fix dates in the fall of 2007 for the hearing that would take place in Lethbridge, Alberta.\n[27] The Complainant has yet to reply to the Tribunal's letter.\n[28] On June 28, 2007, the Respondent filed the present motion requesting that the complaint be dismissed. As I already mentioned, the Complainant was served with the motion on July 16, 2007, and was instructed to file his submissions by August 1, 2007. The Tribunal has not received any submissions or other documentation from the Complainant to this date, nor has he made any other contact with the Tribunal.\nII. Analysis [29] As was pointed out in Seitz v. Canada, 2002 FCT 456, at para. 10, two approaches have developed with respect to dismissal for delay, or as it is also called, dismissal for want of prosecution. The first approach, which is sometimes referred to as the classic test, was set out in Nichols v. Canada, [1990] F.C.J. No. 567 (F.C.T.D)(Q.L.). It is a threefold test consisting, first, of determining whether there has been an inordinate delay; second, whether the delay is inexcusable; and third, whether the defendants are likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay.\n[30] The second approach is set out in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the Seitz decision. This approach is described as being apt in cases where the litigant engages in a wholesale disregard for time limits provided in the rules of court, which is how the Complainant has, in my view, conducted himself in the present case. Seitz points out that such breaches are not to be looked at only from the viewpoint of the litigants, but also in light of the abuse of and prejudice to the due administration of justice. Where an action has remained static for an unreasonable length of time, there is an abuse of the administration of justice, which is separate and apart from any prejudice caused by inordinate and inexcusable delay, elements that must be established under the classic test. Seitz notes that these sorts of breaches will give rise to an abuse of process and will constitute grounds for dismissal. The decision adopts the House of Lords' findings in Grovit and Others v. Doctor and Others, [1997]1 W.L.R. 640, to the effect that:\nThe courts exist to enable parties to have their disputes resolved. To commence and to continue litigation which you have no intention to bring to conclusion can amount to an abuse of process. Where this is the situation the party against whom the proceedings is brought is entitled to apply to have the action struck out and if justice so requires (which will frequently be the case) the courts will dismiss the action.\nGrovit has also been followed in Trusthouse Forte California Inc. v. Gateway Soap and Chemical Co., 1998 CanLII 8897 at para. 9 (F.C).\n[31] Like the courts, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is also entitled to prevent an abuse of its process. The Federal Court noted, in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at para. 15, aff'd Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363, that it is evident that one cannot maintain that the [Canadian Human Rights] Tribunal is the master in its own house if it cannot protect its own process from abuse.\n[32] There have been numerous instances where the Complainant has failed to comply with the time limits and dates that were set by the Tribunal in this case, even when the Tribunal has accorded extensions thereto. I note, in passing, that Rule 1(5) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure states that all dates and time limits set by the Tribunal are peremptory, unless the Tribunal orders otherwise. The Complainant's breaches in this case have included:\nHis late reply to the Tribunal's first offer to mediate, which was received on August 5, 2004, one week beyond the date that had been extended to him for his reply; His failure to appear at the date and time set for the mediation, in British Columbia; His failure to dial into the case management conference call that had been re-scheduled to August 4, 2005, at his request; His inexplicable failure to file his statement of particulars and documentary disclosure, which have been due since September 16, 2005, i.e. over two years ago; His failure to advise the Tribunal of his dates of availability for the hearing, which he had been directed to provide by August 26, 2005, i.e. over two years ago; His failure to confirm, by November 14, 2006, his availability for a conference call to address what I would qualify as his offhand request by email for a follow-up from the Tribunal, coming some 14 months after his last contact with the Tribunal, and after having repeatedly ignored the Tribunal's previous orders; His failure to respond by May 31, 2007, to the Tribunal's May 15, 2007, letter regarding his dates of availability for the hearing; His failure to respond to the Tribunal's instructions that he file his reply submissions to this motion by August 1, 2007.\n[33] The Complainant has thus ignored or failed to comply with numerous time limits set by the Tribunal in the present case. Based on the evidence before me, there is no reasonable excuse to explain the Complainant's late or non-existent compliance with all of these Tribunal directions. I cannot but infer that the Complainant has no interest in following through with his complaint.\n[34] The Tribunal is entitled to protect its process from abuse brought on by this sort of wholesale disregard of time limits, which in this instance has rendered the case completely static for at least two years, an unreasonably long time. I therefore grant the Respondent's motion. The complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

In 1994, he became ill and was diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder and an obsessive compulsive personality disorder. He returned to work in 1995. Since then, Mr. Day\u2019s employment relationship with Canada Post has been difficult. He thinks that Canada Post has never accepted his psychiatric disability and has treated him differently from other employees because he is disabled.\n[2] Mr. Day has raised ten allegations of discrimination during the time period from April 2001 to August 2006. The allegations relate to Mr. Day\u2019s psychological fitness to work, Canada Post\u2019s requirement that he work the night shift, the termination of his employment, and a number of other allegations involving negative differential treatment and harassment on the basis of his disability.\n[3] Mr. Day invokes sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Section 7 provides that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual, or to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 14 stipulates that it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[4] Of the ten allegations of discrimination made by Mr. Day, one is substantiated. Canada Post treated Mr. Day differently from non-disabled employees when it placed him on sick leave and removed him from the workplace in November of 2001. Although the evidence supported Canada Post\u2019s decision to remove him from the workplace, the Corporation failed to treat Mr. Day with dignity and respect throughout the accommodation process. Mr. Day\u2019s other allegations were not substantiated.\n[5] After a brief overview of the facts that gave rise to the complaint, I will set out Mr. Day\u2019s allegations and then address them in turn. Finally, I will provide my reasons for the remedy that I have ordered.\nII. What Are the Facts That Give Rise to the Complaint? [6] Mr. Day was hired as a mechanic by Canada Post in April of 1986 in the Technical Services department at the Glanford Mail Processing Plant (GMPP) in Victoria. In 1992, he was promoted to an EL5, a technical specialist position in Technical Services. EL5\u2019s perform the most difficult repair and maintenance work on the machines at Canada Post. They are also required to supervise up to twenty employees.\n[7] In the fall of 1995, Mr. Day experienced a major depressive episode. He was off work for ten months. He returned to work on a gradual basis, but his reintegration did not go entirely smoothly. He had problems with Canada Post management over a number of issues in the workplace.\n[8] One issue involved the requirement to wear steel toed boots. The repair and maintenance of machinery can be dangerous work. For that reason, Canada Post requires its Technical Service employees to wear steel toed boots on a continuous basis. Mr. Day cannot do so because of a foot condition. Although Canada Post accommodated his foot condition, Mr. Day thought that the way Canada Post handled the process was discriminatory.\n[9] Another dispute between Mr. Day and Canada Post involved the requirement to work shifts at Canada Post. When he was promoted to the EL5 position in 1992, Mr. Day worked the afternoon shift only, from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m.\n[10] In 1997, Canada Post implemented a rotating shift system; from then on all EL5\u2019s, with the exception of the EL5 who held the electronics specialist position, were required to rotate through the following three shifts on a twelve week basis:\nthe day shift, known as Shift 1 which was, at the time of the complaint from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m.; the afternoon shift, known as Shift 2, which was from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m.; and the night shift, known as Shift 3, which was from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m.\n[11] Mr. Day had difficulty with the night shift at Canada Post. From 1996 until the fall of 2001, Mr. Day and his doctors were of the view that working nights aggravated his symptoms of depression. During that period, Canada Post relieved Mr. Day of the obligation to work the night shift whenever he produced a note from his doctor indicating that he could not work nights. He did so on every occasion that he was scheduled to work nights during that period, although he attempted to work a few shifts on two occasions.\n[12] In the fall of 2001, Mr. Day was scheduled to work night shift again. As before, he produced a note from his doctor indicating that he was unable to work night shift. This time, however, Canada Post questioned whether Mr. Day needed to be relieved from the night shift on an ongoing basis. Canada Post temporarily accommodated Mr. Day on the afternoon shift and passed the note on to Medisys, the medical consulting firm that handled Canada Post\u2019s occupational health and safety issues, for further investigation.\n[13] Medisys requested additional medical information. Mr. Day was sent for an Independent Medical Examination (an IME) with Dr. Miller, a psychiatrist in Victoria. On October 11, 2001, Dr. Miller reported that Mr. Day was suffering from major recurrent depression with incomplete remission. He recommended a change in Mr. Day\u2019s medication and cognitive behavioural therapy. Dr. Miller stated that shift work was likely to worsen Mr. Day\u2019s mental state. He was also concerned that there were issues of workplace safety if Mr. Day\u2019s workplace disputes were allowed to drag on unresolved.\n[14] On November 16, 2001, Canada Post thought that Mr. Day\u2019s psychological health had deteriorated to the point that he posed a threat to workplace safety. He was sent home at the end of his shift with a letter stating that he was not fit for work and would be placed on sick leave.\n[15] Mr. Day returned to the workplace on November 21, 2001, with a medical note attesting to his fitness to work. Canada Post did not accept the note and Mr. Day was escorted from the workplace. His supervisor, Mr. Bob Ormerod, informed him he needed confirmation from his doctor that he was complying with Dr. Miller\u2019s treatment recommendations and that he was fit to return to work.\n[16] On December 3, 2001, Mr. Day\u2019s doctor confirmed that Mr. Day was following the treatment recommended by Dr. Miller and that he was progressing well on it. He stated, however, that Mr. Day should work day shift only.\n[17] Dr. Hamm, the Medisys doctor, disagreed with Mr. Day\u2019s doctor that permanent accommodation on day shift was needed. Dr. Hamm thought that Mr. Day was likely to continue to improve on the new drug regime. His symptoms of depression would then go into remission and he would be able to work all three shifts, including the night shift. He provided his opinion to Canada Post in a document known as a Field Report dated December 4, 2001.\n[18] Mr. Day returned to work on December 11, 2001. He was not scheduled to go on night shift until April of 2002. Before that date however, several events occurred which caused Mr. Day concern.\n[19] On January 16, 2002, Canada Post served Mr. Day with a 24 Hour Notice of Interview to discuss his failure to satisfactorily administer the preventative maintenance system. Preventative maintenance is done on the machinery at Canada Post to ensure that it is in good working order. Mr. Day was required to provide information regarding the completion of these duties. He refused to do so, and was disciplined as a result.\n[20] Also in January of 2002, Mr. Day requested permission from Canada Post to switch his twelve week block of afternoon shifts with a fellow EL-5 who was due to go on days. Canada Post denied his request.\n[21] Sometime around April 10, 2001, Mr. Day provided a note to Canada Post from his doctor indicating that, for medical reasons, he was advised not to work nights. Mr. Ormerod, the Superintendent of Engineering and Technical Services in Victoria, informed him that a doctor\u2019s note would not suffice to excuse him from working the night shift. He also stated that the medical information to date indicated that he was capable of working nights and was expected to do so.\n[22] Mr. Day worked part of the night shift on several occasions. Then on April 25, 2002, he left before his shift was over and called in sick the next day. He was suspended for three days without pay for his refusal to work the night shift.\n[23] On May 27, 2002, Canada Post terminated Mr. Day\u2019s employment. The reason cited for the termination was his failure to report for work or to provide an acceptable reason for not doing so.\n[24] Mr. Day grieved his discharge. A settlement agreement was reached pursuant to which Mr. Day returned to work on a gradual basis on May 16, 2003. He worked day shift only.\n[25] In 2004, Canada Post determined that Technical Services was overstaffed by two positions. On September 23, 2004, Canada Post informed the union that two EL5 positions would be declared surplus. This would result in the elimination of Mr. Day\u2019s position.\n[26] Mr. Day became consumed with a desire to prove that his position had been eliminated because he was disabled. His symptoms of depression and anxiety increased. He went on sick leave again on October 27, 2004.\n[27] On November 1, 2004, Mr. Day\u2019s position and that of another EL5 were declared surplus. Mr. Day was informed that he had been transferred to a PO4 position, which is a mail sorter position in the Glanford Mail Processing Plant in Victoria. Mr. Day has never worked in this position since being on sick leave from October 27, 2004.\n[28] In March of 2005 while on sick leave, Mr. Day applied for a vacant MAM11 position in the Technical Services Department in Victoria. This is a mechanics\u2019 position. Mr. Sarbjit Sangha, Manager of Technical Services for Vancouver and Victoria, subsequently informed Mr. Day and his union that the MAM11 position had been deleted. Therefore, Mr. Day was not eligible for the MAM11 position.\n[29] In May of 2006, Mr. Day bid on a letter carrier position in Victoria. Although he was successful in obtaining the route that he requested, he lost it in a subsequent route re\u2011organization. Ultimately, he was assigned to a relief mail carrier position, a position with which he was not happy.\n[30] Mr. Day has been seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. David Swan, in Victoria since September of 2002. Dr. Swan testified that after trying a number of medications, he decided that Mr. Day\u2019s depressive disorder would not respond completely to medication; he continues to have symptoms that will not remit completely. However, Dr. Swan testified that Mr. Day has been fit to return to work on day shift since November of 2004.\n[31] Mr. Day\u2019s obsessive compulsive personality disorder manifests itself in high expectations of himself and others. When his or someone else\u2019s performance falls short of these expectations, it can generate feelings of frustration, anxiety and depression. He tends to dwell on issues that bother him. The disorder does not, however, affect Mr. Day\u2019s ability to act responsibly in the workplace. It does not affect his ability to perform the functions of his job.\nIII. What Are the Issues In the Present Case? [32] The following questions must be answered in the present case:\nDid Canada Post discriminate against Mr. Day with respect to the requirement to wear steel toed boots in April of 2001? Did Canada Post discriminate against Mr. Day when it placed him on sick leave and removed him from the workplace in November of 2001? Did Canada Post discriminate against Mr. Day with regard to the preventative maintenance reports in January of 2002? Was the denial of Mr. Day\u2019s request to exchange shifts with a co-worker in January of 2002 discriminatory? Was the requirement that Mr. Day work the night shift in April 2002 discriminatory? Was the termination of Mr. Day\u2019s employment with Canada Post in May of 2002 discriminatory? Did Canada Post discriminate against Mr. Day in November of 2004 when it eliminated his EL5 position? Was the deletion of the MAM11 position in March of 2005 discriminatory? Was the assignment of Mr. Day to the relief letter carrier position in 2006 discriminatory? Was Mr. Day harassed on the basis of his disability?\nA. What are the Applicable Legal Tests in this Case? [33] When discrimination is alleged, the complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ontario Human Rights Commission et al v. The Borough of Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202). A prima facie case is made out when the complainant presents evidence that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient for a decision in favour of the complainant, in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536).\n[34] Once a prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a satisfactory explanation that demonstrates either that the conduct did not occur as alleged or was non-discriminatory (Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) 2005 FCA 154 at para. 26). If a reasonable explanation is provided by the respondent, it is up to the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination (Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No.1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.)).\n[35] Conduct may be found to be non-discriminatory if the employer establishes that it is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (a BFOR). A BFOR is a rule or practice established in the honest belief that it is necessary to accomplish a valid workplace goal. A requirement will qualify as a BFOR only if the employer establishes that accommodation of the individual\u2019s needs would impose undue hardship considering health, safety and cost (ss. 15(1(a) and 15(2) of the Act).\n[36] In determining whether a BFOR has been established within the meaning of the CHRA, the Tribunal bears in mind the principles set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin) and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer)).\nB. Analysis of the Issues (i) Was the Way that Canada Post Handled the Requirement to Wear Steel-Toed Boots Discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[37] In 1993, Mr. Day provided a medical note indicating that he had a foot condition that prevented him from wearing steel toed boots on a continuous basis. His practice was to wear running shoes and change to steel toed boots only in areas where there was a risk of injury.\n[38] In January of 2001, Mr. Steve Clark, the Coordinator of Technical Services issued a memorandum to all Technical Service employees indicating that they were required to wear steel toed boots at all times in the Technical Services Department.\n[39] Following the release of the memo, Mr. Day was asked to update his medical note. Canada Post issued him a 24 Hour Notice of Interview to discuss his inability to wear steel toed boots. After it was determined there were no alternatives to steel toed boots that Mr. Day could wear on a continuous basis, he was permitted to continue his practice of wearing running shoes in the plant.\n[40] Mr. Day took no issue with the ultimate resolution of the problem. Rather, he complained that the process of having to provide updated medical information, to attend an interview with Canada Post and to look for other boots constituted negative differential treatment on the basis of disability. He felt that Canada Post used the excuse of the steel toed boot requirement to single him out for negative treatment because he was disabled.\n[41] Mr. Iroume, a co-worker of Mr. Day, testified that there were other employees who wore running shoes from time to time in the plant. They were not required to attend an interview about this.\n[42] Mr. Day has established a prima facie case that the issuance of a 24 Hour Notice of Interview for his inability to wear steel toed boots constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability. Mr. Day was led to believe that he might be disciplined for being unable to wear steel toed boots. He was also required to look for steel toed boots that he could wear on a regular and continuous basis when there were apparently other employees who did not always wear steel toed boots.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[43] I am satisfied that Canada Post\u2019s actions with regard to the steel toed boot requirement were based solely on a legitimate safety concern. The repair and maintenance of the large machinery at Canada Post puts workers at risk of injury. Steel toed boots provide protection against injury. Mr. Clark was under orders from the National Health and Safety Committee to vigorously enforce the requirement. He needed to determine if, eight years after the most recent medical information, Mr. Day\u2019s foot condition was still a problem. Mr. Clark also needed to determine if there was any other protective footwear that Mr. Day could wear on a more continuous basis.\n[44] The fact that the clarification of Mr. Day\u2019s accommodation needs was done by way of the 24 Hour Notice process does not, in my view, render it adverse differential treatment. Mr. Clark explained that at Canada Post, 24 Hour Notices and Interviews do not constitute disciplinary action. Rather, they provide an opportunity for Canada Post to discuss concerns with an employee and for the employee, and his or her union representative, to respond to these concerns. If a satisfactory resolution to the problem is arrived at during the interview, disciplinary action does not follow and the notice is not placed in the employee\u2019s personal file. A satisfactory resolution of Canada Post\u2019s concerns was achieved in Mr. Day\u2019s case. He was fully accommodated.\n[45] While it may be true, as Mr. Iroume testified, that the Technical Service employees do not always wear their steel toed boots, Mr. Day and Mr. Clark gave evidence that Mr. Day was the only Technical Service employee who had a regular and consistent practice of wearing running shoes and changing to boots only in certain areas of the plant.\n[46] I accept Mr. Clark\u2019s explanation that it was Mr. Day\u2019s regular practice of wearing running shoes that prompted him to question whether anything could be done to increase the amount of time that he spent wearing protective footwear. He did not target Mr. Day for negative treatment based on his disability; he had a genuine health and safety concern that he needed to raise with Mr. Day.\n[47] Canada Post has, therefore, provided a satisfactory explanation with regard to Mr. Day\u2019s first allegation.\n(ii) Did Canada Post discriminate against Mr. Day when it placed him on sick leave and removed him from the workplace in November of 2001? The Prima Facie Case\n[48] On November 16, 2001, Mr. Day was due to attend an interview regarding work performance concerns that Canada Post had raised in a 24 Hour Notice of Interview. Instead, the interview was cancelled before it began. Mr. Day was sent home at the end of his shift with a letter saying that he was being placed on sick leave.\n[49] Mr. Day testified that he was shocked at being placed on sick leave. He did not feel ill. He thought it was part of Canada Post\u2019s plan to get rid of him because he was disabled.\n[50] On November 21, 2001, Mr. Day returned to work with a note from his doctor indicating that he was well and able to work. He worked the shift, but at the end of it he was approached by Mr. Ormerod who called his name out from across the plant floor. When Mr. Ormerod reached Mr. Day, he told Mr. Day that he should not be at work, that his doctor\u2019s note was insufficient, and that he was to leave immediately. Mr. Ormerod then escorted him from the building. Mr. Day testified that he was very embarrassed by this incident.\n[51] Mr. Day testified that one of the most upsetting parts of this series of incidents for him was the fact that he did not understand the reason that he was being sent home. The letter he was given on November 16, 2001 indicated that Canada Post had a bona fide concern with respect to his fitness for duty based on observations and the professional opinion of Dr. Hamm.\n[52] The letter from Canada Post given to Mr. Day on November 21, 2001, the day that he was escorted from the workplace, indicated that he would not be permitted to return to work until he provided medical proof that he was following the course of treatment recommended by Dr. Miller in the IME Report.\n[53] However, neither Mr. Day nor his doctor received Dr. Miller\u2019s IME Report until November 23, 2001, and it was not until his union representatives met with Canada Post on November 28, 2001 that Mr. Day became aware that Canada Post thought he posed a safety risk at work.\n[54] Mr. Day testified that he had never been violent towards himself or others in the workplace. He stated that if he was a risk at all it would be with respect to his own safety. He stated that although he was upset about the interview on November 16, 2001, his behaviour was slow rather than agitated because he had taken anti-anxiety medication to calm himself. He thought that Canada Post was not justified in placing him on sick leave or removing him from the workplace in November of 2001.\n[55] I find that Mr. Day has established a prima facie case under s. 7(b) of the Act that he was treated adversely in the course of employment on the basis of his disability. Mr. Day was deemed by Canada Post to be a safety risk and unfit to work when his own physician was of the view that he was, in fact, able to work. He was denied the right to return to work even though he had presented proof of his fitness. He was subjected to a humiliating removal from the workplace in front of his peers. Neither he nor his physician was provided with the information they needed to address the concerns that gave rise to Canada Post\u2019s removal from the workplace.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[56] Canada Post argued that the evidence at the time indicated that Mr. Day posed a serious risk to his own safety and to the safety of others in the workplace. It would have constituted undue hardship to have permitted him to remain in the workplace or to have informed him of the full extent of the reasons for his removal. Therefore, placing Mr. Day on sick leave and refusing to permit him to return to work in November 2001 constituted a BFOR, according to Canada Post.\n[57] According to sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the Act, the Complainant\u2019s removal from the workplace cannot be considered to be based on a BFOR unless the Respondent can establish that accommodation of his needs would impose undue hardship, having regard to health, safety and cost.\n[58] Risk is a factor to be considered in determining whether undue hardship would result from the accommodation (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Grismer), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868, at para. 30). Where safety is at issue, both the magnitude of the risk and the identity of those who bear it are relevant considerations (Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Comm.) (1990), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417at para 62).\n[59] I find that the evidence in the present case established that on November 16, 2001, both the severity and magnitude of the risk to Mr. Day\u2019s safety and\/or the safety of others in the workplace was such that Canada Post had no other option than to send Mr. Day home.\n[60] Dr. Miller\u2019s report indicated that Mr. Day\u2019s psychological health was very unstable at that time. He was concerned that Mr. Day might become violent if his workplace grievances could not be resolved.\n[61] One day prior to sending him home on sick leave Canada Post had issued Mr. Day with a 24 Hour Notice of Interview detailing a list of concerns about Mr. Day\u2019s work performance. Ms. Jenica Epp, the Medisys nurse, testified that Mr. Day came to see her before his interview on November 16, 2001. She testified that he was tense, anxious-looking and distraught. She stated that he had a pronounced eye and facial tick. She was uncomfortable and frightened in his presence.\n[62] Mr. Clark also testified that in the weeks prior to November 16, 2001, he noticed that Mr. Day was more agitated and tense than usual. Mr. Clark stated that he was concerned about Mr. Day\u2019s psychological stability at that time.\n[63] I accept that Canada Post has an obligation to assure the safety and well-being of all the employees on its premises. Therefore, employees who pose a safety risk to themselves or others are removed from the workplace and are not permitted to return until they have established, by way of acceptable medical evidence, that they no longer pose such a threat. Accommodating Mr. Day in the workplace would have constituted undue hardship in that it would have exposed others and\/or Mr. Day to the serious potential of significant harm.\n[64] Before permitting Mr. Day to return to work, Canada Post needed assurances from Mr. Day\u2019s physician that he was receiving the treatment recommended by Dr. Miller and that he was no longer a safety risk. Neither of the notes provided by Mr. Day provided that assurance. Again, given the magnitude and severity of the risk to worker safety in this case, I find that it would have created undue hardship to have permitted Mr. Day to return to work on November 21, 2001.\n[65] However, the inquiry as to whether the duty to accommodate has been met does not end there. There is both a procedural and a substantive component involved in the duty (Meiorin, at para 66). The Supreme Court has directed that the procedure adopted to assess the issue of accommodation should be considered separately from the substantive component when determining whether or not the duty has been discharged.\n[66] A failure to meet one of the two components does not necessarily result in a violation of the Act. Both the procedure of the inquiry and the substantive results of those inquiries should be considered when determining whether an employer has met its obligations under the Act (Meiorin, at para 66; Datt v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Canada Ltd. 2007 BCHRT 324; Gordy v. Painter's Lodge (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225)\n[67] In Irvine v. Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), 2005 FCA 432, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that the procedural component of the duty to accommodate requires a fair assessment of the available medical evidence in relation to the complainant\u2019s fitness for duty.\n[68] Fairness in the accommodation process is not, in my view, limited to a fair assessment of the complainant\u2019s fitness for duty. Rather, the notion of fairness extends to all facets of the accommodation process. It requires that the inherent worth and dignity of the individual be respected throughout the process to the point of undue hardship (Meiorin, at para 62).\n[69] The question in the present case then is whether Mr. Day was treated fairly in the application of the standard identified above, that is removal from the workplace when there is a risk of violent or dangerous behaviour. For the following reasons I find that he was not.\n1. Neither Mr. Day, nor his physician was provided, on a timely basis, with a copy of the IME Report which formed the basis of the decision to send Mr. Day home.\n[70] Mr. Day was seen by the IME psychiatrist, Dr. Miller, on October 11, 2001. On several occasions in early November, Mr. Day requested the IME Report from both Canada Post and Medisys. His requests went unheeded; the report was not sent to Mr. Day\u2019s doctor until November 20, 2001.\n[71] Mr. Ormerod explained that the IME report was sent to Mr. Day\u2019s doctor on November 20, 2001. As a result of a problem with the doctor\u2019s fax machine, the report did not reach Mr. Day\u2019s doctor until November 23, 2001. However, no explanation was provided as to why the Report was not sent to Mr. Day\u2019s physician prior to November 20, 2001.\n[72] As a result of the failure to provide the IME Report on a timely basis, Mr. Day had no idea until November 23, 2001, when his doctor received the Report, that Dr. Miller thought he was not receiving proper treatment for his depression and that there was a concern about his safety at work. He felt completely blind-sided by the notice that he was unfit for work.\n[73] As a further result of Canada Post\u2019s failure to provide Mr. Day with the information he needed on a timely basis, he suffered the embarrassment of being escorted from the building on November 21, 2001, because his doctor\u2019s note did not respond to Canada Post\u2019s concerns. Again, Mr. Day had no idea what Canada Post was looking for because his doctor had not yet received the IME report.\n[74] It cannot be said with any certainty if the delivery of the IME Report to Mr. Day\u2019s doctor on a timely basis might have produced a different result in this case. However, based on Mr. Day\u2019s statement that he began the treatment recommended by Dr. Miller immediately upon receiving the report, and his doctor\u2019s statements that he responded well to the medication, it is entirely conceivable that the whole series of events in November might have been avoided had the report been provided right after it was received by Medisys.\n2. Mr. Day\u2019s doctor was not informed that Mr. Day was being placed on sick leave on November 16, 2001\n[75] Mr. Ormerod and Mr. Clark, who were Mr. Day\u2019s supervisors, testified that Mr. Day was not informed about the Corporation\u2019s concerns with respect to his safety, nor did they involve him in the decision to send him home on November 16, 2001 because they were worried that this would further upset him. Mr. Clark stated that he said nothing to Mr. Day because no one likes to hear that he is considered to be a safety risk. I accept that on November 16, 2001 Canada Post was facing a critical situation, and that a difficult judgment call had to be made about what information to provide to Mr. Day. Therefore, the decision not to inform Mr. Day of the full extent of the reasons for his removal may have been justified.\n[76] However, Canada Post did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why Mr. Day\u2019s doctor was not informed that there were serious concerns about his mental health and that he was thought to pose a safety risk to himself or others on November 16, 2001. Mr. Ormerod stated that information regarding an employee\u2019s mental health and safety should not be provided directly to the employee by his or her employer, but by a medical person.\n[77] Why then were Canada Post\u2019s serious concerns regarding Mr. Day\u2019s mental health not immediately communicated to Mr. Day\u2019s physician?\n[78] Dr. Hamm stated that he did not inform Mr. Day\u2019s doctor about what had happened on November 16, 2001, because he did not think that the situation was an emergency. He simply thought that Mr. Day needed to be at home where he could compose himself. In my view, however, if the situation was urgent enough to send Mr. Day home without notice to him about the full extent of the reasons, then it was urgent enough to alert Mr. Day\u2019s doctor. After all, Mr. Day\u2019s own health was potentially at risk. Dr. Miller\u2019s report was vague with respect to Mr. Day\u2019s potential for violence. It certainly could be interpreted to mean that he might direct the violence toward himself. The failure to inform Mr. Day\u2019s doctor that he was being sent home because he posed a safety risk shows, in my view, a rather callous disregard for Mr. Day\u2019s well-being.\n[79] I find, therefore, that Canada Post did not treat Mr. Day fairly in November of 2001; he was treated as a safety risk rather than as a human being whose needs for information and support should be respected. Although accommodating Mr. Day in the workplace was not possible given the safety risk that he posed, Canada Post did not provide a satisfactory explanation as why it did not provide Mr. Day and his physician with timely disclosure of the IME and the Field Report. Similarly, it was not established that informing Mr. Day\u2019s physician of Canada Post\u2019s concerns with respect to his safety would have caused undue hardship.\n[80] As a result, Canada Post did fulfill the procedural component of the duty to accommodate. Although a failure to fulfill the procedural component of the duty to accommodate will not necessarily result in a violation of the Act, I think that in this case the impact of the failure, both in terms of the outcome of the events in November 2001 and its impact on Mr. Day\u2019s dignity and self-worth, warrant such a finding. Canada Post failed to establish, pursuant to ss. 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the Act, that it accommodated Mr. Day\u2019s needs to the point of undue hardship. Mr. Day\u2019s allegation with regard to the November events is therefore substantiated.\n(iii) Was the requirement that EL5\u2019s hand in preventative maintenance slips each Friday of the week discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[81] As an EL5, Mr. Day was required to assign and supervise preventative maintenance (pm) duties on the day shift. The work was assigned on Mondays. It was expected to be completed by the end of the week unless the work was extensive or the plant was busy. Reports regarding the status of the work (pm slips) were entered into a computerized system that monitored the preventative maintenance work done on machines all across Canada. The EL5\u2019s collected the pm slips for the employees that they supervised on the day shift and handed them in along with their own.\n[82] From 1999 to 2001, the EL5\u2019s could submit the pm slips to management for input into the computer system on the following Monday, after the work was assigned. That policy changed some time in 2001. By the time Mr. Day reached the day shift in January of 2002, the expectation was that EL-5\u2019s would submit the pm slips on the Friday of the same week that the work was assigned.\n[83] Mr. Day disagreed with the change in policy. He also disagreed with the manner in which the change was implemented. He thought that it was part of Canada Post\u2019s campaign to treat him differently because he was disabled.\n[84] Mr. Day did not hand in the pm slips for his subordinates on Friday, January 11, 2002 as required. He handed in only his own. Canada Post subsequently issued Mr. Day with a 24 Hour Notice of Interview to discuss his failure to satisfactorily administer the pm system.\n[85] At the interview, it was pointed out to Mr. Day that he was not being singled out; all of the EL5\u2019s were required to hand in their own and those of their subordinates on Friday. Mr. Day continued to hand in only his own pm slips. As a result, he was suspended for three days without pay.\n[86] Mr. Iroume testified on behalf of Mr. Day. He stated that when he came onto days in April of 2002, he too failed to hand in all of the pm slips on Friday. He was also given a 24 Hour Notice of Interview and told to hand the pm slips in on time. Mr. Iroume testified that following the interview, he conformed to Canada Post\u2019s requirements. He stated, however, that Canada Post issued him with a 24 Hour Notice and then interviewed him solely to make Canada Post\u2019s actions with respect to Mr. Day seem legitimate.\n[87] Mr. Iroume\u2019s evidence on this point was not credible. He admitted that prior to the interview he was not complying with the requirement; he was only handing in about 15% of the pm slips for his shift. After the interview, when he was given a direct order by Canada Post to get the pm slips in, that figure moved to 60 to 70%. Mr. Day, however, did not comply with Canada Post\u2019s directive. Accordingly, he was disciplined.\n[88] There was no credible evidence to support the contention that Mr. Day was treated differently from other employees on the basis of his disability with regard to the preventative maintenance system. Therefore, Mr. Day has failed to establish a prima facie case on this ground.\n(iv) Was the Denial of a Shift Change between Mr. Iroume and Mr. Day discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[89] In January of 2002, Mr. Day attempted to switch his twelve week block of afternoon shifts with Mr. Guido Iroume, a fellow EL-5 who was due to go on days. Mr. Iroume preferred afternoons and Mr. Day preferred day shift for family and health related reasons. The request was denied.\n[90] Mr. Day testified that switching an entire twelve week shift block was a common practice at Canada Post. Mr. Iroume testified that while shift exchanges were common, the frequency of the practice diminished after the release of an arbitral decision by Arbitrator Blasina in April of 2002. In that decision, Arbitrator Blasina held that the Corporation was required to rotate the EL5\u2019s through all three shifts.\n[91] Mr. Day argued that Canada Post\u2019s denial of the shift exchange request constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of his disability. However, neither Mr. Day nor Mr. Iroume provided examples of people who had exchanged an entire shift. Moreover, Mr. Iroume\u2019s testimony strongly suggested that if there was such a practice, it changed after April 2002. At that point neither Mr. Day nor his colleagues were permitted to switch an entire shift block. There was no evidence to suggest that the denial of the shift exchange was based on Mr. Day\u2019s disability.\n[92] Counsel for Mr. Day argued that the denial of the request for a shift exchange constituted adverse effect discrimination since Mr. Day was unable, by reason of his disability to work the afternoon shift.\n[93] Mr. Day however, testified that he did not have any trouble working the afternoon shift. He stated that at that point in time, he was looking to be relieved from the requirement to work night shift, not the afternoon shift. Therefore, I find that Mr. Day did not establish a prima facie case that the denial of his request for a shift change, or the requirement that he work the afternoon shift in January of 2002 constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability.\n(v) Was the requirement that Mr. Day work the night shift discriminatory? The Prima Facie case\n[94] From 1997 until April of 2002, Mr. Day was relieved of the requirement to work night shift at Canada Post whenever he presented a doctor\u2019s note indicating that his disability prevented him from doing so. In April of 2002, however, Canada Post insisted that he work the night shift because, in the Corporation\u2019s view, the most recent medical evidence indicated that his disability did not prevent him from doing so.\n[95] Mr. Day disagreed that he was capable of working the night shift. He thought that the medical evidence clearly established that working the night shift made him sick. Therefore, he did not work the night shift as he was required to do in April and May of 2002. Canada Post issued him with a three day suspension as a result.\n[96] Mr. Day complained that Canada Post\u2019s requirement that he work night shift and the discipline that it issued to him for his inability to do so constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of his disability contrary to s. 7(b) of the Act.\n[97] Based on the following evidence, I find that Mr. Day has established a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment with regard to this allegation.\n[98] There was medical support for Mr. Day\u2019s assertion that night shift aggravated his symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the IME Report of October 11, 2001, Dr. Miller indicated that shift work was likely to worsen rather than improve Mr. Day\u2019s mental state. He stated that Mr. Day\u2019s depression was not in complete remission and had not been adequately treated.\n[99] In a Field Report dated October 30, 2001, Dr. Hamm of Medisys agreed that night shift duties should be avoided. He also stated that Mr. Day should follow Dr. Miller\u2019s treatment recommendations.\n[100] In December 3, 2001, Mr. Day\u2019s doctor indicated that although Mr. Day was responding well to the new drug treatment and was capable of returning to work, he should work day shift only. In apparent contradiction to his previous Field Report of October 30, 2001, Dr. Hamm disagreed. He stated that he did not support permanent accommodation on day shift.\n[101] In January of 2002, Mr. Day began seeing a new family doctor by the name of Dr. Cook because his previous doctor had left the country. Dr. Cook provided Mr. Day with a note dated April 10, 2002, which stated this patient is advised not to work nights for medical reasons. Mr. Day and Ms. Andrew, the grievance officer for CUPW, testified that the note was faxed to Canada Post on April 15, 2002, from the union office.\n[102] Mr. Ormerod denied having received this note. However, Mr. Clark\u2019s evidence on this issue was more convincing. He stated that either he or Mr. Ormerod had received the note and that if he had received the note he would have passed it on to Mr. Ormerod.\n[103] Moreover, on April 15, 2002, Mr. Ormerod wrote to Mr. Day saying that his doctor\u2019s note dated April 15, 2002 would not be sufficient to avoid night shift. It is unlikely that Mr. Ormerod would have made such a statement had he not received the note. Therefore, I find that Mr. Ormerod received a note from Mr. Day\u2019s doctor indicating that, for medical reasons, he was advised not to work the night shift.\n[104] Mr. Day presented medical evidence to Canada Post indicating that he was unable to work the night shift in April of 2002 as a result of his disability. Canada Post refused to accept the note from his doctor and instead continued to insist that he work night shift. The evidence led by Mr. Day suggests that he was punished because he could not work the night shift. On that basis, I find that Mr. Day has made out a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[105] After a careful review of the evidence in this case, I have concluded that Canada Post did not discriminate against Mr. Day in imposing a three day suspension for his refusal to work the night shift. The Corporation had sound medical evidence indicating that Mr. Day could, in fact, work the night shift. However, giving Mr. Day the benefit of any doubt that might remain in that regard, I find that Canada Post offered him a number of reasonable offers of accommodation. Mr. Day chose not to accept these offers. If Canada Post had a duty to accommodate Mr. Day (and I am not convinced that it did), it discharged that duty.\n(i) Mr. Day did not require accommodation\n[106] Although the medical evidence up to December of 2001, suggested that Mr. Day was not able to work night shift, there was consistent medical evidence from Dr. Hamm and Mr. Day\u2019s new physician, Dr. Cook, that Mr. Day\u2019s inability to work nights was likely due to the fact that, up to that point, he had not been properly treated for his depression. In April of 2002, however, the evidence indicated that Mr. Day had responded well to the drug treatment program recommended by Dr. Miller and that he was able to work nights. I will now review that evidence.\n[107] In his IME Report of October 2001, Dr. Miller stated that the herbal remedies that Mr. Day had been taking on the recommendation of his previous doctor, Dr. Rozwadowski, were ineffective. He prescribed not only a change in pharmacological treatment, but also cognitive behavioural therapy to deal with his ongoing work issues.\n[108] Dr. Hamm was qualified as an expert in Occupational Medicine at the hearing. He testified that he had extensive experience working with patients with depression. Provided they were properly treated and their symptoms were in remission, these patients did not have any difficulty with shift work, including the night shift, in Dr. Hamm\u2019s experience.\n[109] As a result of a provision in the contract between Medisys and Canada Post, Dr. Hamm was not permitted to meet with Mr. Day. However, he conducted a thorough review of Mr. Day\u2019s file and was in contact with Mr. Day\u2019s physicians.\n[110] In December of 2001, Dr. Hamm consulted with Mr. Day\u2019s doctor at the time and was told that Mr. Day was doing well on the medication that Dr. Miller had recommended; his condition had improved and he was back to work.\n[111] On that basis, Dr. Hamm formed the opinion in December of 2001 that, given the improvement in Mr. Day\u2019s mental health, he should be able to work the night shift by April of 2002. It was for that reason that Dr. Hamm told Canada Post that he did not support permanent accommodation on day shift in the Field Report dated December 4, 2001.\n[112] In a letter to the union dated April 18, 2002, Dr. Hamm explained the apparent discrepancy between his recommendation to avoid night shift in the October 2001 Field Report, and his recommendation to continue with his usual duties including night shift in his December 2001 Field Report. In the letter, Dr. Hamm stated that he had supported temporary accommodation on day shift in October 2001 to give Mr. Day time to adjust to his new medication and for his symptoms to remit. However, it was not his intention at that time to recommend permanent accommodation on day shift to Canada Post. After speaking with Mr. Day\u2019s doctor in December of 2001, Dr. Hamm was of the view that Mr. Day was progressing nicely and should be able to work the night shift as many of his other patients with depression had succeeded in doing.\n[113] Dr. Cook, whom Mr. Day began seeing in January of 2002, provided important testimony at the hearing regarding Mr. Day\u2019s ability to work night shift during the period from January 2002 to May 29, 2002. Dr. Cook testified that he was, and had always been of the view that Mr. Day was medically capable of working the night shift on the condition that his health was monitored while he was doing so. He thought that Mr. Day\u2019s problems were not medical in nature; rather they related to his ongoing disputes with Canada Post. Dr. Cook was of the view that Mr. Day needed the help of a mediator or a counselor with a specialization in workplace disputes, rather than a physician or a psychiatrist.\n[114] Dr. Cook testified that, from his first visit with Mr. Day in January of 2002, it was clear to him that Mr. Day wanted nothing more from him than medical support for the position that he could not work the night shift. Dr. Cook was uncomfortable with this. Like Dr. Hamm, he testified that he had many patients who had depression who could work the night shift provided they were being properly treated and followed by a physician.\n[115] In a letter dated March 18, 2002, Mr. Day told Canada Post that Dr. Cook had advised him not to work night shift due to his medical condition. Dr. Cook, however, testified that he would not have said this because he did not believe that to be the case. When Mr. Day first asked him to provide a note in March of 2002 indicating that he could not work night shift, he refused to do so because he thought it was a workplace dispute rather than a medical issue.\n[116] Nonetheless, on April 10, 2002, Dr. Cook did provide Mr. Day with a note stating that he was advised not to work nights for medical reasons. Dr. Cook testified that he did not know why he had provided the note to Mr. Day. He agreed with counsel for the Respondent in cross-examination that he did so to get Mr. Day off his back. Dr. Cook\u2019s testimony strongly suggested that the note was not an authentic expression of his medical views, but rather was a response to intense pressure to support Mr. Day\u2019s request to be excused from working the night shift.\n[117] Mr. Day\u2019s testimony leant further support to Dr. Cook\u2019s statement that Mr. Day was interested only in obtaining support for his belief that he should not work night shift. He testified that he had always had trouble with Dr. Cook because the doctor did not seem to understand his situation. Mr. Day stated that he had a history of being supported by his physicians and Dr. Cook did not follow that pattern. It was evident from Mr. Day\u2019s testimony that he had difficulty with the fact that Dr. Cook would not provide his unqualified support to avoidance of night shift.\n[118] As a result, in May of 2002, Mr. Day changed physicians from Dr. Cook to Dr. Cooper. Dr. Cooper testified that Mr. Day should not have been required to work night shift in April of 2002. In Dr. Cooper\u2019s view, the night shift exacerbated Mr. Day\u2019s symptoms of depression. Dr. Cooper, however, was not Mr. Day\u2019s physician during the relevant time period of this allegation. He acknowledged that Dr. Cook would have been in a better position to judge Mr. Day\u2019s mental health at the time.\n[119] What explanation did Canada Post provide for the fact that Mr. Day\u2019s note of April 10, 2002 was not accepted as proof that he could not work the night shift? Mr. Ormerod testified that Canada Post had decided that medical notes on prescription pads would no longer suffice to excuse Mr. Day from night shift. More information was needed to determine why the treatment recommended by Dr. Miller was not working. This was explained to Mr. Day and the union in a meeting on April 22, 2001.\n[120] Mr. Ormerod stated that Mr. Day had also been informed, as early as February 28, 2002, that Canada Post expected that the drug treatment program that he was following would lead to his ability to work the night shift. He had had ample time, therefore, to seek medical advice to the contrary, if that was appropriate. He had not provided this medical information. A prescription pad note would not suffice as proof of his inability to work the night shift because it did not provide enough information.\n[121] In my view, this was a reasonable position for Canada Post to take. It did not render Canada Post\u2019s assessment of Mr. Day\u2019s fitness unfair. Mr. Day knew the Corporation\u2019s position with respect to his fitness to work the night shift. He also knew that, since the fall of 2001, Canada Post had ceased to accept medical notes on prescription pads to excuse him from night shift. The fact that he was unable to provide more medical information from his doctor about his inability to work night shift reflects, in my view, the fact that his doctor at the time thought that he could work night shift, notwithstanding the note that he provided to the contrary.\n[122] I agree with counsel for the Respondent that, had the April 10 note from Dr. Cook been provided to Medisys, the likely result would have been that Dr. Hamm would have contacted Dr. Cook and learned that the latter felt pressured by Mr. Day to provide the note. In fact, Dr. Hamm did contact Dr. Cook on April 25, 2002, and discussed Mr. Day\u2019s ability to work the night shift. Dr. Hamm testified that Dr. Cook told him that Mr. Day was medically fit to work the night shift. Dr. Hamm communicated this information to Canada Post.\n[123] Consequently, on April 25, 2002 Mr. Day was given a three day suspension without pay for being absent without leave. Given the medical evidence that Canada Post had regarding Mr. Day\u2019s ability to work the night shift at the time, I find that the discipline was not discriminatory. The Respondent has provided a satisfactory explanation to the prima facie case raised by Mr. Day. There was sound medical evidence establishing that Mr. Day was able to work the night shift in April of 2002. The three day suspension was based solely on Mr. Day\u2019s refusal to work the night shift, not on his disability.\n(ii) If Mr. Day did require accommodation, Canada Post provided reasonable offers of accommodation\n[124] If there was any doubt, however, as to whether Mr. Day was able to work the night shift, I am satisfied that Canada Post provided Mr. Day with reasonable offers of accommodation.\n[125] The Supreme Court has stated that accommodation is a multi-party responsibility. The complainant must do his or her part to facilitate the accommodation process. When an employer has initiated a proposal that is reasonable and would, if implemented, fulfill the duty to accommodate, the complainant has a duty to accept the proposal (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 at paras. 43-44).\n[126] On April 22, 2002, Mr. Ormerod offered Mr. Day three options. The first was that he would be permitted to take leave without pay or annual leave for the duration of his night shift, but he would not be permitted to work part shifts and take the remainder in leave. The other two options were that Mr. Day could work the regular night shift, or he could work a modified shift from 6 pm to 2 am on the condition that he obtained an appointment with a psychiatrist by 3 pm on April 26, 2002.\n[127] Mr. Day did not accept any of the options offered by Canada Post. He stated that the 6 pm to 2 am shift was not a reasonable proposal because it was conditional upon obtaining an appointment with a specialist by April 26, 2002. Mr. Day stated that this was impossible, given the shortage of mental health specialists in Victoria. In the spirit of cooperation, Mr. Day could well have made the effort to obtain an appointment and then indicated to Canada Post if he could not make the deadline. Mr. Ormerod testified that any such effort to obtain an appointment in April would have been acceptable to him. Instead, Mr. Day did not attempt to obtain an appointment with a psychiatrist until the middle of May which was well past the deadline.\n[128] Mr. Day argued that a suggestion made by his doctor on April 25, 2002 to attend a sleep lab in Vancouver constituted an effort to cooperate with Canada Post\u2019s accommodation efforts. Canada Post\u2019s refusal of the suggestion demonstrated a failure to accommodate him to the point of undue hardship, according to Mr. Day.\n[129] Dr. Hamm testified that he investigated the sleep lab suggestion and ultimately rejected it because none of the many physicians that Mr. Day had seen had ever diagnosed him with a primary sleep disorder. Rather, his sleep difficulty was a symptom of his unremitted depression. Therefore, Dr. Hamm decided that there was no justification for expending the time and resources to pursue the question of whether Mr. Day had a sleep disorder. Based on the evidence, I agree that this was not a reasonable option.\n[130] Mr. Day stated that he was advised by Dr. Cook not to work the 6 pm to 2 am shift because it would put his health at risk. However, Dr. Cook did not corroborate this statement. Dr. Cook stated that he was not aware that the Post Office offered Mr. Day a modified shift. If he had been asked about it, he would have advised him to try it. Mr. Day tried the modified shift once and rejected it.\n[131] The situation is similar to the facts in Jeffrey v. Dofasco Inc. (No. 4) 2004 HRTO 5; aff\u2019d: 2007 CanLII 41275 (ON S.C.D.C). In that case, the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal found that the complainant, who was suffering from myofacial pain and some symptoms of fibromyalgia, could have attempted a job as a switchboard operator. The Tribunal found that while she may have experienced some pain in attempting the switchboard position, she would have been in no danger or harm\u2019s way by doing the job. Her chronic pain was not so disabling as to prevent her from trying the job. She failed to try the job not because she was unable to do so but because she chose not to try it. The Tribunal found that there was no medical reason why she could not have tried the switchboard job.\n[132] I think that the situation in Jeffrey is analagous to the present case. There was no medical reason as to why Mr. Day could not have tried the 6 pm to 2 am shift beyond the one occasion on which he worked it. Indeed, Mr. Day testified that when he worked the afternoon shift from 3 pm to 11 pm, he was often called upon to work overtime until 1 or 2 am. He stated, however, that he was able to cope with the afternoon shift. Therefore, I find that the 6 pm to 2 am shift was a reasonable offer of accommodation. Granted it was conditional upon obtaining an appointment with a psychiatrist, but there was no reason why Mr. Day could not have made efforts to do so before mid-May.\n[133] Finally, the 6 pm to 2 am shift was not the only option that Canada Post offered to Mr. Day. If he did not feel that he could work the 6 pm to 2 am shift, he could have opted for leave without pay or annual leave for the duration of the twelve week shift. This would have provided him with ample time to obtain medical information from a specialist before he was due to go on night shift again. I find that this too was a reasonable proposal for accommodation. Mr. Day did not accept either of these options. It was clear from his testimony that he would accept no other proposal than that he be excused from working the night shift on a permanent basis.\n[134] Counsel for Mr. Day suggested that Mr. Day\u2019s obsessive compulsive personality disorder may have been a factor in his inability to cooperate with Canada Post\u2019s efforts to accommodate him. On that basis it was argued that Canada Post should have accommodated this condition by granting Mr. Day his preferred option \u2013 the day shift. However, Canada Post had no knowledge that Mr. Day had obsessive compulsive personality disorder. Dr. Hamm testified that he did not provide this information to Canada Post because he was of the view, based on his clinical experience, that Mr. Day\u2019s disorder did not present any work restrictions. Mr. Day\u2019s own psychiatrist testified that Mr. Day\u2019s judgment and ability to act responsibly in the workplace were not affected by the disorder.\n[135] I find therefore, that there was no merit in the argument that Mr. Day\u2019s obsessive compulsive personality disorder prevented him from being able to see Canada Post\u2019s offers of accommodation as reasonable proposals. Rather, Mr. Day\u2019s testimony demonstrated that his refusal to accept the offers was based on his belief that he had a legal right to be relieved of the obligation to work night shift on a permanent basis. The law is clear, however, that an employee is not entitled to hold out for the perfect solution (Renaud, at p. 995). Mr. Day had an obligation to accept one of the reasonable proposals offered by Canada Post even if it was not exactly what he wanted. He did not do so. Therefore, I find that if there was any doubt as to whether Mr. Day was able to work the night shift, Canada Post fulfilled its obligation to accommodate Mr. Day.\n(vi) Was the Termination of Mr. Day\u2019s Employment with Canada Post discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[136] Mr. Day did not report for work on the night shift after his three day suspension was over; instead, he called in sick on May 1, 2002. He saw Dr. Cook on May 2, 2002 who said that, rather than writing a note, he would telephone Dr. Hamm.\n[137] Mr. Day was served with a 24 Hour Notice of Interview for his failure to report for work on May 1, 2002. The interview was scheduled to take place on May 2, 2002. Mr. Day testified that he did not attend work or the interview because he was sick. He informed Canada Post of this on May 2, 2002.\n[138] On May 14, 2002, Mr. Day wrote to Rob Taylor, the Manager of Mail Operations, that he had been to see his doctor, he was having adjustments made to his medications and, he was waiting for a referral to a psychiatrist. Mr. Day also stated that his doctor was filling out forms for disability insurance and that he would be forwarding those documents to Mr. Taylor presently.\n[139] On May 22, 2002, Mr. Day received a letter from Mr. Ormerod indicating that since he had failed to report for work, or to provide an acceptable reason for his failure to report, he was recommending Mr. Day\u2019s release from Canada Post.\n[140] On May 27, 2002, Mr. Taylor discharged Mr. Day from his employment with Canada Post based on his failure to report for work or to provide an acceptable explanation for his failure to do so.\n[141] Section 7(a) of the Act stipulates that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Mr. Day informed Canada Post that he was unable to work because of his disability. Knowing this, Canada Post discharged Mr. Day from his employment. On that basis, I find that Mr. Day has established a prima facie case that Canada Post refused to continue to employ him on the basis of his disability.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[142] Canada Post argued that Mr. Day\u2019s disability had nothing to do with the imposition of the discharge. Rather, Canada Post dismissed Mr. Day on the basis of his failure to report for work on his scheduled shift and to provide medical documentation to substantiate his illness.\n[143] The evidence in this case supports Canada Post\u2019s explanation. Mr. Day did not attend work as he was scheduled to do on May 1, 2002. He saw Dr. Cook on May 2, 2002 and asked for a note to support his absence from work. Dr. Cook refused to provide that note.\n[144] Rather, Dr. Cook spoke directly with Dr. Hamm by phone on May 7, 2002. Dr. Hamm\u2019s note to file about that conversation indicates that Dr. Cook informed him that he had increased Mr. Day\u2019s medication. It states that Dr. Cook was wondering whether he should be on long term disability leave. Dr. Hamm concluded his note by stating: I gather he will be supporting Mr. Day being off work due to his psychiatric diagnosis.\n[145] Dr. Cook testified that he did not, in fact, support Mr. Day\u2019s absence from work. For that reason, he did not provide a note or medical information to that effect. He stated unequivocally, both in examination in chief and in cross-examination, that he did not think that Mr. Day had a psychiatric problem that required him to be off work; he thought that Mr. Day needed the help of a counselor or mediator to deal with his workplace issues. He never recommended to Mr. Day that he should be off work and he did not support his request for long term disability leave.\n[146] Dr. Cook testified that during the telephone conversation with Dr. Hamm on May 7, 2002, he and Dr. Hamm discussed ideas to help Mr. Day with his ongoing work problems. Dr. Cook stated that one of the ideas that he discussed with Dr. Hamm was putting Mr. Day on long term disability leave. Dr. Cook testified that he did not think that being off work was a good idea. However, he considered it because he felt some sympathy for Mr. Day, and this was what Mr. Day seemed to want. Dr. Cook also testified that he had increased Mr. Day\u2019s medication as a way of providing support to Mr. Day. He did not think, however, that Mr. Day\u2019s medical condition had changed from the time he first saw him in January of 2002, until May 29, 2002, the date of his last visit. For that reason he refused to provide the medical documentation that Mr. Day wanted to support his absence from work.\n[147] Accordingly, I find that Canada Post has refuted Mr. Day\u2019s prima facie case. There was no medical evidence provided to substantiate Mr. Day\u2019s statement that he was unable to work on May 1, 2002 by reason of his medical condition. The discharge, therefore, was not based on Mr. Day\u2019s disability, but on his refusal to report for work or to provide an acceptable explanation for his absence.\n[148] Mr. Day grieved his discharge in May of 2002. Pursuant to a settlement agreement regarding that grievance, he returned to work in May of 2003.\n(vii) Was the surplusing of Mr. Day\u2019s EL5 position discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[149] In the fall of 2004, Canada Post informed Mr. Day that two out of four EL5 positions in Technical Services at the Glanford plant were being eliminated pursuant to Article 53 of the collective agreement. A staffing review had revealed that there was insufficient work at the Glanford plant to warrant the number of Technical Service staff that were employed there. Article 53 of the Collective Agreement between CUPW and Canada Post provides a process whereby positions for which there is insufficient work may be declared surplus and eliminated. Mr. Day and Eric Walry had the lowest seniority among the four EL5\u2019s. Therefore, pursuant to Article 53, their positions were to be eliminated.\n[150] Eric Walry was reassigned to an EL5 in Ontario. Mr. Day, however, was unwilling to move from Victoria. Therefore, according to the collective agreement, his only option was a PO4 position at the Glanford plant. Even though he retained his EL5 salary, he found this reassignment demeaning and upsetting since, as a mail sorter, he would not have the opportunity to use his technical skills. He alleged that the elimination of his EL5 position in 2004 was orchestrated by Canada Post as a means of removing him because he was disabled.\n[151] Mr. Day based his allegations on a letter dated February 3, 2003 from Steve Clark to Joanne Purser, the Manager of Mail Operations at the time. In that letter, Mr. Clark expressed concern that the surplusing action was being considered as a way to remove Tim Day, a troublesome employee who was disabled from the department. Mr. Clark made a case for not eliminating the EL5 positions (including that of Mr. Day) because it could be perceived as bad faith on the part of Canada Post with respect to Mr. Day.\n[152] I find that Mr. Day has established a prima facie case of differential treatment based on disability. Mr. Clark\u2019s letter suggests that the elimination of Mr. Day\u2019s position was done to remove him from Technical Services because his disability was troublesome to Canada Post. Hence, there is evidence that he was being targeted for differential treatment on the basis of his disability.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[153] The Respondent established, to my satisfaction, that Mr. Clark\u2019s concerns were not borne out in the surplusing process. The elimination of Mr. Day\u2019s position had nothing to do with his disability. I draw this conclusion on the basis of the following factual determinations.\n[154] In 2002 and early 2003, Canada Post management in the Vancouver and Victoria region received notice from Ottawa that the Victoria plant was overstaffed. A study had been done that indicated that Victoria Technical Services had four to six positions more than it should have. Management in Victoria was tasked with coming up with a strategy for resolving the overstaffing issue.\n[155] Ms. Purser, the Manager of Mail Operations in Victoria, consulted with a number of people in the Glanford Plant to determine the best course of action. Among the people with whom Ms. Purser consulted were Mr. Ormerod and Mr. Clark.\n[156] Mr. Ormerod candidly admitted that he favoured the deletion of EL5 positions because he saw it as a way of getting rid of a difficult employee \u2013 Tim Day. However, when this was pointed out to him, he tried to put it aside and look squarely at what made sense for the plant, instead of letting his feelings about Mr. Day influence his thinking. He stated that no other plant had 4 EL5\u2019s; Victoria was overstaffed on the EL5 side. There was new equipment that was easier to maintain, and so it made sense to recommend that two EL5 positions be surplused.\n[157] Steve Clark disagreed with Mr. Ormerod. He recommended that two MAM 11 postions be eliminated. Ms. Purser agreed with Mr. Clark. She recommended to Tom Dixon, the Director of Vancouver and Northern British Columbia (which included Victoria), that two MAM11 positions be surplused.\n[158] Mr. Dixon received a letter from Technical Services workers in Victoria objecting to the surplusing action. Therefore, he decided to put the action on hold until a more thorough review of the staffing issue could be undertaken because he wanted to be sure that the right decision was being made.\n[159] Tom Dixon requested that a staffing review or audit of the Victoria Mail Processing Plant be undertaken by National Headquarters. In July 2004, two people from Canada Post Headquarters were brought in to conduct this audit. The auditors reported that, in their opinion, the Victoria Plant had two positions in Technical Services in the Glanford Mail Processing Plant that were not needed.\n[160] When he received the results of the audit, Mr. Dixon consulted with Mr. Sarbjit Sangha, Manager of Technical Services for Vancouver and Victoria. Mr. Sangha stated that Vancouver, which was a much bigger plant with more mail volume and more machinery, had only two EL5\u2019s whereas Victoria had four. He thought that this did not make sense. He provided his opinion to the auditors based on his review of the final draft of the audit report.\n[161] Mr. Sangha stated unequivocally that Tim Day was not a factor in his opinion regarding the need to eliminate two EL5 positions in Victoria. He stated that he did not know who Mr. Day was when he provided his opinion. There was no evidence that he saw the letter from Mr. Clark to Ms. Purser. His testimony was not shaken on cross-examination.\n[162] Upon receiving the audit and Mr. Sangha\u2019s recommendations, Mr. Dixon decided to eliminate two EL5 positions. He stated that the decision had nothing to do with Mr. Day; it was a response to the results of the audit and Mr. Sangha\u2019s advice indicating that there were two EL5 positions too many in Victoria. He did not recall ever having seen the letter from Mr. Clark to Ms. Purser regarding Mr. Day.\n[163] Mr. Dixon did not consult with Mr. Ormerod about the decision to eliminate the EL5 positions. Mr. Ormerod left Technical Services in 2003. His views with respect to the staffing issue were not sought after he provided his opinion to Ms. Purser in 2002.\n[164] Canada Post\u2019s witnesses who testified about this issue were credible and consistent. I accept the explanation that the decision to eliminate the EL5 positions was not done to move Mr. Day out of Technical Services because of his disability. Canada Post has defeated the prima facie case of discrimination with respect to this allegation by showing that the decision had nothing to do with Mr. Day\u2019s disability.\n(viii) Was the deletion of the MAM11 position discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[165] Mr. Day testified that after he was assigned to the PO4 position, he applied for a mechanic\u2019s position - the MAM11 B-2 position. He knew that this position would be vacant since the incumbent was retiring.\n[166] On April 4, 2005, Ms. Andrew, the union representative, requested that Mr. Day be given the vacant MAM11 B-2 position. She stated that Mr. Day was on sick leave. When he was ready to return his doctor wanted him in a less stressful than the EL5 position. The MAM11 position fit that description.\n[167] Ms. Andrew testified that it was standard practice that before a position was eliminated, Canada Post consulted with the union. This was not done. Instead, on the same day as the request for the position was made, the union received notice that the MAM11 position had been eliminated.\n[168] Mr. Day argued that the MAM 11 position was deleted after his request was made in order to frustrate his attempt to return to the Tech Services Branch. This was based on the fact that he was disabled, and Technical Services refused to accept his need for accommodation of his disability.\n[169] The evidence presented by Mr. Day supported the contention that Mr. Sangha deleted the MAM11 position after Mr. Day applied for it. Mr. Sangha knew, from Ms. Andrew\u2019s letter that Mr. Day was off sick and was requesting the position as a way of coping with the stress of reintegration into the workplace. The way that the process was handled suggested that Mr. Day\u2019s disability was a factor in the decision to delete the MAM11 position. Mr. Day has therefore succeeded in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of his disability.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[170] Mr. Sangha stated that he made a decision sometime in the fall of 2004 or early winter of 2005 that he would eliminate the MAM11 position when the incumbent retired in March of 2005. This was well before Mr. Day applied for the position. However, he forgot to inform the union of his decision in writing at the time. He stated that he felt bad when he received Ms. Andrew\u2019s letter in April of 2005 because it was then that he realized that he had neglected to inform the union of his decision earlier on.\n[171] He explained that National Headquarters in Ottawa had decided to replace an old machine in Victoria with a machine that required much less maintenance. As a result, the staff complement of fourteen employees in Technical Services in Victoria exceeded the available work. The union was informed that the number of mechanics on staff at the Victoria Mail Processing Plant would be reduced because there was no longer enough work for fourteen employees. For that reason, he decided to eliminate the MAM11 position.\n[172] Mr. Sangha was a credible witness. He was forthright in his admission of the mistake he made in failing to inform the union about his decision to eliminate the MAM11 position. His testimony was unshaken on cross-examination. Although he did not provide written confirmation of his decision to eliminate the position prior to Mr. Day\u2019s request, I was nonetheless convinced by his testimony that there was no connection between Mr. Day\u2019s disability and the decision to eliminate the MAM11 position.\n[173] I find therefore, that Canada Post has established that Mr. Day\u2019s disability was not a factor in the elimination of the MAM11 position.\n[174] Mr. Day argued, in the alternative, that even if his disability was not a factor in the elimination of the position, Canada Post\u2019s refusal to keep it open for him constituted adverse differential treatment. It deprived him of an opportunity to assume a position that would have accommodated his disability.\n[175] Assuming that Mr. Day established a prima facie case that the elimination of the position had an adverse differential effect on him, I am of the view that the obligation under s. 15(2) of the Act does not extend to the maintenance or creation of a position for which there is no productive work. Rather, the obligation is to provide accommodation to enable employees to perform productive work. The evidence disclosed that there was not enough work to justify the maintenance of the MAM11 position. Canada Post was not required to maintain the position in order to accommodate Mr. Day.\n(ix) Was the assignment of Mr. Day to the relief letter carrier position discriminatory? The Prima Facie Case\n[176] In May 2006, Mr. Day bid for a letter carrier position in Victoria. He was successful in obtaining both the position and the route he wanted. After his successful bid, there was a reorganization of the letter carrier routes. The new routes were to be determined by bid. Mr. Day alleged that the person in charge of the bidding process neglected to call him or the union while he was on disability leave so that he could bid on a new route. As a result, he was assigned a relief letter carrier position. This position is the least preferable because it involves moving around from route to route.\n[177] Based on Mr. Day\u2019s testimony I am prepared to assume that the alleged failure to advise Mr. Day of the bid on the reorganized route while he was on sick leave constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of disability.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Explanation\n[178] Mr. Clark\u2019s understanding was that Mr. Day had been informed, or should have been informed by the union about the bid on the reorganized routes. The arrangement at the time was that all communication intended for Mr. Day would go through the union. Mr. Clark stated that Barry Barter, who was handling the route reorganization at the time, told him that he informed the union about the bid. Mr. Clark did not know whether the union communicated that information to Mr. Day.\n[179] Mr. Patterson, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Victoria local of the CUPW at the time, was the only union official that testified on this matter. He could not confirm or deny that the union had been informed about the bidding for the reorganized routes.\n[180] I accept Mr. Clark\u2019s evidence that the union was informed about the reorganized bid. Whether the union informed Mr. Day or not about the bid is unclear. However, I accept that Canada Post did its part to provide the information so that Mr. Day could place his bid.\n[181] Therefore, I find that Canada Post has provided a reasonable explanation that refutes Mr. Day\u2019s allegation that his assignment to the relief route was discriminatory.\n(x) Was Mr. Day harassed on the basis of his disability? [182] Mr. Day argued that all of Canada Post\u2019s actions in the present case constituted harassment on the basis of his disability. Section 14 (1)(c) provides that it is a discriminatory practice to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[183] Harassment in the context of complaints based on disability has been defined as conduct manifested through repeated words, actions or gestures, that is vexatious, demeaning or insulting and is directed at another person on the basis of his or her disability (Bergeron v. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e., 2004 CHRT 16, at para. 260; aff\u2019d : 2005 CF 879). The severity of the impugned conduct must be assessed from the perspective of the reasonable victim (Dhanjal v. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. 367 at paras 216 \u2013 217 (CHRT), aff\u2019d: [1997] F.C.J. No. 1599).\n[184] The jurisprudence on harassment is premised on the idea that the conduct in issue is, by its nature, extraneous or irrelevant to the legitimate operations and business goals of the employer. Derogatory comments or constant and unnecessary questioning about a disability which are humiliating and demeaning are examples of conduct that is extraneous to the legitimate operation of a workplace.\n[185] The jurisprudence also indicates that harassment generally requires an element of persistence or repetition, although in certain circumstances a single incident may be enough to create a hostile work environment. The more serious the conduct and its consequences are, the less repetition is necessary; conversely, the less severe the conduct, the more persistence will have to be demonstrated (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) (re Franke) [1999] 3 F.C. 653 (T.D.) at paras 43 and 45).\n[186] In the present case, the impugned conduct does not have the character of demeaning or humiliating conduct that is extraneous or irrelevant to the legitimate operations of Canada Post. Rather, Canada Post\u2019s actions were undertaken in the course of managing the mail operations at the Glanford plant. Moreover, with the exception of the removal of Mr. Day from the workplace in November of 2001, I have found that Mr. Day\u2019s disability was not a factor in the actions taken by Canada Post.\n[187] I do not think that a reasonable disabled employee would find Mr. Day\u2019s removal from the workplace in November of 2001, in and of itself, to have constituted harassment. It was disrespectful and insensitive of Mr. Day\u2019s needs as a disabled person; however, it was not repeated, humiliating conduct that was extraneous or irrelevant to Canada Post\u2019s legitimate operations.\n[188] For these reasons, I find that there is no merit to Mr. Day\u2019s allegation that Canada Post harassed him on the basis of his disability.\nIV. What Is The Appropriate Remedy? [189] Section 53(2) of the Act authorizes the Tribunal to make an order against the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. I find that Canada Post engaged in a discriminatory practice when it placed Mr. Day on sick leave and removed him from the workplace in November of 2001.\nA. Compensation for Pain and Suffering [190] Mr. Day has claimed compensation for the pain and suffering that he experienced as a result of Canada Post\u2019s discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal may order compensation in an amount not exceeding $20,000 for any pain and suffering the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice (s. 53(2)(e)).\n[191] Mr. Day testified that not knowing the basis for the decision to place him on sick leave caused him a great deal of anguish and stress. He was humiliated when he was escorted out of the Plant on November 21, 2001. These hurt feelings were caused by Canada Post\u2019s discriminatory conduct in failing to treat Mr. Day fairly in the accommodation process in November of 2001.\n[192] I find therefore, that an award of compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $6,000 is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Pursuant to s. 53(2)(e), I order Canada Post to pay this amount to Mr. Day.\nB. Compensation for Willful and Reckless Conduct [193] Mr. Day claimed compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act. That provision of the Act authorizes the Tribunal to order compensation in an amount not exceeding $20,000 when it finds that the Respondent engaged in the discriminatory conduct willfully or recklessly.\n[194] I find that when it placed him on sick leave and removed him from the plant in November of 2001, Canada Post willfully or recklessly engaged in discriminatory conduct. Canada Post and Medisys knew or ought to have known that the information in Dr. Miller\u2019s report was extremely important and should have been immediately communicated to Mr. Day\u2019s doctor. They knew or ought to have known that Mr. Day was seeking that information. Finally, if Canada Post and\/or Medisys were of the view that Mr. Day was so ill that he was a safety risk, that information should have been communicated to Mr. Day\u2019s physician. The failure to do so demonstrates a wanton disregard of Mr. Day\u2019s needs as a disabled person. In the circumstances, I find that an order for compensation under s. 53(3) of the Act in the amount of $5,000 is appropriate.\nC. Interest [195] Interest is payable in respect of all awards made in this decision pursuant to section 53(4) of the Act. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the bank rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. The interest shall run from the date of the complaint. In no case, however, should the total amount payable under s. 53(2)(e), including interest, exceed $20,000. Similarly, the total amount payable under s. 53(3), including interest, should not exceed $20,000.\nD. Legal Expenses [196] In a recent decision, the Chairperson of this Tribunal held that the weight of judicial authority supports the Tribunal\u2019s power to award reasonable legal costs under s. 53(2) of the Act (Mowat v. Canadian Armed Forces 2006 CHRT 49 at para. 27). I agree that the Tribunal has the authority under the Act to award reasonable legal expenses.\n[197] I therefore order that Canada Post compensate Mr. Day for the reasonable costs of retaining counsel both prior to and during the hearing.\n[198] The parties are encouraged to come to an agreement on the quantum of reasonable costs in this matter. I shall retain jurisdiction over this aspect of the award in the event that the parties are unable to reach such an agreement. The parties are to notify the Tribunal within 60 days of the receipt of this decision if an agreement has not been reached.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

Jensen\n[1] Raymond Thwaites is a pilot with Air Canada. Mr. Thwaites and six other Air Canada pilots with Air Canada are required to retire at age 60 under the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan.\n[2] They filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) discriminated against them on the basis of age, contrary to sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The complaints deal with Air Canada's mandatory retirement requirement at age 60.\n[3] The Fly Past 60 Coalition (the Coalition) requested interested party status in the complaints on October 1, 2007. The Coalition is a group of individuals who oppose the mandatory retirement rule at Air Canada. They are either currently employed as pilots at Air Canada or have recently been forced to retire pursuant to the requirement. The Complainants are all members of the Coalition.\n[4] The Coalition seeks interested party status for the following reasons:\nthe interests of the members of the Coalition will be directly affected by the outcome in these complaints; ACPA is not representing the interests of the Complainants or the Coalition members in this matter, but rather is a respondent in the complaints; the Coalition will assist the Tribunal to make a fair and proper determination of the matters before it by presenting evidence and making submissions in support of the Complainants; the Coalition has members who have been directly involved in the management and affairs both of Air Canada Flight Operations and of ACPA, at the most senior level; the Coordinator of the Coalition, Mr. Raymond Hall, is familiar with human rights law since he was a member of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission from 1991-1993; the Canadian Human Rights Commission is not participating in the proceedings and therefore, the Coalition's participation is needed to right the economic imbalance between the Complainants and the Respondents.\n[5] The Respondents oppose the present motion. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate in the motion, and has indicated that it will not participate in the Tribunal hearing of the complaints.\n[6] Section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act gives the Tribunal discretion to grant interested party status. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate how its expertise will be of assistance in the determination of the issues.

Introduction [1] The complainant, Guy Willoughby, alleges that his employer, Canada Post Corporation (CP) discriminated against him on the basis of his disabilities, both physical and mental, in breach of either or both sections 7(a) or 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). He alleges that CP engaged in a discriminatory practice first by placing him on a 3:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. shift on or about March 12, 2002, notwithstanding a medical direction that he work a regular day shift. He alleges that CP engaged in further discriminatory practice by refusing to continue his employment in or about April 12, 2002 and on or about February 14, 2003 as a result of his disabilities.\n[2] The hearing extended 5 days in May of 2007. Both the complainant and the respondent participated at the hearing and were represented by legal counsel. The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate.\nII. The Issues [3] The issues for determination in this complaint are as follows:\nHas the complainant made out a prima facie case that CP engaged in a discriminatory practice by directing that he remain assigned to a 3:30 a.m. to 11:30 shift notwithstanding that one of the medical restrictions enumerated by his doctor was that he should work only a regular day shift? Has the complainant made out a prima facie case that CP engaged in a discriminatory practice by refusing to continue his employment on or about April 12, 2002 as a result of his disabilities? Has the complainant made out a prima facie case that CP engaged in a discriminatory practice by refusing to continue his employment on or about February 14, 2003 as a result of his disabilities? If the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination in respect of any or all of these allegations, has the respondent demonstrated that the decision or decisions made were the result of a bona fide occupational requirement under section 15 of the CHRA? If one or more of the complaints is found to have been a discriminatory practice contrary to the CHRA, what remedies are appropriate?\nIII. The Evidence A. Evidence of the Complainant [4] Mr. Willoughby commenced his employment with CP in April of 1977. He was a mail service courier for approximately 13 years and was in 1990 promoted to the position of letter carrier supervisor. He last worked for CP on April 15, 2002.\n[5] In the fall of 1997, Mr. Willoughby was working as a letter carrier supervisor in Depot 11 and was assigned to a shift that commenced at 3:30 a.m. and ended at 11:30 a.m. He began to have difficulty performing his job and attended at his doctor for a medical assessment. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s doctor advised CP that he suffered from an injury to his knees and for this reason Mr. Willoughby should not be required to do excessive walking, standing or lifting. The doctor also advised that Mr. Willoughby was suffering from a sleep disorder and that he should be working a regular day shift and not the 3:30 a.m. shift.\n[6] After some weeks of delay, Mr. Willoughby\u2019s medical requirements were accommodated by CP. He was assigned as the day shift supervisor in the Central Re-direction Centre (CRC). The CRC unit was described by several of CP\u2019s witnesses as a rehabilitation unit as all of the employees working in the unit had some permanent work restrictions and were in need of accommodation. The employees in this unit processed and sorted mail that required re-direction because a customer had registered a change of address notice. The jobs in the CRC unit were largely sedentary and hence well suited for employees who had mobility restrictions. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s placement in this unit was considered to be permanent.\n[7] In the spring of 2000 the CRC unit was disbanded. The non-supervisory employees of the unit were re-deployed to the depots and performed their duties in those depots rather than in a single centralized location. As these employees were to report to the supervisors working in the depots to which they had been assigned, Mr. Willoughby\u2019s supervisory position became redundant.\n[8] After the CRC unit was disbanded, Mr. Willoughby was assigned to an administrative project for a few weeks on a day shift. After this project concluded, he was re-assigned to the training office, again, on a day shift. His job in the training office was to assign employees to job vacancies. At the time, job vacancies were posted in the different CP depots and any employee who might want any particular job would apply for it. Positions were filled according to seniority and Mr. Willoughby\u2019s job was to fill the position by assigning the most senior applicant to the job.\n[9] Mr. Willoughby testified that he was not consulted in advance about this assignment. He testified that he found the position to be difficult and that it did not suit either his experience or his abilities. He acknowledged that he made numerous mistakes. He testified that his workload was extremely heavy and that the position required that he work long hours. Mr. Willoughby testified that he advised his supervisor he thought his poor job performance might be the result of dyslexia. Many of his mistakes resulted because he would transpose digits in employee start dates, which dates defined an employee\u2019s seniority. Mr. Willoughby had not been diagnosed with dyslexia, but the disorder ran in his family. Dyslexia is a learning disability that is typically manifested by difficulties in reading and writing experienced by persons of at least average intelligence.\n[10] Mr. Willoughby received a poor performance evaluation from the supervisor in the training unit in April of 2001. He was sent for a medical assessment. Mr. Willoughby went to Dr. Dodd, a general practitioner and his family doctor. In a letter dated April 7, 2001, Dr. Dodd stated that Mr. Willoughby might suffer from dyslexia and recommended that he be assessed at the Glenrose Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta.\n[11] Dr. Dodd wrote a further letter to CP dated July 19, 2001. The doctor stated that Mr. Willoughby had not received an assessment at the Glenrose Hospital, in part because of the cost involved and in part because he had been advised by Mr. Willoughby that his performance difficulties had resolved. He further advised that these difficulties had arisen as a result of the stress and fatigue he experienced as he learned a new job, and not from dyslexia.\n[12] In July or August of 2001, Mr. Willoughby was removed from his position in the training department and was assigned back to the supervisor position in Depot 11. He was placed on the 3:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. shift; the shift he had before the 1997 medical direction that this shift was not appropriate in light of his medical condition. Mr. Willoughby testified that even though he knew that this assignment did not comply with his medical restrictions, he felt he had no choice but to accept the position or he would lose his job.\n[13] Almost immediately upon returning to the Depot 11 position, Mr. Willoughby\u2019s job performance became quite poor. He testified that the increased physical demands of this position and the return to a night shift caused his health, both mental and physical, to deteriorate rapidly and that as a result, his job performance suffered. It was Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence that he had a meeting with his supervisor, Ms. Sample, in January of 2002. Ms. Sample had requested the meeting to discuss her concerns with his performance. It was Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence that he told his supervisor at this meeting that he had been seeing a psychologist and had been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This condition, he thought, might be causing his job performance problems. CP directed Mr. Willoughby to obtain a new medical report.\n[14] Mr. Willoughby\u2019s psychologist, Dr. Aprile Flickenger, wrote to CP in January, 2002. The psychologist confirmed that Mr. Willoughby suffered from PTSD and reported that he was making progress under her care. The psychologist described that the symptoms that Mr. Willoughby was experiencing as a result of this condition made daily functioning difficult. In particular, Mr. Willoughby suffered from nightmares and other sleep disturbances. He was also experiencing flashbacks of prior traumatic events in his life. The psychologist described that other symptoms experienced by Mr. Willoughby included feelings of isolation, low self-esteem and occasional paranoia. Dr. Flickenger identified that these symptoms were exacerbated by the shift to which he had been assigned, being the 3:30 a.m. shift, and directed that he was to be assigned to a day shift.\n[15] Dr. Dodd also wrote to CP in January of 2002. He confirmed that Mr. Willoughby was seeing a registered psychologist for treatment of PTSD and further advised that he was himself imposing no medical restrictions in respect of Mr. Willoughby.\n[16] Mr. Willoughby remained on the 3:30 a.m. shift after CP had received this information from the psychologist.\n[17] Dr. Dodd wrote a further letter to CP dated March 5, 2002. This letter was written in response to correspondence received from CP advising him that it found that his January, 2002 letter appeared to contradict the letter received that same month from Dr. Flickenger. Dr. Flickenger, CP wrote, directed that Mr. Willoughby had medical restrictions, while his letter suggested that he had no restrictions. CP asked Dr. Dodd for clarification. Dr. Dodd, in his letter of March 5, confirmed that he supported the diagnosis and the medical restrictions imposed by the psychologist.\n[18] Dr. Esmail of CP\u2019s occupations health services department, wrote a memo dated March 12, 2002, advising that in light of Dr. Dodd\u2019s most recent correspondence, the requirement of day shift only appeared to be reasonable in the circumstances. Dr. Esmail suggested that CP follow up with the psychologist in a month\u2019s time to see whether the restriction was still necessary.\n[19] On March 19, 2002, after having received this memorandum from Dr. Esmail, Bill Stevenson, zone manager for CP, advised Dr. Esmail that Mr. Willoughby would remain on the 3:30 a.m. shift.\n[20] By letter dated April 11, 2002, Dr. Dodd again wrote to CP directing that Mr. Willoughby should be working only day shift.\n[21] On or about April 15, 2002, Mr. Willoughby met with Tom Duncan, a labour relations officer with CP. Mr. Willoughby testified that Mr. Duncan advised him CP had no positions available to meet his medical restrictions and that he should go on disability leave. Mr. Willoughby went on sick leave for 95 days until his sick day credits had been exhausted. He then applied for and began to receive disability benefits from Sun Life Financial (Sun Life), CP\u2019s medical and disability benefit provider. In his application for disability benefits, Mr. Willoughby wrote the following in response to a question asking why he could not return to work: I would have continued working. My doctor says, and Canada Post\u2019s doctor says I should work a normal day shift, but Canada Post says that there are no day shift positions that are within my physical limitations.\n[22] Mr. Willoughby testified that in April of 2002 there were numerous jobs at CP that would accommodate his restrictions and that he could do successfully. His evidence was that if put on day shift in one of the larger of CP\u2019s depots, there were sedentary administrative tasks that could be bundled to afford him a productive position. He further testified that the day shift supervisor positions were already more sedentary as letter carriers left the building fairly early in the shift and so tasks that required a significant amount of walking, like monitoring the delivery and the processing of the mail and monitoring the attendance and the work of employees, would end early in the shift.\n[23] Mr. Willoughby also testified that he could have performed the job held by the former CRC employees who had been re-assigned to individual depots. These positions were performed by members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). Mr. Willoughby\u2019s union was the Association of Postal Officials of Canada (APOC). He further testified that there were positions performed by employees in the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) bargaining unit, which employees did primarily administrative work. He could, he testified, have been accommodated with a position in this bargaining unit.\n[24] Mr. Willoughby testified that when he learned that CP took the position that it could not accommodate him, he was devastated. He felt abandoned by CP. He felt betrayed to learn that after 24 years of service with this company it could not find a way to continue his employment and to accommodate his restrictions. Mr. Willoughby testified that he became extremely depressed, that the psychological symptoms described earlier by his psychologist as arising from PTSD worsened. He was unable to sleep, ate little and rarely left his home. He felt worthless, had no self-esteem and worried about his future ability to meet his financial needs. He continued to receive treatment from his psychologist.\n[25] In October or November of 2002, Mr. Willoughby met with Sun Life to discuss a graduated back to work plan. Mr. Willoughby testified that he was anxious to get back to work. Sun Life had collected updated medical information from Mr. Willoughby\u2019s doctor and psychologist in advance of preparing the back to work plan. His psychologist, Dr. Flickenger, reported that his condition was improving and that his prognosis was good. She indicated that he still required a day shift and should not be placed in a supervisory position for the time being. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s family doctor, Dr. Dodd, confirmed that he was to be assigned only to a regular day shift and further, that he not be made to walk or stand excessively or lift repetitively. The plan arrived at by Sun Life and communicated to CP in November of 2002 was as follows:\nThat Mr. Willoughby start working four hour shifts, five days per week; That he work day shift; That he be placed in a non-supervisory position, at least for the time being; That he avoid excessive walking, standing and lifting.\n[26] Mr. Willoughby testified that he did not hear anything from either Sun Life or CP in response to this proposal. He telephoned CP and asked that a meeting be set up to discuss the plan for his return to work. A meeting was held on February 14, 2003. At this meeting were Mr. Willoughby, Mr. Duncan, a CP payroll employee, a representative of CP\u2019s occupational health services, and a representative of Sun Life. Mr. Willoughby testified that he was advised by Mr. Duncan at that meeting that there were no positions available to meet his medical restrictions. Mr. Willoughby never returned to CP.\n[27] Mr. Willoughby obtained employment at a car dealership in July, 2004 and resigned from CP. He testified that he was at first unable to look for work because of the emotional and psychological distress that CP\u2019s conduct had caused. He testified further that when he became able to look for work he was unable to find a job. Mr. Willoughby was using a cane during this period of time and testified that he believed this made prospective employers reluctant to hire him.\nB. Evidence of the Respondent [28] Mr. Duncan had, at the time of the hearing, been a labour relations officer for CP for approximately ten years. Mr. Duncan confirmed that CP had assigned Mr. Willoughby to the CRC unit as a day shift supervisor in 1997 to accommodate his physical restrictions and the medical direction that he work only a regular day shift.\n[29] Mr. Duncan also confirmed that upon the CRC unit being disbanded, CP continued to accommodate Mr. Willoughby\u2019s requirements by assigning him first to a short term administrative project and then to the training office.\n[30] Mr. Duncan did not know why Mr. Willoughby had been assigned back to Depot 11 on the 3:30 a.m. shift in July or August of 2001. The decision, he testified, was made by the zone manager, Mr. Bill Stevenson. He did not discuss the matter with Mr. Stevenson at any time. Mr. Stevenson died in or around 2003. Mr. Duncan also testified that Mr. Stevenson maintained a file on Mr. Willoughby that detailed the steps taken by CP to accommodate him since 1997. Mr. Duncan had never read the file and it had been lost by the time this hearing had commenced. Mr. Duncan speculated, however, that the 3:30 a.m. shift at Depot 11 was the only position available at the time.\n[31] CP led no other evidence that would explain why Mr. Willoughby was assigned to the 3:30 a.m. shift and no evidence that would explain why he was not re-assigned to a day shift after CP received medical information in January and in March of 2002.\n[32] Mr. Duncan testified that on or about April 15, 2002 he had a meeting with Mr. Willoughby and that at this meeting Mr. Willoughby expressed to him that he felt he was unable to work in any capacity at CP. He asked Mr. Duncan to help him obtain disability benefits. Mr. Duncan denied that he advised Mr. Willoughby that there were no positions available to accommodate him and so he should go on disability, as was Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence.\n[33] Mr. Duncan also testified that even had Mr. Willoughby wanted to remain actively employed with CP, there were no positions available in April of 2002. Mr. Duncan testified that all of the positions available within his bargaining unit, APOC, required either a significant amount of walking and standing, which Mr. Willoughby could not do, or required either or both of an acute attention to detail and competence with computers. Mr. Duncan testified that he was convinced that Mr. Willoughby could not do any of these more sedentary jobs in part because in his experience, Mr. Willoughby had demonstrated an inability to perform administrative and other more sedentary jobs since he had been promoted to the position of supervisor in 1990 and did not possess adequate computer skills. Further, Mr. Duncan testified that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s poor performance in the training department was further evidence that he was unable to perform administrative jobs to an acceptable standard.\n[34] Mr. Duncan testified that he was surprised to learn in 1990 that Mr. Willoughby had been promoted to letter carrier supervisor. He had worked with Mr. Willoughby before 1990 as a mail courier and testified that he had found his competence to be questionable in that position. In 1993 or 1994, Mr. Duncan and Mr. Willoughby worked together in the same depot. Mr. Duncan was the superintendent and superior to Mr. Willoughby, who was a supervisor. Mr. Duncan testified that Mr. Willoughby could not grasp even very simple concepts, that he was sloppy and neglectful at his duties, that he was unable to secure the necessary relationships with employees he was responsible for and that he made numerous administrative mistakes. He made, for example, numerous errors in vacation scheduling and would often fail to offer overtime to employees in the order dictated by the collective agreement. Under the collective agreement, if an employee is not offered overtime when it is his or her turn, CP was required to pay the employee anyway. Mr. Duncan testified that he took over some of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s administrative tasks because of the number of errors he made.\n[35] Mr. Duncan also testified that Mr. Willoughby was infamous for damaging and deleting important computer software while attempting to modify or improve it. Mr. Duncan described that while he and Mr. Willoughby were in adjacent depots, Mr. Willoughby would regularly run in to his office in great distress having erased important system and other software. Mr. Duncan described that he constantly needed to call in technical support to fix computers damaged by Mr. Willoughby. Mr. Duncan described that computers were irresistible to Mr. Willoughby. He described an incident that had occurred in 1993 or 1994 while he was Mr. Willoughby\u2019s superintendent. Mr. Duncan had received a new laptop computer from CP for use at work. Mr. Duncan testified that he begged Mr. Willoughby not to touch his computer one day before leaving the depot. Mr. Duncan described that when he returned, the computer was black and that it never worked again: It is black to this day.\n[36] Mr. Duncan testified that he was also aware that Mr. Willoughby was performing poorly in the training department in 2001. Mr. Willoughby, he testified, would often come into his office and would express increasing distress and concern that he was unable to perform the training department position adequately.\n[37] Ms. Gavin, a team leader in CP\u2019s training unit, gave further evidence of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s performance difficulties in the training department. She testified that Mr. Willoughby was easily distracted and made many mistakes during his tenure in the department. Ms. Gavin testified that she, together with Ms. Acton, the manager of CP\u2019s training unit, met with Mr. Willoughby in early April of 2001 to discuss their concerns about his performance. Ms. Acton also gave evidence at the hearing. She testified that during this meeting, Mr. Willoughby acknowledged that his performance was poor, but that he was unable to give any adequate reason for his many mistakes. Mr. Willoughby described that he was suffering from some personal problems of long standing, though he did not elaborate any further on the nature of these problems. Neither Ms. Gavin nor Ms. Acton recalled Mr. Willoughby advising them that he thought he might be suffering from dyslexia.\n[38] Ms. Gavin testified that after this meeting, she and Ms. Acton decided that Mr. Willoughby should be sent for a medical examination and was later told that CP had received medical information advising that the difficulties giving rise to Mr. Willoughby\u2019s poor job performance had resolved. She testified that she felt she had no choice but to ask that Mr. Willoughby be transferred, there being no medical explanation for his continuing poor performance.\n[39] Mr. Duncan testified that he was aware that Mr. Willoughby was not performing well after he had been transferred back to Depot 11 in the summer of 2001 on the 3:30 a.m. shift. Mr. Willoughby continued to visit him in his office on a regular basis and expressed that he was unable to meet the demands of this position.\n[40] Ms. Sample, superintendent of Depot 11 when Mr. Willoughby was re-assigned to that depot in July or August of 2001, gave further evidence of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s performance problems in the depot. She testified that his job performance was well below the required standard almost immediately after he had been assigned to the depot. Ms. Sample testified that Mr. Willoughby was almost entirely unable to walk, and therefore could not adequately supervise the employees, and neither could he adequately supervise the delivery or the processing of mail. Further, he continued to make numerous mistakes in the administrative aspects of the position.\n[41] Mr. Duncan testified that because of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s poor job performance and because of his medical restrictions there were no positions available at CP to accommodate him. Mr. Duncan canvassed numerous positions at CP, but found none that Mr. Willoughby could perform adequately. He could not, Mr. Duncan testified, continue to be a letter carrier supervisor because that position required that a person walk around the depot for about 90% of an eight hour shift. Mr. Duncan also testified that it would not be possible to bundle administrative tasks that other supervisors were performing to create an accommodative position for Mr. Willoughby as there was very little administrative work done by any supervisors. Bundling these jobs would not fill a day.\n[42] Mr. Duncan testified that positions in CP\u2019s sales department also entailed a significant amount of walking. He also testified that the depot assistant positions, positions that he first described as being assigned as an accommodation for injured or aging employees, would be unsuitable for Mr. Willoughby because they entailed significant walking and lifting: They (the depot assistants) work harder than you and me put together. He described data entry and other administrative functions done by APOC employees such as those done in the route management and postal code maintenance departments as being highly skilled positions that demanded a highly tuned attention to detail. Mr. Willoughby, Mr. Duncan and others testified, had demonstrated that he was unable to attend adequately to detail and so could not perform these administrative assignments adequately.\n[43] Mr. Duncan gave evidence that CP did not formally canvass suitable positions that might be available in other bargaining units. Some of the job functions at CP were performed by employees who were members of the CUPW bargaining unit. As an example, the long and short letter sortation unit was described as a sedentary position assigned to injured workers. Mr. Duncan described that CP did not consider placing Mr. Willoughby in one of the CUPW positions because serious consequences would be visited on CUPW members should Mr. Willoughby be parachuted in to one of the CUPW positions. Mr. Duncan testified that should Mr. Willoughby be placed in a job outside his collective agreement, someone else would get bumped out on to the street if there were no vacancies in any particular unit. The only alternative should there be a full complement of workers would be to create a position for Mr. Willoughby and that, Mr. Duncan testified, is beyond any employer\u2019s obligation when accommodating an employee. He did not know if there were any vacancies at the relevant time in the CUPW bargaining unit that would have been suitable for Mr. Willoughby. He had not checked.\n[44] Mr. Duncan also gave evidence that at the relevant time there were five employees in the PSAC bargaining unit who were surplus. Members of the PSAC bargaining unit did primarily administrative functions, many of which were sedentary. The positions formerly held by these surplus PSAC employees had become redundant as CP began to computerize more and more of its operations. Under the terms of a collective agreement, CP had agreed to keep these people on payroll. Mr. Duncan describes that these people were kept busy doing make-work projects, working on tasks like data entry. These employees were also used to backfill job vacancies when they arose. Mr. Kordoban testified that CP had at one time cancelled a contract that it had with a security company so that some of these PSAC employees could perform those functions while they remained surplus. Mr. Duncan testified that as CP was continuing to employ surplus workers, it was clear that there were no job vacancies in the PSAC bargaining unit.\n[45] Mr. Duncan testified that in April of 2002, when he decided that accommodation was not possible, he had not reviewed any of the medical information contained in Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment file. His estimation of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s medical restrictions came as a result of his observations of and his conversations with Mr. Willoughby. Mr. Duncan understood from these observations and conversations that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s only medical restriction was that he could not walk or stand much. He was unaware that Mr. Willoughby had been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, had been later diagnosed with PTSD, or that his doctor directed that he should work only a regular day shift.\n[46] Mr. Duncan testified that in advance of his meeting with Mr. Willoughby in February of 2003, ten months after he had last seen him, he had not consulted Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment file or read any medical reports. He was unaware of the Sun Life letter sent to CP in November of 2002 outlining Mr. Willoughby\u2019s medical restrictions and its proposal by which Mr. Willoughby could return to work. He testified that his understanding that there had been no change in Mr. Willoughby\u2019s restrictions came from the comments made at the meeting by a CP nurse.\n[47] Mr. Duncan also testified that he had made no specific inquiries about available job positions at CP that might be available to accommodate Mr. Willoughby in advance of or after the February, 2003 meeting. It was his testimony that as he understood from the comments of the CP nurse that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s restrictions had not changed, CP\u2019s position had not changed: there was no work available.\nIV. Analysis [48] Section 7(a) of the CHRA states that it is a discriminatory practice, whether directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or to continue to employ any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 7(b) states that it is also a discriminatory practice, whether directly or indirectly, in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Disability is a prohibited ground of discrimination enumerated in section 3, and section 25 directs that this ground prohibits discrimination on the basis of either physical or mental disability.\n[49] The onus is first on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\nA. Has the complainant demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability? [50] A prima facie case of discrimination is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favor, in the absence of an answer from the respondent employer. The respondent\u2019s answer is not to be considered when determining whether a prima facie case has been made out. (O\u2019Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985], 2 S.C.R. 536 at para 28, see also Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6 and Moore v. Canada Post Corporation and Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2007 CHRT 31 at para. 85). A complainant is not required to prove that discrimination was the only factor influencing the conduct which is the subject of the complaint. It is sufficient that a complainant make out a prima facie case that discrimination is a factor. (See Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029).\n[51] Mr. Willoughby\u2019s allegations of discrimination are first that on or about March 12, 2002, CP continued his assignment to the 3:30 a.m. shift after having received a letter from his doctor directing that he required day shift assignments, and second, that CP refused to continue his employment in both April of 2002 and February of 2003 as a result of his disabilities.\n(i) Has a prima facie case been made out in respect of the first allegation: continuing the 3:30 a.m. shift assignment in March, 2002? [52] Mr. Willoughby alleges that when CP received the letter of Dr. Dodd in March of 2002, directing that he required a day shift assignment, its decision to continue his assignment to the 3:30 a.m. shift was a discriminatory practice. This allegation engages section 7(b) of the CHRA which directs that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer, in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[53] In Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment, [2003] F.C.J. No. 439 (FCA), Pelletier JA, writing for a three member panel of the Court, directs that when considering a complaint of discrimination that arises as a result of a course of conduct between an employer and employee, rather than from a discrete and coherent employment policy, the appropriate question to ask when considering whether a complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination under section 7(b) is whether the transaction between the parties taken as a whole discloses adverse treatment on a prohibited ground (see paragraphs 75 and 76). There is no specific test or analysis that applies where one is considering whether a prima facie case is made under section 7(b). This Tribunal must be flexible, not overly legalistic in order to advance one of the broad purposes of the CHRA, being the elimination of discrimination in the workplace (Morris v. Canada Armed Forces [2005] F.C.A. 154 at paragraphs 27 to 30). Analyses made under section 7(b) must be made on a case by case basis and in a manner sensitive to the factual context.\n[54] I find that Mr. Willoughby has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. CP had accommodated his medical restrictions continuously since 1997, including his need to work day shifts. Then, abruptly, in the summer of 2001, CP assigned Mr. Willoughby back to the 3:30 a.m. shift. When CP received medical information in March of 2002 that Mr. Willoughby could work only a day shift, CP kept him on the 3:30 a.m. shift. There can be no question that CP\u2019s course of conduct visited an adverse effect on Mr. Willoughby on the basis of his disability: CP\u2019s decision was directly contrary to the clear direction of his doctor and caused his medical condition to worsen. I also find that Mr. Willoughby made out a prima facie case that he was treated not just adversely, but differentially on the basis of his disability. There is no free-standing right to accommodation under the CHRA as was recently observed by this Tribunal in Moore v. Canada Post 2007 CHRT 31 (paragraph 86). However, I find that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence that his employer received medical direction identifying a work restriction and that the restriction was not accommodated, makes out a prima facie case of differential treatment. I find that Mr. Willoughby has made out a prima facie case that he was treated adversely and differentially by CP on the basis of his disabilities.\n(ii) Has a prima facie case been made out on the second allegation: CP\u2019s April, 2002 decision not to continue his employment? [55] Mr. Willoughby testified that in April of 2002, Mr. Duncan advised him that there were no positions available to accommodate him and that he should apply for disability benefits.\n[56] I find that a prima facie case has been made out in respect of this second allegation. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence, if believed, would prove that CP\u2019s refusal to continue his employment on April 12, 2002 arose, at least in part, as a result of his disabilities in breach of section 7(a) of the CHRA in the absence of an answer from CP.\n(iii) Has a prima facie case been made out on the second allegation: CP\u2019s February 14, 2003 decision not to continue his employment? [57] Sun Life wrote to CP in November of 2002 advising that Mr. Willoughby was ready to return to work and proposed a gradual return to work plan that included a discrete list of work restrictions. In February of 2003, Mr. Willoughby testified that he was advised that there were no positions available at CP to accommodate his restrictions.\n[58] I find that a prima facie case has been made out. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence, if believed, would prove that CP\u2019s refusal to continue his employment on February 14, 2003, arose as a result of his disabilities in breach of section 7(a) of the CHRA in the absence of an answer from CP.\nB. Is CP able to justify its prima facie discriminatory conduct? [59] Section 15(1) of the CHRA directs that where an employer\u2019s decision or course of conduct is established by the employer to have resulted from a bona fide occupational requirement, the decision is not a discriminatory practice.\n[60] Section 15(2) of the CHRA clarifies that for a practice or a decision to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement, the employer must establish that accommodating the needs of the employee would impose undue hardship on the employer considering health, safety and cost.\n[61] The Supreme Court of Canada decision in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union (B.C.G.S.E.U.) (Meiorin Grievance) [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin), sets out the analysis by which a bona fide occupation requirement must be assessed.\n[62] To establish that its conduct was justified, or that the conduct arose as the result of a bona fide occupational requirement, the employer must prove:\nthat the standard was adopted or a decision made for a purpose rationally connected to a legitimate work related purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 58); that the standard adopted or the decision was made in an honest and good faith belief it was necessary to fulfill this work related purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 60); that the standard adopted or decision made was on the evidence reasonably necessary to accomplish this work related purpose (Meiorin, supra at para. 62).\n(i) Is CP able to justify its decision to continue the 3:30 a.m. assignment in March of 2002? [63] CP did not lead any direct evidence that would explain why Mr. Stevenson decided to keep Mr. Willoughby on the 3:30 a.m. shift after CP received medical information directing that he required day shift assignments. Mr. Stevenson was deceased at the time of the hearing and the personnel file he had maintained in respect of Mr. Willoughby could not be located. Mr. Duncan speculated that the 3:30 a.m. shift may have been the only position available at CP.\n[64] Once a complainant has satisfied his or her evidentiary burden, the employer must then satisfy its evidentiary burden: the employer must lead evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, each step of the Meiorin analysis. CP is unable to discharge its evidentiary burden in respect of any of the three arms of the Meiorin test. Mr. Duncan in his evidence speculated as to the considerations that might have informed Mr. Stevenson\u2019s decision to continue Mr. Willoughby\u2019s assignment on the 3:30 a.m. shift. An employer cannot discharge the evidentiary burden established in Meiorin by speculation (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] S.C.J. No. 73 at para. 41). I find that CP has been unable to satisfy its evidentiary burden in respect of this allegation.\n(ii) Is CP able to justify its decision not to continue Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment in April of 2002? [65] CP\u2019s evidence in respect of this allegation gives rise to a consideration that is preliminary to a consideration of whether its conduct was justified as contemplated in the Meiorin test. Mr. Duncan testified that Mr. Willoughby asked to be put on disability and that Mr. Duncan merely facilitated his request by assisting him in his application for benefits. Thus, there was no refusal to continue to employ Mr. Willoughby. Mr. Duncan\u2019s evidence is, of course, contrary to that of Mr. Willoughby, who testified that he was told that there was nothing for him at CP and that his only recourse was to apply for disability benefits. I find that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s evidence is more credible and accept it over the evidence of Mr. Duncan. I note in coming to this conclusion that in the disability insurance application form completed by Mr. Willoughby, he writes as follows: I would have continued working. My doctor says, and Canada Post\u2019s doctor says I should work a normal day shift, but Canada Post says that there are no day shift positions that are within my physical limitations. In addition, an e-mail exchange was introduced into evidence at the hearing of this complaint. Mr. Duncan was asked by CP in 2003 to summarize the manner in which Mr. Willoughby\u2019s accommodation was handled. In his response, Mr. Duncan did not report that Mr. Willoughby had requested that he go on disability. One would expect that had Mr. Willoughby asked to go on disability, or at least, had Mr. Duncan interpreted their discussion that way, this information would have been included in Mr. Duncan\u2019s report in 2003. It was not.\n[66] Having found that Mr. Willoughby did not ask to be put on disability, I will review the evidence led by CP in the alternative, being that there were no positions available at CP to accommodate Mr. Willoughby.\n[67] Turning to the first arm of the test in Meiorin, did CP establish that its decision was made for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the work? It was CP\u2019s evidence that the combination of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s medical restrictions and his performance difficulties that led it to conclude that there were no positions available to accommodate him within his own bargaining unit. Further, that assigning Mr. Willoughby to a position outside his own bargaining unit would create undue hardship as it would require that CP create a position for him. CP\u2019s purpose, it would appear, was to preserve efficiency in its operations. I find that CP\u2019s decision was made for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the work.\n[68] Moving to the second arm of the analysis, did CP establish that its decision was made in an honest and good faith belief that it was reasonably necessary to satisfy its legitimate work-related purpose? I find that CP has not established this second arm of the test. I find that CP knew or ought to have known that it had not properly considered the question of whether its decision was reasonably necessary in the circumstances.\n[69] CP\u2019s refusal to continue to employ Mr. Willoughby was made by Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan was an experienced labour relations officer with CP. He testified that he had significant experience in accommodation issues, dealing with employees and representing the company at arbitrations. I find that Mr. Duncan had, or ought to have had, an extensive understanding of the considerations applicable to a determination of whether a decision to refuse employment was reasonably necessary as contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin and that he had an extensive understanding of the procedural requirements imposed on employers as they consider whether they can accommodate the needs of an employee. I will deal with the procedural and substantive elements of the third arm of the test in Meiorin shortly, but I will observe in making this finding that it was Mr. Duncan\u2019s evidence that he did not, in advance of concluding that CP could not accommodate Mr. Willoughby, even review his file or any of the medical reports that had been written. Had Mr. Duncan reviewed the file, he might have noticed that Mr. Willoughby had been assigned to a shift that was contrary to his medical requirements. He might have realized that perhaps Mr. Willoughby\u2019s job performance difficulties in Depot 11 arose at least in part as a result of this assignment. As I will explore at greater length shortly, individual assessment is a critical first step that an employer must undertake when considering the accommodative needs of an employee. An experienced labour relations officer could not, in my view, hold a good faith belief that he or she was properly attending to the considerations necessary to an analysis of whether refusing to continue the employment of an employee was reasonably necessary, where such person failed to undertake such a fundamental preliminary inquiry.\n[70] Turning to the third step of the Meiorin test we ask whether the employer has established, on a balance of probabilities, that its decision was reasonably necessary to accomplish its work-related objectives. The decision will be reasonably necessary if the employer is able to demonstrate that it cannot accommodate an employee without experiencing undue hardship (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62, see also Grismer, supra, at para. 20 and Hutchinson, supra, at para. 70).\n[71] CP concluded that it could offer no position to Mr. Willoughby in April of 2002. Was this decision reasonably necessary in the sense contemplated in Meiorin? I find that it was not.\n[72] We are directed in this third arm of the test, to look first at the process or procedures adopted by the employer to assess the issue of accommodation, and second, to look at the substantive content of the decision made (Meiorin, supra, at para. 66).\n[73] An employer must demonstrate that the processes or procedures adopted to assess the matter of accommodation were appropriate. An employer must be sensitive to and respectful of the skills, capabilities and potential contributions of employees requiring accommodation (Meiorin, supra, at para. 64); an employer must investigate alternative approaches to accommodation that might be less discriminatory, and demonstrate that any alternative approach considered was rejected only for appropriate reasons (Meiorin, supra, at para. 65); an employer must be innovative and practical in assessing accommodation issues.\n(a) Was CP sensitive to Mr. Willoughby\u2019s skills, capabilities and potential contributions? [74] I find that CP was not sensitive to and respectful of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s skills, capabilities and potential contributions. This procedural requirement can be met only if the employer can establish that it has taken all necessary steps to ensure that they have fairly and properly assessed the employee\u2019s skills, capabilities and potential contributions. CP led no evidence that it undertook such an analysis in advance of considering Mr. Willoughby\u2019s need for accommodation\n[75] CP did lead evidence of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s job performance difficulties. I find, however, CP\u2019s evidence regarding these difficulties to have been overstated. The conduct that was described by Mr. Duncan is of a nature that one would expect to be met seriously by an employer. CP failed to produce a single poor performance review other than the one performed in 2001 while he was in the training unit. It was also CP\u2019s evidence that no disciplinary actions were taken in respect of Mr. Willoughby. If Mr. Willoughby was constantly and against direct orders ruining computers and important CP software, if he was utterly derelict and incompetent in his supervisory duties, surely a performance evaluation would make some mention of these matters. It is also difficult to believe that not a single disciplinary action was taken if the misconduct was as serious and relentless in nature as alleged.\n[76] Further, while medical reports were in the hands of CP, Mr. Duncan had not familiarized himself with these reports in advance of making his decision. Surely, taking the necessary steps to fairly and properly assess an employee\u2019s limitations is a necessary element of the employer\u2019s duty to be respectful of and sensitive to the unique capacities and circumstances of each employee and a necessary element of this procedural requirement.\n[77] The decision not to continue Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment in April of 2002 was based on the impression of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s condition formed by Mr. Duncan during his visits with him. The impression formed by Mr. Duncan was incomplete. He was unaware of the PTSD diagnosis and Mr. Willoughby\u2019s need to work a regular day shift. Without accurate preliminary information an employer cannot reasonably expect to be successful at accommodating an employee. This step of information gathering is crucial to the accommodation process and this step was ignored by CP.\n(b) Did CP carefully consider alternative approaches to Mr. Willoughby\u2019s accommodation? [78] CP led considerable evidence regarding the nature of alternate positions that might have been available to accommodate him within the APOC bargaining unit. I find that CP overstated the rigors of at least some of these jobs. I find that Mr. Duncan was not a very credible witness in respect of fairly describing the demands of at least some of the different positions that might have been made available to Mr. Willoughby. His evidence about the rigors of the depot assistant positions, after describing them as positions used to accommodate the aging and the infirm was less than credible. Further, his evidence was at times contradicted by other employees. For example, Mr. Kordoban, manager of CP\u2019s production, control and reporting department, also gave evidence at the hearing. His department dealt with staffing and budgeting among other things. Mr. Kordoban described that the route management and postal code management units were often used to temporarily accommodate injured employees and further that they did not have to be highly skilled; they learned on the job.\n(c) Did CP conduct an adequate search for alternative employment? [79] I find that CP failed to demonstrate that it had carefully considered alternative approaches to Mr. Willoughby\u2019s accommodation before deciding in April of 2002, that it was unable to accommodate him. CP led evidence that Mr. Willoughby could not perform any of the jobs available in the APOC bargaining unit. The letter carrier supervisor job required too much walking. Other APOC positions, for example data entry in the route management unit or the postal code maintenance unit, required an exquisite attention to detail. I found earlier that CP over-stated the rigors of many of the positions that might have been made available to Mr. Willoughby in his own bargaining unit. I also found earlier that CP over-stated Mr. Willoughby\u2019s short-comings as a supervisor. I find that CP did not demonstrate that there were no positions available within the APOC bargaining unit that could have accommodated Mr. Willoughby.\n[80] Further, CP did not demonstrate that it had made adequate inquiries in respect of positions that may have been available in other of its collective bargaining units. First, CP\u2019s evidence, through its labour relations officer, was that it had not made any careful investigation of whether there might be positions available within the CUPW bargaining unit. Mr. Duncan, it seems, assumed that if Mr. Willoughby was accommodated in that unit, some CUPW employee would be bounced into the street. This impressionistic evidence simply fails to meet the employer\u2019s procedural duty when considering accommodation. Mr. Duncan also testified that since there were surplus workers in the PSAC bargaining unit, there could be no positions available. This is not adequate investigation. The mere existence of surplus workers in the PSAC bargaining unit does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that there could be no positions that might be made available to Mr. Willoughby. Perhaps there was a position, or positions, that the surplus workers could not do, but that Mr. Willoughby could do. CP did not make these inquiries.\n[81] Further, unions have a role where an employer is seeking accommodation for an employee. A union has an obligation to become involved in matters of accommodation where such involvement is required to make accommodation possible, there being no other reasonable alternate resolution available to an employer (Renaud v. Central Okanagan School District No. 23 (1992) 95 D.L.R. 4th 577 (S.C.C.)). While the decision in Renaud dealt with the duty of a union to cooperate with an employer in respect of its own members, I see no principled reason why, where an employer\u2019s operation includes more than one union, a duty of cooperation would not attach to another bargaining unit if such cooperation is found to be the only way to secure accommodation for an employee. Had CP discovered a position that would have accommodated Mr. Willoughby, they could then have requested that the union cooperate. I find that CP should have canvassed both of CUPW and PSAC carefully to search for an accommodative position for Mr. Willoughby and I find that they did not.\n(d) Was CP adequately flexible and creative? [82] Employers must be innovative in their search to accommodate an employee. They must be flexible and creative. CP did not demonstrate adequate innovation, flexibility or creativity. CP dismissed out of hand any possibility that they could have bundled different tasks to provide an accommodative position for Mr. Willoughby. CP led evidence that there were insufficient administrative tasks performed by supervisors in a single depot to create a full time position for Mr. Willoughby. It did not, however, lead evidence that CP looked more broadly at its operations to determine whether there were other tasks that could be bundled to accommodate Mr. Willoughby.\n[83] I find the decision in Saunders v. Kentville (Town) [2004] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. No. 9 to be instructive. In that case, a Nova Scotia Board of inquiry considered the complaint of a police officer alleging that she was not accommodated by her detachment because of her sex\/pregnancy. Chair Deveau employed a Meiorin analysis in the context of a small police force in Nova Scotia. The Chair found that even in this small force of 12 to 14 officers, and even where accommodation would be awkward and inconvenient, the employer failed to discharge its duty to accommodate as it made little effort to assemble a number of duties and functions on a temporary basis in searching for ways of accommodating the claimant. The employer, he found, had a duty to fully and completely explore opportunities for light duties to the point of undue hardship. The employer had not proven that it had done that.\n[84] CP is a much larger operation with hundreds of employees working in Edmonton and doing a wide range of different job functions. I find that CP, had it been properly innovative and flexible, could have attempted to create, modify or re-package one or more of these job functions to accommodate Mr. Willoughby. CP led no evidence that it had engaged in this type of inquiry.\n(e) Did CP demonstrate that accommodating Mr. Willoughby would have created undue hardship? [85] Moving beyond the process employed by CP in considering its accommodation of Mr. Willoughby and viewing the substance of the decisions made, it is clear that CP failed to demonstrate that its decisions were justified in the manner contemplated by Meiorin. CP led no evidence to suggest that it would suffer undue hardship should it have accommodated Mr. Willoughby.\n[86] CP\u2019s position was that the only way it could accommodate Mr. Willoughby would be to create a position for him and that creating a position always amounts to undue hardship. First, I have found that CP did not establish that creating a position would be the only way that Mr. Willoughby could have been accommodated. However, even if that were true, such a requirement will not in every circumstance establish that the employer would suffer undue hardship.\n[87] The CHRA directs in section 15(2) that undue hardship may be made out through the consideration of health, safety and cost. The section does not direct that undue hardship will be made out wherever an employer is required to create a position to accommodate an employee and nor, in my opinion, should this section be interpreted in such a manner. Whether any action that might be necessary to accommodate an employee would be creative of undue hardship by reason of undue cost must be determined on a case by case basis. CP led no evidence that the creation of a position would, given its financial circumstances, be creative of undue hardship by reason of the cost that would be involved.\n[88] I find that CP has failed to discharge its evidentiary burden under section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA: it has not demonstrated that it would be impossible for it to accommodate Mr. Willoughby\u2019s restrictions without suffering undue hardship.\n(iii) Did CP demonstrate that its decision to refuse to continue Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment in February of 2003 was justified? [89] In February of 2003, Mr. Willoughby attended at CP for a meeting to discuss his return to work. A return to work proposal had been prepared by Sun Life after consulting with Mr. Willoughby, his doctor and his psychologist. The return to work proposal identified four restrictions. CP decided that it could not accommodate Mr. Willoughby. CP\u2019s reasons were the same as those that led it to decide it could not accommodate Mr. Willoughby earlier.\n[90] Turning to the first arm of the test in Meiorin, I find, again that the purpose of CP\u2019s decision was efficiency and further that the purpose was a legitimate work-related purpose and that the decision was rationally connected to that purpose.\n[91] Turning to the second arm of the test in Meiorin, I find that CP did not have an honest and good faith belief that its decision was reasonably necessary. By the time of the meeting in February of 2003, Mr. Willoughby had been off work for several months. It was Mr. Duncan\u2019s evidence that he did not, in advance of this meeting, review any of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s medical information. He was not aware that a return to work program had been designed to facilitate Mr. Willoughby\u2019s return. He had made no formal canvass of jobs that might be available to accommodate Mr. Willoughby. His evidence was that he understood Mr. Willoughby\u2019s restrictions had not changed and so CP\u2019s position had not changed. There were no positions available. The process undertaken by Mr. Duncan in advance of deciding that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment would not be continued was wholly inadequate. In the circumstances, I find that CP did not have an honest and good faith belief that its decision was reasonably necessary.\n[92] With respect to the third arm of the Meiorin test, the evidence led by CP relevant to this part of the analysis in respect of the February, 2003 decision was the same evidence that was led in respect of the April, 2002 decision. Accordingly, my analysis of whether the decision was reasonably necessary is the same for both decisions. I repeat the earlier analysis and find that CP has not demonstrated that its decision not to continue Mr. Willoughby\u2019s employment in February of 2003 was reasonably necessary.\n(iv) Finding of Discrimination [93] For all these reasons, I find that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s complaint that he suffered discrimination on the basis of his disabilities in breach of both sections 7(a) and 7(b) of the CHRA has therefore been substantiated.\nV. Remedies A. Compensation for lost wages [94] Mr. Willoughby has asked for compensation for lost wages pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Section 53(2)(c) empowers a tribunal, upon having found a complaint substantiated, to compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[95] The Federal Court of Appeal has recently considered the analysis appropriate to making awards in compensation for lost wages. In Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No. 1134, Pelletier J.A., writing for the Court, directs that the central consideration when considering such an award is to determine whether there exists a causal connection between the lost wages and the discriminatory act or acts. The principles that limit recovery in damage assessments in civil litigation, such as remoteness and foreseeability, have no application. A wrongdoer may be ordered to compensate its victim for losses caused by his or her conduct whether or not such losses could have reasonably been foreseen. Section 53(2)(c) gives the Tribunal discretion. The section directs that a tribunal may order compensation in respect of any or all of wages lost as a result of discriminatory conduct. This discretion must be exercised in a principled manner (Chopra, supra, at para. 37). Further, while a tribunal may consider whether a victim has taken steps to mitigate his or her damages, mitigation is not a mandatory consideration. Mitigation can be considered should the Tribunal consider it appropriate in the circumstances.\n[96] Mr. Willoughby was unable to obtain employment until July of 2004. He testified that he was at first emotionally devastated by CP\u2019s conduct and that later he had difficulty finding employment because of his disabilities. I find that Mr. Willoughby made reasonable attempts to mitigate his damages by looking for alternate employment. I also find that CP\u2019s discriminatory conduct was the cause of the period of unemployment experienced by Mr. Willoughby before he was able to secure employment. Had CP not refused to continue his employment, Mr. Willoughby would have remained employed. Mr. Willoughby testified that he was able to secure alternate employment in July of 2004. I believe that an award for lost wages extending from when he last worked for CP in April of 2002 until the day he commenced employment with Mill Woods Suzuki in July of 2004 is appropriate compensation for lost wages.\n[97] Pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, I order CP to compensate Mr. Willoughby for wages that he has lost from his removal from service, April 15, 2002, until the date he commenced working in July of 2004. Any disability or other benefits and any employment income received by him will be deducted from the award or re-paid to the issuer. In addition, CP will pay to Mr. Willoughby any employment benefits he would have received during this time, including the amount, if any, that CP would have contributed to Mr. Willoughby\u2019s pension plan on his behalf.\n[98] Mr. Willoughby has asked that he be compensated for 95 days of lost sick benefits. I heard no evidence to suggest that employees of CP are entitled to receive any monetary compensation for banked sick days upon their departure from CP\u2019s employ and accordingly I do not make this order.\nB. Compensation for pain and suffering [99] Mr. Willoughby testified that CP\u2019s refusal to assign him to a day shift in March of 2002, after having received a letter from his doctor containing that direction, caused his health, both his physical and his mental health, to continue to deteriorate.\n[100] Mr. Willoughby also testified about the emotional impact of CP\u2019s refusal to continue his employment, first in April of 2002 and again in February of 2003. He described feeling devastated. He felt betrayed by his employer, felt wholly without value and depressed. He testified that his psychological symptoms became aggravated. Our courts have recognized the centrality of one\u2019s employment to one\u2019s sense of identity, self worth and emotional well being (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.) [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313 at 368). I find that CP\u2019s conduct caused Mr. Willoughby to suffer serious pain and suffering.\n[101] I order CP to pay Mr. Willoughby $10,000.00 in compensation for this pain and suffering.\nC. Special Compensation [102] The complainant asks for special compensation. Under the CHRA, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award a maximum of $20,000.00 upon finding that a respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly (section 53(3)). I have found that CP knew or ought to have known that it had not attended to the matter of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s accommodation in a manner consistent with the principles established in Meiorin. CP\u2019s conduct was either willful or it was reckless. Special compensation is accordingly appropriate and I award $10,000.00.\nD. Legal Costs [103] The complainant asks for an order directing that the respondent pay the legal costs incurred by him during the course of this proceeding. Sections 53(2)(c) and 53(2)(d) both empower the Tribunal, where it finds that a complaint is substantiated, to make among other orders, an order that the respondent compensate the victim for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[104] Chairperson Sinclair has recently made a careful review of Federal Court jurisprudence dealing with this issue (Mowat v. Canada Post Corporation, 2006 CHRT 49). He concludes that the predominance of authority from that court is that the Tribunal has the power to award legal costs under section 53(2).\n[105] I agree with this conclusion and am further persuaded that this Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award legal costs for the reasons articulated by Chairperson Mactavish (as she then was) in her decision of Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 29). Chairperson Mactavish notes that human rights legislation, given its fundamental and quasi-constitutional status is to be given a liberal and purposive construction, not only in respect to the rights protected under such statutes, but in respect of the remedial powers conferred (Nkwazi, at para. 13; see also Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at 1136; Robichaud v. The Queen, [1987] 2 S.C.R 84).\n[106] The Federal Court of Appeal decision in Chopra does not deal expressly with the matter of legal costs. The decision does, however, consider the proper interpretation of section 53(2)(c), which is one of the sections of the CHRA that confer upon this Tribunal the jurisdiction to award legal costs. Pelletier J.A. directs that the central consideration when making awards pursuant to this section is that of a causal nexus between the expenses incurred and the discriminatory conduct. Considerations such as remoteness, foreseeability, have no application, and mitigation can be considered where appropriate, but is not a mandatory element of the analysis.\n[107] In this case, each of the three allegations was found to have been substantiated. I find that CP\u2019s discriminatory conduct caused Mr. Willoughby to incur legal expenses in the pursuit of his complaint. I find that in the circumstances it is appropriate that Mr. Willoughby\u2019s reasonable legal expenses incurred in relation to this complaint be paid, and I so order.\nE. Interest [108] Interest is payable in respect of all the awards made in this decision, except the award of legal costs, pursuant to section 53(4) of the CHRA. In denying interest in respect of legal fees, I am persuaded by the decision of Chairperson Sinclair, that interest is not an expense under section 53(2) of the CHRA. I heard no evidence that Mr. Willoughby paid any interest in respect of his legal expenses and so do not order that interest is payable in respect of this expense.\n[109] In respect of the other orders, the interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada, per Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering and the special compensation, the interest shall run from the date of the complaint.\nF. Retention of jurisdiction [110] The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders, if the parties are unable to reach an agreement with respect to any issues arising from the remedies ordered in the within decision. Should the parties require direction on any remedial matter they may request same within 60 days of the date of this decision.\nSigned by\nJulie C.

Gesturing with his hand, the Tribunal Chairperson indicated to the respondent\u2019s counsel to stop his examination of Dr. Dufour. Then, for 20 minutes, the Tribunal Chairperson observed Ms. Montreuil sleeping with her head on her chest. During this 20-minute period, nobody in the hearing room \u2013 i.e. the Tribunal Chairperson, the registry officer, the respondent\u2019s two counsel, the Commission\u2019s counsel and the witness \u2013 made the slightest sound, observing complete silence. It was not until about 10:55 a.m. that Ms. Montreuil finally woke up.\n[2] The Tribunal Chairperson then let Ms. Montreuil know that she had slept for 20 minutes and that during all that time, the Tribunal Chairperson as well as the other persons present in the hearing room were able to observe this fact. Moreover, the audio recording that continued during this 20-minute period indicates that not a word was said during this period of time in the hearing room. The Tribunal Chairperson also told Ms. Montreuil that she would not be allowed to cross-examine Dr. Dufour, as her mental absence during Dr. Dufour\u2019s examination prevented her from adequately following her testimony and from carrying out an effective cross-examination. The Tribunal told the parties that it would give reasons for its decision.\n[3] About 20 minutes after the hearing resumed, the Tribunal Chairperson noted that Ms. Montreuil was dozing. The Tribunal Chairperson once again interrupted Dr. Dufour\u2019s testimony to let Ms. Montreuil know that her conduct was unacceptable. Ms. Montreuil then explained her state of fatigue by the fact that she had not slept for almost 28 hours, having prepared documents for this proceeding, exams for her students, etc. Moreover, Ms. Montreuil stated that the witness\u2019 excessively soft voice was putting her to sleep.\n[4] The Tribunal Chairperson then reminded Ms. Montreuil that the hearing room was not a dormitory and that it was unacceptable for counsel not to be attentive to the debates taking place in a hearing room and to the examination of a witness whom she is expected to cross-examine. The Tribunal Chairperson then demanded that Ms. Montreuil choose between being entirely present before the Tribunal or excusing herself to rest outside the hearing room. Ms. Montreuil then decided to leave the hearing room.\n[5] On the afternoon of October 17, the Tribunal observed that Ms. Montreuil was not present when the hearing resumed to continue Dr. Dufour\u2019s examination. Ms. Montreuil was however present when the hearing resumed after the afternoon recess.\n[6] It goes without saying that in the context of a hearing, both the physical presence and the mental presence of counsel is required if counsel is called to cross-examine a witness. The fact that counsel, who is also a party, would sleep during a hearing is disrespectful to the Tribunal as well as to the witness, colleagues and the administration of justice. It is, in fact, unacceptable that the conduct of a member of the Bar be as offensive and disrespectful as Ms Montreuil\u2019s conduct.\n[7] As a member of the Bar, Ms. Montreuil must be aware of the decorum that must be displayed before any Tribunal. The reasons made ex post facto by Ms. Montreuil to explain her conduct do not hold water. Her numerous activities cannot in any way justify a conduct as irreverent and disrespectful as hers was before the Tribunal. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, her conduct on the morning of October 17, 2007, compromised her ability to perform her duties as counsel, at least insofar as Dr. Dufour\u2019s cross-examination was concerned.\n[8] Accordingly, considering that Ms. Montreuil did not show that she was closely following the testimony of Dr. Dufour, the respondent\u2019s witness, at the hearing on the morning of October 17, 2007, so that she could at the appropriate time proceed with a relevant and effective cross-examination but that instead, to the contrary, she was in a state which prevented her from following Dr. Dufour\u2019s testimony and comprehending its content, for all intents and purposes, the Tribunal withdraws Ms. Montreuil\u2019s right to cross-examine Dr. Dufour. Only the Commission\u2019s counsel is authorized to cross-examine Dr. Dufour.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario October 25, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1047\/2805\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

In her request, Ms. Montreuil asks, moreover, that Mr. Lamb be excluded from the Tribunal (sic) for the remainder of the hearings.\n[2] Attached to this request is another request to order the respondent, the Canadian Forces, to pay the complainant the amount of $336.10 in repayment of the costs incurred for a trip to Montr\u00e9al in May 2006 for an interview with Dr. Assalian, Dr. Wilchesky and Dr. Dufour.\n[3] At the hearing, the respondent made a verbal motion to dismiss the complainant\u2019s requests. The respondent raised two grounds regarding the finding of guilt and one ground regarding the payment of the amount of $336.10.\n[4] With regard to the request for the declaration of guilt, the respondent submits first that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide this matter and that there are other forums for dealing with the issues raised by the complainant. The respondent submits next that the complainant\u2019s request is an abusive proceeding that has no basis in law.\n[5] With regard to the payment of the amount of $336.10 for costs incurred by the complainant when she travelled to Montreal for an interview with Dr. Assalian, Dr. Wilchesky and Dr. Dufour, the respondent argues that this issue must be determined later, namely during the arguments on remedies.\n[6] After hearing counsel, the Tribunal rendered judgment from the bench. The Tribunal granted the respondent\u2019s verbal motion to dismiss, with reasons to follow in regard to the complainant\u2019s first request. The Tribunal deferred its decision regarding the amount of $336.10 until after hearing the parties on the issue of remedies.\n[7] This decision sets out the reasons that lead the Tribunal to dismiss the complainant\u2019s first request regarding Mr. Lamb\u2019s conduct.\n[8] In this case, the complainant is asking the Tribunal to find Mr. Lamb guilty of failing to respect his professional and ethical duties as well as deliberately deceiving and misleading the complainant. She is requesting that Mr. Lamb be excluded for the remainder of the hearings.\n[9] The complainant, who is a lawyer, must know that breaches of professional ethics, for that is what we are dealing with in this case, are under the jurisdiction of the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s syndic and not of a Tribunal like this Tribunal. If the complainant believes that Mr. Lamb acted inappropriately toward her and breached his professional duties, the complainant can file a complaint with the syndic of the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec. The Tribunal does not have any jurisdiction to declare counsel guilty of a breach of professional ethics. [Emphasis added.]\n[10] Moreover, the Tribunal is of the opinion that this request involving a counsel of the Canadian Forces is an abuse of process. As stated earlier, the Tribunal has no authority to find counsel guilty of failing to respect his professional and ethical duties or deliberately deceiving and misleading the complainant. This would require some form of proof from the complainant as well as a response from Mr. Lamb. Whatever the case, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to preside over such a hearing.\n[11] That said, the request to exclude Mr. Lamb from the Tribunal for the remainder of the hearings has no legal foundation, no legal basis and makes no sense. It is an entirely unreasonable request by Ms. Montreuil and is indicative of a complete ignorance of the rules of procedure and the applicable law on her part.\n[12] A party cannot present untimely procedures as she pleases and rashly demand orders. This is what Ms. Montreuil is doing in this case. The findings that she seeks in this case are a non sequitur to the allegations.\n[13] Rather than file requests like the request contemplating Mr. Lamb, it would be to Ms. Montreuil\u2019s advantage to concentrate on the more fundamental aspects of her complaint. In so doing, she would not have to work day and night and she would then be able to make her presence at the hearings more constructive.\n[14] Moreover, if Ms. Montreuil believes that there was an agreement between her and the respondent\u2019s counsel in regard to her travelling to Montr\u00e9al to meet with Dr. Assalian, Dr. Wilchesky and Dr. Dufour and that there\u2019s a breach of the agreement, she will simply have to argue in due course that there was an agreement \u2013 even verbal \u2013 and that it was breached. The Tribunal will then be able to determine whether there was such an agreement and, if need be, order the respondent to pay back the costs claimed.\n[15] Accordingly, the motion to dismiss by the respondent\u2019s counsel is granted and Ms. Montreuil\u2019s request to have Mr. Guy Lamb, one of the respondent\u2019s counsel, found guilty of failing to respect his professional and ethical duties and deliberately deceiving and misleading the complainant, as well as to exclude him from the hearings, is dismissed.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario October 25, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1047\/2805\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

Grant Sinclair Date: October 25, 2007 Citation: 2007 CHRT 48\nAir Canada\u2019s Motion [1] Air Canada brings a motion asking the Tribunal to permanently stay the hearing of the human rights complaint of Eddy Morten which he filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) on September 19, 2005. The CHRC referred his complaint to the Tribunal on February 23, 2007.\nMr. Morten and His Human Rights Complaint [2] In his human rights complaint, Mr. Morten claims that Air Canada requires him to travel with an attendant when there is no such requirement for an able-bodied person. He alleges that, in doing so, Air Canada discriminates against him because of his disability, contrary to s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[3] Mr. Morten describes himself as a 43 year old male who is deaf-blind. He has some tunnel vision and lives totally independently without home care support. In August 2004, Mr. Morten purchased an airline ticket through his travel agency to fly on Air Canada from Vancouver to San Francisco. He has traveled alone to Europe twice and to the United States frequently on Air Canada and other airlines.\n[4] About two weeks after he booked his flight, he was told by his travel agency that Air Canada would not allow him to travel on the flight to San Francisco unless he was accompanied by an attendant. He did not make the trip.\n[5] Mr. Morten does not have access to an attendant and cannot afford to pay for an attendant fare. More importantly, he firmly believes that he is well able to fly independently and does not require an attendant.\nCanada Transportation Agency Decision [6] In February 2005, Mr. Morten filed an application with the Canada Transportation Agency (Agency), under the Canada Transportation Act (CTA). He claimed that the requirement of Air Canada that he travel with an attendant was an undue obstacle to his mobility.\n[7] The Agency issued its decision on July 8, 2005. It agreed with Mr. Morten that Air Canada\u2019s requirement is an obstacle to his mobility. But the Agency concluded that it is not undue. Accordingly, the Agency took no action on Mr. Morten\u2019s application.\n[8] Air Canada argues that the same issues raised by Mr. Morten in his human rights complaint have already been dealt with by the Agency and should not be re-litigated. Air Canada pleads issue estoppel, collateral attack and abuse of process.\n[9] Mr. Morten\u2019s complaint to the Agency is under Part V of the CTA. Section 172 empowers the Agency on application, to determine whether there is an undue obstacle to the mobility of persons with disabilities using the federal transportation network. If the Agency concludes this to be the case, it can require corrective action or direct compensation be paid for any expense incurred by a person with a disability, or both.\n[10] Part V of the CTA must be considered in conjunction with s. 5 of that CTA, which declares Canada\u2019s national transportation policy. In particular, s. 5 (g)(ii) provides that each carrier or mode of transportation should operate, as far as is practicable, so as not to cause an undue obstacle to the mobility of persons including those with disabilities.\n[11] Both Mr. Morten and Air Canada made submissions to the Agency concerning Air Canada\u2019s requirement that he travel with an attendant. In reaching its decision, the Agency noted that Air Canada had consulted with Mr. Morten\u2019s travel agency and his representative with respect to his disability. On the basis of these consultations, Air Canada concluded that Mr. Morten was not self-reliant and required an attendant. According to Air Canada\u2019s applicable tariff, non self-reliant means a person who is not self-sufficient and capable of taking care of his\/her needs during a flight or during an emergency evacuation or decompression, and has no special or unusual needs beyond assistance in boarding or deplaning.\n[12] On the question of whether Air Canada\u2019s requirement was an undue obstacle, the Agency accepted Air Canada\u2019s assessment of the safety-related concerns that could arise in the event of an emergency evacuation or decompression. Air Canada\u2019s position is that, in these situations, Mr. Morten could hinder not only his own safety but the safety of all passengers. The collective safety of the passengers and crew must take precedence over the personal preference of an individual passenger.\nThe Agency and Human Rights Principles [13] The Supreme Court of Canada in its 2007 decision in CCD v. Via Rail, recognized that the test for finding an undue obstacle to mobility under the CTA is the same test for determining undue hardship under s. 15 of the CHRA. And in defining and identifying undue obstacles in the transportation context, the Agency must apply the principles of the CHRA (Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15, at para. 115)\n[14] Where an employer or service provider seeks to justify an otherwise discriminatory, policy or practice under s.15 of the CHRA, they must demonstrate that they have made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship.\n[15] The human rights principles as to what constitutes undue hardship have been considered in a number of Supreme Court decisions. These decisions may be summarized as follows. Where there is a barrier to mobility, the barrier can only be justified if it is impossible to accommodate the individual without imposing undue hardship on the person who has imposed the barrier. The point of undue hardship is reached when all reasonable alternatives to accommodation are exhausted and there remains only unreasonable or impractical options for accommodation (VIA Rail at paras. 129, 130).\n[16] For the Agency to conclude that there is no undue obstacle to the mobility of persons with disabilities, it must be satisfied that no reasonable alternative to burdening such persons exists. The burden to satisfy the Agency is on the person who has imposed the barrier.\nIssue Estoppel [17] With this background, I turn now to a consideration of issue estoppel and whether it should be applied in this case. Three pre-conditions must be satisfied before issue estoppel applies:\nthe same question is being decided in both proceedings; the judicial decision said to create the estoppel is final; and the parties or the privies are the same in both proceedings.\n[18] However, even if these conditions are satisfied, a court or tribunal must decide, as a matter of discretion, whether issue estoppel should be applied in the circumstances of the particular case (Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44 at paras. 25, 33).\n[19] The third pre-condition has not been established. The parties to the Agency adjudication were Mr. Morten and Air Canada. The parties to the human rights proceeding are Mr. Morten, Air Canada and the CHRC. The parties are not the same.\n[20] The CHRC cannot be considered in any way to be the privy of Mr. Morten. Section 51 of the CHRA makes it clear that when appearing at a hearing, the CHRC represents the public interest and not the complainant.\n[21] Indeed, on this question, Air Canada simply argues that although the Commission has now been added as a party to the Tribunal proceedings for the purpose of representing the public interest pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is submitted that this aspect of the test for issue estoppel has been met. Air Canada\u2019s submission recognizes the public interest role of the CHRC and impliedly concedes that the parties are not the same. There is nothing more to its submission than that.\n[22] The second step of the two step analysis, the exercise of discretion only comes into play when all of the pre-conditions are met. Because the parties are not the same in both proceedings, there is no need to consider the exercise of discretion within the issue estoppel context.\nAbuse of Process [23] The rationale for the abuse of process doctrine is to preserve the integrity of the judicial\/adjudicative process by promoting judicial economy, consistency and finality. Relitigation can have negative consequences. There is no guarantee that relitigation will produce a more accurate result than the first proceeding. It can yield contradictory results. And it may waste judicial resources and involve unnecessary expenses for the parties. (Toronto v. CUPE, 2003 SCC 63, at paras.37, 51)\n[24] However, there may be cases where the bar to relitigation would lead to unfairness or create an injustice. In such case, this would overcome the interest in maintaining the finality of the original decision (Toronto v. C.U.P.E., para. 63).\n[25] There are two compelling reasons that militate against applying the doctrine of abuse of process to stay the Tribunal\u2019s proceeding. First, the CHRC is participating as a party in the Tribunal proceeding dealing with Mr. Morten\u2019s complaint. It has a statutory right to present evidence and represent the public interest in the prevention and elimination of discrimination (ss. 2 and 51 of the CHRA).\n[26] The CHRC was not a party to the Agency proceedings and did not have the opportunity to advance the public interest that it has identified in this case. The Agency\u2019s decision was rendered without the input of the CHRC.\n[27] Secondly, it is apparent from its decision that the Agency\u2019s analysis in dealing with Mr. Morten\u2019s claim falls far short of what would be required under the Via Rail test. Mr. Morten\u2019s services complaint under s. 5 of the CHRA is ongoing in nature and impugns a policy that Air Canada continues to pursue.\n[28] It would be an injustice to deprive both Mr. Morten and the CHRC of the opportunity to put Air Canada to the strict proof of its contention that accommodating his needs or others with similar needs, would cause it undue hardship within the meaning of these terms.\nCollateral Attack [29] The rule against collateral attack operates to prevent a challenge in a subsequent proceeding, to the legality of a judicial order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. This rule focuses on attacking the order itself and its legal effect (Toronto v. CUPE, at paras. 33, 34; Danyluk at para. 20). This is not the case with Mr. Morten\u2019s human rights complaint. It is not a claim which seeks to contest the legality of the Agency\u2019s decision in the proceedings before this Tribunal.\nConclusion [30] Air Canada has not satisfied the three preconditions for issue estoppel. It is not an abuse of process to allow Mr. Morten\u2019s human rights complaint to proceed. The rule against collateral attack does not apply in this case.\n[31] For these reasons, Air Canada\u2019s motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Introduction [1] The Complainant, Richard Warman, has filed a complaint, dated January 6, 2005, alleging that the Respondent, Jessica Beaumont, discriminated against persons or groups of persons on the basis of religion, sexual orientation, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, and disability, by repeatedly communicating messages through an Internet website. He alleges that the messages would likely expose Rastafarians, Jews, gays and lesbians, Chinese, Hispanics, blacks, Aboriginals, and other non-whites to hatred and\/or contempt, contrary to s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission participated at the hearing and was represented by legal counsel. Mr. Warman and Ms. Beaumont appeared and testified at the hearing. They were not represented by legal counsel, but Ms. Beaumont was assisted by an agent, Paul Fromm, who is not a lawyer. Mr. Fromm indicated at the opening of the hearing that he was offering her some assistance, having been involved as an intervenor in a number of cases regarding s. 13 of the Act. Mr. Fromm emphasized that he was not in a position to provide Ms. Beaumont with proper legal counsel. As her agent, he made an opening statement, examined and cross-examined witnesses, and presented final arguments on her behalf.\nII. Analysis A. Section 13 of the Act [3] In order to substantiate a complaint of discrimination under s. 13(1) of the Act, it must be established that a person or group of persons acting in concert communicated telephonically or caused to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[4] Section 13(2) specifies that s. 13(1) applies to matter that is communicated by means of the Internet.\nB. What are the impugned messages that Ms. Beaumont allegedly communicated? [5] Mr. Warman testified that he viewed the alleged hate messages starting in January 2004, principally on a website based in the United States called Stormfront.org. This website consists mainly of a forum where individuals post messages that can be viewed by anyone on the Internet. The forum is divided up into a number of sections, which are themselves divided up into numerous levels of sub-sections (also known alternatively as sub-forums, topics, threads or discussions). One of the sections of the Stormfront.org forum is dedicated to Canadian issues, and is entitled Stormfront Canada.\n[6] Persons who wish to post messages on the Stormfront.org forum must first register themselves as members. They may then post messages on any of the existing sub-forums. They may even create new sub-forums on which they post the initial message that then can be viewed by others on the Internet. Other Stormfront.org forum members may then post their own messages on the sub-forum.\n[7] Members have the choice of displaying their true identities next to the postings, or using pseudonyms instead. Ms. Beaumont readily acknowledged in her evidence that she posted messages on the Stormfront.org forum under the pseudonym Jessy Destruction. The margin notes next to postings usually indicate the date when the member joined the forum and the number of posts the person had made to date. Ms. Beaumont\u2019s join date is shown as October 2003. One of the postings entered into evidence was posted on May 5, 2006. Its margin notes indicate that she had by this point made 1,023 postings on the Stormfront.org forum.\n[8] The margin notes also typically show the member\u2019s declared location. In many of her postings, Ms. Beaumont gives her location as being in the land of brainwashed whites. In her other postings, the location is simply Coquitlam, BC, Canada.\n[9] During his testimony, Mr. Warman led into evidence printouts of the impugned messages, posted by Jessy Destruction, most of which I have summarized below. In her testimony, Ms. Beaumont acknowledged having posted almost all of these messages, but for two that she does not recall posting. Many of the impugned messages contained the occasional spelling mistake or typographical error. Rather than repeatedly identifying the errors, I have simply reproduced the texts as they appeared on the printouts filed in evidence.\nMessage 1 \u2013 January 24, 2004\n[10] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Gangs and Double Standards. The initiator of this discussion argued that the term racist is usually ascribed to gangs composed of white people, but not to those made up of non-whites. Another contributor to the discussion referred to an incident where he and his crew had been thrown out of a bar because they were wearing boots and flight jackets with swastikas on them. Ms. Beaumont was apparently there during the incident because in the message that she posted, she complained that if we were nigs, then we\u2019d just be blacks hanging out and eating.\nMessage 2 \u2013 January 25, 2004\n[11] This is one of the messages that Ms. Beaumont does not recall posting. It was posted in a sub-forum entitled Blacks in Western Canada?. The discussion centred on a comparison between the concentrations of Blacks in Western Canada relative to Ontario. The margin note shows that the message was posted by Jessy Destruction. The message states, It could get worse, lets just cross our fingers and hope they all die off from AIDS.\nMessage 3 - January 28, 2004\n[12] This is another message that Ms. Beaumont does not recall posting. It was posted on a sub-forum regarding inter-racial dating. A contributor to the sub-forum had asked other forum members how they would react if a close relative began dating a non-white. A message in reply, which was posted by Jessy Destruction, states I told my sister already that I would kill him and then beat her up, she knows I would too\u2026but she says blacks look funny so I don\u2019t have to worry.\nMessage 4 - May 29, 2004\n[13] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Re: Calgary Alberta. It states:\nOooh Marcus, the only nigger who went to punk shows. Now I see where you got the name Darkus from\u2026yeah I met him like\u20264 or 5 years ago at a show, at the multi. I don\u2019t go to shows anymore unless its either a) a REALLY REALLY good band or b) Cheap beer.\nThe context of the message is not clear given that the messages that preceded Ms. Beaumont\u2019s posting were not produced. Ms. Beaumont testified, however, that she grew up in Calgary. She moved to British Columbia for a couple of years before taking up residence in Calgary again, in 2006.\nMessage 5 - June 10, 2004\n[14] On a sub-forum entitled Britkids website, there was a discussion about a website dealing with young people in Britain. The initiator of the sub-forum commented that of the nine youths shown on the website, only one is of White European descent. Ms. Beaumont posted a message with a reference to an excerpt from this website in which one of these British youths professes to be a Rastafarian. Ms. Beaumont adds the following comment:\nThat\u2019s about the little nignog\u2019s religion. This site is disgusting, it really worrys me even more so about what my sisters are being forcefed in school.\nMessage 6 - June 24, 2004\n[15] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled My Rant About Pride Week in TO. The initiator of the discussion criticized the holding of Gay Pride Week in Toronto. In her subsequent posting on this sub-forum, Ms. Beaumont stated:\nI think we all know where your coming from with this rant, we had a week in Calgary, I stayed in the whole week. But about a week after I went downtown and still saw some of the fag banners hanging around town.\nMessage 7 - August 14, 2004\n[16] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Let Muslim women keep hijabs on. The discussion related to a news report that then Prime Minister Paul Martin believed that the practice at Montreal\u2019s airport of requiring Muslim women to remove headscarves as they pass through security screening should be stopped. Ms. Beaumont posted the following comment in this regard:\nThat drives me nuts, I take photos for the citizenship, passports, pr (permanent residence), visa cards etc. and as I have been told from human resourses that the ears MUST be visable, which means, if your hair covers your ears, it has to be tucked back.\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a religious thing or not, if you don\u2019t want to follow our rules, even if it is taking off your scarf thing for one lousy picture, then stay out of my effing country!\nMessage 8 - August 14, 2004\n[17] This message was posted on a sub-forum called Some semi-drunken ramblings from the new member. The person who initiated the discussion complained that as a fourth generation Torontonian, it broke his heart to see the city slip quietly into the hands of filthy thirdworlders. Ms. Beaumont was the fifth person to reply to these comments. She wrote:\nIt\u2019s good to see a new member on this board, welcome.\nJust think, all the mindless pawns of the juden who believe in race-mixing and all that such, will be screwed over in the end.\nMessage 9 - October 15, 2004\n[18] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled The Most Sick Thing I Have Ever Witnessed. The initiator of the discussion complained that he saw a white man in his early twenties with a veiled muslim that looked fresh off the boat, with the mud baby in the stroller! Ms. Beaumont was the first forum member to reply to this comment. She wrote:\nEver seen a tar black negriod and a chink? That\u2019s a pretty sick\/funny site.\nMessage 10 - October 22, 2004\n[19] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Homosexual pornography is art!? The initiator of the discussion was apparently a university student. He complained that the works displayed by a visiting artist to his university included photos of the artist performing oral sex on another male. Another forum member, with the username Der Totenkopf, posted a subsequent message stating that this was not art but rather some sick mental defect fag getting off on the fact that you guys having to watch it.\n[20] Ms. Beaumont posted her own comment in reply, but it is noteworthy that on this occasion, she opted to quote the other member\u2019s remark before adding her own. Users of Stormfront.org\u2019s forum typically have two options available to them if they want to post a message to an existing discussion. They may either click on a Reply icon that enables them to simply post their own comments, or they may choose to click on the Quote icon, in which case the member can select an excerpt from one of the previously posted messages and incorporate it in the new message. The excerpt is placed in a separate bordered text box and is preceded with the word Quote.\nIn this case, after excerpting Der Totenkopf\u2019s remarks, Ms. Beaumont added, AGREED! f\u2019ing perverts.\nMessage 11 - November 1, 2004\n[21] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled New $20 bill. The initiator of the discussion disagreed with the decision to feature a First Nations traditional carving of a Haida canoe on the new $20 note. Ms. Beaumont made the following comment in this regard:\nI haven\u2019t seen the new $50 bills, but the $20\u2019s and $100\u2019s I have seen. I have talked with a few people about them (who aren\u2019t WN) but they don\u2019t like the fact that there is native stuff on the bills. I mean, who wants to pay for something and be reminded of a chug? Not me!\nMr. Warman testified that WN stands for White Nationalists.\nMessage 12 - November 12, 2004\n[22] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled No Need to Feel Threatened. One of the participants in this discussion suggested that there was nothing wrong with having non-white friends. Ms. Beaumont replied to this suggestion as follows:\nI just don\u2019t feel the need to be-friend non-whites, as they can do nothing for me, nor would I like to associate with them. I am fine with my own kind, and allways will\/have been. Theres my f*cking answer. Good enough? If not, PM [private message] me, well debate this some more.\n[23] Private messaging was an available feature on the forum, which enabled participants to communicate directly with one another without their discussions appearing on the forum. No one other than the communicating individuals would be able to view their messages exchanged in this fashion.\nMessage 13 - November 19, 2004\n[24] Ms. Beaumont posted the following message on a sub-forum to welcome a new member, who apparently was moving to Calgary:\nWelcome, I am living in Calgary\u2026 until Sunday. But you can always PM me, or other Calgarians. It\u2019s a nice city, if you get past all the ARA threats (which are just that\u2026 empty threats) and homo loving retards. And, if you can, stay the f*ck away from the North East and North West, filled with non-whites, best place is the good old south, still white.\n[25] The term ARA mentioned in Ms. Beaumont\u2019s message is a reference to a group known as Anti-Racist Action.\nMessage 14 - December 2, 2004\n[26] This message was posted on a sub-forum dealing with the American artist, Norman Rockwell, entitled Norman Rockwell is racially insensitive. Ms. Beaumont wrote:\nI love Norman Rockwell, he is one of my favorite artists of live. I have a collection of his works, in one he has a little black girl on her way to school, the wall behind her says Nigger, as well as a tomatoe has just been thrown. She has 3 black men escorting her towards school; the painting is titled What we all Have to Live With.\nMessages 15 and 16 - December 2 and 3, 2004\n[27] These messages both appear in a sub-forum that Ms. Beaumont initiated entitled 16 Facts. The first message reads as follows:\nI got this off a US site, but I feel it applies to Canada as well.\nCRITICAL FACTS THAT YOUR KIDS WILL NOT LEARN IN SCHOOL.\nThe White race made America what it is today. American heritage is White heritage. American law is based upon White concepts from White European thought. The American all-White neighborhoods of the past were demonstrably safer, and freer of crime of all sorts than integrated neighborhoods of today. The American all-White schools of the past were clearly superior to any integrated school of today. All great societies of the past which were White as they rose to power, when they changed from being dominantly White, to a dominantly mixed race society, they fell permanently into decay. (e.g. Egypt, Greece, Rome, Spain, Portugal.) Racial integration of our neighborhoods and our schools has forced them into decay, just like the racial integration of the societies of the great White nations of the past caused them to fall into decay. History, both ancient and recent American, has consistently taught the very same lesson. It is clear beyond any debate, that modifying the racial composition of America away from the dominantly White society that it was as it rose to power, towards a mixed, racially diverse society, will be catastrophic. It will plunge the great American nation into the same depths that the other great White nations of the past have fallen in. Based upon the extensive history of the Black race it is clear that it is not capable of creating or maintaining an advanced society. It has never created one advanced society in Africa. In every case (such as Haiti) where it has been given a thriving society, it has killed it, driving it into the same primitive state that its people have always lived in, in their native Africa. (For any who is foolish enough to doubt history, we have the sad spectacle of South Africa playing out before us, which should erase all doubts.) History has shown us that the Black race cannot create or maintain an advanced society on its own. Its members therefore, as a people, cannot well fit into an advanced society, as equals, living and working beside those who not only are capable of building one advanced society, but have built numerous such societies in all climates and in all types of land. History has shown us that the Hispanic peoples are also deficient in creating advanced societies like the White race has repeatedly created. While they have sown ability that is superior to the Black race, by creating their own written language and some moderately advanced societies they have not been able to take the superior natural resources of the South American continent and do much with them. Spain and Portugal sent soldiers to the lands south of the Rio Grande to conquer and take the wealth of the land. Instead of sending families to colonize, the Spanish men took native wives. The racial makeup of the lands south of the Rio Grande is composed of American Indian, Black, mixed-race and a small percentage of Whites thrown in. Their lands have never thrived like the nations to the north where Whites colonized and kept their race intact, seldom mixing their race with others. By celebrating diversity we are bringing in the Hispanic and Asian peoples into White America and we will cause the North American continent to become like the South American continent. The great wealth and stable society of the White United States will be traded for the poverty and instability of the revolution torn countries south of our border. Even if all races were exactly the same, if there were no differences whatsoever, the fact that Whites created the nation of the United States of America, means that we are completely within our honorable rights to restrict entrance into our country. We may honorably allow only White immigrants, or no immigrants at all. The number of Whites, as a percentage of world population, is now down into the single digits and falling fast. Nearly all of the White nations on earth are now accepting large numbers of Nonwhite immigrants. The only one of the three major races of earth, that is in real danger of falling into a minority status in its own racial home, is the White race. This could easily lead to extermination of the White race. Those who support American diversity, Nonwhite immigration, miscegenation, integration, and\/or Affirmative Action, are either: 1) ignorant of the above critical facts; or 2) blatant haters of the White race and seeking to end its existence on planet Earth.\n[28] In Ms. Beaumont\u2019s second message, posted the following day on the same sub-forum, she states that she also likes this one and then sets out the following text, together with a link to a page on the Internet where she presumably found it:\nBILL OF RACIAL RIGHTS\nWhite People have a right to exist as a distinct and separate people. White people have the right to retain, and defend their own lands, free from immigration, or habitation by members of other races; which includes the right to live in all-White neighborhoods, and to send their children to all-White schools. White people have the right to be proud of their history. White people have the right to be proud of their own culture, and to reject entirely within their lands all non-White cultures. White people have the right to educate their own children in any way they wish, free from government interference. White people have the right to place their own interests above the interests of any other race or people. White people have the right to reap the benefits of having a low birth rate. White people have the right to require that all people within their borders speak the language of the White people who created the country. White people have the right to prohibit all forms of miscegenation within their lands. White people have the right to produce, and to consume, entertainment and advertising that is free from mention or depiction of members of other races.\nIf you are not willing to fight for your rights, you don\u2019t have any!\nMessage 17 - December 6, 2004\n[29] This message is found on a sub-forum that asked participants what they considered were five things that concerned them as white Canadian Citizens. Ms. Beaumont answered the question as follows:\nImmigration Freedom Of Speech (and everything else) People need to wake up, and grab a sense of morality. People who support gay marriages although are not gay, even if they are\u2026. IT\u2019S SICK! Basis of\/for Deportation for illegal immigrants (this needs to be followed through with A LOT faster, and more watched)\nMessage 18 - December 7, 2004\n[30] This message was posted on a sub-forum started by someone who was seeking advice on whether to attend a family gathering. The initiator of the sub-forum did not want to go because it would mean that he would have to see his sister who had borne two children with a black man. Ms. Beaumont provided the following opinion in reply:\nI would stay away from the get together as well, my sisters know how addimient I am about race-mixing. And would never bring home a nig if they wanted to ever see me again. Your sister will understand when you aren\u2019t at the reuinion, and if she doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s her fault; then I am truely sorry to hear that.\nMessages 19 and 20 - December 8 and 9, 2004\n[31] These messages were posted on a sub-forum entitled Giant Menorah on Queen\u2019s Park, regarding the installation of a Menorah in front of Ontario\u2019s Provincial Legislature\u2019s building. Ms. Beaumont posted two comments on this sub-forum. In the first, she wrote, That\u2019s sick, I\u2019m sure something like this will happen in Van. Sick, sick, sick!! In her follow-up remarks, she stated, I saw in the newspaper on the 8th, they had a quarter page spread of some rabbi lighting BC\u2019s largest menorah in Van, sick sick sick.\nMessages 20 and 21 - December 9 and 10, 2004\n[32] These messages were posted on a sub-forum that dealt with same-sex marriage. In her first message, Ms. Beaumont wrote:\nI was proud before, to say that [Alberta] was the only provinces to not allow Save sex marriages but now, its all the same AIDS peddling sh*t.\nThe next day, Ms. Beaumont followed up with this message:\nI don\u2019t know about anyone else her, but even if I put my religion aside, I still think fags are wrong, vile, and disease ridden, as well as frigging perverts.\nMessage 22 - December 13, 2004\n[33] This message was posted on a sub-forum in which one of the participants mentioned that to his understanding, it is legal in Canada for an adult to marry a child. Ms. Beaumont replied to this remark by stating, If this is true, it\u2019s the jews who made that law. I\u2019ll try and find out if it is true or not.\nMessage 23 - December 22, 2004\n[34] This message was posted in a sub-forum about whether same-sex marriage would be recognized in Alberta. Ms. Beaumont\u2019s commentary in this respect was, I hope Alta never lets those degenerates marry, it\u2019s just vile!\nMessage 24 - May 16, 2005\n[35] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Silencing Christians in Saskatchewan: You Can\u2019t Criticize Homosexuals. The discussion related to a finding by the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal that an individual had been distributing literature that promoted hatred against homosexuals.\n[36] In providing her views on the issue, Ms. Beaumont first inserted the phrase, You can\u2019t criticize homosexuals, which is a quote from a previous forum participant. She then wrote the following:\nOh yes I can!\nThis type of sh*t just boils my blood. They are allowed freedom of sexuality but I can\u2019t speak my mind being freedom of speech AND religion? It says right in the bible that homosexual relations are punishable by death.\nQuote: Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\nLeviticus 18:22\nQuote: If a man lies with man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\nLeviticus 20:13\nSo wouldn\u2019t that be infringing on MY religious beliefs? On MY freedomof speech?\nHell, they can be fags till the day they die, and I\u2019ll be with God for my life. But my thoughts should not allow them to get money for their suffering. They should be getting a lot of money in hell then, they will be doing A LOT of suffering there.\nI know my post should be I the theology section, but I think it should stay her, it is relevant.\nMessage 25 - November 27, 2005\n[37] This message was posted on a sub-forum begun by Mr. Fromm entitled Help Us Fight Warman & the Human Rights Censors. His initial posting discussed a number of other cases regarding s. 13 of the Act with which he was involved, and included excerpts from some of the material filed in those proceedings. Ms. Beaumont was the first person to post a reply:\nSeems to me like Warman won\u2019t stop anytime soon. If it\u2019s up to him, everyone on [Stormfront] Canada will be facing the same retarded charges that few of us are facing right now. I guess Warman doesn\u2019t realize that we know how to play this stupid game to; but the best part is, we DON\u2019T give up. We MUST keep fighting unless you all want every single one of your freedoms stipped away. I mean, he wants to charge people with a hate crime\u2026 for writting on the internet. How assinine is that?\nWe need all the help we can, either help, or sit on the side lines and watch canada crumble farther than it already has into multicultural, anti-freedom, faggot loving, white hating hell.\n[38] This text was followed by what is commonly referred to as a signature block. Forum participants are able to set up their accounts so that at the end of each of their postings, a text of their choice appears automatically. In Ms. Beaumont\u2019s previous postings, she had only included the following text in her signature block: My beliefs and opinions have been shaped by my family, my friends, my upbringing, what I see, hear and read, and my experiences of life.\n[39] However, in Message 25, two additional statements were found in the signature block. The first said, Fight for your race, because failure is not an option! The second text read as follows:\n\u2018Many Jews are fond of referring to anti-Semitism as a disease. I agree, Anti-Semitism is a disease \u2013 you catch it from Jews. - Page 102, Defensive Racism;\nEdgar J. Steele\nThe Commission filed in evidence five additional postings made by Ms. Beaumont on the Stormfront.org forum, subsequent to this posting. The identical signature block appears in each of these subsequent postings on Stormfront.org, the last of which was made on February 5, 2006.\nMessage 26 - December 2, 2005\n[40] This message was posted on the sub-forum referred to earlier, Help Us Fight Warman & the Human Rights Censors. The message is made up principally of two quotes from prior postings made by two other participants in the forum. Ms. Beaumont apparently inserted these excerpts by clicking the quote icon referred to earlier. Her entire message reads as follows:\nQuote:\nOriginally posted by renegade\nYou would think so, wouldn\u2019t you. The truth is that Canada helped save the Jews from Hitler. How do these Jew bastards thank us? By undrmining our society. Conquering our nation from within. Then while these Jews are in the process of destroying our nation and systematicly driving White Canadians into extintion, they pass hate speech laws making it illegal to just talk about it.\nA perfect alalogy would be you saving a man\u2019s life by pulling him out of deep water as he\u2019s about to drown. After you save him, he pays you back by sleeping with your wife, defrauding you of your life savings, and charging YOU with assault when you punch him in the face for all the greif he\u2019s caused you.\nQuote:\nOriginally posted by Coldstar\nI knew very little about Jews until I moved to Canada. It is here where my eyes were opened in both shock and amazement. The libraries across the country are a fountain of jewish literature that could make a peace dove turn into an attack dog. Then add what they state on radio and TV and consider the weird sound or pitch that comes through so many jewish voices, it makes me shudder. I often think that they are a representation of the Devil. In fact these days when somebody says Devil or Satan I only think of Jews. I do not believe in some mythical spirit called Devil anymore, like Santa Claus, that tale of for kids.\nCheers to both posts. And Coldstar, I\u2019m with you on the Devil subject; except I believe that Jews are literally spawn of Satan himself.\nMessage 27 - January 3, 2006\n[41] This message was posted on a sub-forum entitled Jews stage their own hate crime. The discussion related to a news report of a Jewish family in Pennsylvania that had allegedly vandalized their own property with anti-Semitic graffiti in an attempt to garner sympathy from the community and divert attention from complaints that had been made against the family about the dog kennel that they were operating. The family had not only claimed that their property had been defaced but also that attempts had been made to attack their dogs. Ms. Beaumont posted the following message regarding the matter:\nI understand why no-one believes them, I wouldn\u2019t either after learning this. But see, if it was racial hatred; I don\u2019t understand why someone would attack helpless dogs [as] opposed to going after those dirty Jewish animals directly.\nMessage 28 - February 5, 2006\n[42] This message was posted on a sub-forum that apparently related to a s. 13 complaint filed by Mr. Warman against another individual. Ms. Beaumont posted the following message:\nGlad to hear that you are doing better. Hopefully this b*ll**** will stop before everyone knows what we\u2019ve experienced. People have lost their family, jobs, and websites. (Among many other things) And all because of that retarded jew warman. We all know he does this because he is a very low and disgraceful animal. He does this for his own personal gain (be it monetary or mentally). Regardless, I WILL NOT LET HIM DEFEAT ME!\nMessages 29 and 30 \u2013 July 13, 2006\n[43] These messages were posted on a different forum than Stormfront.org, which was entitled BloodandHonour.com. Ms. Beaumont testified that she was a member of this forum and that she had posted messages on it. The Jessy Destruction who was posting on BloodandHonour.com listed as her location the same place that Ms. Beaumont had given on Stormfront.org, i.e. Coquitlam, B.C.\n[44] These particular messages were posted on a sub-forum entitled Winnicki Gets 9 Months. Tomasz Winnicki had been named as a respondent in another s. 13 complaint that Mr. Warman had filed. The Commission had obtained a Federal Court order that he stop posting messages on the Internet pending the Tribunal\u2019s final decision regarding the complaint. Mr. Winnicki violated that order and the Court found him in contempt. Ms. Beaumont\u2019s first message on this sub-forum dealing with the finding of contempt stated the following:\nShitty deal for Tom. It\u2019s retarded how they (CHRC) can even contemplate giving him jail time for speaking his mind (in a so-called free country)\nThe sentence should serve as a warning to other white supremacists using the Net to spread hate, Warman said.\nNope, doesn\u2019t stop me. This bastard isn\u2019t going to collect one red cent from me. Lock me up, big deal, just futhers my feelings towards this BS. I don\u2019t understand how they think locking Tom up for 9 months will make him change his mind and start loving niggers and jews.\n[45] Another forum member replied to Ms. Beaumont\u2019s message, following which she posted this message:\nHa ha. And boy would I appreciated 3 meals and a nice warm bed (without having to hearing Ciaran snore) lol. I can\u2019t stop posting my hate filled messages, I think it is what I was born to do.\nQuote:\nOriginally posted by Canadian Hate Machine\nJessy\u2026We\u2019ve been Warned !! You\u2019d better stop posting your vile, digusting HATE on the internet!. Unless you want 3 squares and a cot for 9 months\u2026. I HATE you Warman I can only hope that I live long enough to piss on your useless grave, you kyke.\n[46] The quotation in her second message is the text from the message that the other member had posted prior to hers. As I explained earlier, she automatically generated this quotation within her message by clicking on the Quote button rather than the Reply button to post her reply.\nC. Did Ms. Beaumont communicate the impugned messages, or cause them to be communicated, by means of the Internet, within the meaning of s. 13? [47] As I stated earlier in this decision, Ms. Beaumont acknowledged in her evidence that she posted messages under the pseudonym Jessy Destruction. She even admitted having made practically all of the impugned postings in this case with the exception of Message 2 and Message 3, which she did not recall posting.\n[48] These two messages are among the earliest of her postings on the Stormfront.org forum. She joined in October 2003 and the two messages were posted in January 2004. Ms. Beaumont was a prodigious contributor to the forum, having posted over 1,000 messages as of May 2006. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that she is unable to recall every one of her entries.\n[49] The margin notes and signature blocks of Messages 2 and 3 are identical to those in the messages that Ms. Beaumont concedes having posted. Furthermore, the views expressed in Messages 2 and 3, regarding Blacks and inter-racial relationships, are consistent with those expressed in her other messages. If, as suggested by Ms. Beaumont, someone else had entered her account and posted the two messages in question without her knowledge, she could have removed them subsequently. She acknowledged in her evidence, however, that she did not make any attempt to delete these messages. I infer from all of the circumstances, therefore, that on the balance of probabilities, Ms. Beaumont posted Messages 2 and 3 as well.\n[50] I am thus satisfied that Ms. Beaumont posted all of the impugned messages and that she therefore communicated this matter or caused it to be communicated by means of the Internet, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act.\nD. Were the communications made repeatedly, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Act? [51] The Tribunal has held in the past that material communicated via the Internet is by that medium\u2019s innate characteristics alone, a repeated communication, particularly where no obstacles are put in place that would prevent anyone connected to the Internet from surfing his or her way to a website and viewing the material (see Warman v. Harrison 2006 CHRT 30 at para. 44; Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11 at para. 62; Warman v. Tremaine, 2007 CHRT 2 at paras. 116-9). Mr. Warman testified that anyone could access the Stormfront.org forum and view the messages that members had posted. No passwords, codes or pre-registration were required.\n[52] Mr. Fromm argued that Ms. Beaumont\u2019s communications were not repeated communications in that each of her postings consisted of a separate communication. She was, in effect, engaging in a conversation with other like-minded individuals, who were also participating in the forum. Mr. Fromm directed the Tribunal to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892 at 938, where the Court stated:\nSection 13(1) is worded so as to diminish phone use of the type I have just described, for in the context of s. 13(1) the term repeated must comport a requirement for something in the way of a series of messages. Moreover, because the Tribunal must be satisfied that the messages are likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt, it may be that even a series of personal calls (by which I mean communications with friends and acquaintances) espousing hate propaganda will not constitute a discriminatory practice within the definition of the section. I thus think it misleading to conflate the discussion to the point where all one sees is the telephone's position as an apparatus oft-used for private communications, and hence mistakenly to conclude that s. 13(1) suppresses messages which do little to promote the harms caused by hate propaganda.\n(emphasis added)\nOf course, the Taylor case dealt with telephone messages that had been recorded on an automated answering machine. The judgment was rendered at a time when the Internet had yet to gain widespread global usage.\n[53] I do not agree with Mr. Fromm\u2019s submission that the messages posted by Ms. Beaumont on the Stormfront.org forum can be equated with personal telephone calls amongst friends and acquaintances. As the Tribunal in Tremaine, supra, noted, at paragraph 119, One of the purposes sought by posting messages on a website is that it will be available for transmission and display by a user who requests it. Tremaine is a case that also dealt with matter that had been posted on the Stormfront.org forum. Users of message boards like this forum know that anything they post on the board can be viewed by others with access to the Internet, not just friends and acquaintances. The Internet when thus used becomes an inexpensive means of mass distribution of information (Tremaine, ibid).\n[54] Ms. Beaumont was, in my view, keenly aware of this fact. In Message 12, she expressed her disagreement with the opinion of a previous contributor regarding the merits of having non-white friends. She invited this other individual to further debate the question by way of private messaging (PM). In Message 13, Ms. Beaumont invited another forum member to contact her by PM if he wanted talk further about Calgary.\n[55] Ms. Beaumont thus demonstrated that she knew the distinction between the public nature of posting on the forum and the confidential nature of private messaging. Indeed, when asked during cross examination why she had opted to post on the forum the passages entitled Critical Facts that Your Kids Will Not Learn in School and the Bill of Racial Rights (Messages 15 and 16), she explained that she posted them for other people to read. She added that she thought the material was interesting, and that someone else might enjoy reading it. She pointed out that she didn\u2019t really care if the material would have an impact on certain individuals or not, adding that she did not see why such individuals would be visiting a website like Stormfront.org in the first place.\n[56] However, irrespective of Ms. Beaumont\u2019s intentions or whether an individual from any particular group actually viewed her messages, the fact is that the communication of her messages over the Stormfront.org forum resulted in their gaining a wider, public circulation, rather than being a mere private communication (see Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 15 at paras. 25-6). The analogy to a telephone conversation amongst friends and acquaintances does not apply.\n[57] I therefore find that the material was communicated repeatedly.\nE. Is the material likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, within the meaning of s. 13(1)? [58] In Nealy v. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the term hatred involves feelings of extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one hates another means that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. The Tribunal added that contempt suggests looking down upon or treating as inferior the objects of one's feelings. The two terms are not necessarily co-extensive. In some instances, hatred may be the result of envy of superior qualities such as intelligence, wealth and power, which contempt, by definition, cannot be.\n[59] The Nealy Tribunal went on to say that the use of the word likely in s. 13(1) means that it is not necessary to prove that the effect of the communication will be that those who hear the messages will direct hatred or contempt against others. Nor is it necessary to show that, in fact, anyone was so victimized.\n[60] These findings were later endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Taylor, supra. The Court added that the terms hatred or contempt in s. 13(1) refer to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification.\n[61] I find that many of the messages posted by Ms. Beaumont on the Stormfront.org forum contain matter that is likely to expose members of the targeted groups to hatred or contempt, within the meaning of s. 13(1), as interpreted in the jurisprudence.\n[62] To begin with, Ms. Beaumont repeatedly used highly inflammatory and derogatory language with respect to several groups, based on their religion, race, national or ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. The Tribunal in Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50 at para. 67, pointed out that the use of epithets to describe a targeted group has been found, in the jurisprudence, to contribute to the likelihood that a message will expose the group to hatred or contempt. In the present case, Ms. Beaumont refers to Blacks in the messages filed in evidence by the term nigger or some derivation thereof (negroid, nignog, nigs). As I noted in Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11 at para. 44, the use of this term, with its inherent connotation to slavery, segregation, and racism, in and of itself displays hatred and contempt in regard to black people. Elsewhere in the messages, Ms. Beaumont refers to homosexuals as fags or faggots, to a Chinese person as a Chink, and to aboriginal people as chugs.\n[63] Mr. Fromm submitted that it is not uncommon to hear some of these terms used in public today. Ms. Beaumont testified that she usually spoke this way amongst her peers. For instance, in her everyday conversations, she often refers to Indians as chugs (a term used in Message 11) and she sees nothing wrong with that. She acknowledged that it is a derogatory term but she would only use it when speaking to her friends, and not it in the presence of an Aboriginal person.\n[64] However, whether or not epithets form part of everyday parlance amongst the circle of people with whom Ms. Beaumont converses, or even more broadly within the community, is not what is at issue here. Section 13 of the Act addresses a particular type of exchange, one that occurs repeatedly, by telephonic means that include the Internet. In these instances, different rules apply, and messages containing matter that is likely to expose targeted groups to hatred or contempt cannot be so conveyed, irrespective of whether they are commonly used in everyday conversations.\n[65] This is not to say that s. 13 is breached every time such epithets appear. For instance, the Commission attempted to argue that Message 14, regarding the Norman Rockwell painting, was likely to expose Blacks to hatred or contempt due to the mention of the word nigger. This interpretation is taken completely out of context. It is evident that Ms. Beaumont was taking issue with someone\u2019s claim in an earlier posting that Rockwell was racially insensitive. Her message appears to accurately describe the painting, which the artist had produced as a social commentary on the challenges facing the civil rights movement of the 1960\u2019s in America. Her description of the painting was not likely to expose black persons to hatred or contempt.\n[66] Similarly, the Commission tried to depict Ms. Beaumont\u2019s every use of the term retarded as an epithet against developmentally disabled persons. However, in messages such as Message 25, where she ranted about the retarded charges made against her in the human rights complaint, she did not use the term in this context, but rather as a synonym or euphemism for absurd, inane or some other similar uncomplimentary term. While her indiscriminate use of the term is insensitive to the dignity of persons with developmental disabilities, it does not expose them to hatred or contempt.\n[67] But context cuts both ways. The context of most of the epithets used in Ms. Beaumont\u2019s messages is one where members of the targeted groups are subjected to ridicule and hostility, for instance:\nEver seen a tar black negroid and a chink? That\u2019s a pretty sick\/funny site. Fags are wrong, vile, and disease ridden, as well as frigging perverts.\n[68] Beyond the mere use of epithets, Ms. Beaumont insinuates in her postings that members of the targeted groups are devoid of any redeeming qualities and demonstrates extreme ill will towards them. She describes homosexuals as degenerates and expresses her wish that they all die off from AIDS. She describes Jews as literally the spawn of Satan himself. Ms. Beaumont claimed, during her testimony, that she based this comment on her interpretation of a passage in the Bible, adding that she did not care if Jews would be offended by her ideas. However, irrespective of whether she cares or not, s. 13 of the Act dictates that the repeated communication via the Internet of matter that is likely to expose targeted groups to hatred or contempt constitutes a discriminatory practice. Whether the person communicating the matter was in fact its author is immaterial. The mere act of communicating the material or causing its communication attracts liability under the Act.\n[69] One method by which contempt and extreme vilification of a target group can occur is through comparisons of the members of the group to animals and vermin (see Kouba, supra at paras. 62-3). In her message of January 3, 2006 (Message 27), Ms. Beaumont makes this kind of comparison by implying that Jewish people have less worth than dogs and by claiming she does not understand why someone would attack helpless dogs rather than going after those dirty Jewish animals.\n[70] Other recurring themes that the Tribunal has found, in previous decisions, to be demonstrative of communications that likely expose target groups to hatred or contempt, include the usage of so-called true stories to make negative generalizations of the targeted group, as well as the portrayal of the group as the cause of society\u2019s problems (Kouba, supra, at paras. 30-48). These themes are present in some of the material posted by Ms. Beaumont on Stormfront.org, particularly in Message 15, which is the list of 16 Critical Facts that children will not learn in school. The list asserts, based on \u2026 history, that Blacks and Hispanic peoples are not capable of creating and maintaining advanced societies, which the White race has repeatedly created. Therefore, it is argued, the members of these groups cannot well fit into an advanced society, as equals. Elsewhere in the list, it is suggested that American all-White neighbourhoods of the past were safer and freer of crime than integrated neighbourhoods of today. The implication of this statement is that the presence of non-whites is the cause of crime-related problems. The integration of non-whites is also blamed for a supposed drop in the quality of schooling.\n[71] In Message 22, Ms. Beaumont, when informed that it is supposedly legal in Canada for a child to wed an adult, for some unapparent reason immediately blames the jews for having made that law. Earlier, in Message 8, Ms. Beaumont referred to the mindless pawns of the juden who believe in race-mixing. Juden is, of course, the German word for Jews, a term with which the world became very familiar through the images of their persecution in Nazi Germany. As was pointed out in Kouba at paras. 24-5, one of the recurring hallmarks of communications that have been found to offend s. 13, is the portrayal of a targeted group as a powerful menace that is taking control of the major institutions in society and depriving others of their livelihoods, safety, freedom of speech and general well-being. The suggestion in Message 8 is that Jews control the way others think and express themselves about race-mixing, and in Message 22, that Jews are a powerful menace that forces lawmakers to adopt laws that undermine acceptable social values.\n[72] In Nealy, supra, at paras. 45668-45670, the Tribunal adopted the view that messages preaching the forced deportation of non-Whites or their segregation from the White population are likely to expose members of these targeted groups to hatred or contempt by encouraging violence as a proactive means of defence against any who were seen as the enemies of racial purity. The basic theme of Message 15\u2019s Critical Facts list is that the presence and integration of non-Whites in American society is undesirable. The Bill of Racial Rights in Message 16 is even more explicit in its assertion that White people should have the right to retain, and defend their own lands, free from immigration, or habitation by members of other races, including the right to live in all-White neighbourhoods and to send their children to all-White schools, i.e. segregation.\n[73] The signature blocks of Ms. Beaumont\u2019s more recent messages (Message 25 and onwards), contained the sentence Anti-Semitism is a disease \u2013 you catch it from Jews. This phrase puts forth the notion that Jews bring anti-Semitism on themselves. The implication is that those who propagate anti-Semitism are not to be blamed, for the fault lies with Jews themselves. In effect, the victims are blamed for the discrimination that they experience and in so doing, the message downplays the effect. It trivializes a past and current tragedy, which creates a climate of derision and contempt that is likely to make members of this targeted group exposed to these emotions (Kouba, supra at paras. 72-5).\n[74] In sum, I find that in most of the impugned messages, Ms. Beaumont engaged in the communication of matter that was likely to expose persons identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination (namely race, religion, national or ethnic origin, and sexual orientation), to hatred or contempt. I have already determined that all the messages were communicated by her over the Internet, and therefore, repeatedly. As a result, the complaint has been substantiated.\nIII. Remedies A. An order that the discriminatory practice cease (s. 54(1)(a) [75] According to Section 54(1)(a), the Tribunal may order a respondent to cease the discriminatory practice, and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or prevent it from occurring in the future.\n[76] Mr. Warman is seeking a permanent order to have Ms. Beaumont cease the discriminatory practice of communicating hate messages through the Internet or other federal communications undertaking. The Commission concurs with this request. Mr. Fromm argued that the issuance of a permanent order would be a penalty\u2026for life. He contends that Ms. Beaumont would have to be forever careful in expressing any political or religious view on the Internet for fear of breaching the order and finding herself in contempt and possibly going to jail. She would essentially be silenced from making any political or religious statement on the Internet. He therefore suggested that the scope of any such order should be limited in time, to perhaps five years.\n[77] I do not share this view. A cease and desist order essentially puts respondents on notice that messages of the sort that they have previously communicated are in breach of the Act and that they should not repeat the practice. As such, the order merely reiterates what has already been articulated in the Act, i.e. that communicating messages falling within the meaning of s. 13 is a discriminatory practice. Mr. Fromm\u2019s submission presupposes that the Act is ambiguous and that Ms. Beaumont will somehow unknowingly fall into a trap that leads to contempt charges being laid against her. These concerns are unfounded. According to the Supreme Court in Taylor, there is no ambiguity to be found in the language of s. 13, and the numerous decisions that have been rendered since, regarding this provision, should serve to inform Ms. Beaumont when considering what sort of material she can communicate over the Internet without offending s. 13. Moreover, she will have the benefit of a decision relating to her own prior Internet postings, to further inform her future communications.\n[78] Furthermore, a cease and desist order would not be an overwhelming and ever-present peril for Ms. Beaumont, as Mr. Fromm suggests. To be found in contempt, it would have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt (i.e. the criminal standard of proof) that Ms. Beaumont breached the order by again communicating hate messages of a nature previously found to fall within the meaning of s. 13. The standard of proof would thus be much higher than what would be required to substantiate a human rights complaint. It would have to be established that the activity that is said to constitute contempt was clearly covered by the prohibition set out in the order (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. French, [1996] F.C.J. No. 384 (F.C.T.D.)(Q.L.).\n[79] In addition, contempt does not appear to be an absolute offence, and courts are reluctant to find contempt where the individual has taken every objectively reasonable step to comply with the order (see R.W. McCauley & J.L.H. Spragg, Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals, looseleaf, vol. X, (Toronto: Thomson, 2004) at 29A.9(c)). On the other hand, intent to discriminate is not a pre-condition to a finding of discrimination (Taylor, supra at 931). As a result, were Ms. Beaumont to ever inadvertently communicate matter that offended s. 13, she may be more likely to find herself the subject of a new s. 13 human rights complaint and being found liable for a new remedy under s. 54, than of being found in contempt of the previous cease and desist order.\n[80] I therefore see no reason to deny the order. Ms. Beaumont is ordered to cease and desist from communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13 of the Act, and particularly the Internet, any matter of the type contained in the messages at issue in this case that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nB. Special Compensation (s. 54(1)(b) [81] Section 54(1)(b) of the Act provides that where a victim is specifically identified in the communication that constituted the discriminatory practice, the Tribunal may order the payment of special compensation to the victim, of a sum that is not to exceed $20,000, if the Tribunal determines that the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. Mr. Warman is seeking this special compensation in the amount of $10,000, from Ms. Beaumont.\n[82] A number of communications were produced in evidence in which Ms. Beaumont made reference to Mr. Warman. They include a photograph that she had placed on her pages, which she had created on the EveryonesSpace.com and MySpace.com websites. These are social networking websites on which users place their personal profiles and interact with a network of friends with whom they can share music, videos, and so on. Under her EveryonesSpace.com profile\u2019s list of interests, Ms. Beaumont included an apparently doctored image of a street-side sign identifying a Catholic church. Three swastikas had been digitally added to the picture of the sign. In the lower portion of the sign, where the church would ordinarily post its announcements, the following text appears, exactly as written below:\nCURCH OF THE DEAD\nWARMAN SOCIETY\nWARMAN HATERS\nALLWAYS WELCOME\nThe same image was posted on April 5, 2006, by Ms. Beaumont as a message on her MySpace.com page\u2019s bulletin board. Ms. Beaumont testified that this picture was meant to be a joke between herself and a friend, as a variation on the title of a motion picture from a few years ago, The Dead Poet\u2019s Society.\n[83] In addition, in Message 28, which was posted on February 5, 2006, Ms. Beaumont voiced disapproval about the human rights complaints that had been filed against her and others, claiming that people have lost their family, jobs and websites, as a result. She then added that this is all because of that retarded jew warman and that we all know he does this because he is a very low and disgraceful animal.\n[84] Mr. Warman is not Jewish, as he so testified in Warman v. Kyburz, (2003), 46 C.H.R.R. 425 at para. 90, but it is obvious that Ms. Beaumont perceived him as such. A person who is perceived to have the characteristics of someone who falls within one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination, may be the object of discrimination even though he does not actually have those characteristics (District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 at para. 41, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused; see also Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montreal (City), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 665).\n[85] Was Mr. Warman a victim specifically identified in the communication that constituted a discriminatory practice? Mr. Fromm submitted that the reference to Mr. Warman as a Jew was merely being used as a descriptive term, given Ms. Beaumont\u2019s mistaken perception of his religion. It would be no different than had she said that retarded man Warman. Mr. Fromm added that the use of the term retarded was not intended to disparage developmentally disabled persons but simply to describe Mr. Warman with an uncomplimentary adjective, in the same sense that I explained earlier in this decision. In my opinion, while Ms. Beaumont\u2019s intention in calling Mr. Warman retarded may have been to just insult him in a juvenile way, given the context of all her messages, including this one, her reference to him as that\u2026Jew bears an entirely different connotation.\n[86] First of all, the signature block of this message contains the phrase that I referenced earlier, Anti-Semitism is a disease, you catch it from Jews, which I found to be a communication that falls within the meaning of hate messages under s. 13.\n[87] Furthermore, Ms. Beaumont\u2019s comments should be taken in context with her other statements. She acknowledged in her evidence that she believes in National Socialism. She described herself in her messages as a full time Nazi. Members of the Stormfront.org forum were permitted to attach logos or avatars to their postings, which would appear under their names or pseudonyms in the margin notes. Ms. Beaumont selected as her avatar a cartoon image of a woman with a swastika in the background. Some of her other messages were accompanied by an avatar comprised of a swastika and a dead-head skull and cross-bones, symbols associated with Nazi forces in World War II (see Warman v. Kulbashian, 2006 CHRT 11).\n[88] In addition, Mr. Warman and the Commission pointed out that in Message 30, although Ms. Beaumont did not mention Mr. Warman by name in the three lines that she typed, she opted to click on the Quote icon rather than the Reply icon and include the quotation from a previous contributor to the sub-forum. That quotation ends with the following statement: I hate you Warman I can only hope that I live long enough to piss on your useless grave, you kyke. This use of the pejorative term kyke to describe Mr. Warman, who is being perceived as Jewish, is matter that, in accordance with the authorities I have referenced earlier in my decision, is likely to expose persons of the Jewish faith to hatred or contempt.\n[89] A question arises, however, about whether Ms. Beaumont communicated this hate message. She did not compose it; she only repeated it by clicking on the Quote icon. In my view, this is a false distinction. She had a choice about whether to quote the earlier message or not. As is evident from her other postings in evidence, she usually just replied to prior messages, and only exceptionally quoted them. Furthermore, in some cases, only portions of the prior messages would appear in the quoted material, which indicates that Ms. Beaumont would edit portions out prior to posting them in her own messages. These facts demonstrate, in my view, that her practice was to use the quote feature of the forum whenever she intended to repeat the message. It was not inadvertent.\n[90] In this context, Ms. Beaumont was clearly not merely describing Mr. Warman, in Message 28, as a Jew, but was trying to disparage him. This is especially apparent given her subsequent reference to him as a disgraceful animal, which hearkens back to her earlier posted message in which she ascribed the attributes of dogs to a Jewish family.\n[91] In my view, therefore, Ms. Beaumont\u2019s references to Mr. Warman in these hate messages were intentional. She engaged in this discriminatory practice wilfully. Mr. Warman\u2019s name was mentioned in only three instances, but these include a description of him as dead, which takes on particular significance given the swastikas that appear in the image and Ms. Beaumont\u2019s perception of him as Jewish (see Kulbashian, supra, at para 138).\n[92] This is not Mr. Warman\u2019s first s. 13 complaint. The Tribunal has already issued final decisions on at least nine s. 13 complaints filed by Mr. Warman. The Tribunal in Warman v. Winnicki, supra at paras. 168-172, found that Mr. Warman has extensive experience and involvement in organized activities aimed at combating hate propaganda. The Tribunal concluded that Mr. Warman appears to be a very resilient person who is somewhat impervious to threats and insults. Mr. Fromm argued that given Mr. Warman\u2019s role as a player with regard to s. 13 complaints, he is not a true victim within the intended meaning of s. 54 of the Act. Consequently, he should not be entitled to any compensation.\n[93] Section 54(1)(b) does not, however, make any distinction between types of victims. The elements that Mr. Fromm raises with regard to Mr. Warman could in theory constitute factors in the assessment of a victim\u2019s pain and suffering experienced as a result of a discriminatory practice, pursuant to s. 53(2)(e), in cases involving discriminatory practices other than those described in s. 13. However, s. 54(1)(b) explicitly directs the Tribunal to s. 53(3) with regard to the compensation of the victim. Section 53(3) is aimed at providing compensation for wilful and reckless discriminatory conduct regardless of the degree to which the victim may have been affected by the conduct (see Winnicki, supra at para. 180).\n[94] In assessing the appropriateness of such an order, the only messages in issue are those that reference Mr. Warman, and not the entirety of the material that has been found to be in breach of s. 13. Ms. Beaumont knew or should have known that the language she was using to attack and ridicule Mr. Warman was likely to expose him to hatred and contempt in conjunction with his identification as a Jew. The reference to Dead Warman Society accompanied by images of swastikas is particularly troubling. Words suggesting that harm should come to another cannot be taken lightly, even if they were made in jest. Others viewing this material on the Internet may not see it as such and take the message more seriously. Mr. Warman also points out that Message 30, for instance, was posted after Ms. Beaumont was served with the human rights complaint. Thus, rather than halting the hate messages, she continued them and began to include references to Mr. Warman by name.\n[95] In the circumstances, I therefore order Ms. Beaumont to pay the sum of $3,000 in special compensation, pursuant to s. 54(1)(b) of the Act.\nC. Penalty (s. 54(1)(c)) [96] The Tribunal may order a respondent who engaged in a discriminatory practice set out in s. 13 of the Act, to pay a penalty of up to $10,000, pursuant to s. 54(1)(c). Section 54(1.1) enumerates several factors that the Tribunal must take into account when deciding whether to make such an order:\nThe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the discriminatory practice, and The wilfulness or intent of the respondent, any prior discriminatory practices that he or she has engaged in, and his or her ability to pay the penalty.\nThe Commission and Mr. Warman have requested that a penalty of $7,500 be assessed.\n[97] I have determined that most of the impugned messages are likely to expose a number of targeted groups to hatred or contempt. Ms. Beaumont testified that she did not care what effect her messages would have on members of these groups or the community at large.\n[98] Compared to other hate messages that have come before the Tribunal in the past, I find that Ms. Beaumont\u2019s do not have the same gravity. Thus, although her postings contained negative epithets with respect to a number of targeted groups, these terms were not used with the same frequency as in other cases. Ms. Beaumont did not engage in any vivid descriptions of violence against the targeted groups. Her messages were in the form of relatively short postings on the forum, for the most part. She did not create an entire website replete with or dedicated to the communication of hate messages, as we have seen in other cases.\n[99] The Commission pointed out that Ms. Beaumont has posted at least 1,000 more messages on the Stormfront.org forum, beyond those that are in evidence in this case. Without viewing the other postings, however, I cannot assume that they would offend s. 13. Indeed, as I have indicated in my decision, not every single one of the impugned messages filed in evidence was found to constitute hate messages within the meaning of the Act.\n[100] Ms. Beaumont testified that she had not been on Stormfront.org since July 2006, and that her EveryonesSpace.com and MySpace accounts had been deleted. Mr. Warman points out, however, that after the human rights complaint was filed against her, she posted a number of the hate messages that are in evidence in this case.\n[101] Ms. Beaumont testified that whatever the Tribunal\u2019s decision in this matter, she would not change her views and ideas. However, she also testified that she would stop going to the Internet if the Tribunal ordered her to do so.\n[102] At the time of the hearing, Ms. Beaumont was no longer residing in British Columbia and had moved back to Calgary. She is 21 years old and is living with her parents. She claimed to be paying rent to her parents although this evidence was not documented. She produced pay stubs showing that she was employed as a salesperson in a retail store earning $10.50\/hour.\n[103] I have no evidence of her having engaged in any prior discriminatory practices. In December 2005, Mr. Warman made a criminal complaint to the British Columbia Hate Crimes Team, alleging that Ms. Beaumont had wilfully promoted hatred, within the meaning of s. 319 of the Criminal Code. In July 2006, based in part on this information, the Vancouver Police Department obtained a warrant and seized Ms. Beaumont\u2019s computer. She has not, however, been formally charged with any crime relating thereto. I cannot, therefore, conclude that she has engaged in a prior discriminatory practice in this regard.\n[104] Taking all of these factors into account, I order Ms. Beaumont to pay a penalty of $1,500. Payment of the penalty shall be made by certified cheque or money order payable to the Receiver General for Canada, and must be received by the Tribunal within 120 days of the date on which this decision is served on Ms. Beaumont.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Is the 2001 Re-opener Discriminatory to the Extent it Distinguished Between Members and Non-Members?\nIV. DECISION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Yvonne Sugimoto is the complainant in this matter. She filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated December 9, 2002. She alleges that the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), in its Pension Plan provisions, has discriminated against her by treating her in an adverse differential manner, on the ground of sex, contrary to ss. 7, 10, and 21 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The adverse differential treatment that Ms. Sugimoto complains of is this. Under the RBC Plan, a male the same age as Ms. Sugimoto with an identical employment record with RBC, can retire with an unreduced pension at age 56. If Ms. Sugimoto wished to retire at the same age, she would suffer almost a 35% reduction in her annual pension. To receive the same unreduced pension as her male counterpart, Ms. Sugimoto would have to work for an additional 70 months. This is all because Ms. Sugimoto was denied the opportunity that RBC gave to her male counterpart, to participate in the 2001 Re-opener.\n[3] To understand how this impacted on Ms. Sugimoto, one must understand the nature of the RBC Plan and its evolution over the past 30 years or so.\n[4] Ms. Sugimoto was a member of the defined benefit pension Plan at RBC prior to her retirement. Under the Plan, an employee could participate as a contributory or as a non-contributory member. The annual pension at retirement in the contributory plan is equal to 1.3% x final average salary x years of contributory pensionable service. For the non-contributory plan, it is .9% instead of 1.3% and there are no member contributions.\n[5] A member could accumulate contributory or non-contributory service or a combination of both. The member contributes 4 or 6 % of his or her salary depending on salary level. RBC is responsible for funding the actuarial value and the administrative costs of the Plan.\n[6] Ms. Sugimoto left RBC in March 2002 on a salary continuance arrangement. She was paid a salary by RBC until she took early retirement on October 4, 2006.\nII. FACTS A. Plan Membership Eligibility Pre-May 1, 1974 [7] Ms. Sugimoto was born on October 4, 1951 and joined RBC on February 23, 1970. She was 18 years old. Prior to May 1, 1974, male employees of RBC were eligible to become contributory members of the Plan at age 21. Female employees were not eligible for Plan membership until age 24.\nB. The May 1, 1974 Plan Amendment [8] On May 1, 1974, the Plan was amended to change the membership eligibility age for all employees, male and female, to age 30. Those employees, who were members of the Plan, but under age 30, were given the option of either remaining in the Plan as a contributory member or suspending their membership until age 30. If they suspended their membership, they would not accrue any pensionable service until they re-enrolled in the Plan at age 30.\n[9] Plan members who were over age 30 as of this date could choose to remain as contributory members or become non-contributory members. The May 1, 1974 amendments did not affect Ms. Sugimoto. She was 22 years old at the time.\nC. The 1980 Pension Plan Amendment [10] On March 1, 1978, the Canadian Human Rights Act came into force. Under the CHRA, a two year grace period was given to bring federally regulated pension plans into conformity with its provisions.\n[11] On September 1, 1980, RBC amended the Plan and changed the eligibility age for membership from age 30 to the earlier of age 25 or five years of continuous service. For any employee who joined the Plan, their date joined was made retroactive to March 1, 1980 (to meet the expiry of the grace period).\n[12] Ms. Sugimoto was 26 years old and joined the Plan as a contributory member as of March 1, 1980. On March 1, 1985, she elected to become a non-contributory member which the terms of the Plan allowed after 5 years as a contributory member.\nD. The 1987 Plan Amendment - Early Retirement [13] Effective January 1, 1987, the Plan was amended to provide that Plan members with 35 years of contributory \/ non-contributory pensionable service could retire with an annual, unreduced pension after age 55. For each year less than 35 years of pensionable service, their annual pension would be reduced by 5 %. The normal retirement age is 65.\nE. The 1996 Gender Buy-Back (GBB) (i) Background to the GBB [14] The introduction in 1987 of the early retirement option, raised a significant issue for female Plan members who, pre-1974, could only join the Plan three years after their male counterparts. The issue was the consequences of this disparity for early retirement and an unreduced pension.\n(ii) The February 1995 Mercer Report [15] In 1995, RBC began to consider ways of correcting the potential consequences of the pre-May 1974 eligibility rules. It retained the William Mercer Company to identify possible strategies and their potential impact on the Plan.\n[16] In its February 1995 Report, Analysis of past discriminatory practices in Canadian Pension Plans, Mercer pointed out that female RBC employees like Ms. Sugimoto who had not attained age 24 at May 1, 1974, could not accrue pension benefits for her three years of service between ages 21 and 24. Further, because she was not eligible to join the Plan until March 1, 1980, she could not accumulate pension benefits for her years of service between May 1, 1974 and March 1980.\n[17] The Mercer report noted that some Canadian financial institutions had eliminated all past discriminatory practices in their pension plans retroactively; some had made retroactive adjustments that partially eliminated past discriminatory practices; and some did nothing.\n[18] The Mercer report emphasized that RBC has never made any retroactive amendments to the Plan. But if RBC wanted to make an exception to this policy, Mercer suggested two options.\n[19] RBC decided to implement a third option, namely, counting the years of service a female employee had between age 21 and the earliest of, the day she joined the Plan, age 24, and May 1, 1974, as contributory pensionable service.\n[20] In its report, Mercer recommended against considering the years from May 1974 to March 1980 for two reasons. First, it would be highly speculative to guess what a person today between ages 21 and 24 would have done in 1974, given the choice to continue as contributory member or opt out. Secondly, it would give these employees an unfair advantage compared to those who were Plan members in 1974, and who had to make a decision then, not 20 years later.\n(iii) The December 5, 1995 Board of Directors' Resolution. [21] The matter was first considered by the Human Resources Committee who recommended certain retroactive changes to the Plan. On December 5, 1995, the RBC Board of Directors passed a resolution authorizing the Pension Plan Management Committee to amend the Royal Bank Pension Plan to enable affected females to purchase benefits for any effected years of service. In its resolution, the Board recognized that the pre-1974 Plan eligibility rules had prevented women from joining the Plan at the same age as men, a practise now seen as discriminatory.\n[22] This resolution was implemented through what is described as the 1996 Gender Buy-back. The GBB was a one-time offer made to female employees who joined the Plan on or before March 1, 1980, and who had continuous, full time service between age 21 and age 24 prior to May 1, 1974. Those eligible could purchase up to three years of additional pensionable service, calculated as the time period between the later of, their 21st birthday and their start date at the Bank, and the earlier of, their 24th birthday and May 1, 1974.\n[23] After the GBB was in place, Mercers, the Plan's actuary, calculated that the net increased actuarial liability for RBC of the GBB was approximately $13,000,000 after the employee contributions of between $3,000,000 - $4,000,000.\nF. The September 5, 2003 GBB Plan Amendment [24] The additional benefits given under the GBB required a Plan amendment. Interestingly, the amendment was only made on September 5, 2003, effective January 1, 1996, more than seven years after the 1995 Board resolution. The amendment was by resolution of the Pension Plan Management Committee which was authorized by the Board to make amendments to the Plan.\n[25] The reason for this delay (as explained by Gary Dobbie, RBC Senior Vice-President, Compensation and Benefits, in his March 25, 2003 letter to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) was that, after 1996, Plan members and former Plan members had approached RBC on numerous occasions asking for additional benefits based on the GBB. To ensure that the GBB was equitably and consistently offered, RBC postponed the Plan amendment until the matter was fully considered and resolved.\n[26] To appreciate how the 2003 Amendment works, it must be located in the context of Section C (Canada) Royal Bank Pension Plan as amended and restated on January 1, 2002. This is the most recent iteration of the Plan text provided by the parties to the Tribunal.\n[27] Section 2.01(6) defines Admission Date as the date a Member is admitted to the Plan. Member is defined in s. 2.01(38) as an employee who has been admitted as a member to the Plan under the eligibility rules in s. 3 of the Plan and who continues to be entitled to benefits under the Plan. Vesting in s. 2.01(71) means acquiring the right to a deferred pension after having a defined number of years of Service.\n[28] Section 4 is entitled Service, Service is defined in s. 4.05 as an employee's continuous employment with RBC. Pensionable Service, s. 4.04(1), is the period of service commencing on the Member's Admission Date and ending on the earliest of retirement, termination or death in service or attaining 35 years of Service.\n[29] Section 4.06 - Inclusion of Prior Service- provides that, where a Member is terminated prior to becoming vested in their pre-1987 Service and is re-employed by RBC after 1986, the prior period of Service shall be included in the Member's Pensionable Service.\n[30] Section 4.07 is entitled Inclusion of Prior Service at Election of Member. Section 4.07(1) deals with the situation where a Member with contributory Service prior to 1987, who terminated employment prior to becoming vested in such service, and was re-hired prior to January 1, 1987, may apply to the Administrator of the Plan to have that prior period reflected as Pensionable Service.\n[31] Section 4.07(2) - Election by Female Members in respect of Employment Prior to May 1, 1974 - reproduces the 2003 GBB amendment. This section sets out the eligibility rules for the GBB and provides that eligible members may apply to the Administrator of the Plan to have their period of employment pre-May 1, 1974, between ages 21 and 24, reflected as Pensionable Service.\n[32] Section 4.07(2) also sets out the terms of payment for the GBB and goes on to provide that the GBB period of Pensionable Service does not affect the Member's Admission Date nor shall the Member be deemed to have been a Member during that period.\n[33] It is very important to note that ss. 4.06, 4.07(1) and 4.07(2) by their terms are made exceptions to s. 4.04, the definition of Pensionable Service.\nG. Ms. Sugimoto and the GBB (i) Initial Correspondence and Consultations [34] The GBB offer was communicated to eligible Plan members by an internal RBC communication called Between Ourselves. It is dated January 24, 1996 and the headline read Royal Bank Moves to Correct Gender Gap in Pension Plan.\n[35] This communication sets out that one of the stated goals coming out of a series of gender conferences held by RBC a year earlier, was to make RBC a leading employer for gender equality. To achieve this, where possible, RBC would be making changes to previous policies that do not accord with its current gender policies. One of the past inequities identified was the disparity in the pre-1974 Plan eligibility rules for men and women.\n[36] In an effort to deal with this inequity, women who had continuous RBC employment pre-May 1974 and who were age 21-24 at the time would be given a one-time option to purchase up to three years of contributory pension plan membership.\n[37] Interested employees who wanted additional information were provided with a document called Royal Bank Past Gender Discriminatory Practices. This outlined that eligible employees could purchase contributory pension benefits and set out the terms and costs, etc.\n[38] The Human Resources Service Centre issued a further communication to employees on May 17, 1996 following up on the Between Ourselves newsletter. This referred to the special policy, previously outlined, for eligible female employees to buy pension plan service for full time employment prior to May 1, 1974 between ages 21 and 24.\n[39] Ms. Sugimoto was interested and submitted a Request for Information form indicating both that she wished to purchase three years of pension plan service and her eligibility to do so. She received an Application to Purchase Pension Plan Service Female Employees - 1996 Option, which she completed.\n[40] The Application set out her date of birth, 04-Oct-51; her continuous service date, 23-Feb-70; the date joined plan 01-Mar-80; years of service purchased 1.5833 (19 months); and deemed date joined pension plan, 01-Aug-78. The Application also contained the statement that this purchase of pension benefits provided additional years of service for benefit calculations and early retirement discount purposes only. Ms. Sugimoto had to pay $4,835 for the buyback years, which she did.\n[41] Ms. Sugimoto understood that at least to the extent of the GBB, RBC had made an attempt to eliminate the gender gap. But, in her view, there still existed a disparity between male and female employees of the same age and employment record.\n[42] So, on July 12, 1996, Ms. Sugimoto wrote to the RSVP Coordinator. She pointed out that male members with her employment record and age, who had elected to remain as contributory members rather than opt out, would be able to retire 72 months earlier than she could. Ms. Sugimoto asked whether RBC was making any efforts to close the remaining gap, namely, the period from 1974 to 1980.\n[43] Susan Ormiston, the RSVP Coordinator responded in her letter dated September 17, 1996. She wrote that in introducing the GBB, RBC recognized that this could not and did not solve all the past Plan inequities. Other reasons which she gave echoed those given in the February 8, 1995 Mercer Report.\n[44] RBC had considered offering a buy-back for the 1974 - 1980 period, but rejected this because it would be unfair to those who had opted out in 1974. If they had known then about the early retirement amendment, they would have made a different decision.\n[45] Further, to allow a buy-back of this period of service for the GBB employee could raise similar demands for the same from new hires where the Plan admission age was 30.\n[46] Ms. Sugimoto also obtained a letter dated December 23, 1996, from Brad Lambert, Vice-President, Business Banking, British Columbia and Yukon. In his letter, which was written in response to requests to buy back pension membership for the 1974-1980 period, Mr. Lambert pointed out that, with the benefit of hindsight, it was possible to assume some employees would have stayed in the Plan in 1974. But the assumption was that those seeking to buy back the 1974-1980 period, would have opted out in 1974 had they been Plan members. This was based on the fact that most people at that time who had only a few years service did in fact opt out. He reiterated that the GBB went some distance to deal with past gender inequity, but did not address all of the concerns.\n[47] Ms. Sugimoto also spoke with someone in the Pension Benefits department about the fact that she wanted to make this purchase. She says that she was told that when developing the GBB, the RBC had concluded that because most of the employees in her age group had opted out of the Plan in May 1974, the GBB participants would also likely have opted out. According to Ms. Sugimoto, RBC deemed her and the others to have opted out of the Plan as at May 1, 1974.\n[48] At this point in time, only one thing remained to Ms. Sugimoto's puzzlement. That was the concept of the deemed date joined plan that first appeared in her GBB Application.\n[49] Ms. Sugimoto says that she called the RBC Connections Help Line which was set up to advise employees on the GBB. She spoke to Carol Ann Clark and asked why she was being assigned a deemed date joined pension plan of August 1, 1978 and not October 1, 1972 to May of 1974.\n[50] According to Ms. Sugimoto, Ms. Clark told her it was for administrative purposes to show continuous pension plan membership and that, in effect, she had purchased contributory Plan membership for that period.\n[51] Ms. Sugimoto also spoke to Evelyn Murphy at Connections who told her that the terms, pension membership\/benefits\/service were interchangeable. In their evidence before the Tribunal, both Marianne Wilson and Gary Dobbie agreed with this.\n[52] Ms. Sugimoto said that Ms. Murphy told her that in that same conversation that, with the GBB, she had purchased Plan membership for October 1, 1972 to May 1, 1974.\n[53] Ms. Sugimoto was satisfied that after the GBB, she was now on an equal footing in terms of pension benefits to her male counterpart who in 1974 had opted out of the Plan. Both were eligible for a full unreduced pension at age 61 years, 10 months. There was no longer a gender problem and she did not pursue the matter any further in 1996.\n(ii) Ms. Sugimoto's Personal Benefits Statements [54] The personal benefits statement is an annual statement from RBC to its employees giving details of all their employment benefits. As to her pension details, Ms. Sugimoto's 1994 statement showed her date of birth, October 4, 1951; date joined Plan, March 1, 1980; and her contributory pensionable service dates are March 1, 1980 to March 4, 1985. Her early retirement date, after 35 years of credited Plan membership, was February 28, 2015.\n[55] Ms. Sugimoto's post-GBB 1997 statement showed these same details with the addition of contributory pensionable service, being August 1, 1978 to February 28, 1980 and March 1, 1980 to March 4, 1985. Also added was deemed date joined plan, August 1, 1978. Her early retirement date with 35 years of credited pension plan membership was now July 31, 2013 which reflected her GBB purchase of 19 months. All of Ms. Sugimoto's subsequent personal benefits statements up to and including 2001 had these same details.\n(iii) The BenPlus DB Pension System [56] Ms. Sugimoto also referred to a computer printout from the BenPlus DB pension system. This is a computer generated retirement modeling tool that RBC makes available on-line to Plan members. It was introduced in October 2001 to allow employees to make retirement calculations and retirement planning scenarios available on RBC's intranet. The employee inputs certain data assumptions such as estimated salary growth and pensionable bonus, retirement ages etc. Other data on the printout comes from RBC's pension records.\n[57] This printout is dated September 17, 2001 and consists of five pages. On page two, there is a box labelled Pensionable Service Details. This shows Ms. Sugimoto to be in the defined benefit plan with a service period of 1980\/03\/01 to date. Her contributory pensionable service period is shown as 1980\/03\/01 to 1985\/03\/04 and her previous contributory pensionable service as 1972\/10\/01 to 1974\/05\/01.\n[58] There is a disclaimer on page four of the printout. It provides that the information in the printout may not be accurate, complete or current. It is for estimation purposes only and the estimates are based on assumptions inputted by the employee which could change in the future. The disclaimer goes on to provide that the actual Plan benefits will be based on the Plan provisions and if there is any conflict between the printout and the Plan, the Plan will prevail.\nH. The 2001 Re-opener [59] The 2001 Re-opener was an offer by RBC to active employees and retirees, male and female, who had suspended their Plan membership between May 1, 1974 and their 30th birthday, to elect to have their period of suspension treated as a non-contributory membership in calculating their pension benefits.\n[60] The push for the 2001 Re-opener came from a number of individuals who questioned the actions that they had undertaken at May 1, 1974 in suspending their membership. After three years of negotiating with RBC, they threatened to bring a class action if RBC did not take remedial action.\n[61] RBC retained a number of law firms to review the text of the May 1, 1974 Plan amendment. Their advice was that the amendment could be interpreted as providing three options to the under age 30 members. Option one, to remain as a contributory member; option two, to suspend membership until age 30; and, option three, to remain in the Plan as a non-contributory member. There was no legal interpretation that required RBC to offer the 2001 Re-opener to any other Plan members.\n[62] After reviewing this legal advice, RBC requested William Mercer to estimate the cost of providing this third option. In doing its costing, Mercer considered two groups:\nGroup A - members of the Plan who opted out on May 1, 1974, and the cost of offering them additional periods of pensionable service from May 1, 1974 to the earliest of March 1, 1980 and age 30;\nGroup B - male employees under 21 and female employees under age 24 at May 1, 1974 who were not eligible to join the Plan and the cost of offering them additional pensionable service from the later of May 1, 1974 and age 21, to March 1, 1980.\n[63] Mercer noted that there were 304 females and 290 males in Group A as of January 1, 2001. And 885 females and 53 males in Group B. The increased actuarial costs to RBC for Group A were calculated to be $23,178,000. For Group B, $28,346,000.\n[64] After receiving Mercer's report, RBC did consider offering the 2001 Re-opener to Group B members. But decided not to do so because it would have required a Plan amendment; there was a significant cost to do so; and RBC felt that it would be inappropriate to offer it to Group B and not to other categories of employees who were not Plan members at May 1, 1974.\n[65] In its September 26, 2001 letter, RBC offered to those employees in Group A and retirees who had suspended membership in May 1974, to elect non-contributory membership for the period of their suspension. 260 females and 250 males took advantage of the 2001 Re-opener. It was not offered to Ms. Sugimoto. RBC did not consider that she was a Plan member who had suspended her membership at May 1, 1974.\n[66] RBC characterized the 2001 Re-opener as a re-interpretation of the May 1974 Plan amendment. As such, it was not necessary to amend the Plan to effect the 2001 Re-opener. RBC was only administering the Plan in compliance with the Plan text. And it was done through administrative process.\n[67] There was, however, an amendment to the Plan relating to the 2001 Re-opener. Section 1.02 History of the Plan was amended to provide an explanation for the 2001 Re-opener, which is referred to in this section as the 2001 Fix.\nI. Ms. Sugimoto and her OSFI Complaint [68] When Ms. Sugimoto learned of the 2001 Re-opener, she enquired from RBC as to why the offer was not made to her. She was told that she did not qualify because she was not a Plan member on May 1, 1974.\n[69] She was shocked and considered this to be sex and age discrimination. She believed that as a result of the GBB, she had been made equal at least to her male counterpart who had opted out in 1974. Now, because of the 2001 Re-opener, her male counterpart could retire with an unreduced pension at age 56, but she had to wait to age 61 years, 10 months for the same pension benefits.\n[70] Ms. Sugimoto was persistent in her efforts to remedy what she considered to be another gender inequity. She wrote numerous letters and e-mails to senior officials of RBC. She had numerous conversations with RBC officials, but to no avail.\n[71] Ms. Sugimoto first wrote to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions on September 4, 2002, three months before her complaint to the CHRC. One of OSFI's responsibilities is to oversee federally administered pension plans under the Pension Benefit Standards Act.\n[72] In her letter, Ms. Sugimoto documented in great detail all of the events from 1974 to the 2001 Re-opener. She sought OSFI's assistance and advice regarding the effects of the GBB and particularly the 2001 re-opener which she considered to amount to age and gender discrimination.\n[73] Ms. Sugimoto's submissions mirrored her submissions to the CHRC and the evidence she presented at the hearing before this Tribunal. In addition, her counsel made a number of written submissions to OSFI and met with OSFI officials. Their submissions raised these concerns. First, the gender gap issue which OSFI advised both Ms. Sugimoto and her counsel to be a human rights issue and beyond its jurisdiction.\n[74] Secondly, improper disclosure by RBC in that not all eligible female employees were properly informed of the GBB and some were misinformed. Further, the words pensionable service and membership were used interchangeably in the communications from RBC and this raised the question of whether the members bought back membership or pensionable service. Finally, there was the question of the delay by RBC in filing the GBB amendment with OSFI.\n[75] OSFI's review of the issues raised by Ms. Sugimoto took over two years. It reached its conclusions and communicated them in its December 14, 2004 letter to Grosman, Grosman & Gale, Ms. Sugimoto's counsel; in its December 20, 2004 letter to Ms. Sugimoto; and in its January 21, 2004 letter to RBC.\n[76] As to the question of improper disclosure, OSFI concluded that RBC did comply with the PBSA with respect to the communicating to affected members of the GBB offer and Plan amendment.\n[77] OSFI was critical of RBC for the delay between the 1995 Board resolution and the filing of the 2003 GBB amendment and suggested that RBC review its procedures to ensure compliance with the PBSA.\n[78] OSFI also criticized RBC for the confusion caused in its communications with members with respect to the use of the terms purchase of three years plan membership and purchase of pension benefits or years of pension plan service. OSFI pointed out that had the Plan amendment closely followed the 1995 resolution, this confusion could have been avoided.\n[79] On the question of the GBB, pensionable service and Plan membership, OSFI wrote that it had reviewed the written disclosure provided to members including the Between Ourselves newsletter, the GBB Application, the May 17, 1996 memorandum to eligible members, and the documentation submitted by Ms. Sugimoto including her annual personal benefits statements. OSFI concluded that:\nWe noted the communication to members did refer to the purchase of past benefits as the purchase of three years contributory plan membership, contributory pension Plan benefits, as well as pension service.\nWe are unable to comment on any verbal advice received by individual Plan members from Bank personnel. However, we cannot conclude from the material submitted that any promise was made to members that specified their purchase of the pension benefit would affect their date of entry into the plan or deem them to be a member during the buy-back period.\nThis is consistent with the wording of the 1995 Board resolution and applicable amendment filed with OSFI in October 2003.\n[80] Ms. Sugimoto was not very accepting of OSFI's conclusion. On June 20, 2005, she wrote to OSFI saying that it appeared that OSFI's findings were based on incomplete information, evidence and documentation and that there were a number of issues that OSFI failed to consider. In her 16 page letter, Ms. Sugimoto set out the further considerations that OSFI should address. She also wrote to OSFI on December 9, 2005 claiming that RBC had contravened the PBSA, and giving particulars. This is unrelated to her human rights complaint.\n[81] OSFI replied on June 22, 2006, that they were reviewing the issues that she had raised. That remains the current status.\nIII. ANALYSIS A. The Prima Facie Test, and the Issues to be Decided [82] In a human rights case before this Tribunal, the complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, i.e. credible, is complete and sufficient for a decision in the favour of the complainant, in the absence of a reasonable answer from the respondent. The respondent's answer should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004; Dhanjal v. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6)\n[83] Ms. Sugimoto makes three arguments for a prima facie case of discrimination:\nby the GBB, Ms. Sugimoto bought back pre-1974 Plan membership, in which case she was treated adversely vis-\u00e0-vis her male counterpart because she was denied the opportunity to participate in the 2001 Re-opener. alternatively, if she did not buy back pre-1974 Plan membership, the GBB was under-inclusive. It purported to, but did not give Ms. Sugimoto the same status as her male counterpart. This is also alleged to be adverse discrimination. the 2001 Re-opener was facially neutral and was to apply to all members who had opted in 1974. However, the GBB women, who were told that they were being made equal to their male counterparts, were denied the 2001 Re-opener. The effects of this seemingly neutral rule were adverse for the GBB women.\nB. Did Ms. Sugimoto Establish a Prima Facie Case of Pre-May 1, 1974 Plan Membership? [84] There are a number of facts that support Ms. Sugimoto's prima facie case for pre-1974 Plan membership and adverse treatment. There is the announcement in the Between Ourselves newsletter that RBC moves to correct gender gap in pension plan. To deal with past inequities in the Plan, those eligible were offered the opportunity to buy back up to three years of contributory plan membership.\n[85] Other documentation provided to the employees such as the May 17, 1996 Human Resources bulletin characterized the GBB as being the purchase of pension plan service. The Request for Information form described the GBB as the purchase of contributory pension benefits.\n[86] Ms. Sugimoto was told by Evelyn Murphy when she called the Connections Line that the terms pension plan membership\/service\/benefits were used interchangeably. This was confirmed by other RBC officials (Gary Dobbie and Marianne Wilson).\n[87] As to the deemed date joined pension plan, Ms. Sugimoto was told by Carol Ann Clark at the Connections Line that it is a term used by RBC for administrative purposes to show continuous pension plan membership. But this term is not found anywhere in the Plan text.\n[88] According to Ms. Sugimoto, both Ms. Clark and Ms. Murphy told her that she had purchased contributory Plan membership for the period of October 1, 1972 to May 1, 1974.\n[89] There is the December 23, 1996 letter to Brad Lambert in which he talked about the assumption that employees in Ms. Sugimoto's position would have opted out in 1974. Further, Ms. Sugimoto was told by the Pensions Benefits department that RBC, in developing the GBB, had concluded that the GBB participants would likely have opted out and RBC deemed Ms. Sugimoto and others to have opted out in 1974. If this is so, then logically RBC must have considered her to be a Plan member in 1974.\n[90] Finally, there is the BenPlus printout which shows Ms. Sugimoto's previous contributory pensionable service to be 1972\/10\/01 to 1974\/05\/01. This information came from RBC pension records and was not inputted into the system by her.\n[91] There is no argument that, immediately after her GBB purchase, Ms. Sugimoto was equal to her male counterpart insofar as both could retire at the same age with the same pension.\n[92] Accepting the facts that the Between Ourselves newsletter communicated to employees that RBC was moving to correct the gender gap; that Ms. Sugimoto was told that by participating in the GBB, she had purchased contributory plan membership for the relevant period, and that term is interchangeable with pensionable service\/benefits; and that deemed date joined pension plan is not a Plan term; and that RBC deemed the GBB women to have opted out in 1974 thereby suggesting that they had become members; and that the BenPlus printout showed her previous contributory DB pensionable service to be from 1972\/10\/10 to 1974\/05\/01, it is fair to conclude that Ms. Sugimoto has established, on a prima facie basis, that she has attained the same status as her male counterpart, i.e. a pre-1974 Plan member who was deemed to have opted out in 1974.\n[93] There is also prima facie evidence that Ms. Sugimoto was not eligible for the 2001 Re-opener; that her male counterpart was; that the 2001 re-opener differentiated between the two; and the differentiation adversely affected Ms. Sugimoto in the course of her employment.\n[94] Accordingly, I have concluded that Ms. Sugimoto has shown a prima facie case of adverse differentiation in respect of the 2001 Re-opener on the basis of the distinction drawn between her male counterpart's pre-1974 membership and her own pre-1974 membership.\nC. Has the Respondent Provided an Answer to the Prima Facie Case of Discrimination? [95] Many aspects of the prima facie case have not been refuted: Ms. Sugimoto's ineligibility for the 2001 Re-opener and her male counterpart's eligibility; the uniquely female nature of the GBB initiative; the fact that the GBB in the immediate aftermath, equalized retirement possibilities. The only contested question is whether the GBB gave her pre-1974 membership.\n[96] RBC notes that there is nothing in Ms. Sugimoto's Application that refers to any pre-May 1, 1974 Plan membership, nor did Ms. Sugimoto sign any enrolment card that would give her retroactive Plan membership for that period. Further, her Application clearly sets out that the purchase of pension benefits provides additional years of service for benefit calculations and early retirement discount purposes only.\n[97] All of her personal benefit statements from 1997 to 2001 consistently showed her date joined plan as March 1, 1980. There is nothing on these statements that show that she was a member of the Plan between October 1, 1972 to May 1, 1974.\n[98] Bernard Morency, an actuary with William Mercer was the actuary to the Plan and was actively involved in the development of the GBB and the 2001 Re-opener. He said that any pension benefits that may accrue to Plan members must be found in the Plan text. And although the GBB amendment was not added to the text until 2003, Plan members and the Plan trustee could look to the 1995 Board resolution to define their GBB entitlement.\n[99] In his view, the GBB gave eligible employees the option to make a contribution in order to get the eligible service considered pensionable. If accepted, the GBB would be counted as contributory service towards the annual pension amount and also count towards the 35 years required for early retirement. For him, the GBB did not affect the date joined plan. It changed or added to the years of pensionable service.\n[100] Marianne Wilson was the Manager, Pension Administration in the Human Resources Centre from 1987 to 1998. She was responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Plan, to ensure all calculations for benefits were appropriately done for employees, to respond to employees questions and to maintain the payroll records for pension purposes and the administration of the pensioners' payroll. She was very much involved in implementation of the GBB including the development of the documentation required for the GBB.\n[101] According to Ms. Wilson, the date an employee joined the Plan never changed. The term deemed date joined plan was the method that RBC used to account or record employees buying back previous service. It gives a date for prior service to count as credited service.\n[102] Ms. Wilson called this ante-dating. This is similar to what was done in earlier Plan texts and the GBB amendment tracked the earlier versions in concept, except that the structure of the GBB amendment is somewhat different.\n[103] Ms. Wilson referred to previous Plan texts as they evolved over the years to show the historical analogy for the deemed date joined plan under section C1.25 of the Consolidated By-laws of the Pension Fund Society amended to May 1, 1974, a Plan member whose service was terminated and was later re-hired, was treated as a new employee with a new date of admission in the Plan. This new date of admission could be backdated to allow for the employee's previous service. This backdating did not involve giving the employee deemed membership at his or her original commencement date of employment. This treatment is analogous to the administrative measures taken by RBC in assigning the deemed date joined plan to Ms. Sugimoto.\n[104] The January 1, 1981 Consolidated By-laws carried forward C1.25 and also added C1.26 which allowed for service lost because of a labour dispute to be deemed pensionable service. Notably absent from this provision is any reference to changing the admission date.\n[105] The 1974 and1981 Consolidated By-laws are also instructive in showing the relationship in the Plan between the buy back of service and pensionable service. Under paragraph C1.12 (m) of the 1974 Consolidated By-laws, pensionable service was the period of years commencing with the date of admission to the Plan and ending with the date of termination of service or the 35th anniversary of admission. Member is defined as an employee who has been admitted to the Plan.\n[106] The January 1981 Consolidated By-laws carried forward this same definition except that the definition of pensionable service was now made subject to the application of C1.25 and C1.26. Therefore, for the purposes of these two provisions, the concept of pensionable service was uncoupled from the concept of admission to membership. They were no longer interchangeable.\n[107] Mr. Morency gave an example of how s. C1.25 worked. If an employee was a Plan member between 1974 and 1978, left RBC and returned to employment in 1981, the employee would have four years of prior service. When the employee re-joined RBC, his or her date joined Plan would be 1981. But C1.25 would allow the employee's admission date to be backdated to 1977.\n[108] Mr. Dobbie spoke to the BenPlus computer printout. He noted the disclaimer which provided that the information may not be complete, accurate or correct and that it was there for a variety of purposes. This was a new system; it was for information purposes only; and it was not intended to provide specific advice because the calculation is to some extent, generated by input from the employee. It was not meant to replace the annual personal benefits statements.\n[109] As to that part of the printout, Pensionable Service Details, Previous Royal Bank Pensionable Service, Pension Service Period, 1972\/10\/01 to 1974\/05\/01, it shows only that Ms. Sugimoto bought contributory pensionable service for that period. To that extent, said Mr. Dobbie, it is similar to the date that would be reflected there for employees with broken service records.\n[110] Any rights or benefits Ms. Sugimoto may have acquired through her GBB purchase must flow through the 1995 Board resolution and the 2003 GBB Plan amendment which was effective January 1, 1996. Accordingly these are the sources that I must look to.\n[111] I include the Plan amendment because OSFI, the authority charged with regulating federal pensions, has concluded that the 2003 GBB amendment is consistent with the 1995 Board Resolution. Ms. Sugimoto's suggestion that OSFI may change its position based on her June 20, 2005 submissions, is entirely speculative.\n[112] What Ms. Sugimoto was told or promised by RBC officials or understood from the various documents can not be the source of her rights. The case before this Tribunal is not a contract case, nor is it a case of estoppel or misrepresentation.\n[113] As I read the 2003 GBB amendment, it adds the period of the GBB as contributory pensionable service to the pensionable service Ms. Sugimoto began accumulating when she joined the Plan on March 1, 1980.\n[114] This is made clear by s. 4.07(2) of the 2003 amendment, which applies notwithstanding the definition of Pensionable Service in s. 4.04. Just as C1.12(m) of the 1981 Consolidated By-laws made the definition of pensionable service subject to C1.25 and C1.26.\n[115] Further, the concluding words of s. 4.07(2) makes it clear that the acquisition of additional Pensionable Service under this provision does affect the Member's Admission date. This was the consequence of the GBB and it did not confer on Ms. Sugimoto, the status of a pre-1974 Plan member who had opted out. Her date of admission to membership remained March 1, 1980.\n[116] Thus, I have concluded that the respondent has answered the prima facie case and there is no discrimination relating the refusal of RBC to allow Ms. Sugimoto to participate in the 2001 Re-opener. Because the GBB did not grant her pre-1974 membership, she was not comparable to her male counterpart.\nD. Was the GBB Under-Inclusive and therefore Discriminatory? [117] Apart from her assertion that the GBB was under-inclusive because it did not give what it purported to give to Ms. Sugimoto, she offered little argument or legal authorities to support this position. However, since the argument was raised, I will deal with it.\n[118] In Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the concept of under-inclusiveness and discrimination under the Manitoba Human Right Code.\n[119] This case involved Canada Safeway's group insurance plan which provided generally for benefits during pregnancy, but excluded coverage for 17 weeks of the pregnancy period.\n[120] In dealing with the question of whether such exclusion was discriminatory as being under-inclusive, the Supreme Court considered that under-inclusion may be a backhanded way of permitting discrimination. It is no less discriminatory to partially withhold benefits from a group than it is to impose a penalty or burden on the group.\n[121] In Brooks, Canada Safeway had an ongoing, active obligation under the Manitoba Human Rights Code not to deny its female employees equal benefits under the group insurance plan.\n[122] The problem with applying the principle of under-inclusiveness in this case is that it assumes that RBC had a legal obligation under the CHRA to remedy the pre-CHRA discrimination. But this is not so.\n[123] It strains logic to say to an employer that you are under no legal duty to eliminate pre-CHRA discrimination, but if you choose to do so, you must eliminate all of it or incur liability under the CHRA for the outstanding balance. Or, to express it another way, an ex gratia gesture to account for pre-CHRA discrimination should not attract liability for under-inclusiveness.\n[124] For these reasons, it is my opinion that Ms. Sugimoto has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because of the alleged under-inclusiveness of the GBB.\nE. Is the 2001 Re-opener Discriminatory to the Extent it Distinguished Between Members and Non-Members? [125] The 2001 Re-opener, although neutral on its face (it does not distinguish between men and women - only between members and non-members) imposes a restriction on women in Ms. Sugimoto's position because of a special characteristic they share, namely, ineligibility for Plan membership in 1974 because of their age and gender. This special characteristic arises from the operation of a pension rule that was in effect prior to the enactment of the CHRA. Indirect restrictions based on characteristics of this kind are referred to as adverse effect discrimination.\n[126] Adverse effect discrimination has been recognized by the Supreme Court in O'Malley. But the difficulty in this case and not encountered in O'Malley is one of retrospectivity.\n[127] Is it discriminatory for the 2001 Re-opener to distinguish on the basis of past membership, given this was in place pre-CHRA? In my opinion, the Federal Court of Appeal has answered this question in the negative. It did so in Gell v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., (1987) 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5494.\n[128] In Gell, prior to the commencement of the CHRA, the company pension plan had a maximum age rule (age rule) that excluded from membership any persons who were 40 years old or older when they started working for the company. The complainants, who were both over 40 when hired, were excluded from the pension plan pursuant to the age rule.\n[129] In 1978, the company amended the plan to give eligible employees the right to join the plan if they had earlier elected not to join the plan, or if they had left the plan. The complainants were not eligible because of the age rule.\n[130] In 1979, the company amended the plan again, allowing all those employees who joined the plan pursuant to the 1978 amendment the option to buy back up to 10 years of past pensionable service. The complainants were not eligible for the 1979 buy-back, because they had not been eligible to benefit from the 1978 amendment.\n[131] In 1980, the CHRA became operative in respect of pension plan age discrimination. That same year, the company introduced a further amendment to the plan that allowed any employees who had been previously excluded from membership by the age rule to join the plan. The complainants joined.\n[132] In 1982, another plan amendment was adopted, aimed exclusively at those employees who had benefited from the 1978 and 1979 amendments. The 1982 amendment allowed eligible employees to buy back pension service in respect of any remaining years of service which they had not already bought back. The complainants were ineligible to benefit from the 1982 amendment due to their ineligibility in respect of the 1978 and 1979 amendments.\n[133] The complainants alleged that their exclusion from the 1982 buy-back amendment was discriminatory because the eligibility rules for the amendment incorporated by reference a discriminatory age rule that had existed prior to the commencement of the CHRA provisions. They argued that since the buy-back offer (to which the Act applied) took into account past discriminatory considerations (to which the Act did not apply), the buy back offer was discriminatory.\n[134] The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed. It noted first that the buy-back offer was in essence facially neutral (it distinguished only on the basis of membership in the plan on a specific date). It then observed that the complainant's ineligibility for the buy-back offer was caused solely by the former existence of a discriminatory rule that pre-dated the operation of the CHRA.\n[135] The Court concluded that this rule was at the time perfectly legal and its effect, which is not required by the Act to be eliminated retroactively, must be taken as it is. Thus, according to Gell, a neutral event or transaction does not engage the CHRA by reason only of its reliance upon a discriminatory pre-Act state of affairs.\n[136] Ms. Sugimoto argues that Gell is distinguishable because it lacked a crucial fact that is present in the case at bar, the GBB. Unlike in Gell, RBC took the initiative, post-CHRA, to narrow the disparity between the complainant group and their comparators. (The degree to which the gap was narrowed is in dispute, but no party denies that it was at least partially narrowed.)\n[137] Ms. Sugimoto says that the GBB initiative constituted a commitment to full equality for all the GBB women, i.e. closing the gap that was created before the CHRA came into force. Moreover, she alleges that RBC represented it as such to its female employees. Ultimately though, from her perspective, RBC failed to live up to its commitment, and the GBB did not have the effect that RBC purported it to have.\n[138] Ms. Sugimoto stresses that none of these circumstances were present in Gell. There was no initiative in Gell to narrow the disparity between the complainant and comparator groups. There was no commitment to close the gap between the over-40-year-olds and the under-40-year-olds, nor any representation to have effectively done so. Accordingly, it cannot be said that in Gell there was any failure to live up to such promises.\n[139] It is true that there are factual differences between Gell and this case, including the absence in Gell of anything resembling the GBB initiative. However, this is not enough to distinguish the decision.\n[140] To do so, it would be necessary to show that the factual differences in question are relevant to the Court's reasoning. Gell stands for the proposition that a neutral event or transaction does not engage the CHRA by reason only of its reliance upon a discriminatory pre-Act state of affairs. The presence of the GBB in the current matter does not make this proposition any less applicable.\n[141] I have earlier concluded that the GBB did not alter Ms. Sugimoto's status to the point of putting her on the same footing as her male counterpart. The GBB merely narrowed the gap in years of pensionable service. I have also concluded that in narrowing the gap-a gap RBC had no obligation to close in the first place-the GBB cannot be viewed as under-inclusive or otherwise adversely differential towards Ms. Sugimoto.\n[142] In effect, the GBB granted Ms. Sugimoto partial compensation for pre-CHRA exclusion. But in terms of status, the GBB did not place her in any better position vis-\u00e0-vis the 2001 Re-opener than the Gell complainants found themselves at the time of the 1982 amendment. In each case the individuals concerned had eventually acquired plan membership, but they were still ineligible for the facially neutral pension offer in question because the offer was tied to old discriminatory membership rules that existed prior to the commencement of the CHRA.\n[143] In Gell, the impugned buy-back was an offer made to the comparators that was based on a certain status enjoyed by the comparators before the CHRA came into force (a status the complainants were not granted at the time).\n[144] Likewise, in this case, the Re-opener was an offer made to the comparators that was based upon a certain status enjoyed by the comparators before the CHRA came into force (a status that Ms. Sugimoto was not granted at the time, and never acquired retroactively, notwithstanding the GBB).\n[145] In Gell, the Federal Court of Appeal has stated that discriminatory differences in status pre-dating the CHRA can still be relied upon after the legislation has come into force, without engaging liability.\n[146] In the current case, the result can be no different. The presence of the GBB does not alter the discriminatory difference in status pre-dating the CHRA which separates Ms. Sugimoto from her male counterpart.\n[147] In her submissions, Ms. Sugimoto relied extensively on the dissenting judgment of Jackson JA in the case of Anderson v. Saskatchewan Teachers Superannuation Commission (1995) 24 C.H.R.R. D\/177 (Sask.C.A.).\n[148] In Anderson, a school board had a policy requiring female teachers to resign in order to take maternity leave and then re-apply for employment. Under this policy, the teachers were unable to accumulate pensionable service during their pregnancy-related absences from the workplace. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the complainant teachers resigned for pregnancy and childbirth reasons, and were later re-hired following the completion of their maternity leaves.\n[149] In the 1970s, legislation came into force in the province which forbade discrimination in employment on the ground of sex.\n[150] In 1976, the school board began approving formal maternity leaves instead of requiring resignations. In addition, in 1976 pension legislation was passed that essentially allowed women to buy back the pensionable service they lost while on board-approved maternity leave.\n[151] In the early 1990s, the complainants applied to buy back the service lost on account of their pregnancies. The pension commission refused, given that the complainants' maternity leaves had not been board-approved; they had resigned to take their leave.\n[152] The complainants then alleged that the pension commission's refusal to allow them to buy back service in respect of their maternity leaves was discriminatory.\n[153] The majority in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the pension buy-back rule was not discriminatory. Given their finding, the majority was not required to address the fact that the origin of the buy-back dispute, the complainants' non board-approved maternity leaves in the late 1950's and early 1960s, pre-dated the commencement of the applicable anti-discrimination legislation.\n[154] Jackson JA, in dissent, held that the pension buy-back rule was discriminatory. In doing so, she had to address the fact that the complainants' pregnancy resignations occurred prior to the coming into force of the Human Rights Code, and the Code could not deal with discriminatory acts occurring prior to its enactment.\n[155] In her view, however, the relevant event for this analysis was not the old policy obliging women to resign to take maternity leave, but rather the new act, i.e. the introduction of a new maternity buy-back rule that excluded the complainants because (due to pre-Code discrimination) they had been unable to take board-approved leave.\n[156] The new buy-back rule was not a natural consequence of the old pre-Code policy. In this regard it was noteworthy that the pension commission was not obliged to offer buy-backs.\n[157] Given that it was not a natural consequence of the pre-Code rule, the new buy back rule could not be sheltered by the principle of non-retrospective application of the Code.\n[158] In reaching her conclusion, Jackson JA referred to Gell, which she considered, on its facts, to be similar to the facts in Anderson. However, after discussing the Gell case, Jackson JA concluded that Gell should not be followed. In her view, once the respondent in Gell decided to offer the buy-back, it could not discriminate on the basis of age by building upon a prior discriminatory rule to create present day discrimination.\n[159] It is clear that in Anderson, Jackson JA refused to follow Gell. It is also clear that this was not because Gell was distinguishable on its facts.\n[160] The only fair conclusion to be drawn from Jackson JA's reasons is that she believed that Gell, while dealing with facts similar to those before her, was not to be followed because, in her opinion, it was wrongly decided.\n[161] However, while Jackson JA, as a judge of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, is free to disagree with the Gell decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, this Tribunal cannot.\n[162] Ms. Sugimoto did not refer to any Federal Court of Appeal decisions that overrule Gell. Given the absence of salient dissimilarities between Gell and the present case, this Tribunal is bound to follow Gell.\n[163] Even if the Tribunal were free to adopt the dissenting reasons in Anderson, they would not be of assistance. First of all, much is made in the reasons of Jackson JA that new acts that rely on past discrimination are themselves discriminatory. Yet there is a strong argument against characterizing the 2001 Re-opener as a fresh step. The facts are that the 2001 Re-opener is a re-interpretation of a 1974 Plan amendment that should have been made available at the time of the amendment.\n[164] Moreover, given Jackson JA's statements about the factual similarities between Anderson and Gell, it is inconsistent for Ms. Sugimoto to argue on one hand that Gell is distinguishable on its facts, while on the other hand, Anderson should be applied to the current case. If Gell is distinguishable on its facts, then Anderson should be as well.\n[165] The 2001 Re-opener adversely differentiates between Ms. Sugimoto and her male counterpart. But the Gell decision compels us to view the differentiation in terms of membership, as opposed to gender, and therefore there is no nexus between this adverse effect and a prohibited ground of discrimination. Ms. Sugimoto has not shown a prima facie case of discrimination.\nIV. DECISION [166] I have found that Ms. Sugimoto has made out a prima facie case of discrimination on the question of pre-1974 Plan membership and adverse differentiation because of the denial of the 2001 Re-opener. I have concluded, however, that RBC has provided a reasonable explanation to the prima facie case, so this allegation must be dismissed.\n[167] With respect to the allegations of discrimination based on the under-inclusiveness of the GBB and the allegation of discrimination based on the adverse effect of the 2001 Re-opener on certain non-members, I have concluded that Ms. Sugimoto has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[168] Accordingly, Ms. Sugimoto's complaint of discrimination against RBC under s. 7 of the CHRA is dismissed.\n[169] In her complaint, Ms. Sugimoto also alleged that RBC contravened ss. 10 and 21 of the CHRA. However, she did not present any evidence or argument with respect to these allegations. I assume they have been abandoned. If not, these allegations have not been substantiated and for this reason are also dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ.

Hadjis\nDate: October 29, 2007\nCitation: 2007 CHRT 50\n[1] I wanted to review all the material and I\u2019ve written up my decision on the points raised by you this morning, if you\u2019ll just give me a moment.\n[2] On September 5, 2007, the Respondent made a motion to have the present complaint dismissed, principally because the complainant, Ms. Kuhlmann, failed to comply with her disclosure obligations. The Respondent has reiterated the request today, at the opening of the hearing into the complaint. Ms. Kuhlmann, in reply, has asked for leave to proceed to lead her evidence notwithstanding her failure to disclose, or in the alternative, that an adjournment be granted to enable her to complete her disclosure.\n[3] Ms. Kuhlmann filed her complaint on August 1, 2003. The complaint was referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Tribunal on July 20, 2006. On April 25, 2007, the Commission advised the Tribunal and the parties that it would not be appearing or calling evidence at the hearing into the complaint. At a case management teleconference conducted by the Tribunal on May 10, 2007, the hearing into this complaint was set down for September 17 to the 21st, 2007.\n[4] The parties were informed during the conference call of the dates for their respective disclosure, pursuant to Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. In a follow up letter from the Tribunal, the information that is to be exchanged as part of the disclosure was spelled out, including a statement of particulars, remedies sought, the lists of documents, witness lists and summaries of their evidence, including experts. Ms. Kuhlmann was to provide her disclosure by June 21, 2007, the Respondent by July 5, 2007.\n[5] On June 19, 2007, Ms. Kuhlmann wrote an email to the Tribunal requesting information on how to obtain and serve subpoenas and how to request additional disclosure from the other party. The information requested was provided to her by the Tribunal Registry, via an email message sent the same day.\n[6] On June 25, 2007, Ms. Kuhlmann wrote an email to the Tribunal requesting an extension for the disclosure of her documents, statement of particulars and witness list. She claimed to be having difficulty locating one of her potential witnesses. She also indicated that she had had her documents reviewed and was informed that case law would have to be provided. She was unfamiliar with case law research. She therefore requested that her deadline be extended to July 16, 2007. The Tribunal wrote back granting her extension but only until July 6, 2007.\n[7] On July 10, 2007, the Tribunal Registry sent an email message to Ms. Kuhlmann reminding her that four days had passed since the extended disclosure deadline had passed and she had still not filed her disclosure documents with the Tribunal. The message reminded her that no further extension had been granted and it was incumbent on her to send this material to the Tribunal and to the Respondent.\n[8] On July 16, 2007, the Tribunal Registry sent a letter by mail - by email, sorry - to Ms. Kuhlmann reminding her that she had still not filed her disclosure documents. The Tribunal asked that she respond and submit her disclosure immediately. The Tribunal reiterated the point that had been made when her disclosure date was extended, to the effect that the hearing dates set down would not be affected by the extension. The case would still proceed on September 17, 2007.\n[9] On July 17, 2007, Ms. Kuhlmann sent an email message to the Tribunal in which she stated that she had been in touch with the Commission for direction but had no reply from them as of yet. She attached a letter that she had sent to the Commission expressing her displeasure at their decision to not appear at the hearing.\n[10] The following day, on July 18, 2007, the Tribunal Registry wrote back to Ms. Kuhlmann by email, pointing out to her that the Commission is a separate and distinct entity from the Tribunal and that the Tribunal was not in a position to comment on the issues she had been raising with the Commission. The Tribunal reminded her that she had yet to complete her disclosure and included with the correspondence that was sent to her, a copy of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure with the pertinent provisions highlighted. The Tribunal reiterated that hearing dates for the complaint were not affected by the granting of an extension to July 6th for her disclosure. The Tribunal also pointed out to her that Rule 9(3) states that a party who does not comply with Rule 6(1) regarding disclosure shall not raise an issue, call witnesses, introduce documents or seek remedies at the hearing.\n[11] This morning when the hearing opened and the present issues were being debated, Ms. Kuhlmann indicated that she had telephoned and spoken to Mr. Guy Gr\u00e9goire, Manager of Registry Operations at the Tribunal, on July 30, 2007. She confirmed that he had indicated to her that she should provide the Tribunal with any documents she had on hand at that time and request that the Tribunal accept these documents as her disclosure. Nonetheless, Ms. Kuhlmann did not provide any disclosure documents whatsoever to the Tribunal or the Respondent thereafter.\n[12] On August 27, 2007, the Tribunal sent email messages to all the parties requesting their availability for a conference call to discuss the hearing process. Ms. Kuhlmann did not reply to this email. On September 5, 2007, the Tribunal attempted to telephone Ms. Kuhlmann. There was no answer so a message was left on her answering machine or voice mail, asking her to call back. It is my understanding that Ms. Kuhlmann never called back in this regard, and a conference call was not conducted. I would note here that this is information I just obtained looking at the Tribunal's file. But that is my understanding that a message was left at that time.\n[13] On Friday, September 14, 2007, at 2:30 p.m., that is to say, three days ago, Ms. Kuhlmann wrote an email message to the Tribunal in which she stated that upon returning from her vacation, she had managed to catch up on the numerous emails with regard to this matter. She added that she could not find in her emails any information regarding the time and place for the hearing and asked for the information to be forwarded to her. The information was forwarded to her by the Tribunal within five minutes, although I note from the case file that the Tribunal had emailed a notice of venue to all the parties on August 10, 2007.\n[14] In her submissions today on the issues at hand, Ms. Kuhlmann confirmed that she had been away from her home on and off for a number of weeks in August and early September. She claimed that she did not have access to a computer in this period and did not check her voice mail. There is no indication, however, of her having advised the Tribunal of her absence and of a forwarding address where she could be reached.\n[15] More importantly, during the month of July she was apparently available, and did receive the correspondence sent to her by the Tribunal. She herself contacted the Tribunal a number of times. There is, of course, no doubt that she knew that her disclosure was due by July 6, 2007. Yet despite the repeated notices from the Tribunal of her failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, she did not fulfill her disclosure obligations.\n[16] In the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence with Ms. Kuhlmann, there was explicit mention made of the consequences of failing to disclose, as set out in Rule 9(3). These consequences are also set out in the booklet entitled What happens next? A guide to the Tribunal process, which the Tribunal sends to all parties and which Ms. Kuhlmann acknowledged having received in this case. At page 18 of the guide, the paragraph is boldfaced and a symbol reflecting that this is a point to remember is added in the margin in the form of a magnifying glass. The paragraph states:\nIf you fail to disclose a document you may not be allowed to introduce it into evidence at the hearing. Similarly, you may not be permitted to examine witnesses or raise legal issues, including remedies sought that you have failed to identify in advance. The Tribunal will allow a party to rely on evidence not disclosed before the hearing only in exceptional circumstances.\n[17] And then it continues about the ongoing duty to disclose.\n[18] Ms. Kuhlmann arrives today at the hearing without having disclosed a single document or complied with any of her other disclosure obligations. Are there any exceptional circumstances in this case to justify allowing her to proceed without complying with her disclosure obligations? I do not see any. On the contrary, as the Respondent points out, it finds itself in a most untenable position. It must retain experts and expend time and money to fully prepare for the hearing, without knowledge of the case it must rebut. And in fact, it has not been able to prepare itself for today\u2019s hearing. In addition, there is no evidence of the Respondent having failed to comply with its duties in this process. For instance, given the Complainant\u2019s failure to disclose, it sought the Tribunal\u2019s authorization to be dispensed from disclosing at the dates that were stipulated for its disclosure.\n[19] The only justification that Ms. Kuhlmann appears to be providing for her failure to meet her disclosure obligations is her inability to get a response to her satisfaction from the Commission on the matters she has raised with them. This is not a relevant matter for the case at hand. Ms. Kuhlmann knows since at least April 2007 that the Commission will not be appearing. If she still wanted to pursue her complaint, it was incumbent upon her to focus her attention on the Tribunal process. She has failed to do so. I therefore see no reason to grant her leave from her disclosure obligations. Pursuant to Rule 9(3), and given her entire failure to disclose, she is foreclosed from leading any evidence in support of her complaint, raising any issue arising there from, calling any witness, or claiming any relief.\n[20] I also see no reason to adjourn this case to enable Ms. Kuhlmann to comply with her disclosure obligations. She has had ample opportunity to comply over the last two months, she has been repeatedly reminded of what she has to do to satisfy these requirements, and has opted not to do so. The Rules of Procedure are put in place to enable a fair and expeditious Tribunal hearing process. They are not there to be ignored and cast aside cavalierly, simply because a party opted to not comply with them. All parties have a duty to respect the Rules and Tribunal directives, be they Respondents or Complainants.\n[21] I would also add, in my view, that it would be unfair to the Respondent to extend this matter, one that dates back to August 2003, for what would surely be many months more and would probably take us well into 2008.\n[22] Ms. Kuhlmann\u2019s motion to adjourn is therefore denied.\n[23] Given, therefore, that the Complainant is foreclosed from leading evidence or raising any issue before me to support the complaint, as I indicated earlier, I find that her complaint is not substantiated and is therefore dismissed. Thank you. I don't think I have anything else to add so thank you very much.\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and accurate representation of my decision given to the parties on September 17, 2007.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

It should be noted that, during their testimony, Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel remarked on Dr. Beltrami's reports that were filed in evidence.\n[2] The complainant and the Commission oppose this motion inter alia on the ground that the respondent cannot divide its evidence and that, in any event, the respondent would be given an undue advantage which would be prejudicial to them if the Tribunal were to grant the respondent's motion.\n[3] The Tribunal is master of its own procedure. Pursuant to the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal holds inquiries into complaints referred to it by the Commission. In this respect, it can hear both ordinary and expert witnesses. That said, when a complaint is heard, the Tribunal must ensure that procedural fairness is observed so that one party is not given an advantage to the detriment of another in terms of the administration of the evidence.\n[4] In this matter, it was decided that the respondent's experts, namely Dr. Assalian, Dr. Dufour and Dr. Karmel, would be heard prior to the Commission's expert, Dr. Beltrami. Dr. Assalian had been heard before Dr. Beltrami testified, regarding his reports as well as Dr. Beltrami's reports. Dr. Assalian was thereby able to comment on Dr. Beltrami's reports, but without hearing his testimony. Similarly, Dr. Karmel was able to comment on the parts of Dr. Beltrami's report bearing on the MMPI-2 test, without having heard Dr. Beltrami's testimony.\n[5] Dr. Beltrami testified during the week of October 22, 2007. In the context of his testimony, which lasted five days, Dr. Beltrami commented on his reports and was also able to comment on several remarks made by Dr. Assalian during his testimony. He also referred to Dr. Karmel's report. Moreover, Dr. Beltrami was prompted to qualify certain assertions contained in his report.\n[6] In other circumstances, Dr. Beltrami would have testified prior to Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel. He would then have been able to testify in regard to his own reports, as well as comment on the reports of Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel. In such case, as Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel would not have had yet testified, Dr. Beltrami could not have commented on their testimonies.\n[7] That said, given the complexity of the medical issues raised in this matter, it is more likely that, once the respondent's experts had testified, the Commission would have requested that Dr. Beltrami be reheard to comment on their testimonies, a request that would have been very seriously considered by the Tribunal given the complexity of the issues raised in this matter and the importance that the Tribunal benefit from the most complete information possible on the medical issues raised.\n[8] The issue now before the Tribunal is whether to rehear the respondent's two experts, who did not have the opportunity to comment on the testimony of the Commission's medical expert, not whether to rehear two ordinary witnesses of the respondent in order to have them complete their testimonies.\n[9] The rehearing of an expert on one or more specific elements cannot be likened to rehearing a fact witness called to add to the witness' version of the facts after hearing another party's witnesses, thereby qualifying his or her own testimony.\n[10] The rehearing of Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel, recognized as expert witnesses, is intended to give the Tribunal the most complete understanding possible of the medical elements at issue in this case. The administration of justice would not be properly served if the Tribunal were to deprive itself of the comments of these two expert witnesses regarding Dr. Beltrami's testimony.\n[11] In this case, it is important for the Tribunal to benefit from the knowledge of the parties' experts in order to completely understand the specific medical factors at the heart of this litigation involving gender dysphoria, sexual identity disorder, transsexualism and transgenderism. On this point, it is important for the Tribunal to have the opinion of the respondent's experts in regard to Dr. Beltrami's testimony on these issues and on his assessment of the complainant, even more so because Dr. Beltrami qualified certain parts of his reports in his testimony.\n[12] The Tribunal must remind the parties that the experts that they have testify are meant to enlighten the Tribunal on specific points which are not matters of judicial notice. In principle, the experts are not there to support the argument advanced by the party that made it, but to provide the Tribunal with information that will enable it to make an enlightened decision on the issues submitted to it for adjudication.\n[13] In order for an expert that a party wants to have reheard to fully enlightened the Tribunal on technical or scientific issues at the heart of a litigation, the expert that the party wants to have reheard for a specific purpose must have heard or have knowledge of the testimony of the witness on which he or she is called to remark.\n[14] It appears from the comments made by the respondent's counsel at the hearing of October 26, 2007, that Dr. Assalian, even though he was not present during Dr. Beltrami's testimony during the week of October 22, 2007, nevertheless received the stenographer's transcript of Dr. Beltrami's testimony in this case. Dr. Assalian would therefore have knowledge of Dr. Beltrami's testimony in this proceeding.\n[15] In regard to Dr. Karmel, the Tribunal noted that he was present in the hearing room during Dr. Beltrami's examination by the Commission's counsel, namely on October 22, 23 and 24, 2007. Moreover, Dr. Karmel was able, during those three days, to benefit from an interpreter's services to facilitate his comprehension of Dr. Beltrami's testimony, as Dr. Beltrami had testified in French. However, Dr. Karmel was not present during the cross-examination of Dr. Beltrami on October 25 and 26, 2007.\n[16] Considering the complexity of the medical issues submitted to the Tribunal in this case, the Tribunal is of the opinion that it is important that Dr. Assalian and Dr Karmel be reheard for the sole purpose of commenting on Dr. Beltrami's testimony, in order to fully clarify the medical issues that the Tribunal is called to decide.\n[17] The Tribunal therefore authorizes that Dr. Assalian, psychiatrist, be called back as an expert witness for the sole purpose of commenting on the testimony given by Dr. Beltrami during the hearings held in the week of October 22, 2007, insofar that he can state that he read the transcript of Dr. Beltrami's testimony and that his testimony bears only on Dr. Beltrami's testimony.\n[18] The Tribunal also authorizes the rehearing of Dr. Karmel, psychologist, for the sole purpose of commenting on Dr. Beltrami's testimony regarding the administration and interpretation of the MMPI-2 test completed by the complainant. Dr. Karmel, who was not present for the hearing on October 25 and 26, 2007, will not be able to comment in any way on Dr. Beltrami's testimony during those two days.\n[19] The Tribunal is of the opinion that in this case there would be no prejudice caused to the Commission or to the complainant. The Commission is there to represent the public interest, as the Commission's counsel often pointed out. In principle, in a proceeding such as this one the Commission has no interest in having the Tribunal deprived of the clarification that could be provided by these experts who have been recognized as such by the Tribunal, regardless of the party that had them heard.\n[20] The Tribunal therefore authorizes the rehearing of Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel as experts in their respective fields of expertise for the sole purpose of commenting on Dr. Beltrami's testimony. The rehearing of these two witnesses will take place on November 5, 2007, beginning at 9:30 a.m. The Commission and the complainant will be able to cross-examine Dr. Assalian and Dr. Karmel, if need be.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA, Ontario October 29, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1047\/2805\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Micheline Montreuil v.

Hadjis\nDate: November 1, 2007\nCitation: 2007 CHRT 52\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has made a motion requesting an amendment of the style of cause in this proceeding. The complaint identifies the respondent simply as Drumsaremybeat and this designation has to this point been carried forward into the style of cause. The Commission is requesting that this name now be substituted with the names of two individuals, Heather Fleming and Ronald Fleming.\n[2] The Commission has also requested a direction from the Tribunal that the Complainant\u2019s identity not be publicly disclosed, even to the responding party.\n[3] The Tribunal\u2019s hearing on the two motions was conducted by videoconference on October 1, 2007. The Commission\u2019s counsel and the Complainant appeared at the hearing, but no one appeared or filed any written submissions on behalf of Drumsaremybeat.\n[4] The Tribunal had sent a notice to Mr. and Ms. Fleming informing them that they could appear at the hearing by presenting themselves at the Federal Court\u2019s videoconferencing facilities located in Edmonton, which is not far from their residence. Neither of them appeared at the hearing, which lasted over four hours in total. The Tribunal did not receive any communication from them explaining their failure to attend. They did not provide any written submissions regarding the Commission\u2019s motions either.\n[5] As a result, the Complainant and the Commission were the only parties to put evidence and submissions before the Tribunal on the motions.\nMotion to amend style of cause [6] The Complainant states in the complaint that from December 2004 to March 2005, he viewed a number of postings on an Internet bulletin board administered by AOL Canada (AOL), which he believes constitute hate messages, within the meaning of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The messages were posted by someone using Drumsaremybeat as his or her AOL username or pseudonym.\n[7] The Complainant did not know the true identity of the person making these postings when he filed the complaint on July 15, 2005. As a result, he identified the respondent merely as Drumsaremybeat. On February 6, 2006, AOL informed the Commission that according to its records, the AOL customer who was using Drumsaremybeat as a screen name in 2005 was Heather Fleming. AOL provided the Commission with an information sheet regarding Ms. Fleming\u2019s account, which included her postal address.\n[8] From then on, the Commission began to basically deal with the matter as if Ms. Fleming was the respondent. Thus, on March 6, 2006, the Commission investigator assigned to this case wrote a letter to Ms. Fleming advising her that the Commission had received a complaint from beachesboy@aol.com alleging that drumsaremybeat posted messages on an AOL bulletin board that discriminate against the Complainant and others on the basis of sexual orientation. The letter went on to state the following:\nAt this time, I would appreciate receiving by March 27, 2006, your position regarding the allegations, but not limited to, the following:\n(1) Are you drumsaremybeat?\n(2) Did you post the messages as alleged in the complaint form? If so what was the purpose of posting the messages?\n(3) What is the intent of the information\/documentation posted on the websites?\n(4) Who is your present Internet Service Provider (ISP)? Where is it located? Please provide a copy the agreement with your ISP. [sic]\nIf someone other than yourself will be representing you in this matter, please let us know at your earliest opportunity. Also, please be advised that you are required to preserve any material related to the complaint, including information in electronic formats, until the final disposition of the matter.\n(Emphasis added)\n[9] The Commission received a letter in response, dated March 15, 2006. Although the letter appeared to have been signed by H. Fleming its content suggested that someone else was its author. For instance, in the second paragraph, the writer wrote, This complaint is addressed to my wife as the phone in which I was on the ISP AOL at the said time of the offensive was in her name (sic throughout). The author then went on to state that at the time the alleged hate messages were posted, his computer was being controlled by a hacker without his consent. He added that no one at this address applies to that screen-name (i.e. Drumsaremybeat).\n[10] By early July 2006, the Commission investigator prepared the investigation report regarding the complaint. On the cover page of the report, the investigator identified Heather Fleming (a.k.a. Drumsaremybeat) as the respondent. The report states that Ms. Fleming confirmed to the investigator that she was the registered holder of the AOL account linked to the Drumsaremybeat username, but that it was her spouse who was in fact using the account. She told the investigator that she was inexperienced in handling computers and did not post any messages on the AOL message boards. She added that the written defence to the complaint that had been submitted to the Commission by Drumsaremybeat had been provided by Mr. Fleming. The report gave a summary of this defence including Mr. Fleming\u2019s claim that a hacker had used their AOL Account to post the impugned messages under the Drumsaremybeat username.\n[11] On July 10, 2006, the Commission sent a letter to Ms. Fleming informing her that:\nThe investigation into the complaint against you has been completed. A copy of the investigation report is enclosed for your review.\n(Emphasis added)\n[12] The Commission similarly sent a copy of the investigation report to the Complainant, who in turn opted to submit a reply in writing. On July 27, 2006, the Commission forwarded this reply to Ms. Fleming, stating in its accompanying letter that the Complainant\u2019s submissions were regarding the complaint filed by Beachesboy against you.\n[13] In October 2006, the Commission sent a letter addressed to Ms. Fleming advising her that the Commission had decided to refer the complaint of beachesboy@aol.com v. Drumsaremybeat to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[14] The Commission subsequently received a letter dated October 19, 2006, seemingly bearing the signatures of Ronald Fleming and H. Fleming. The letter ends with the following typewritten statement:\nYours pathetically in anger\nRonald L. Fleming\nCanadian Citizen\nThe letter reiterated the claim that Ms. Fleming had nothing to do with the AOL user account in question, and added:\nNow, if you wish to communicate with the person that is supposed to be responsible for this phoney human rights charge, then you will address this envelope and all other particulars to me and to me only!\nMr. Ronald Fleming at said address.\n[15] In its motion, the Commission maintains that the information garnered from AOL, as confirmed by Mr. and Ms. Fleming themselves, indicates that they were responsible for the AOL account with which the username Drumsaremybeat was associated.\n[16] The Commission claims that the complaint did not initially identify the AOL member who was using the screen name Drumsaremybeat because the member\u2019s identity was not known at that time. I note, however, that as of February 6, 2006, the Commission had learned of the AOL member\u2019s name (Ms. Fleming) and in the Commission investigator\u2019s report of July 2006, there was a finding that Mr. Fleming was using the AOL account.\n[17] Yet, despite having knowledge of this information, the Commission did not amend the complaint and opted to refer it to the Tribunal in its existing form. It was only after the complaint had been referred to the Tribunal that the Commission sought permission from the Tribunal to amend the style of cause, a merely technical formality, according to the Commission.\n[18] I disagree with this assertion. Amending the style of cause is not a mere technicality. Serious consequences may flow from such action. Persons who have hitherto not been involved in the human rights complaint may suddenly find themselves embroiled in a legal process that will bear significantly on them. They will have to expend time and resources contesting the complaint. If the complaint is ultimately found to be substantiated, remedial orders may be issued against them. These sorts of amendments are therefore not to be taken lightly.\n[19] Where circumstances warrant, the Tribunal has the authority to add new parties to a complaint, a procedure that is explicitly contemplated in s. 48.9(2)(b) of the Act and in Rule 8(3) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.

Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 CHRT 31 at para. 30 (Telus), the Tribunal noted that the addition of a new respondent once a complaint has been referred to the Tribunal is appropriate where the presence of the new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint and it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\n[20] This latter condition calls for particular attention in the present case. Was it not reasonably foreseeable, since at least February 2006, that Ms. Fleming should be named as a respondent? Was it not reasonably foreseeable, as of the date when the Commission released its investigation report, that Mr. Fleming should also be named?\n[21] The question of foreseeability relates largely, as I see it, to the potential prejudice to new respondents that may arise from the denial of the benefits that accrue to them during the Commission process that precedes the complaint\u2019s referral to the Tribunal (see Brown v. National Capital Commission, 2003 CHRT 43 at para. 46). These benefits include the possibility that the Commission will decide not to deal with the complaint (s. 41 of the Act), dismiss it (s. 44(3)(b)), or refer it to conciliation (s. 47) (see in this regard the Tribunal\u2019s oral decision in Desormeaux, cited in Telus at paras. 25-7). The Federal Court pointed out in Parent v. Canada, 2006 CF 1313, at paras. 40-1, that the question of prejudice to the respondent is the predominant factor to be considered by the Tribunal when ruling on amendments to complaints, though it should be noted that Parent dealt with the addition of factual allegations to a complaint, not new parties.\n[22] I am satisfied that in the present case, Mr. and Ms. Fleming would not be denied the benefits that would have accrued to them had they been named as respondents from the outset, in the complaint. The Commission has dealt with them as the actual respondents since well before the complaint was referred to the Tribunal. Correspondence with Ms. Fleming repeatedly referred to her (you) having been named in the complaint. More importantly, both she and Mr. Fleming responded to the allegations made against them. They were able to put their positions before the Commission, prior to the referral. Indeed, their defence submissions were summarized in detail in the Commission investigation report. They not only were given the opportunity to respond to the allegations made, but they in fact exercised their right to do so.\n[23] I also find that the second component of the test set out in Telus has been met. The involvement of Mr. and Ms. Fleming is necessary to dispose of the complaint, if only because an Internet username is not likely recognizable as a person who can participate in a hearing and be held accountable for compliance with any final order. Without their presence, there is effectively no respondent to the complaint and thus, no dispute before the Tribunal. If, as the Commission alleges, Mr. and Ms. Fleming were the individuals who held the AOL account associated with the Drumsaremybeat username, they can be held accountable.\n[24] In the circumstances, I find that it is appropriate for the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to allow the change being sought by the Commission and, in effect, add two party respondents and remove another. As such, it is perhaps more correct to frame the Commission\u2019s motion as a request to add parties rather than a motion to amend the complaint. It is unfortunate that the parties were not added to the complaint prior to its referral to the Tribunal, which would have obviated the need for the present motion.\n[25] I therefore order that Ronald Fleming and Heather Fleming be added as respondents in this case, in substitution of Drumsaremybeat. I also direct that the style of cause associated with this complaint be amended to show Mr. and Ms. Fleming as the sole respondents.\nMotion regarding disclosure of the Complainant\u2019s identity [26] On the complaint form filed with the Commission on July 15, 2005, the Complainant did not disclose his real name. Instead, he signed the document as beachesboy@aol.com followed by an explanation that his name and contact information had been provided separately to the Commission, but withheld from publication for safety reasons. In its subsequent dealings with the complaint, the Commission acceded to this request and never divulged the Complainant\u2019s name and contact information to Mr. and Ms. Fleming.\n[27] When the complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, the Commission provided the Tribunal with the Complainant\u2019s name and contact information. However, the Commission also requested that these details not be revealed publicly, citing safety concerns. The Tribunal has, accordingly, to this date, not disclosed the Complainant\u2019s name and contact information to Mr. and Ms. Fleming, nor anyone else.\n[28] It bears repeating, at this point, that nobody appeared at the hearing to contest the Commission\u2019s motion for a direction from the Tribunal that this practice be maintained indefinitely.\n[29] In support of its motion, the Commission has highlighted some of the messages referred to in the complaint. These consist of postings made by someone using the pseudonym Drumsaremybeat on AOL\u2019s on-line bulletin board. These messages, if genuine, appear to contain expressions of aggression and violence directed against homosexuals generally and beachesboy@aol.com personally. The Complainant is not named specifically since he never revealed his true identity on the bulletin board, and only participated using his username. The messages rely on some fairly vulgar language to depict the harm and violence that the author of the messages would wish upon beachesboy@aol.com and all homosexual persons. The messages\u2019 author laments that homosexuals are not executed anymore in Canada and he or she proudly recounts an incident where a friend punched a gay man on an Edmonton street.\n[30] All of these messages, however, were posted in late 2004 or early 2005. No evidence of any subsequent statements of a similar nature was presented to me. Moreover, these AOL bulletin board messages were posted by someone using a pseudonym (Drumsaremybeat), and at this point, it has merely been alleged that the person(s) responsible for posting the messages are Mr. and\/or Ms. Fleming. This has yet to be proven. Since the filing of the human rights complaint, Mr. and Ms. Fleming have sent a number of letters to the Complainant, the Commission and the Tribunal, some of which I alluded to earlier in this ruling. While these letters express anger with regard to what are claimed to be wrongful accusations in the complaint, they do not contain any threats or expressions of violence.\n[31] The Complainant has pointed out that he has filed several more s. 13 complaints against other individuals. A number of these complaints have already been referred to the Tribunal. The Complainant claims that on at least one occasion in the past, when some statements by him condemning discriminatory conduct were reported in the media, he received a number of threats at his home.\n[32] In my view, given the violent language used in the messages referred to in the complaint, some of which targets the Complainant, and the Complainant\u2019s general concerns regarding the public disclosure of his identity, coupled with the fact that the Commission\u2019s motion was not contested, I see no reason to modify the approach that has been adopted in this case thus far. However, once the case reaches the hearing stage, maintaining this approach will pose certain challenges. For instance, how will the Complainant be able to give testimony if he does not reveal his actual name when taking his oath or making his solemn affirmation? If the complaint is ultimately found to be substantiated and the Complainant seeks a personal remedy to which the Tribunal believes he is entitled, the Tribunal may have some difficulty drafting an order in favour of an unidentified victim.\n[33] Mindful of these concerns, I direct nonetheless that the practice followed by the Tribunal Registry to this date be maintained until the opening of the hearing on the complaint (i.e. that the Complainant be publicly identified as beachesboy@aol.com and that his contact information not be disclosed to anyone, including the respondents in this case). The matter may thereafter be addressed by the member assigned to inquire into the complaint.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Conclusion\nI. Introduction [1] On August 23, 2004, Micheline Montreuil filed a complaint in accordance with the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S. 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA), against the Canadian Forces Grievance Board (the Board). The complainant alleges that the Board discriminated against her on the basis of sex (transgender) and ethnic origin (language) contrary to sections 3 and 7 of the Act.\n[2] During a pre-hearing teleconference held on April 7, 2006, with the case manager of this matter, the Tribunal Vice-Chairperson, Athanasios D. Hadjis, the complainant stated that the complaint would involve only discrimination on the basis of sex and that she would not pursue her complaint of discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin. According to the minutes of this teleconference, the complainant undertook to provide a letter to the Tribunal confirming this undertaking. This letter was never provided.\n[3] There is no doubt that the complainant, who is also counsel, made an undertaking. There is no reason to believe that she would now want to withdraw it. Indeed, throughout the hearing she insisted on pointing out that the argument based on language only served to support her complaint based on sex. She alleged, in fact, that the language ground had only been a pretext for not giving her the desired position based on her sex. Under these circumstances, this decision will address only the discrimination complaint based on sex. However, the complainant\u2019s arguments are such that I will have no choice but to address in my reasons the aspect of her argument based on language.\nA. The Parties (i) The complainant [4] Micheline Montreuil is a lawyer by profession. In addition to her law degree, she has university degrees in industrial relations and in administration. She also recently obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in education and is studying for her master\u2019s degree in ethics. She has been a member of the Quebec Bar since 1976. Since her admission to the Bar, she practised law and also taught at two colleges in Qu\u00e9bec, namely Limoilou College and Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau College. She also gave courses at the Universit\u00e9 Laval, and at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi and in Rimouski.\n[5] When she talks about discrimination on the basis of sex, Ms. Montreuil refers to certain characteristics tied to gender identity or appearance which are such that she does not find herself, in her own words, in a situation [Translation] that could be described as ordinary. Between what she describes as [Translation] a normal man or woman there is the transsexual or transgendered realm. Within that realm, she identifies three large groups. There are transvestites, who are individuals who dress completely or partially in accessories or clothing of the other sex. However, she states that this choice is only temporary and that the transvestite returns to the clothing of his or her sex after a certain period of time. At the other end of the spectrum is the transsexual group. The choice of individuals in this group is to completely change their sex through surgical operations. Between the transvestites and the transsexuals, Ms. Montreuil identifies the transgendered, i.e. individuals who, like her, choose to live in the clothing of the other sex all of the time. Persons from this group may also opt for certain minor surgical operations to change certain aspects of their appearance, but they will not undergo a complete surgical transformation.\n[6] From the outset, the Board\u2019s counsel conceded that Ms. Montreuil\u2019s [Translation] particular condition was not at issue and that she could therefore allege that she had been discriminated against on the basis of sex under section 3 of the Act because of this particular condition.\n[7] At the time of the hearing, Ms. Montreuil was working as a part-time lecturer in the bachelor of nursing sciences program at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec in Rimouski, where she gave courses in ethics and legal liability. She also worked as a legal researcher at the Conseil de la justice administrative du Qu\u00e9bec, in Qu\u00e9bec. Her employment at the Conseil de la justice administrative was supposed to end on April 27, 2007. She also adds that she continues to practise law.\n(ii) The Canadian Forces Grievance Board [8] The Canadian Forces Grievance Board has at this time about 50 employees. It also has six members, including the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson who both work full-time. The other four members are part-time.\n[9] The Board was established during the military justice reform initiated when in 1995 the Doshen report (A Report on the Study of Mechanisms of Voice\/Complaint Resolution in the Canadian Armed Forces) was filed regarding the resolution of grievances within the armed forces. In 1997, two events reinforced this idea for reform. First, the Minister of Defence filed a report on leadership and management of the Canadian Forces (Report to the Prime Minister on Leadership and Management of the Canadian Forces) and then the findings of the Somalia Inquiry Report were published reiterating the need to change the military justice system.\n[10] Further to these different reports, the federal government decided that the National Defence Act should be amended to modernize and reinforce the military justice system, which included simplifying the grievance process in the Canadian Forces. The Board, an independent administrative tribunal, was created on March 1, 2002.\n[11] The Grievance Board is responsible for examining military grievances filed by members of the Canadian Forces, in accordance with section 29 of the National Defence Act. Inter alia, it examines grievances sent to it by the Chief of Defence Staff. To be more precise, the Chief of Staff send the Board grievances related to the \u2026 administrative action resulting in the forfeiture of, or deductions from, pay and allowances, reversion to a lower rank or release from the Canadian Forces of a member, whether it be for medical or behavioural reasons. The Board also examines grievances regarding the application or interpretation of Canadian Forces policies relating to expression of personal opinions \u2026 conflict of interest and post-employment compliance measures, harassment or racist conduct. (See \u2013 Chapter 7.12 of the Queen\u2019s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces.)\n[12] After the grievances have been considered, the Board submits impartial and fair recommendations to the Chief of Staff and to the complainant.\n[13] In order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate, the Board created grievance officer positions. The main duties of a grievance officer are reviewing the records, investigating and taking part in the drafting of the findings and recommendations of the Board to the Chief of Defence Staff. The grievance officer also acts as a specialist with the personnel and Board members.\nB. Legal Framework [14] Section 7 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination, including inter alia sex or national or ethnic origin. (See also sections 3 and 15 of the CHRA.)\n[15] The burden of proof in a matter like this one is first on the complainant, who must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. (See: Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, at 1618; Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; and Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04).\n[16] A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a finding in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of a response from the respondent. (Ontario (Ontario Human Rights Commission) v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at page 208; Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28).\n[17] The issue is therefore whether there is evidence establishing on a balance of probabilities that the complainant had been discriminated against. In this case, we need not dwell on whether Ms. Montreuil has a distinguishing trait or traits of a group against which discrimination is prohibited under the CHRA on the basis of sex since the respondent has not contested it and admits that discrimination based on transgender is deemed to be on the basis of sex.\n[18] In the employment context, a prima facie case is described as requiring evidence of the following elements:\nThe complainant was qualified for the employment at issue; The complainant was not hired; Someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature, which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint, subsequently obtained the position.\n(See: Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, at paragraph 8918.)\n[19] This approach was changed in order to accommodate situations where the complainant is not hired and where the respondent continues to look for a suitable candidate. In that case, the following factors must be present to establish a prima facie case:\nThe complainant belongs to one of the designated groups under the Act;\nThe complainant applied and was qualified for a job that the employer wished to fill;\nAlthough qualified, the complainant was rejected;\nThereafter, the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant\u2019s qualifications.\n(See: Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, at page 1618.)\n[20] In Montreuil v. National Bank of Canada, 2004 CHRT 7, at paragraph 44, the Tribunal considered the differences between these two approaches. It determined that the approach in Shakes applies to cases where the complainant is competing with other candidates for a specific position. The Tribunal adds that it does not appear that it can apply to ongoing recruitment situations, given that irrespective of whether the persons hired at a given moment lack the distinguishing feature of the complainant, other employment positions into which the complainant could potentially be hired continue to remain available. However, it explains that the Israeli approach, given its fourth factor, applies to situations where the employer continues to search for applicants.\n[21] In this case, the evidence is not as clear as it was in Montreuil v. National Bank. Ms. Montreuil applied for a specific position. We could therefore be led to determine that the approach in Shakes ought to be applied. However, the respondent will respond that it did not reject the application because it kept the complainant on an eligibility list for a unilingual French grievance officer position for a period well beyond the one established to fill the position for which Ms. Montreuil had applied. Moreover, given the almost continuous turnover of Board personnel, it continued to seek applicants for grievance officer positions and kept the complainant on an active eligibility list. It is clear that neither one of the approaches in Shakes or Israeli specifically addresses the dilemma before us. However, I do not think it necessary to choose between these two approaches.\n[22] In Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, the Tribunal stated that the tests in Shakes and Israeli are useful guides, but that neither test should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion. Rather, the circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate. Ultimately, the question will be whether the complainant has satisfied the O\u2019Malley test, that is: if believed, is the evidence before the Tribunal complete and sufficient to justify a finding in the complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent? We will therefore apply this flexible approach to this case by combining the two approaches if necessary and by reformulating the tests to apply if the need arises.\n[23] Once this prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the respondent, who must provide a reasonable explanation of the alleged conduct.\n[24] The case law recognizes the difficulty of proving allegations of discrimination by direct evidence. The discrimination is frequently practised in a very subtle manner. Overt discrimination is rare. (See Basi, supra, paragraph D\/5038.) Rather, it is the Tribunal\u2019s task to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there is what is described in the Basi case as the subtle scent of discrimination. (Premakumar, paragraph 79.)\n[25] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses. (Premakumar, paragraph 81.) However, discriminatory considerations need not be the sole reason for the practices at issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if these considerations are factors in the decision not to hire. (Premakumar, paragraph 82, Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at paragraph D\/15.)\n[26] In fact, evidence of discrimination has inherent problems. The most significant is, without question, the fact that similar circumstances may be interpreted differently. If the discrimination is based on differentiation, the problem is that this differentiation does not exist independently of the parties\u2019 actions. It must be inferred. It follows that the Tribunal member called to decide the issue must use his or her judgment in assessing the circumstances giving rise to the allegations of discrimination.\nC. Analysis (i) The prima facie case (a) Does the complainant have the skills or qualifications necessary to fill the position? [27] The role of a senior grievance officer is, inter alia, to provide opinions and legal advice to the members of the Board regarding the grievances referred to them by the Chief of Defence Staff. To fill the grievance officer positions, the Board first held an internal competition in February 2002.\n[28] In April 2002, a second competition was launched which was open to the general public. The Board at that time advertised 10 grievance officer positions of a determinate term of twelve months or more. According to the advertisement, applicants had to have a university degree in human resources, law or industrial or labour relations. The advertisement also set out a series of required skills and provided that the majority of positions were bilingual imperative CCC, but that [Translation] some are unilingual English or French.\n[29] On May 6, 2002, Ms. Montreuil applied for one of the positions advertised in the competition of April 2002. She also sent her Public Service Commission of Canada English language exam results, which she had written on February 9, 2000. Her proficiency level was E (Exempt), with a score of 63 of 65 in written comprehension, and in written expression her proficiency level was B, with a score of 43. A score of 44 is required for a proficiency level of C. In oral interaction, the complainant had a proficiency level of C. Linguistically, the complainant was therefore evaluated ECB. On November 26, 2002, Ms. Montreuil rewrote the English Second Language written expression exam in order to improve her standing in that category. In fact, there was nothing to prevent Ms. Montreuil from continuing to improve her skills in written expression in English and to redo the Public Service language proficiency exams as often as she wished. Following this new exam, the complainant\u2019s proficiency level in English written comprehension remained unchanged at B.\n[30] On August 20, 2002, Ms. Montreuil was asked to report to Valcartier military base to take a written exam. On October 31, 2002, she was told that she had passed her exam and that she would be [Translation] soon called to an interview by the Selection Board.\n[31] On November 15, 2002, the complainant was interviewed in Ottawa by Diane Laurin, Mireille Royer, then Human Resources Advisor, and Gary Wetzel, the Board\u2019s in-house counsel. Diane Laurin was at that time the Board\u2019s Vice-Chairperson. She became Chairperson in February 2004.\n[32] According to a letter dated July 14, 2005, written by Jacques Shore, from the law firm Gowling Lafleur Henderson, the respondent\u2019s counsel at that time, it would appear that Ms. Laurin took notes during Ms. Montreuil\u2019s interview. We can presume that the other members of the Board also took notes during the interview. These notes were not produced at the hearing. These notes are often indicative of the state of mind of the interview participants as indicated in the decisions of this Tribunal in Kasongo v. Farm Credit Canada, 2005 CHRT 24 and Montreuil v. National Bank, supra. Unfortunately, we will not have the benefits of the notes in this case.\n[33] According to Ms. Laurin\u2019s testimony, the interview with Ms. Montreuil went well. She added that the atmosphere was comparable to the atmosphere of the interviews with the other applicants. During this interview, Ms. Laurin met Ms. Montreuil for the first time, but she knew who she was because she had heard about her in the media. She was aware that she was transgendered and that she had [Translation] struggled before several courts of justice to assert her rights. Ms. Laurin pointed out that Ms. Royer had also been aware of the fact that the candidate was transgendered. It is possible, in her opinion, that Mr. Wetzel had not been aware of this and she therefore thought it best to tell him before the interview began. She added that the Selection Board had discussed this candidate beforehand as it had done with respect to all the other candidates. Ms. Laurin stated that the Selection Board found Ms. Montreuil\u2019s curriculum vitae [Translation] interesting. She added that the interview results indicate that the complainant [Translation] did very well. Indeed, according to the interview results, the complainant placed third of the four candidates. On cross-examination, Ms. Laurin added that the three other candidates, unilingual Anglophones, had all been hired by the Board.\n[34] Ms. Laurin explained that at the interview the candidates were evaluated according to certain criteria i.e.: knowledge, ability, competencies and personal attributes. Knowledge was established by a series of predetermined questions addressed to all of the candidates. Ability and competencies were assessed based on the individual\u2019s curriculum vitae. Finally, personal attributes were examined at the interview and based on the references provided by the candidate. The candidate\u2019s language capabilities or abilities were not evaluated or considered at the interview. Ms. Laurin added that if a candidate wanted to qualify for a bilingual position, the candidate must then comply with the language requirements of the Public Service Commission.\n[35] On December 30, 2002, Ms. Montreuil received a letter from Mireille Royer, human resources consultant for the Board, who informed her that the members of the Selection Board had completed the evaluation of the candidates and that she had qualified in the competition.\n[36] Considering these facts, I find that Ms. Montreuil had the necessary competencies or qualifications to work as a grievance officer. According to Mireille Royer\u2019s letter, which we referred to above, she was qualified for the position in the context of the competition.\n(b) Was the complainant\u2019s application rejected? [37] Ms. Royer\u2019s letter, referred to above, also states that Ms. Montreuil, being qualified for the competition, then had her name place on an eligibility list which had to be used to staff positions that became vacant between then and March 30, 2003. The letter refers to [Translation] attached eligibility lists, yet these lists were not filed at the hearing.\n[38] In the months after this letter was received, Ms. Montreuil contacted the Board several times to find out when it would be hiring grievance officers. She was told that the Board was waiting for its budget to be increased before proceeding to hire new employees. Ms. Montreuil did not at all question the truthfulness of this statement since, as she admitted at the hearing, the other candidates also had to wait for the budget to be confirmed before they were offered employment.\n[39] Ms. Montreuil then had a series of conversations with an individual by the name of Pierre Lacasse, an employee of the Board, who provided her with certain information about the processing of her application for the grievance officer position. Mr. Lacasse was not called to testify. Throughout the hearing, Ms. Montreuil referred to the information that she received from Mr. Lacasse or from the interview that he had with the investigator from the Human Rights Commission. This evidence is hearsay and the issue was promptly raised regarding its admissibility.\n[40] The courts have generally refused to adopt a single, exhaustive definition of the hearsay rule. They fear that such a definition will not cover all of the cases where an out-of-court statement will involve one or more of the traditional hearsay dangers, i.e. the absence of sworn testimony, the lack of an opportunity for the opposing party to cross-examine the witness and the lack of opportunity for the tribunal to assess the witness\u2019 credibility. In this case, there are several, if not all, of these dangers. Even though the Tribunal is, as a general rule, flexible enough in its treatment of hearsay evidence (see, for example, paragraph 50(3)(c) of the CHRA), the fact remains that in this case there is no valid reason to explain Mr. Lacasse\u2019s absence, other than the complainant\u2019s undertaking not to call him as a witness. In these circumstances it would be inconsistent with the principles of natural justice, codified in subsections 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the CHRA, and unfair to admit this evidence. I will therefore not consider it in my decision.\n[41] In September 2003, the Board, at the request of the Minister of National Defence, developed an operational plan in order to clear a backlog of about 349 grievances by December 2004. Of these, 70 (20%) were in French. In order to achieve this mandate, the Board was given additional resources.\n[42] At the end of October 2003, almost one year after the interview, Ms. Montreuil again contacted the Board to ask whether it had proceeded to hire new grievance officers. She was told that the Board had hired three unilingual English grievance officers, two of whom had already assumed their positions and a third who was to begin the following week. The complainant then asked whether the respondent would be hiring other individuals in the near future. She was told it would not.\n[43] On November 10, 2003, Ms. Montreuil wrote to Ms. Laurin requesting certain particulars about the hiring of grievance officers. She wanted to know, inter alia, how many Anglophone, Francophone and bilingual grievance officers had been hired by the Board. She also asked how many files the Board had to process. The letter was never answered.\n[44] On December 12, 2003, she once again asked Ms. Laurin to reply to her letter dated November 10. On December 18, 2003, Muriel Korngold-Wexler, Director of the Board\u2019s Grievance Analysis and Operations division, responded to Ms. Montreuil. Ms. Korngold-Wexler explained that in September 2003, following an agreement with the Department of Defence, the Board implemented an operational plan in order to clear the backlog of grievances before December 31, 2004. She added that the Board had, in this context, examined its operational needs in depth. She stated that, given the number of grievances in English, the Board had offered positions to candidates who were place on the English only eligibility list, as well as those on the bilingual eligibility list.\n[45] She informed Ms. Montreuil that the Board did not have any operational need for unilingual French grievance officers. She pointed out however that the Board had extended the eligibility list for grievance officer positions to March 2004 and she assured Ms. Montreuil that she would call on her services if the Board should need a unilingual French grievance officer. Indeed, I am wondering why the Board decided to extend this eligibility list when it seemed clear, according to Ms. Korngold-Wexler\u2019s explanations, that the Board would never need a unilingual French grievance officer since there were enough bilingual officers to handle this task.\n[46] On January 18, 2004, Ms. Montreuil asked Ms. Korngold-Wexler to provide her with more details about the linguistic distribution of the bilingual grievance officers. In response to this request, Ms. Korngold-Wexler pointed out that between September 1 and December 18, 2003, the Board hired a total of nine (9) grievance officers distributed as follows: one unilingual English grievance officer for an indeterminate term, three unilingual English grievance officers in specified term positions, one unilingual English officer in the Exchanges Canada program, two unilingual grievance officers in temporary employment and two bilingual grievance officers in secondment. On December 18, 2003, the Board had fifteen (15) grievance officers working for it, six of whom were bilingual at the CCC level and nine unilingual English. Finally, Ms. Korngold-Wexler stated, once again, that if there were an increase in files to be processed in French and the Board saw the need to hire a unilingual French grievance officer, then they would use the unilingual French eligibility list on which Ms. Montreuil was the only candidate. She also stated that the Board had extended this eligibility list to December 2004.\n[47] From this information, the complainant drew certain conclusions. She contended that the Board could hire a unilingual Anglophone, but that the only unilingual Francophone applicant will not be hired. She added that the only characteristic differentiating the unilingual Francophone applicant in this case is that she is transgendered. In her opinion, language was not the cause of the discrimination that she alleged to have suffered but rather the pretext for hiding the discrimination. She argued that the discrimination was based on sex and that the language was just a [Translation] cover.\n[48] Later in the summer of 2004, the complainant asked Ms. Korngold-Wexler to give her details about the linguistic distribution of the grievance officers still working and the validity of the eligibility list.\n[49] On July 20, 2004, she received the following information. She was informed that on June 6, 2004, the respondent had 13 grievance officers, seven of whom were unilingual English and six bilingual at the CCC level. It was also added that the respondent went from 15 grievance officers in December 2003 to 13 grievance officers in June 2004 and that, accordingly, an internal Public Service competition was in progress in order to establish the admissibility lists for staffing the respondent\u2019s needs for the coming two years. With respect to the eligibility list for unilingual French candidates, the complainant was still the only one on that list. The letter stated that this list would be used [Translation] in the event that the volume of files to be processed in French were to increase considerably and that there were not enough bilingual agents to handle inter alia these files. [Emphasis added.] Ms. Korngold\u2013Wexler did not explain what she understands to be a considerable increase of files to process in French.\n[50] In light of this evidence, we can find that Ms. Montreuil\u2019s application was never rejected. In fact, the respondent\u2019s witnesses all stated that she had been placed on an eligibility list, which was extended twice and which finally expired in December 2004. Further, she was told that if the number of French files were to increase considerably, the Board would not hesitate to call on her services. Yet, this was infeasible because based on the admissions of the respondent\u2019s own witnesses, there were not enough French files at the Board for a unilingual Francophone position and that in any event the bilingual grievance officers could handle those files.\n[51] Hence, by placing Ms. Montreuil on an eligibility list for which there was never any need, the Board in effect rejected her application because it was imposing a condition that was impossible to fulfil, i.e. that there be such an increase in files to process in French that there would no longer be enough bilingual agents to get the work done. Yet, even if the number of French files were to increase, the Board could always increase the number of bilingual officers, making it useless to hire a unilingual French grievance officer.\n(c) Were the candidates hired in response to the competition and thereafter more qualified than the complainant? [52] The only evidence regarding the competence of the other candidates was the interview indicating that Ms. Montreuil was ranked third of the four candidates. The three other candidates, unilingual Anglophones, were all hired. There is nothing to suggest that the candidates hired were more qualified than Ms. Montreuil to work as grievance officers.\n(d) Was there a prima facie case? [53] I find from the preceding evidence that the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination. The burden is now on the Board to provide a reasonable explanation for the alleged conduct.\n(ii) The respondent\u2019s explanation [54] The explanation given by the Board for refusing Ms. Montreuil\u2019s application was that it did not have any operational need for a unilingual French grievance officer and that in any event, its bilingual grievance officers could handle the processing of the French language files. Yet, as we already stated, the advertisement for the competition for which Ms. Montreuil applied indicated that the majority of the positions were bilingual imperative CCC but that some are unilingual English or French. [Emphasis added.] Why then advertise that certain positions would be unilingual French if the Board was of the opinion that there were not enough French language files to warrant hiring a grievance officer with this profile? I am not persuaded or satisfied by the responses to this question provided by the Board\u2019s witnesses.\n[55] We should note that in her letter dated December 18, 2003, which we referred to earlier, Ms. Korngold-Wexler states: [Translation] The Board cannot predict the number of grievances that it will have to address in 2004. However, according to our data from the last two years, of the 226 files completed in 2002 and 2003 to date, 89% were in English and 11% were in French. She adds [Translation] the Board addresses on average 100 to 126 grievances per year and that it has in place [Translation] five bilingual grievance officers at the CCC level (whose mother tongue is French) who also handle the French files. It is indeed in anticipation of these needs that we have hired a certain number of bilingual officers, who will be called on to work in both languages. I do not see how this explanation justifies the Board\u2019s decision.\n[56] For the purposes of the hearing, Ms. Korngold-Wexler prepared a table indicating the number of grievances handled by the Board between 2000 and 2007. According to this table, for the years 2002 (205 grievances) and 2003 (146 grievances), the Board received a total of 351 grievances, 287 (81%) of them in English, and 64 (18%) in French. I note that these figures do not correspond with those provided in her letter dated December 1, 2003. In any event, the explanation given by Ms. Korngold-Wexler to explain why the Board does not need bilingual grievance officers is far from convincing. Taken to the extreme, this logic could also be interpreted to mean that unilingual English grievance officers need not be hired since by increasing the number of bilingual grievance officers, they could deal with all of the English and French files. And yet, the Board did not hesitate to hire unilingual Anglophone grievance officers.\n[57] I also note that no evidence was filed to explain what number of files in French would be necessary for there to be an operational need to justify hiring a unilingual Francophone grievance officer, apart from the fact that hiring a French grievance officer cannot be justified when 18% of the files are in French.\n[58] According to Ms. Korngold-Wexler\u2019s table, in 2002 the Board received 205 grievances, of which 173 (84.4%) were in English and 32 (15.6%) were in French. In 2003, it received 146 grievances, of which 114 (78.1%) were in English and 32 (21.9%) were in French. In 2004, the Board received 102 grievances, of which 82 (80.4%) were in English and 20 (19.6%) were in French. In 2005, the Board received 80 grievances of which 52 (65%) were in English and 28 (35%) were in French. In 2006, there were 63 grievances, of which 51 (81%) were in English and 12 (19%) were in French.\n[59] Even at 35%, the Board considered that it did not have the operational need for a unilingual French grievance officer. Based on this evidence, I must find that the Board will never need a unilingual French grievance officer, unless there is an exceptional change in the linguistic composition of the files. But then why place Ms. Montreuil on an eligibility list that will never be required?\n[60] To justify its decision, the Board also relied on the Policy on the Staffing of Bilingual Positions issued by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat which provides for imperative staffing of specified term positions, meaning that only those candidates who meet the language requirements of the position at the time of appointment can be accepted. (See: Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, Policy on the Staffing of Bilingual Positions \u2013 Archived version of 2001.) Even though this Policy explains why Ms. Montreuil could not get one of the bilingual positions, it does not explain why the Board decided not to create a unilingual Francophone position.\n[61] I must point out however that this decision does not involve determining whether the Board refused to hire Ms. Montreuil because she was Francophone, but rather whether the Board refused to hire her because she was transgendered, using her language profile as a pretext. I am aware that it is not the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to determine whether a federal institution considered the official language requirements necessary when staffing a position. In fact, according to section 91 of the Official Languages Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 31(4th Supp.), nothing in Part IV or V of this Act authorizes the application of official language requirements to a particular staffing action unless those requirements are objectively required to perform the functions for which the staffing action is undertaken. The official language requirements cannot therefore be imposed frivolously or arbitrarily (See: Canada (A.G.) v. Viola, [1991] 1 F.C. 373 (C.A.)), but only based on each situation. (Professional Institute of the Public Service v. Canada, [1993] 2 F.C. 90.) Under section 91, the government is not necessarily justified in requiring that candidates be bilingual for a given position. This is the case in particular when the employer has not relied on the objective requirements determined by the Treasury Board and when the staffing file has no reason to justify such a requirement. (Rogers v. Canada (Correctional Service), [2001] 2 F.C. 586 (T.D.); See also R. Leckey and E. Didier, Le droit linguistique priv\u00e9 in Les droits linguistiques au Canada (2i\u00e8me \u00e9d.), under the direction of Michel Bastarache, \u00c9ditions Yvon Blais, page 537.)\n[62] Even though there are specific remedies provided under Part X of the Official Languages Act, in order to determine whether the institution in its staffing action breached its obligations under this Act, this does not in any way strip the Tribunal of its authority to determine whether a language requirement, even if objectively justified, is simultaneously discriminatory. The Tribunal is not exceeding its mandate when it asks whether a language requirement for staffing, as is the case here, is only a pretext for discrimination within the meaning of the CHRA. The fact that an activity is subject to sectorial oversight and regulation, in this case the Official Languages Act, does not preclude the application of the CHRA. (See inter alia subsection 82(2) of the Official Languages Act, which specifically states that it does not prevail over the CHRA.)\n[63] Therefore, in Vlug v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. 404, at paragraphs 30 to 32, the Tribunal determined that the decisions issued by the CRTC regarding closed captioning were not determinative in regard to the obligation to close-caption under the CHRA. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these two legal criteria are different.\n[64] Similarly, Mr. Justice Rothstein (as he then was) writes in Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569:\nCounsel for the Attorney General argues that the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-33, establishes a scheme whereby promotions are to be based on merit. He says the scheme for promotion is elaborately set forth in the Public Service Employment Act and that this cannot be overruled by a Human Rights Tribunal. He says the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is limited to referring the matter back to Correctional Service Canada, in order for it to request an exclusion under section 41 of the Public Service Employment Act, making a declaration that Dr. Uzoaba was entitled to a WP-5 position or perhaps ordering that Dr. Uzoaba be entitled to compete for a WP-5 position.\n\u2026\nI think the principle of paramountcy must apply in this case to enable a Human Rights Tribunal to order a promotion which it has found has been denied for reasons of discrimination, contrary to the Act. In other words, the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and the process respecting promotions within the Public Service must give way in those rare exceptions where promotions have been denied based on discriminatory reasons and where a Tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction under the Act, orders a promotion in order to remedy the results of discriminatory action taken by the employer. In this respect, I adopt the approach of Dickson J., as he then was, in Kelso v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 199 where he stated at page 207:\nNo one is challenging the general right of the Government to allocate resources and manpower as it sees fit. But this right is not unlimited. It must be exercised according to law. The government\u2019s right to allocate resources cannot override a statute such as the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 1976-77, c. 33, or a regulation such as the Exclusion Order.\n[65] The same principles apply in this case. Even though there may be recourse under the Official Languages Act, this does not strip the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to address the issue of discrimination if need be.\n[66] I would also point out that the intention to discriminate is not a prerequisite condition to a finding of discrimination. In Ontario Human Rights Commission and Theresa O\u2019Malley v. Simpson\u2011Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, Mr. Justice McIntyre states at pages 549\u2011550:\n. . . [to] hold that intent is a required element of discrimination under the Code [Ontario Human Rights Code] would seem to me to place a virtually insuperable barrier in the way of a complainant seeking a remedy. . . It is my view that the courts below were in error in finding an intent to discriminate to be a necessary element of proof.\n[67] Therefore, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the Board members intended to discriminate against Ms. Montreuil. Indeed, discrimination is often invisible. Individuals who discriminate often are not aware of what they are doing. This does not mean, however, that others are not aware of it. Hence, taking into account all of the circumstances, is it possible that there is a subtle scent of discrimination in this case, as described in Basi, supra?\n[68] To arrive at my finding, I reviewed the entire situation by proceeding with a careful, in-depth review of the evidence filed by both parties. I objectively considered Ms. Montreuil\u2019s arguments and those of the Board. The evidence and the arguments submitted to me by the Board did not persuade me that there was not a subtle scent of discrimination in the decision not to offer a grievance officer position to Ms. Montreuil.\n[69] Even though the Board\u2019s witnesses claimed that Ms. Montreuil\u2019s transgenderism did not have any effect on the decision not to hire her, the evidence and the explanations that they gave to support their arguments did not persuade me. Was it reasonable to say that there was not enough work in French at the Board to occupy even a single unilingual Francophone grievance officer when the French workload was almost 18%? Throughout the hearing, there was no satisfactory response to this question. Simply saying that bilingual officers could handle the French files if needed is not a satisfactory answer. As I already stated, the same logic could be applied to justify having fewer unilingual Anglophone officers.\n[70] Similarly, there is no evidence to support the argument that the bilingual officers were all Francophone and that designating a unilingual French position would restrict their right to work in French.\n[71] Finally, one fact stands out when we look at the evidence as a whole. Ms. Montreuil had one characteristic that the other grievance officers did not have: she was transgendered. As I already stated, the standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, I have to find that there is evidence that the Board discriminated. I have to find that the evidence renders this conclusion more probable than any other possible conclusion or hypothesis. Even though it is possible that the discriminatory reasons were not the only reasons for the decision not to hire Ms. Montreuil, that is not enough when discriminatory considerations are also factors in the decision not to hire.\n[72] The Board was not able to provide a reasonable explanation justifying its decision not to hire Ms. Montreuil for a grievance officer position and for these reasons, I find that there is a subtle scent of discrimination. I therefore find that the Board discriminated against Ms. Montreuil on the basis of sex (transgender) contrary to sections 3 and 7 of the CHRA.\nD. The Remedies Sought by Micheline Montreuil [73] Having determined that the Board discriminated against Ms. Montreuil, I must now address the issue of remedies. As remedies, Ms. Montreuil is claiming:\nan order pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the CHRA for loss of salary; an order for compensation for pain and suffering pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA; an order pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the CHRA; interest pursuant to subsection 53(4) of the CHRA.\n(i) Claim for loss of salary [74] Ms. Montreuil is seeking an order from the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the CHRA for the Board to pay her salary and benefits that she would have received had she been hired November 1, 2003, until February 28, 2006. She is also seeking an amount for future damages for the period between March 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.\n[75] First, I would point out that no evidence was filed with the Tribunal to support the claim for future damages and that this claim is therefore dismissed.\n[76] According to the advertisement of the competition, the position for which Ms. Montreuil applied was for a term of 12 months or more, which was to end on December 31, 2004. The salary scale was between $59,817 and $64,670. There was no evidence filed to determine where on the scale Ms. Montreuil would have been had she been hired. I therefore infer that initially she would have found herself at the bottom of the scale i.e. at $59,817. Even though the Board hired three grievance officers in September 2003, I accept Ms. Montreuil\u2019s claims that the date of her hiring be set at November 1, 2003.\n[77] From November 1, 2003 to November 1, 2004, Ms. Montreuil\u2019s salary would have been $59,817 had she been working for the Board. Since the position was to end on December 31, 2004, I am adding $10,000 to this amount for loss of salary for the months of November and December 2004. Therefore, had she been hired by the Board as of November 1, 2003 until December 31, 2004, Ms. Montreuil would have received a salary of $69,817.\n[78] From this amount we must deduct Ms. Montreuil\u2019s revenue for these two years respectively. In her income tax returns for 2003 and 2004, Ms. Montreuil claimed professional losses as well as rental income in regard to 2004. As these losses were not explained at the hearing, I see no reason why the Board should be held responsible for them in calculating the loss of salary. I will therefore not take them into account in this calculation.\n[79] According to Ms. Montreuil\u2019s income tax returns for 2003, her employment income was $46,741 and for 2004 it was $22,853. For the period from November 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004, I will deduct $30,643 from the amount of $69,817. I therefore establish Ms. Montreuil\u2019s loss of salary for this period at $39,174. I consider that this amount should not be reduced for failure to mitigate the losses because the complainant successfully established that she did what was necessary to minimize her losses by various attempts to secure other employment.\n[80] As regards the loss of salary, I order that Ms. Montreuil be given compensation in the amount of $39,174.\n(ii) Order for compensation of pain and suffering [81] The complainant is also seeking $20,000 in damages for pain and suffering pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. Once again, there was no evidence filed at the hearing to support this claim. It is not enough that a party allege pain and suffering, this claim must also be supported with certain evidence, however modest, to show what effect the discriminatory practice had on her.\n[82] In view of the lack of evidence that the Board\u2019s decision caused pain and suffering to the complainant, I do not believe that the order sought should be issued.\n(iii) An order pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the CHRA [83] The complainant is seeking $20,000 pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the CHRA since she submits that the Board engaged in the practices wilfully and recklessly.\n[84] In regard to the wilful nature of the Board\u2019s practices, there is no evidence supporting the claim that the Board acted deliberately. In my decision, I simply determined that it was reasonable on a balance of probabilities to determine that certain aspects of the Board\u2019s practices could be perceived as being discriminatory. I never found \u2013 and there was no evidence filed that would support a finding \u2013 that the Board wilfully engaged in the practice against the complainant.\n[85] Did the Board act recklessly? According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, a reckless act is committed with indifference to the consequences. The word recklessly is translated as inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 in the French version, which seems to contemplate a thoughtless practice (qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un manque de r\u00e9flexion; qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9, pes\u00e9 [which betrays a lack of reflection; which is not considered, weighed]: Le petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise - 2006).\n[86] In my opinion, in one language or the other, the term can be ascribed to the Board\u2019s discriminatory practice in this case. Given the nature of the Board\u2019s mandate, we are entitled to expect that it be more sensitive to the consequences of its practices. In this sense, we can say that it betrayed a lack of reflection and that it did not adequately weigh the consequences of its practices. I therefore find that the Board engaged in the practice recklessly.\n[87] Subsection 53(3) states that compensation not exceeding $20,000 can be awarded. Considering all of the circumstances of this case, inter alia the fact that the discriminatory practices were not really deliberate or malicious, I order that the Board pay Ms. Montreuil the amount of $5,000 as special compensation in accordance with subsection 53(3).\n(iv) Interest [88] Interest is payable for all of the compensation awarded in this decision (subsection 53(4) of the Act). The interest shall be calculated in accordance with subsection 9(12) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) i.e. simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate established by the Bank of Canada. Interest shall accrue from the date of the complaint, until the date of payment of the compensation.\nE. Conclusion [89] For the above-mentioned reasons, I find that the complaint of discrimination on the basis of sex (transgender) contrary to section 3 and 7 of the CHRA filed by the complainant Micheline Montreuil against the respondent, the Canadian Forces Grievance Board, is substantiated and I order the respondent to pay to the complainant:\ncompensation in the amount of $39,174 for loss of salary; special compensation in the amount of $5,000; and simple interest on the compensation calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate established by the Bank of Canada, accruing from the date of the complaint, until the date of payment of the compensation.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario November 20, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1108\/8905\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

Jensen\nDate: December 7, 2007\nCitation: 2007 CHRT 54\n[1] Raymond Thwaites is a pilot with Air Canada. Mr. Thwaites and six other pilots with Air Canada were required to retire at age 60 under the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan. Their retirement dates range from May 1, 2005, to April 1, 2006.\n[2] The Complainants filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging that Air Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement policy discriminated against them on the basis of their age contrary to sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[3] Air Canada, a Respondent in all 7 complaints, and the Air Canada Pilots Association, a Respondent in 3 of the complaints, have brought a motion requesting that the Tribunal dismiss the 7 complaints without a hearing. They argue that this Tribunal\u2019s decision in Vilven and Kelly v. Air Canada 2007 CHRT 36 has conclusively determined the factual and legal issues that are raised in the present complaints. It would be an abuse of process to hold a hearing into the present complaints since the circumstances of the present complainants do not differ from those of Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly.\n[4] In Vilven and Kelly, the Tribunal examined whether Air Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement policy, which forced the complainants in that case to retire in 2003 and 2005, was discriminatory. Section 15(1)(c) of the CHRA stipulates that it is not a discriminatory practice to terminate an individual\u2019s employment because that person has reached the normal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of that individual. The Complainants argued that the Tribunal should not apply s. 15(1)(c) to their complaints because it violated s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n[5] The Tribunal held that s. 15(1)(c) did not violate the Charter. It further held that Mr. Vilven and Mr. Kelly had reached the normal age of retirement for employees working in similar positions to theirs\u2019. On that basis the Tribunal dismissed the complaints.\n[6] In determining what the normal age of retirement was in 2003 and 2005, for employees working in similar positions to those of the complainants, the Tribunal used two approaches. The first was the normative approach which directed the Tribunal to search for a rule governing the maximum age of retirement in the airline industry. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted standards for the maximum age of pilots flying commercial airlines internationally. In September of 2003 and May of 2005, the ICAO standard for pilots in command required retirement at age 60.\n[7] The second approach to determining the normal age of retirement that the Tribunal employed in Vilven and Kelly was the empirical approach. The empirical approach involved a consideration of the evidence on retirement ages for major international airlines. That evidence established that in 2003 and 2005, age 60 was the mandatory retirement age for the majority of positions that were similar to those of the complainants.\n[8] On November 23, 2006, a new ICAO standard came into effect that established 65 as the maximum age for pilots-in-command. All of the complainants in the present case retired before this new standard came into effect. Given that in Vilven and Kelly the Tribunal established that prior to the new ICAO standard of November 2006, the normal age of retirement was age 60, it would be an abuse of process to permit the Complainants to relitigate this issue now, according to the Respondents.\n[9] The doctrine of abuse of process is used to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue estoppel have not been met, but where allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate principles such as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79 [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at para. 37. The application of the doctrine in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings has been approved by the Federal Court: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corportion (Cremasco) 2004 FC 81 at para. 41; aff\u2019d 2004 FCA 363).\n[10] As the Tribunal noted recently in Morten v. Air Canada 2007 CHRT 48, at para. 23, the doctrine of abuse of process is used to prevent relitigation because it can have negative consequences. For example, relitigation can yield contradictory results. It may waste judicial resources and involve unnecessary expenses for the parties (Toronto v. CUPE, 2003 SCC 63, at paras. 37 and 51).\n[11] However, the Tribunal should exercise caution in applying doctrines such as abuse of process which result in the dismissal of a complaint without a hearing. Such action deprives the parties of the opportunity to present evidence and make representations regarding the alleged violation of their human rights (O\u2019Connor v. Canadian National Railway 2006 CHRT 5, at para. 22). Where it is apparent that the dismissal of a complaint could lead to unfairness or create an injustice, the doctrine should not be applied (Morton, at para. 24; Toronto v. C.U.P.E., para. 52).\n[12] I find that dismissing the complaints at the present time on the basis of the doctrine of abuse of process could lead to unfairness or create an injustice. The issues in the complaints have not been conclusively determined. The complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission have applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Vilven and Kelly. Depending upon the outcome of those applications, the issues in the present complaints may remain unsettled. The right to have those issues determined by this Tribunal would be irrevocably lost if the Tribunal dismissed the complaints now without a hearing. This would be an unjust result. The filing of new complaints would not remedy that injustice since the new complaints would likely be outside of the one year time period for filing complaints (s. 41(1)(e) of the CHRA).\n[13] Accordingly, the Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaints is denied, without prejudice to their right to bring a motion for an adjournment of the present proceedings pending the outcome of the applications for judicial review in Vilven and Kelly.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] Ruth Walden is one of 431 Complainants who believe that the Respondents have discriminated against them on the basis of their gender. The Complainants are a group of predominantly female nurses who work as medical adjudicators in the CPP Disability Benefits Program. For 35 years they have worked alongside doctors, a predominantly male group of workers, in a common enterprise - the determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits.\n[2] The Complainants say that the doctors (known as medical advisors) and nurses (known as medical adjudicators) do the same work: they apply their medical knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits. When medical advisors perform that work, they are classified as health professionals within the Public Service classification system. However, when the medical adjudicators do this work, they are not classified as health professionals. Rather, they are designated as program administrators. As a result of their classification, medical advisors receive better compensation, benefits, training, professional recognition and opportunities for advancement than medical adjudicators.\n[3] The Complainants assert that it is discriminatory to treat a female dominated group of workers differently from a male dominated group when they are performing the same or substantially similar work. They seek to be treated the same as medical advisors.\n[4] The issues to be determined in this complaint are whether the Respondents have discriminated against the Complainants on the basis of their gender by: (1) treating them differently from the medical advisors contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act; and\/or (2) pursuing a practice that deprives the Complainants of employment opportunities, contrary to section 10 of the CHRA.\nII. SUMMARY OF THE DECISION [5] The Complainants met the legal requirement to establish a prima facie case under s. 7 of the Act. To meet that requirement the Complainants were required to produce credible evidence which, in the absence of a reasonable explanation from the Respondents, would substantiate their complaints.\n[6] The Complainants' evidence supported their allegation that since 1972, medical adjudicators have performed the same or substantially similar work as the medical advisors. They both apply their medical qualifications and expertise to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits. Yet, only the medical advisors are classified as health professionals within the Health Services (SH) Group in the Public Service, and only the advisors receive the benefits and recognition that flow from that designation.\n[7] The Complainants have also made out a prima facie case under s. 10 of the Act. To establish a prima facie case there must be credible evidence that the Respondent is pursuing a practice that deprives or tends to deprive individuals of employment opportunities.\n[8] The Complainants' evidence supported their allegation that the Respondent's ongoing characterization of the Complainants' work as fundamentally different from that of the advisors' constitutes a practice that deprives the Complainants of employment opportunities.\n[9] The burden then shifted to the Respondent to provide an explanation for the conduct that has been found to be, on the face of it, discriminatory.\n[10] The Respondents provided a reasonable explanation that rebutted part of the Complainants' prima facie case, but not all of it. While there is a significant overlap in the functions of the two positions, there are also some important differences. Within the common enterprise of eligibility determination, medical advisors exercise an oversight and advisory role that is not performed by the adjudicators. This results in some differences in the job tasks performed by advisors and adjudicators. These differences explain the distinction in the job titles and explain some of the differences in compensation and benefits.\n[11] However, the differences are not significant enough to explain the wide disparity in treatment and, more particularly, they do not explain why the advisors are recognized as health professionals and the adjudicators are not. The core function of both positions is applying professional knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits. The Respondents have failed to provide a reasonable, non-discriminatory explanation as to why this function is medical work when the advisors do it, and program administration work when the adjudicators do it.\n[12] The Respondents also failed to show that classifying the medical adjudicators as health professionals within the Health Services Group would cause them undue hardship. Therefore, I have found that the complaints are substantiated.\nIII. WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THIS COMPLAINT? [13] In 1966, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP or the Plan) came into being. Along with pension benefits, the Plan offered disability benefits to workers. A person was eligible for disability benefits if he or she had contributed to CPP for a minimum of 5 years and had a severe and prolonged mental or physical disability.\n[14] In about 1971, medical doctors were hired to determine applicants' eligibility for CPP disability benefits. There were so many applications that the doctors were unable to process the applications on a timely basis. A backlog developed. For this reason, in 1972, the Director of the program hired registered nurses to work with the doctors to determine eligibility for disability benefits.\n[15] The determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits requires the use of medical knowledge to fully understand and assess the documentation submitted in support of the application. Both medical advisors and medical adjudicators have always used their professional knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits. Neither position involves the provision of direct patient care.\n[16] The use of medical advisors' professional knowledge in the determination of eligibility is reflected in the classification of their position within the Public Service of Canada. The adjudicators' use of their professional knowledge of nursing is not reflected in their classification.\n[17] The classification of positions in the Public Service is important. It determines, among other things, the professional recognition, pay and benefits, and opportunities for continuing education and career advancement that the incumbent will receive. Positions are classified according to the primary function of the position. They are first allocated to an Occupational Group, which is a collection of jobs that are grouped together based on common duties or similarity of work. Within an Occupational Group, there are Classification Standards that are more specific to the kinds of work that are done within that group. For example, within the Health Services (SH) Group there is the Nursing (NU) Classification Standard, and the Medicine (MD) Classification Standard, among others. Within the Program and Administrative Services (PA) Group, there is the Programme Administration (PM) Classification Standard, among numerous others.\n[18] Medical advisors are classified as MD's within the Health Services Group. The Health Services Group definition includes positions that involve the application of medical or nursing knowledge (among other professional specialties) to the safety, and physical and mental well-being of people. Medical advisors have always been included in this Group because the definition of medical officer has historically included positions that have, as their primary purpose, responsibility for the assessment of medical fitness for the determination of disability and other federal government benefits.\n[19] Medical adjudicators have always been classified as PM's within the Program and Administrative Services (PA) Group. The PA Group comprises positions that primarily involve the planning, development, delivery or management of administrative and federal government programs to the public. Positions within the PA Group do not involve the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties such as nursing or medicine.\n[20] From 1988 until just recently, the medical adjudicators have been seeking recognition as health professionals through classification of their position in the Nursing (NU) Group within Health Services. These attempts have been unsuccessful. Over the years, a number of classification reviews have been undertaken by the Respondents Treasury Board and Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMAC; now CPSA), and in each case the classification of the medical adjudicator position has been confirmed in the PM group.\n[21] In 2004, Ruth Walden filed a human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Between 2004 and 2007, 430 other medical adjudicators filed human rights complaints alleging the same discriminatory conduct and requesting the same remedy.\n[22] The majority of the Complainants were represented by counsel during the hearing. Approximately 17 Complainants were not represented during the hearing. Those Complainants who were not represented by counsel were provided with information about the hearing through regional representatives.\nIV. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR THE COMPLAINTS? [23] Each Complainant alleges that the discriminatory conduct began on the date that she or he was hired, and has continued either until the present time (if the individual is still employed in the CPP Disability Benefits Program), or when her or his employment with the Program ended.\n[24] Counsel for some of the Complainants provided a list of the dates of hire for those Complainants whom he represented. The earliest date is August of 1979. The latest date mid-February of 2007. The dates of hire for those Complainants who did not retain counsel were not provided to the Tribunal. Albina Elliott, one of the first nurses hired in 1972, testified during the hearing. Counsel for some of the Complainants stated that Ms. Elliott had filed a complaint. However, her name does not appear on the list of Complainants that was provided to the Tribunal by the Commission and counsel for the Complainants.\n[25] During the hearing, counsel for some of the Complainants argued that although the complaint forms indicate that the discriminatory conduct began when the Complainants were hired, the Tribunal can and should make a finding that the impugned conduct began in 1972, when the first nurse was hired and classified as a PM.\n[26] I disagree with this argument.\n[27] The Canadian Human Rights Act came into force in March of 1978. The Courts and this Tribunal have consistently held that the CHRA does not have retrospective application to conduct and practices that occurred before the Act or its amendments came into force (Robichaud [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, at para. 20; Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Services Canada), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 1, TD 1\/01 at para. 233; cited with approval in: Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, at para. 50).\n[28] In Latif v. Canadian Human Rights Commission [1980] 1 F.C. 687, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the newly enacted CHRA had retrospective application only in a very limited sense. It applied to conduct that began before the Act came into force and continued for a short time after its enactment (Latif, at para. 34). This was to enable the Commission to deal with complaints that were ongoing at the time the Act came into force. In that very limited sense, the Court held, the Act could have retrospective application to discriminatory practices begun before the Act came into force but continuing on or shortly after that date. Otherwise, the Court held, the CHRA does not apply retroactively. (On the issue of limited retrospectivity generally, see: Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, at para. 113).\n[29] Accordingly, I conclude that the Respondents' potential liability in the present case is limited to conduct and practices following the coming into force of the CHRA.\n[30] The Respondents contended that their potential liability for discriminatory conduct or practices should be further limited to one year prior to the filing of Ms. Walden's complaint. That would mean the limitation of liability to 2003 and onward. On that basis, the Tribunal would be required to dismiss the complaints of those Complainants who left the CPP disability benefit program prior to 2003.\n[31] In my view, it would not be appropriate to do this. It is important, I think, to distinguish between a determination of the Respondents' liability for discriminatory conduct pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Act, and the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion under s. 53(2) of the CHRA to compensate victims for losses caused by the discriminatory conduct. They are related, but separate questions. The question of liability for discriminatory conduct should, in my view, be considered separately from the remedy that may flow from that determination.\n[32] In this case, the Complainants allege systemic discrimination. By its nature, systemic discrimination occurs over time and cannot be isolated to a single action or statement (Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Department of National Defence) (NPF) [1996] 3 F.C. 789 at para. 16). For that reason, it is not appropriate in this case to fix an arbitrary date upon which the discriminatory conduct will be deemed to have commenced for the purposes of determining liability. Instead, the Tribunal must examine the evidence and make a determination, on the balance of probabilities, as to whether discriminatory conduct occurred and if so, when the conduct occurred.\n[33] This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal cannot impose a limit on the compensable losses caused by the discriminatory practice in the event that the complaints are substantiated. Indeed in the recent case of Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that the discretionary power under s. 53(2)(c) to award any or all of the losses suffered, leaves it open to the Tribunal to impose a limit on losses caused by the discriminatory practice. In my view, it was in the context of a consideration of the appropriate exercise of the Tribunal's discretionary powers under s. 53(2), that the Court in NPF stated that it was reasonable, in that case, to limit compensation for lost wages to one year prior to the filing of the complaint. However, at this stage in the determination of liability, a one year limitation is not appropriate.\n[34] For all of these reasons, liability will be assessed from March 1978 to the present time. Nevertheless, for the limited purpose of analyzing the work that was, and is, being done by the medical adjudicators and the advisors, and the circumstances that gave rise to the alleged discriminatory conduct, it is necessary to examine the whole history of the case from 1972 to the present.\nV. WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR CPP DISABILITY BENEFITS? [35] To understand the issues in this case, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the process for determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits. There are two conditions for eligibility: the applicant must have made sufficient contributions to CPP, and the disability must be prolonged and severe.\n[36] The process for determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits was, and still is, as follows:\nan individual makes an application for benefits; an initial determination is made about whether to grant the benefits on the basis of the eligibility criteria; if the application is denied, the applicant may apply for a reconsideration of the decision; if benefits are denied at the reconsideration stage, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Review Tribunal (RT) (formerly known as the Review Committee); if benefits are again denied at the RT stage, the applicant may apply for leave to appeal to the Pension Appeals Board (PAB); if the applicant is granted benefits at the RT stage, the Minister in charge of the CPP program may apply for leave to appeal the RT decision; both the applicant and the Minister may apply to the Federal Court of Appeal for judicial review of the PAB decision; at any stage of the process, an applicant may submit additional or new medical or non-medical information. The decision-maker at that particular stage considers the information in determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits.\n[37] The following flow chart may be helpful in visualizing the CPP disability benefit determination process. It is important to bear in mind, however, that 90% of all applications for CPP disability benefits are conclusively determined at the initial or reconsideration levels. Relatively few cases are appealed to the RT or PAB. Even fewer cases are the subject of applications for judicial review.\nInitial -> Reconsideration -> Review -> Pension Appeals -> Federal Court\nDetermination Tribunal Board of Appeal\nVI. WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE UNDER SECTIONS 7 AND 10 OF THE CHRA? [38] A discriminatory practice is defined under s. 7 of the Act as adverse differentiation on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. To establish a prima facie case under s. 7, the Complainants must present evidence that they are being adversely differentiated on the basis of their gender. With respect to s. 10(a) of the Act, evidence must be presented of a policy or practice that deprives, or tends to deprive, the Complainants of an employment opportunity based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[39] Statistical evidence that apparently neutral conduct negatively affects a disproportionate number of members of a protected group is sufficient to establish a prima facie case under sections 7 and 10. For example, in Chapdelaine v. Air Canada, 1987 CanLII 102 (C.H.R.T.); appeal on other grounds at (1991), 15 C.H.R.R. D\/22 (C.H.R. Rev. Trib.), the complainants, both women, possessed all of the qualifications necessary to be pilots for Air Canada save only that they failed to meet the height requirement. The Tribunal accepted statistical evidence regarding the height of men and women in the general population, and concluded that although, perhaps on its face neutral, the effect of the application of the height requirement was to deprive 82% of all Canadian women and 11% of all Canadian men between the ages of 20 and 29 of the opportunity for employment as a pilot. Therefore, the Tribunal found that the policy affected women differently from men. Evidence of a disproportionate impact of the rule on women was sufficient to establish a prima facie case under ss. 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[40] The comments of Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 in Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de l'Acadie v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) [1989] 2 S.C.R. 879 (SEPQA) at paras. 80-82, although written in dissent and in obiter, are also instructive in the present context. In that case, Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 stated that to establish a prima facie case under ss. 7 and 10, statistical evidence of professional segregation of the kind provided in that case is a most valuable tool. The evidence in SEPQA was that a predominantly female group of employees, who were working under similar conditions and at jobs having the same objective, were paid less than a predominantly male group of employees. That, said Justice L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, was sufficient to establish a prima facie case under ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA, but not sufficient to establish a prima facie case under s. 11. Under s. 11, the Complainant must provide evidence that the work is of equal value in addition to providing evidence of professional segregation.\n[41] This is not a section 11 complaint. Therefore, to establish a prima facie case, the Complainants need not provide evidence of the equal value of the work. Rather, to establish a prima facie case under s. 7 of the CHRA, it is sufficient for the Complainants to present evidence that they constitute a predominantly female group of workers who are performing the same or substantially similar work as the predominantly male group of medical advisors, and yet are treated differently than the advisors. To establish a prima facie case under s. 10, it is sufficient to present evidence of a practice that has a disproportionate impact on women by depriving them of employment opportunities that are available to men who are performing the same or substantially similar work.\nVII. HAVE THE COMPLAINANTS ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE CASE UNDER S. 7 OF THE CHRA? (i) What is the appropriate comparator group?\n[42] The appropriate comparator group is implicit in the requirement for establishing a prima facie case: it is the group of predominantly male workers who are performing the same or substantially similar work to that of the Complainants. That group is the medical advisors. There is no other group of predominantly male employees in the CPP Disability Benefits program whose work could arguably be described as the same as or substantially similar to that of the adjudicators.\n(ii) What is the evidence of gender predominance?\n[43] Before they are hired, medical adjudicators are required to provide proof that they are licensed to practice as a Registered Nurse in Canada. There was no dispute that 95% of nurses are women. The predominance of women in nursing and the requirement to produce a nursing license before being hired as an adjudicator results in an overwhelming preponderance of women in the medical adjudicator position. Currently, according the Respondents, 95% of all medical adjudicators are women.\n[44] The Respondents produced evidence that 80% of medical advisors are men.\n(iii) What is the evidence that the work of the medical advisors is the same or substantially similar to that of the medical adjudicators?\n[45] There are three distinct time periods in this case, marked by key events that affect the nature of the work done by the medical advisors and adjudicators. The prima facie case will be analyzed according to this temporal framework.\n1972- 1989\n[46] From 1972 to 1989, final determinations regarding eligibility for CPP disability benefits were made by the Director of the Disability Program, based on the recommendations of a Disability Determination Board. The Board was composed of at least two persons, one of whom was required to be a duly qualified medical practitioner (Canada Pension Plan Regulations, Consolidated Regulations of Canada 1978, c. 385, s.71(1)).\n[47] Albina Elliott, one of the first nurses hired in 1972, testified that both adjudicators and advisors assessed applications and signed recommendations to the Director. When the applications came in, they were placed in files on shelves. Medical advisors and adjudicators went to the shelves and took the file that was closest to them regardless of the complexity of the file. He or she would independently review the file and make a recommendation to grant or deny benefits. Ms. Elliott testified that the adjudicators were required to have a medical advisor sign off on their recommendations.\n[48] Alfred Gregory, a physician who has been employed as a medical advisor in the CPP Disability Benefits Program since 1980, also testified that medical advisors were required to sign off on recommendations made by adjudicators during this time period. He stated, however, that medical adjudicators and advisors worked as colleagues; the adjudicators' professional judgment and recommendations on files were generally accepted.\n[49] Dr. Gregory testified that both medical adjudicators and advisors performed the same core function during this time period - assessing applications and making recommendations for CPP disability benefits. He stated that this core function has always required the use of medical knowledge, training and experience by both medical advisors and medical adjudicators. Occasionally, medical advisors provided advice to the medical adjudicators on difficult files.\n[50] Dr. Gregory testified that since the inception of the program, medical advisors have gradually ceded the work that they have done in determining eligibility for benefits to the medical adjudicators. At first only the medical advisors made the initial assessments. Then the medical adjudicators were hired, and they did initial applications as well. After that, the medical advisors handled only the reconsiderations and the Review Committee work. However, over time, that work too was given to the medical adjudicators.\n[51] Dr. Gregory stated, by way of example, that prior to 1983, only medical advisors prepared the case summaries that were presented to the Review Committee. The Review Committee, composed of three members from the community, heard appeals from reconsideration decisions. The case summary that was provided to the Review Committee, outlined the chronology of the file, explained the medical issues, summarized the case law, and provided a recommendation regarding eligibility to the Committee.\n[52] In about 1982, the medical advisors indicated that they did not like preparing the case summaries. Ms. Elliott was asked to assume responsibility for this work. She was trained by a medical advisor and in April of 1983, she assumed full responsibility for preparing case summaries. The approval of a medical advisor was not required before she sent them to the Review Committee. Subsequently, additional nurses were hired to assist Ms. Elliott in preparing the case summaries.\n[53] Dr. Gregory testified that when the medical advisors and the medical adjudicators were making initial determinations and reassessments, and preparing case summaries for the Review Committee, there was no difference in the functions that the two were performing. When Ms. Elliott did this work she was classified as a program administrator (PM). When Dr. Gregory did this work he was classified as a MOF or medical officer (MD).\n1989 - 1999\n[54] In 1989, changes were made to the CPP Regulations which permitted a single adjudicator to make final decisions on eligibility for disability benefits (Canada Pension Plan Regulation, amendment SOR\/89-345, s. 7 of the Schedule). The new Regulations, which are still in force today, include a Regulatory Impact Statement which states that the adjudication of and final decision on disability applications will be done by specially trained adjudicators with professional medical backgrounds (e.g. nurses, paramedics) and experience in the field of disability adjudication (Workers Compensation, Quebec Pension Plan). Staff physicians will be available at all times for consultation on contentious cases (SOR\/89-345: Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 123, No. 15).\n[55] Even though the Regulations stipulated that the adjudicators would be making the final decisions with regard to disability applications, the evidence established that from 1989 until about 1999, both medical advisors and medical adjudicators continued to make final determinations on initial applications and reconsiderations. Both were able to make final decisions without the signature or approval of the other.\n[56] In about 1996, the adjudication of initial applications and reconsiderations was regionalized. As a result, from 1996 - 1999, most of these determinations, which were once the exclusive responsibility of medical advisors, were now being made in the regional offices by medical adjudicators. There were no medical advisors in the regional offices. However, there were still medical advisors in Ottawa who made final determinations on initial applications and reconsiderations until 1999.\n[57] In 1988, the Medical Expertise Division (MED) in Ottawa was created to handle appeals to the Pension Appeals Board (PAB) and to provide expert medical advice on difficult files. Both medical advisors and medical adjudicators worked in MED to prepare for the PAB hearing. The Pension Appeals Board was, and still is, composed of three judges who make eligibility determinations at the final stage of appeal in the CPP Disability Benefit Program. Medical advisors testify under oath or affirmation before the PAB about the medical issues in the file.\n[58] Ruth Walden, one of the Complainants, was hired in 1993 to work as a medical adjudicator in MED. She continues to work in MED. Ms. Walden testified that the doctors and nurses in MED worked together to work up the file for a PAB hearing. This involved reviewing the file, seeking additional medical information if necessary, and making a decision as to whether the case should be settled before it goes to the PAB.\n[59] Dr. Gregory and Ms. Walden testified that the primary function of both adjudicators and advisors in MED, and in the regions during this time period, was to apply their comprehensive medical knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP benefits. Dr. Gregory testified that there was no difference in the work done by medical adjudicators making final eligibility determinations in the regions from the work done by medical advisors in Ottawa who were making eligibility determinations during this period.\n1999 - Present\n[60] By 1999, all medical advisors employed in the CPP Disability Benefits Program had migrated to MED. Since that time, the final adjudication of all disability benefits at the initial and reconsideration levels has been handled by the medical adjudicators. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, medical adjudicators represent the Minister in hearings before the Review Tribunal (RT). Medical advisors are involved in the initial, reconsideration and Review Tribunal stages of disability determination only when there is a request for their advice, or there is a backlog of applications to be processed. Dr. Gregory testified that medical advisors provide advice on only 1-2% of the files at the initial, reconsideration or RT stage. Backlogs occur infrequently.\n[61] Dr. Gregory testified that since 1999, the majority of the work done by medical advisors in MED involves preparing for, and appearing before the PAB. This involves an extensive review of the file, preparation of a case summary and testifying under oath or affirmation before the PAB.\n[62] Since 1999, one of the Complainants, Elizabeth Franklin, has represented the Minister responsible for the CPP Disability Benefit Program before the Review Tribunal in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Before she attends an RT hearing, Ms. Franklin prepares a case summary for the Tribunal which includes an analysis of the medical and legal issues in the file. She then appears before the Tribunal, asks questions of the witnesses and answers questions from the Tribunal. Ms. Franklin explains the Minister's position and the medical issues in the case to the Tribunal. She points out inconsistencies in the oral testimony. Ms. Franklin is authorized to offer a settlement, without prior approval, to the applicant prior to the commencement of the hearing if she is of the view that the applicant's case is a strong one.\n[63] The description of the work that medical advisors do to prepare for, and appear before the PAB was read to Ms. Franklin. Ms. Franklin stated that, other than testifying under oath or affirmation, the work that she does at the RT stage is the same as the work of the medical advisors at the PAB stage. Both the advisor and the adjudicator present the Minister's position at the hearing, both are required to explain the basis for the previous decision from which the appeal is being sought, and both are called upon by the decision-makers to explain medical conditions, terminology and diagnoses.\n[64] Dr. Gregory testified that in the Medical Expertise Division, both medical advisors and adjudicators work on cases that are appealed to the PAB. He testified that the primary function of both positions in MED is disability determination.\n[65] Both medical advisors and adjudicators may be involved in outreach and policy development work. Dr. Gregory works with other medical advisors on policy development and analysis. Ruth Walden testified that she knew of at least one medical adjudicator who is working in the policy development area. The medical adjudicator's job description stipulates that adjudicators may participate in or lead teams engaged in training and policy development.\n[66] Dr. Gregory does outreach and networking with other divisions in the government, and with professional and medical associations. The medical adjudicator's job description states that the adjudicators may also represent the CPP Disability Benefit program in consultations with internal and external clients\/stakeholders (including MP's, the medical community, representatives of insurance companies, special interest groups, the Canadian public) to provide advanced technical knowledge of program eligibility and medical issues.\n(iv) Conclusion Regarding the Similarity of the Work of Medical Adjudicators and Advisors\n[67] Based on the foregoing evidence, I am satisfied that the Complainants have established a prima facie case that the work they have done since March of 1978, and are still doing at the present time, is the same or substantially similar to the work of the medical advisors.\n[68] The Complainants' evidence indicated that since the inception of the CPP Disability Benefit Program, the primary responsibility and function of both the medical advisors and the medical adjudicators has been to use their professional expertise and knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits at all stages of the process, and\/or to prepare for, and represent the Minister in appeals.\n[69] Specifically, both advisors and adjudicators have performed the following functions at various points throughout the three time periods in this complaint:\nmaking recommendations and decisions on initial applications involving varying degrees of complexity and difficulty in terms of the medical and legal issues involved; making recommendations and decisions on reconsideration applications that were also varied in terms of their level of complexity and difficulty; preparing case summaries for the Review Committee, or as it was later called, the Review Tribunal; requesting additional medical and non-medical information from applicants and others on an application for CPP disability benefits; preparing a file for the Pension Appeals Board; making an offer to settle or a recommendation to settle (without prior approval); working on policy and outreach.\n[70] Over the three time periods, the amount of time spent by the advisors and the adjudicators performing the overlapping functions has shifted. However, the evidence established that from 1972 until 1999, there were medical advisors and medical adjudicators whose primary function was to make recommendations or final determinations on initial and reconsideration applications and to prepare case summaries for the Review Committee. The work on initial applications and reconsiderations represented a considerable amount of the advisors' and adjudicators' workloads since over 90% of all applications are conclusively determined at one of those two levels. As time went on, more and more adjudicators were hired and the medical advisors spent less time working on initials, reconsiderations and RT work and more time on PAB appeals. But, from 1972 - 1999, there were always advisors and adjudicators who performed substantially the same function of determining eligibility at the initial and reconsideration levels, as well as preparing case summaries for the RT.\n[71] Since 1999, medical adjudicators in the regions have been doing substantially the same work that advisors performed from 1972-1999: the final determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits at the initial and reconsideration levels.\n[72] Also since 1999, medical advisors and medical adjudicators have performed similar functions in MED preparing cases for the PAB hearing. The work that the medical adjudicators have done in Manitoba since 1999 to prepare for and present a case before the Review Tribunal is substantially similar to the work done by the medical advisors in preparing for and testifying before the Pension Appeal Board.\n(v) What is the differential treatment?\na) Professional Recognition\n[73] Medical advisors have always been recognized as health professionals under the Public Service classification scheme, whereas medical adjudicators have not. Although neither position involves hands-on patient care, they both require professional knowledge about permanent disabling conditions.\n[74] The knowledge required to perform a function is not generally relevant to the allocation of a particular position to an Occupational Group within the Public Service Classification system. However, in the case of the Health Services Group, the definition explicitly states that for a position to be classified within that Group, the position must primarily involve the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the fields of medicine and nursing (among others) to the safety and physical and mental well-being of people.\n[75] The application of medical advisors' knowledge of relevant professional specialties in the determination of eligibility for CPP benefits has always been reflected in the medical advisors' classification as MD's within the Health Services Group. However, the application of the medical adjudicators' knowledge of relevant professional specialties has never been reflected in their classification as program administrators (PM) within the Program Administration (PA) Group.\nb) Salary and Benefits\n[76] Ms. Walden testified that medical advisors have always been paid roughly twice as much as medical adjudicators and receive a yearly retention bonus which the adjudicators do not receive. The difference in pay is reflected in the adjudicators' comparatively lower pension benefits at retirement.\n[77] Ms. Walden stated that health professionals in the Health Services Group, including medical advisors, have always received more vacation allowance than medical adjudicators. The Respondent did not dispute this.\nc) Payment of Professional Fees and Educational\/Training Opportunities\n[78] The Respondent Social Development Canada (SDC) has paid the licensing fees for medical advisors on a yearly basis. Payment of the advisors' fees does not come out of the training and education budget line for the medical advisors in the CPP Disability Benefit Program.\n[79] In contrast, until 1999, the medical adjudicators paid their own fees to maintain their nursing licenses and were not entitled to reimbursement from SDC. They grieved this and in 1999, SDC agreed to pay the adjudicators' fees out of the training budget. Ms. Walden stated that the payment of the adjudicators' fees out of the training budget leaves less money for training and continuing education opportunities for the adjudicators. She has been told that there was no money left in the budget for ongoing education and training. She stated that medical advisors, on the other hand, are able to attend conferences on a regular basis; there does not seem to be a shortage of money for their continuing education activities.\nd) Career Advancement\n[80] Ms. Walden testified that as a PM, her chances of obtaining a job as a nurse in the government were not as good as if she was classified as a health professional, like the medical advisors. Nursing positions require recent nursing experience. Ms. Walden stated that although the Nurses' Associations across the country recognize that adjudicators are engaged in the practice of nursing, the Public Service of Canada does not. Therefore, when seeking a position as a nurse within the Public Service her work as an adjudicator would not be viewed as recent nursing experience.\n(vi) Conclusion: the Complainants Have Established a Prima Facie Case under Section 7\n[81] I find that the Complainants have established a prima facie case that since March of 1978, they were, and still are treated differently from the predominantly male group of medical advisors who performed the same or substantially similar work as them in the past and continue to do so in the present.\nVIII. HAVE THE COMPLAINANTS ESTABLISHED A PRIMA FACIE CASE UNDER S. 10 OF THE CHRA? [82] To establish a prima facie case under s. 10(a) of the Act, the Complainants must present evidence of a policy or practice that deprives or tends to deprive them of an employment opportunity based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(i) What is the allegedly discriminatory practice? [83] The Complainants assert that the Respondents have pursued a practice of treating the advisors and the adjudicators as though they do different work and classifying them accordingly.\n[84] As established above, on a prima facie basis, the core function of both the advisor and the adjudicator position is the application of professional knowledge to assess medical fitness for the determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits. According to the Group Definition for the Health Services Group, both positions should fall within that group. However, since 1972, when they were first hired, Treasury Board and PSHRMAC have maintained a practice of classifying the adjudicators within the Program and Administrative Services (PA) Group.\n[85] Treasury Board has consistently asserted that the medical adjudicator position does not fit the Nursing Classification Standard (NU) within the Health Services Group, since its primary function is not to provide direct care to patients. The NU Standard stipulates that the position must involve the application of nursing knowledge to the physical and mental well-being of people and specifically, to the care of patients and the treatment and management of illness in cooperation with medical doctors.\n[86] In 2002, the Assistant Deputy Minister of Income Security Programs wrote to Treasury Board stating that the outmoded classification standard which required that nurses provide direct health care did not reflect current realities in nursing, under which many practicing nurses do not provide direct health care to individual clients. He stated that the NU standard should include medical adjudicators and proposed that a benchmark position be added to the NU standard to facilitate their inclusion in the SH Group.\n[87] In March of 2004, SDC prepared a Business Case in an attempt to persuade PSHRMAC to create a Nursing subgroup that would include the adjudicators in the Health Services Group. In the Business Case, SDC stated that the department refers publicly to its medical adjudicators as medical professionals. SDC further stated that the medical adjudication process is complex and requires professional nursing knowledge, skills and judgment. In addition, provincial nursing licensing associations, as well as the Canadian Nursing Association, recognize medical adjudication work as falling within the practice of professional nursing.\n[88] In response to the Business Case, PSHRMAC stated that while medical and nursing knowledge is important for the adjudicator positions, the primary purpose of the positions is the delivery of a federal program to the public, not the application of nursing knowledge to the safety and physical and mental well being of people, or the assessment of medical fitness. PSHRMAC also pointed out that the Business Case did not have the support of the bargaining agent, which they asserted, is one of the prerequisites when considering changes to occupational group definitions.\n[89] As a result of that characterization of the adjudicators' work, Treasury Board and PSHRMAC have continued to pursue the pre-1999 practice of classifying medical adjudicators as PM's and advisors as MD's.\n[90] The Commission argued that had the Respondents classified the medical adjudicators as nurses instead of program administrators, part of the discriminatory practice would have been resolved because then, like the advisors, the adjudicators would have been recognized as health professionals and classified within the Health Services Group.\n[91] However, Commission counsel maintained that the discriminatory practice at issue in this case would not have been completely resolved by classifying the adjudicators as nurses. It is also the Respondents' failure to recognize that adjudicators and the advisors are doing the same work, and that they should both be in the same position and compensated accordingly, that is a discriminatory practice, according to the Commission and the Complainants.\n[92] Until recently, the adjudicators have not maintained that they were doing the same work as the advisors; they claimed that they were engaged in the practice of nursing, just as the advisors' work involved the practice of medicine. As a result, the Respondents' practice of maintaining the advisors and adjudicators in different positions with resulting differences in compensation and benefits has never been in issue prior to the filing of the present complaints.\n[93] According to the Commission, it is of no consequence that the Complainants have only just recently clearly argued that they do the same work as the medical advisors'. It is not a requirement under the Act to establish that the Respondents knew or ought to have known that the impugned practices were discriminatory. If the effect of their practices is to deprive the group of an employment benefit on the basis of a prohibited ground, then regardless of the Respondents' awareness of the nature of their conduct, it will be found to be a violation of the Act. The question of knowledge or intent is relevant only to the issue of compensation under s. 53(3) of the Act.\n[94] I agree with the Commission's position on this issue.\n[95] I find that the Complainants have established a prima facie case that since 1972, the Respondents have pursued a practice of treating the advisors and the adjudicators as though they were doing different work, even though they were doing substantially similar work, and classifying them accordingly.\n(ii) What are the employment opportunities of which the Complainants were allegedly deprived? [96] The Complainants allege that the Respondents' practices have denied them the following: (i) recognition as health professionals; (ii) salary and benefits equal to those of the medical advisors; (iii) payment of professional fees and the provision of educational\/training opportunities on the same basis as the advisors; and (iv) career advancement opportunities like those of the medical advisors. Do all of the foregoing employment benefits constitute employment opportunities as that term is used in s. 10 of the CHRA?\n[97] The French version of s. 10 refers to practices that deny or tend to deny les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus. When the French and the English versions of s. 10 are read together, one is led to the conclusion that the term employment opportunities refers to conditions which enable employment and the advancement of individuals in their employment.\n[98] This interpretation is reflected in the Tribunal's jurisprudence wherein the term employment opportunities has been used to refer to opportunities to transfer to another job (Gauthier v. Canadian Armed Forces [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 T.D. 3\/89; opportunities to do certain kinds of work that would enhance earnings and career potential (O'Connell v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp [1988] C.H.R.D. No. T.D. 9\/88); training opportunities (Green v. Canada (Public Service Commission [1998] C.H.R.D. No. T.D. 6\/98, reviewed on other grounds in: Canada (Attorney General) v. Green [2000] 4 F.C. 629 (T.D.)); and continued and uninterrupted employment (Hay v. Cameco [1991] C.H.R.D. No. 5 No. T.D. 5\/91).\n[99] In the present case, I find that the following constitute employment opportunities within the meaning of s. 10: recognition and classification as health professionals; the payment of professional fees and training\/educational opportunities on the same basis as the medical advisors; and opportunities for career advancement as health professionals. These conditions affect the Complainants' ability to enhance their earnings and career potential within the Public Service. For that reason, they are employment opportunities within the meaning of s. 10 of the Act.\n(iii) Conclusion: the Complainants have established a prima facie case under s. 10 [100] The Complainants' evidence establishing a prima facie under s. 7 of the Act also establishes, on a prima facie basis, that the Respondents' pursuit of the practice identified above deprived or tended to deprive the Complainants of the employment opportunities in question. The designation of the adjudicators' work as program administration, and the treatment of the adjudicators' work as different from that of the advisors, has resulted in a deprivation of the employment opportunities listed above which are enjoyed by medical advisors.\n[101] As noted above, it is sufficient to provide evidence that the practice had a disproportionate impact on women to establish the connection between the practice and the prohibited ground of discrimination. The evidence of the gender predominance of women in nursing and therefore, in the medical adjudicator position, establishes a prima facie case that the practice deprived the Complainants of employment opportunities on the basis of gender.\nIX. WHAT IS THE RESPONDENT'S EXPLANATION? [102] Once a prima facie breach of ss. 7 and 10 has been made out, the onus shifts to the Respondents to provide a reasonable, non-discriminatory explanation for their conduct.\n[103] In the present case, the Respondents have offered the following explanations with regard to both the s. 7 and the s. 10 complaints:\nThe most appropriate group of predominantly male workers to which the work of the female medical adjudicators should be compared is the group of male medical adjudicators. In comparison to this group, the female adjudicators have not been treated in an adverse differential manner; In the alternative, if the Tribunal determines that medical advisors constitute the appropriate comparator group, the work that is done by the advisors and the adjudicators is different. Any differences in treatment between the advisors and the adjudicators are based entirely on the difference in the work that is done, not on gender; In the further alternative, if the Tribunal determines that the Respondents have not rebutted the prima facie case under both provisions, the differential treatment and the practices are bona fide occupational requirements.\n(i) The Appropriate Comparator Group [104] The Respondents argued that male medical adjudicators constitute the most appropriate comparator group because they perform comparable functions using comparable levels of skill, effort and responsibility. The Respondents urged the Tribunal to take guidance from the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal in Prpich v. Pacific Shores Nature Resort Ltd., 2001 C.L.L.C. 230-035. That case involved a complaint under s. 13 of the British Columbia Human Rights Code which prohibits employers from paying different wages to employees of one sex than employees of the other sex who are performing similar or substantially similar work. Section 13(2) of the B.C. Code stipulates that the concepts of skill, effort and responsibility must be used to determine whether the work is similar or substantially similar.\n[105] Sections 7 and 10 do not prescribe the factors that must be taken into account in determining whether the impugned conduct is discriminatory. In contrast, s. 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, like s. 13 of the B.C. Human Rights Code, sets out the criteria that must be used to determine whether an employer has committed a discriminatory practice by establishing or maintaining differences in wages between male and female employees who are performing work of equal value. Those factors are skill, effort, responsibility and the conditions under which the work is performed.\n[106] In my view, the Prpich case is inapplicable to the present case. Prpich deals with legislative provisions from another jurisdiction that are comparable to s. 11 of the CHRA, rather than to ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[107] Moreover, the Respondents' argument that the male medical adjudicators' work should be compared to that of the female medical adjudicators is unreasonable. The male adjudicators are not a separate group, but rather are part of the predominantly female group of medical adjudicators. Therefore, by virtue of their membership in this group, they too are subject to any potential discriminatory difference in treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the medical advisors. A comparison of their work with that of the female adjudicators would not be a meaningful indicator of equal treatment of the overwhelmingly female population in the group. The Complainants in this case allege that their inferior working conditions are a function of the strong gender predominance of their occupational group. This allegation cannot be properly tested by examining the working conditions of this small male minority within their ranks.\n[108] Therefore, I maintain that the appropriate comparator group is the predominantly male group of medical advisors.\n(ii) The Work done by the Advisors is Different from the Work done by the Adjudicators [109] The Respondents argued that the evidence revealed that during all three time periods, the functions of the medical advisors and the adjudicators have been different. In support of this argument, the Respondents produced the job descriptions that applied during all three time periods for both positions.\n[110] The advisors' description states that they provide expert medical advice on more difficult and contentious disability cases; review and assess the quality of decision-making; contribute to professional development of other medical advisors and of medical adjudicators; communicate internally and externally regarding disability under the Canada Pension Plan; review and respond to requests for personal information under the Privacy Act and perform other duties.\n[111] The medical adjudicators' job description states that their key activities are: the medical adjudication of Canada Pension Plan Disability claims; providing applicant referral and navigation service; leading\/managing project teams including program design, services and policies; initiating and maintaining contact with representatives of the medical community, other departments and levels of government, the insurance industry, the public, etc. to maintain a critical knowledge of medical and disability issues, trends and emerging medical conditions.\n[112] The job descriptions suggest that the key difference between the work of the advisors and the adjudicators is, in fact, reflected in their respective job titles: the medical advisors fulfill more of a medical advisory and oversight function, while the medical adjudicators deal directly with the applicants in adjudicating their claims and providing referral services.\n[113] It is important, however, to consider the job descriptions together with the testimony of those who do the work and administer the program to determine if the job descriptions are an accurate reflection of the work that is done and was being done during the three time periods in question in this complaint.\n[114] Dr. Raymond Aubin, the Acting Director of the Medical Expertise Division, testified on behalf of the Respondents. His testimony was directed primarily at the differences in the work performed by the advisors and the adjudicators in the 1999 to the present time period.\n[115] He testified that currently, medical advisors are exclusively responsible for many of the decisions and actions taken in the last stage of the disability benefit appeal process - the Pension Appeals Board. It is the medical advisor who reviews the file, prepares the case summary and testifies before the PAB. The medical advisors currently spend roughly 75% of their time preparing for the PAB hearing. Some of that time is spent performing an overlapping function with medical adjudicators - developing the file for the hearing. However, the advisors have more decision-making authority at this stage of the process than the adjudicators.\n[116] The work done by the advisors in preparing for the PAB from 1999 until the present time was compared to the work done by some adjudicators in Manitoba who prepare for and appear before Review Tribunals. The evidence established that the work is indeed very similar to the PAB work, with some important differences. The adjudicator and the advisor must both apply their medical knowledge and their knowledge of the CPP disability benefit program to prepare for and present information to the respective decision-makers. However, it is only in Manitoba and Saskatchewan that medical adjudicators represent the Minister before the RT. In other provinces, the case summaries for the RT are prepared by employees who do not necessarily have a medical background, and no one appears on behalf of the Minister. Thus, it would appear that, with the exception of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, at the present time the presentation of expert medical information to a decision-maker is reserved for the final stage of appeal - the PAB. That function is performed exclusively by medical advisors.\n[117] Based on all the evidence presented in this case, I find that there are some functions which have only ever been performed by the medical advisors throughout the three time periods in this case. They are:\nsigning off on adjudicators' recommendations regarding eligibility from 1972-1989; providing expert medical advice to the adjudicators on 1-2% of the files during all time periods; authorizing decisions or recommendations regarding settlement, requests for leave to appeal to the PAB, and requests for further information at the PAB level from 1999 to the present; providing some training to adjudicators up until the past decade; reviewing the file, preparing case summaries and providing testimony before the Pension Appeal Board during all three time periods; providing Affidavit and viva voce evidence if required on judicial review applications of the PAB decisions at the present time.\n[118] Some of the Complainants admitted that there were differences in the work done by the advisors and the adjudicators. For example, Ms. Franklin candidly admitted that the medical advisors have a different role to play at a different level than she does. She stated however, that over the years, the advisors and the adjudicators have done many of the same functions. Furthermore, the core function is the same - the determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits.\n[119] In my view, Ms. Franklin's statement provides an excellent summary of the evidence that I heard in this case. Throughout the history of the CPP disability benefit program there has been, and continues to be, a significant overlap in the functions performed by the medical adjudicators and the advisors. However, the medical advisors' work is different from the adjudicators' work in certain respects. Unlike the adjudicators, the advisors have always provided an oversight and advisory role in the determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits. This role involves the provision of medical advice on difficult files, training, and final decision-making responsibility at certain levels of the process. In addition, the advisors provide expert medical testimony to the final decision-makers at the final appeal stage of the CPP disability benefit determination process - the Pension Appeals Board. The PAB is the last opportunity for the parties to obtain a determination on the merits of the file based on the medical evidence presented to that point.\n[120] The advisors bring a different kind of knowledge to the program, perform some different tasks and have been given different responsibilities than the adjudicators. This provides a reasonable and non-discriminatory explanation for some of the differences in salary and benefits. It also explains why the advisor and the adjudicator positions might occupy different levels within a classification standard in Health Services.\n[121] However, the differences in the work responsibilities of the respective positions are not extensive enough to explain the wide disparity in treatment between the advisors and the adjudicators. In particular, the Respondent has failed to provide a reasonable non-discriminatory response to the following question: why have the advisors been recognized as health professionals, and compensated accordingly, when their primary function is to make eligibility determinations and yet, when the adjudicators perform the same primary function, they are designated as program administrators and are paid half the salary of the advisors?\n[122] The Respondents argue that the answer to this question can be found in the decision of the Public Service Labour Relations Board (PSLRB). That case involved an application by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC) to have the medical adjudicators included in the Health Services Group. The PSLRB decided that medical adjudicators were appropriately classified as program administrators within the PA Group. The Respondents argued that the PSLRB decision provides a reasonable explanation for the differences in treatment between the two positions, and should be applied in the present context.\n[123] The PSLRB found that the adjudicator position did not belong in the Health Services Group since adjudicators do not provide direct health care to CPP disability benefit applicants. The Vice-Chair of the Board stated that although medical adjudicators use their medical knowledge to assess the applications and files of claimants, they do not assess the claimants themselves. Therefore, they do not provide care to the claimants as is required to be classified within the Health Services Group.\n[124] However, the evidence in this case leads me to conclude that if the medical adjudicators are not assessing the claimants when they determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits, then neither are the medical advisors. And yet, the advisors are recognized as health professionals and classified accordingly and the adjudicators are not. The PSLRB did not engage in a comparative analysis of the two positions, nor did it make a determination as to whether any such difference might violate the CHRA. For that reason, I find that the PSLRB's conclusion has very little bearing on my decision.\n[125] Patricia Power, the Acting Director General of Classification, Policy and Strategy at PSHRMAC, testified on behalf of the Respondents. She stated that medical advisors are included within the Health Services Group because they meet the Health Services Group Definition and the Medicine (MD) Classification Standard. Ms. Power stated that the adjudicators are not included within the Health Services Group because they do not meet the Health Services Group Definition or the Nursing (NU) Classification Standard.\n[126] To be included within the Health Services Group Definition, the position must meet the umbrella definition for the Health Services Group Definition, and then fall within an inclusion statement for the MD or the NU Classification Standards.\n[127] The umbrella definition for the Health Services Group states that the Group comprises positions that are primarily involved in the application of a comprehensive knowledge of professional specialties in the fields of medicine and nursing (among others) to the safety and physical and mental well-being of people.\n[128] Ms. Power testified that while the advisor position meets the umbrella definition for the Health Services Group, the adjudicator position does not meet that definition. The basis for her distinction would appear to be the fact that medical adjudication does not involve the use of nursing knowledge to provide direct patient care. However, as indicated above, the evidence established that neither position involves the use of nursing or medical knowledge to provide direct patient care in the way that is done in a clinical setting. Therefore, if the adjudicators do not meet the umbrella definition because they do not provide direct patient care, then on that basis, the advisors' position does not meet the definition either.\n[129] Nonetheless, in her testimony, Ms. Power went on to state that not only do the advisors meet the umbrella definition for the Health Services Group, they also fit within the MD Classification Standard because the position matches one of the inclusion statements provided in the MD definition. That is inclusion statement 5 which reads as follows: the assessment of medical fitness for the determination of disability and other federal government benefits ....\n[130] Ms. Power explained that historically, inclusion statement 5 has always been a part of the MD Classification Standard. In 1999, it was incorporated into a new definition of the Health Services Group through a process known as the Universal Classification System (UCS). Ms. Power stated that had the new definition of the Health Services Group, developed through the UCS process, been applied to the medical adjudicator position, it would have allowed medical adjudicators to be classified within the Health Services Group by virtue of inclusion statement 5.\n[131] However, as a result of a process that occurred in the late 90's, the new definition was modified and inclusion statement 5 was not applied to the adjudicators. Ms. Power explained that in 1993, Treasury Board was mandated under the Public Service Reform Act to reduce the number of Occupational Groups in the Public Service within 6 years. One of the conditions set out in the legislation was that bargaining unit affiliation was not to be changed by the reduction in Groups. To preserve bargaining unit affiliation, inclusion 5 was explicitly excluded from the NU Classification Standard and included in the MD Standard. The reason for this was that to allow inclusion statement 5 to apply to the adjudicators would have meant moving them out of the bargaining unit represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and into a bargaining unit represented by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada. Ms. Power stated that the intent of the 1999 process was to avoid a change in bargaining unit affiliation.\n[132] Ms. Power also stated, however, that the 1999 process was not intended to indefinitely freeze the composition of the bargaining units. She stated that changes could have been made to the classifications that would have resulted in changes to the bargaining units had there been a good reason to do so.\n[133] Ms. Power agreed that one good reason for making a change to the Classification Standards in the Health Services Group would have been to eliminate gender inequities. She admitted that had there been a gender inequity in the classification system, the 1999 process would have had the unintended effect of carrying that inequity forward into the present. Ms. Power stated that had the 1999 process introduced or re-introduced gender bias, it would have been Treasury Board's responsibility to re-define the Group Definitions and Classification Standards in order to remove the bias. Treasury Board has the exclusive authority under s. 7 of the Public Service Labour Relations Act to determine classifications. Bargaining unit approval is not required to make changes to the classification standards.\n[134] However, bargaining unit approval is exactly what Treasury Board and PSHRMAC stated that they required in their response to the Business Case proposed by Social Development Canada to change the NU Classification Standard. Treasury Board Secretariat indicated that it would only consider a change to the Health Services Occupational Group definition when there was a sound business case to do so and when all parties, including the bargaining agents, supported the change.\n[135] In its Response to the Business Case, Treasury Board also maintained that the primary purpose of medical adjudication is not the application of nursing knowledge to the safety and physical well-being of people or the assessment of medical fitness. It is the administration of a government program.\n[136] In my view, if the medical advisors are deemed to be applying their medical knowledge to the safety and physical well-being of people and assessing medical fitness for the purpose of determining eligibility, then the adjudicators should also be deemed to be doing the same for the purposes of classification. The Respondents have failed to provide a reasonable, non-discriminatory reason for the differential application of the principles of classification in the Public Service. They have failed to explain their refusal to recognize the professional nature of the work done by a group of predominantly female workers when they are performing essentially the same core function as predominantly male workers whose work receives professional recognition.\n[137] Similarly, the Respondents have not provided a reasonable, non-discriminatory explanation for treating the adjudicators differently from the advisors with respect to the payment of professional fees and educational\/training opportunities and the provision of career advancement opportunities. The adjudicators use their medical expertise to determine eligibility, just as advisors do. They are health professionals and should be provided with the same employment advantages and opportunities for career development and advancement that other health professionals have in the Public Service.\n[138] Treasury Board had the exclusive power to make changes to the Classifications Standards with or without bargaining unit approval. Treasury Board could have decided that the Nursing Classification Standard was going to revert back to the one that was developed through the UCS process which included inclusion statement 5. Or, a new Classification Standard within the Health Services Group could have been developed that included the work done by both adjudicators and advisors. Indeed, Treasury Board had the prerogative to take any action it saw fit, provided the professional qualifications of the adjudicators were recognized commensurately with the professional qualifications of the advisors. Treasury Board did not exercise this authority.\n(iii) Have the Respondents established that the differential treatment is a bona fide occupational requirement? [139] Subsections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA provide a defense to discriminatory conduct and practices where it is established that they are based on a bona fide occupational requirement. To constitute a BFOR, the Respondents must establish that accommodating the needs of the individuals would cause them undue hardship having regard to health, safety and cost.\n[140] The only factor that applies in this case is cost. The Respondents did not provide evidence that the cost of treating the adjudicators the same as the advisors with respect to professional recognition, the payment of licensing fees, and the provision of training and educational opportunities would cause them undue hardship.\n[141] Marc Thibodeau, a negotiator with the Treasury Board Secretariat, testified that a change in the adjudicators' classification and the resulting impact on salary levels would affect the way that similar positions within the Public Service were classified and remunerated. For example, disability claims adjudication at the Department of Veterans Affairs is done by employees who are also classified as PM-4. The recognition of the medical adjudicators' professional expertise in the present case could result in a review of the classification levels of adjudicators in departments like Veterans Affairs. This, in turn, might cause a significant increase in the Public Service payroll.\n[142] Almost invariably there is a cost involved in providing a workplace that is free from discrimination. Often increased cost is provided as a reason for refusing to deal with a problem of discrimination in the workplace. However, it is only when the cost of redressing the discrimination is so high that it would cause the Respondent undue financial hardship that the conduct will be considered a bona fide occupational requirement. The Respondents provided no evidence that the classification of medical adjudicators as health professionals would cause them undue financial hardship.\nX. CONCLUSION REGARDING LIABILITY UNDER SECTIONS 7 AND 10 OF THE ACT [143] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Complainants have established that the Respondents' refusal since March of 1978, to recognize the professional nature of the work performed by the medical adjudicators in a manner proportionate to the professional recognition accorded to the work of the medical advisors, is a discriminatory practice within the meaning of both ss. 7 and 10. The effects of the practice have been to deprive the adjudicators of professional recognition and remuneration commensurate with their qualifications, and to deprive them of payment of their licensing fees, as well as training and career advancement opportunities on the same basis as the advisors.\nXI. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY IN THIS CASE? [144] Section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA provides the Tribunal with the authority to order the Respondents to cease the discriminatory practice and to take measures, in consultation with the Commission, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future. The parties requested that, in the event that I found the complaints to be substantiated, I make an order that the discriminatory practice cease, but that I refrain from specifying the measures that should be taken to redress the practice. They asked to be given an opportunity to negotiate the appropriate measures to be taken with all of the stakeholders. I am in agreement with this request. Accordingly, I make the following Order, but retain jurisdiction over this aspect of my decision in the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement:\nThe Respondents are ordered to cease the discriminatory practice identified in paragraph 143 above.\n[145] A case conference will be scheduled for three months from the date of this decision at which time the parties will provide the Tribunal with a report on the negotiations. On that date also, a deadline will be set by the Tribunal for the final resolution of any outstanding matters arising from this aspect of the decision. If resolution is not achieved by the deadline, I will make a final determination after the parties have had an opportunity to present evidence, if necessary, and argument on remedy.\n[146] Section 53(2)(c) provides the Tribunal with the authority to order that the Respondents compensate the victims for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victims as a result of the discriminatory practices. Given my order above in relation to s. 53(2)(a), and its possible impact on remuneration, I feel it is appropriate to reserve jurisdiction, on the same terms, in relation to any relief under s. 52(2)(c).\n[147] Section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA provides the Tribunal with the authority to award compensation for the pain and suffering experienced by the victims as a result of the discriminatory practice. I heard evidence from Ms. Walden and the three other Complainants who testified in this case about the frustration, demoralization and loss of self-esteem that they experienced as a result of the Respondents' refusal to recognize their professional expertise. On that basis, I am prepared to order that some compensation should be provided to the Complainants under s. 53(2)(e). However, I have some questions regarding quantum which were not addressed during the hearing. For example, should a Complainant who has only been employed in the Program since February of 2007 receive the same compensation for pain and suffering as a Complainant who has been employed since 1993? I will reserve jurisdiction on the issue of quantum in the same terms as set out above. I encourage the parties to come to an agreement on this issue failing which, as with the above-noted issues, I will conclusively determine the matter.\n[148] The Commission and the Complainants argued that the Tribunal should order compensation under s. 53(3) of the CHRA. That provision authorizes the Tribunal to award compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim where the respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly. I find that an order for compensation under s. 53(3) is not appropriate in the present circumstances. This is a case of adverse effect discrimination where the unintended effect of a practice has been to expose a disproportionate number of women to unfavourable treatment. I was convinced by the sincerity and forthrightness of Ms. Powers' testimony that had she and other members of the Respondent group realized that discriminatory practices were occurring or had been carried over unintentionally through the 1999 negotiations with the bargaining agents, Treasury Board would have exercised its prerogative to take the appropriate corrective action. As such, I find no evidence of willful or reckless conduct warranting an order for compensation under s. 53(3).\n[149] As noted above, I shall retain jurisdiction to deal with the three outstanding issues that have been left to the parties to negotiate. The three month progress report, and the deadline for the resolution of these matters applies with respect to all three issues.\nSigned by\nKaren A.

(the respondent), informed the Tribunal, for the first time, that his client had presented to its creditors a proposal under the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the Bankruptcy Act). The first meeting of creditors took place on October 18, 2002. The proposal was accepted by the creditors and went into effect on November 5, 2003. In turn, the trustee was discharged on March 17, 2004. When asked why he had waited until the first day of the hearing to raise this issue, Mr. Jobidon said that he had only recently been informed of this fact.\nThe respondent's submissions [2] Mr. Jobidon argued that this proposal had the effect of removing the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear this matter or, at the very least, made any order against his client unenforceable. To support his claims, he relied inter alia on subsection 69.1(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides:\n69.1 (1) Subject to subsections (2) to (6) and sections 69.4 and 69.5, on the filing of a proposal under subsection 62(1) in respect of an insolvent person,\n(a) no creditor has any remedy against the insolvent person or the insolvent person's property, or shall commence or continue any action, execution or other proceedings, for the recovery of a claim provable in bankruptcy, until the trustee has been discharged or the insolvent person becomes bankrupt;\n(b) no provision of a security agreement between the insolvent person and a secured creditor that provides, in substance, that on\n(i) the insolvent person's insolvency,\n(ii) the default by the insolvent person of an obligation under the security agreement, or\n(iii) the filing of a notice of intention under section 50.4 or of a proposal under subsection 62(1) in respect of the insolvent person,\nthe insolvent person ceases to have such rights to use or deal with assets secured under the agreement as the insolvent person would otherwise have, has any force or effect until the trustee has been discharged or the insolvent person becomes bankrupt;\n(c) Her Majesty in right of Canada may not exercise Her rights under subsection 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act or any provision of the Canada Pension Plan or of the Employment Insurance Act that refers to subsection 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act and provides for the collection of a contribution, as defined in the Canada Pension Plan, or an employee's premium, or employer's premium, as defined in the Employment Insurance Act, and of any related interest, penalties or other amounts, in respect of the insolvent person where the insolvent person is a tax debtor under that subsection or provision, until\n(d) Her Majesty in right of a province may not exercise Her rights under any provision of provincial legislation that has a similar purpose to subsection 224(1.2) of the Income Tax Act, or that refers to that subsection, to the extent that it provides for the collection of a sum, and of any related interest, penalties or other amounts, where the sum\n(i) has been withheld or deducted by a person from a payment to another person and is in respect of a tax similar in nature to the income tax imposed on individuals under the Income Tax Act, or\n(ii) is of the same nature as a contribution under the Canada Pension Plan if the province is a province providing a comprehensive pension plan as defined in subsection 3(1) of the Canada Pension Plan and the provincial legislation establishes a provincial pension plan as defined in that subsection,\nin respect of the insolvent person where the insolvent person is a debtor under the provincial legislation, until\n(iii) the trustee has been discharged,\n(iv) six months have elapsed following court approval of the proposal, or\n(v) the insolvent person becomes bankrupt.\n[3] According to this provision, if the proposal is accepted by the creditors, no creditor has any remedy against the debtor, in this case the respondent, or against the debtor's property, without leave of the court. A proposal is a contract between a debtor and a debtor's creditors. When it is accepted by these creditors and approved by the court, all of the creditors are bound by it. Accordingly, in this case, the respondent's creditors who accepted the proposal could not be granted leave to commence or continue enforcement proceedings against the debtor for the balance of their claim without challenging the very essence of the proposal and its acceptance. I note that, according to the evidence filed at the hearing, the complainant was not included in the proposal between the respondent and its creditors.\n[4] Section 69.4 of the Bankruptcy Act in turn provides:\n69.4 A creditor who is affected by the operation of sections 69 to 69.31 or any other person affected by the operation of section 69.31 may apply to the court for a declaration that those sections no longer operate in respect of that creditor or person, and the court may make such a declaration, subject to any qualifications that the court considers proper, if it is satisfied\n(a) that the creditor or person is likely to be materially prejudiced by the continued operation of those sections; or\n(b) that it is equitable on other grounds to make such a declaration.\n[5] According to this provision, a creditor affected by section 69.1 must seek leave from the court to commence or continue legal proceedings. Mr. Jobidon therefore inferred from this that the complainant could not proceed before the Tribunal without first seeking leave of the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec. He added that she would not be exempt from this obligation unless she fell under one of the exceptions provided under subsection 178(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which states:\n178. (1) An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from\n(a) any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order, imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail;\n(a.1) any award of damages by a court in civil proceedings in respect of\n(i) bodily harm intentionally inflicted, or sexual assault, or\n(ii) wrongful death resulting therefrom;\n(b) any debt or liability for alimony or alimentary pension;\n(c) any debt or liability arising under a judicial decision establishing affiliation or respecting support or maintenance, or under an agreement for maintenance and support of a spouse, former spouse, former common-law partner or child living apart from the bankrupt;\n(d) any debt or liability arising out of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity or, in the Province of Quebec, as a trustee or administrator of the property of others;\n(e) any debt or liability for obtaining property by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation;\n(f) liability for the dividend that a creditor would have been entitled to receive on any provable claim not disclosed to the trustee, unless the creditor had notice or knowledge of the bankruptcy and failed to take reasonable action to prove his claim;\n(g) any debt or obligation in respect of a loan made under the Canada Student Loans Act, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act or any enactment of a province that provides for loans or guarantees of loans to students where the date of bankruptcy of the bankrupt occurred\n(i) before the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student, as the case may be, under the applicable Act or enactment, or\n(ii) within ten years after the date on which the bankrupt ceased to be a full- or part-time student; or\n(h) any debt for interest owed in relation to an amount referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (g).\n[6] It is obvious that the complainant does not fall under any of these exceptions. Mr. Jobidon therefore drew the conclusion that since she had not sought leave from the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec to continue her proceeding before the Tribunal and since none of the exceptions provided under subsection 178(1) applied, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to continue the hearing of this complaint.\nDecision [7] A proposal is a contract between a debtor and his creditors. These proposals are covered by Part III of the Bankruptcy Act, which contains the applicable provisions. The debtor who files a proposal is an insolvent person within the meaning of section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, but is not a bankrupt.\n[8] According to section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, the word person includes a corporation but the definition of insolvent person excludes those who are bankrupt. In this case, Mr. Jobidon, who had the burden of establishing that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the matter, did not file any evidence establishing that the respondent was an insolvent person or a bankrupt when its proposal was filed. I thereby infer that at that time Groupe Major Express Inc. was insolvent and not bankrupt.\n[9] In the context of a proposal, trustees do not take possession of the property and therefore cannot dispose of it as they would in the case of a bankrupt. Indeed, the trustee's powers in regard to the possession and disposal of a bankrupt's property should be distinguished from those of the same trustee acting during the proposal of an insolvent person. Despite the trustee's intervention, the debtor is still the owner of its business. The trustee is then considered to be an agent and not a grantee. The Bankruptcy Act allows insolvent persons to submit proposals to their creditors without first assigning their property to the official receiver. Debtors thereby keep their property and continue to administer it. (Darabaner v. Imperial Bank of Canada, [1960] S.C. 411; Appolo Refrigeration Inc. v. Office de construction du Qu\u00e9bec, [1976] S.C. 1716; commented on by Boh\u00e9mier, A. Proposition pr\u00e9ventive - refus des cr\u00e9anciers - cession r\u00e9troactive - d\u00e9termination des cr\u00e9ances admissibles, (1977) 37 R. du B. 229.)\n[10] According to the Bankruptcy Act, if the creditors refuse a proposal, the debtor is deemed to have made an assignment of his property on the date the proposal was filed. However, if the creditors accept the proposal, the trustee must immediately apply to the court to have the proposal approved (see section 58 of the Bankruptcy Act.) A proposal accepted by the creditors and approved by the court is binding on creditors with claims provable contemplated by the proposal (subsection 62(2) of the Bankruptcy Act). In such a case, the debtor continues to do business but must comply with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act in regard to proposals and the limitations resulting from the proposal. The debtor becomes a bankrupt and is presumed to have made an assignment of his property only in cases where the debtor's creditors refuse the proposal. (Appolo Refrigeration Inc. v. Office de construction du Qu\u00e9bec, supra)\n[11] In this case, we can infer from the evidence filed at the hearing that the proposal was accepted by the respondent's creditors and approved by the court. The accepted and approved proposal was never filed. Therefore, the Tribunal does not know what it contains. Further, Mr. Jobidon did not file any evidence regarding the enforcement of this proposal.\n[12] Following my analysis of the Bankruptcy Act regarding proposals and the state of the evidence filed by the respondent, I find that the fact that the respondent filed a proposal does not have any effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear this complaint. The respondent is still in business in a case where a proposal has been accepted and approved. None of the respondent's arguments have persuaded me that it was, on that basis, released from its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[13] For these reasons, I find that the Tribunal still has jurisdiction to hear this complaint. The parties shall therefore within 10 days of this decision advise the Tribunal of their dates of availability in the next three months for a three-day hearing. Should the parties not comply with this direction, the Tribunal shall set the hearing dates. Should one of the parties not have any date available in the next three months, it shall provide the Tribunal with sufficient reasons to explain its unavailability. The Tribunal will then decide the merits of those claims.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario December 19, 2007\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1179\/6106\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Magaly Germain v.

INTRODUCTION [1] By October 19, 1999 Dan Durrer had worked for one company - the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) - for over 28 years. On that day, he was notified that his position was to be eliminated and his employment terminated. He was 48 years old. His job was one of many that was eliminated as part of a company-wide downsizing and restructuring plan. He stayed on in three temporary positions with the Bank for 2.5 years, until finally, not having secured another position, his moving date of termination crystallized on April 12, 2002.\n[2] On July 23, 2002, Mr. Durrer filed a Complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) alleging that CIBC had discriminated against him on the basis of age, in violation of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The Commission referred the Complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) on January 30, 2006. The Commission has chosen not to participate in the hearing portion of the inquiry, while still remaining a party. The hearing of the evidence took place in November 2006. These are my Reasons for Decision.\nII. MR. DURRER'S COMPLAINT [3] The exact nature of the Complaint appeared to be different from inception to the hearing. What exactly was the basis of Mr. Durrer's Complaint? In his Complaint Form filed with the Commission under the section Allegation, Mr. Durrer states: I, Dan Durrer, allege that the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce discriminated against me in employment by terminating my employment on the ground of age (50) in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Since he indicated age 50, that would suggest that the basis of his Complaint crystallized on April 12, 2002 - his last day of work. The rest of the Complaint focuses on the events in that time-frame, and not on the initial decision to eliminate his position and not redeploy him in the new Compliance Department.\n[4] In the Statement of Particulars - in essence his pleading - filed by Mr. Durrer's counsel with the Tribunal, the Complainant focuses on discrimination based on age and years of pensionable service. The Complainant pleads that CIBC developed a policy of dismissing employees who were close to retirement, depriving those employees of a job simply by stint of their age. The Statement of Particulars underscores CIBC's alleged refusal to let Mr. Durrer take a fourth temporary job and attempt to reach the bridgeable age of 53 plus two-years' worth of severance to get that immediate, unreduced pension. CIBC terminated Mr. Durrer at age 50.5 in an effort to defeat Mr. Durrer's pension entitlement and its pension obligations. Further on, he writes:\nMr. Durrer was precluded from receiving the benefit of the pension offered to employees who were 53 years of age at the time of their termination, because CIBC would not allow him to extend his career with CIBC through [temporary] term assignments. CIBC's actions constitute adverse differentiation in employment contrary to section 7(b) of the CHRA, and is pursuant to a policy that deprived Mr. Durrer of employment opportunities contrary to section 10 of the CHRA.\n[5] Counsel for CIBC filed its Statement of Particulars - its responding pleading - inter alia, objecting to the Complainant's addition of the section 10 aspect to the Complaint, saying it appeared for the first time in the Complainant's pleading. The Complainant did not file a Reply. In his opening statement, CIBC's counsel raised the section 10 issue and said that he would wait to see how Mr. Durrer's case is going to go in. Complainant's counsel did not mention section 10 in his very brief opening statement. By the end of the hearing, no further mention of a section 10 violation per se had arisen. Counsel for the Complainant did not make submissions about it in final argument, except for one brief reference. That reference was to a statement in CIBC's pleading, found in the Bank's in the alternative response on the merits to the section 10 allegation in the Complainant's pleading. CIBC's counsel did not make submissions about a section 10 violation in closing argument. In the Complainant's Book of Authorities, two B.C. Human Rights Tribunal decisions dealing with the power to amend complaints are included. However, counsel for the Complainant made no submissions about them. I also note importantly that the Complainant never sought to amend the Complaint to add section 10. I interpret the above as an abandonment of the allegation that CIBC violated section 10 of the CHRA. In the alternative, I find that by the end of the hearing, CIBC had a reasonable expectation that I would be considering the evidence and argument from the perspective of a section 7 violation only. For me to consider a section 10 violation at this point would constitute a denial of fairness and natural justice. Accordingly, I will consider the evidence and argument only as they relate to a violation of subsections 7(a) and 7(b) of the CHRA.\n[6] While the Complainant's pleading and the testimony of Mr. Durrer focused on CIBC's alleged refusal to allow the Complainant to continue to work in temporary assignments to the bridgeable age of 53, I did hear evidence about whether the initial decision to eliminate Mr. Durrer's Compliance position was discriminatory. And evidence was led and argument made by the Complainant's counsel about whether Mr. Young's decision not to redeploy Mr. Durrer in the newly revamped Compliance Department constituted discrimination based on age. In closing argument, counsel for the Complainant succinctly stated that the section 7 violation in this case was two-fold: first, when the termination decision was made by Mr. Young because age was a factor; and then, in March-April 2002 when Human Resources thwarted his attempt to get a fourth temporary job and his employment came to an end.\nIII. ISSUES [7] I deal with the following issues:\nDid CIBC eliminate Mr. Durrer's position in October 1999 on account of his age; Did CIBC decide to not transfer Mr. Durrer to another position in the same department (Compliance) on account of his age; and Did CIBC interfere with Mr. Durrer's attempts to seek redeployment within CIBC because of his age.\nIV. FINDINGS OF FACT [8] In this section, I make my findings of fact, including those derived from the Agreed Statement of Facts filed.\nA. Background [9] Dan Durrer was born on October 9, 1951. He joined CIBC in January 1971. He had a Grade 12 diploma. He worked his way up through the Bank, holding various branch line and regional office positions. From 1994 until his last day of work in 2002, Mr. Durrer worked in the Head Office in Toronto in various positions. At the time of his notice of termination on October 19, 1999, Mr. Durrer held the executive position of Director, Business Risk and Control Consulting, Retail Banking, in one of the Bank's three Compliance Departments. He was 48 years old.\n[10] According to the Agreed Statement of Facts, Throughout his employment with CIBC, Mr. Durrer was a dedicated and loyal employee who received numerous promotions and commendations from his superiors including two Chairman's awards for outstanding performance. By his own admission, he was a generalist in a workplace that was becoming more specialized.\nB. Company-wide Restructuring and Downsizing [11] In 1999, CIBC hired a new President and CEO, John Hunkin. The new CEO directed a company-wide downsizing and restructuring program, to make CIBC more competitive, among other goals. I accept the evidence that this was a tough time for CIBC financially. The restructuring resulted in approximately 2,500 jobs being eliminated. Mr. Durrer's was one of them. The internal e-mail that was sent to executives and managers (including Mr. Durrer) on September 27, 1999, directing them to distribute it to staff, reads in part:\nCIBC's commitment to bring its cost base into line with that of our competitors will result in significant restructuring activity over the coming months...\nThis CIBC restructuring initiative is likely to result in fewer redeployment opportunities for staff in the immediate future. Therefore, we need to provide more flexibility to employees whose jobs have been eliminated - greater flexibility to explore career opportunities outside CIBC earlier, and more support to sustain what might be a longer job search externally.\n[12] The e-mail clearly states that there would be fewer redeployment opportunities and employees would be encouraged to look for jobs outside CIBC. I accept Mr. Durrer's evidence that he did not believe the restructuring would affect him and his job would be eliminated, although as early as when he received this e-mail, he knew that big changes were coming soon.\n[13] I find that part of the restructuring involved the elimination of waste and duplication and involved a degree of cost-cutting. That is to be expected from such a process. The evidence does not suggest a targeting of older workers or the elimination of jobs on the basis of an employee's age. For example, in his viva voce evidence and his expert's report, Michael Banks, an expert on pensions and actuarial science and partner at Mercer Human Resources Consulting, outlined the experience rates of termination of employees covered by the ETSP program which are included in our report on the Actuarial Valuation of the CIBC Pension Plan as at October 31, 2005. In the age category of 21-30 years, there was a rate of ETSP termination of one percent for each age in that range. In the age category of 31-52 years, it was 1.5 percent for each age in that range. His conclusion was: The experienced rate of termination under the ETSP program is uniform for employees aged anywhere between 31 and 52. There is no indication of selection by age in this range. I accept Mr. Banks' evidence.\nC. Employment Continuity Policy (EC) and Restructuring Support Program (RSP) [14] In 1992 and 1993, CIBC created its Employment Continuity policy (EC) and Restructuring Support Program (RSP) respectively. EC and RSP worked in tandem to give employees who lost their jobs through position elimination the opportunity to either redeploy themselves into another position within the Bank, or if they could not do this, to receive a severance package and other benefits, including counseling, vocational rehabilitation, and legal and financial advice, to assist them in transitioning into employment outside CIBC.\n[15] One of the most significant benefits offered to qualifying employees affected by the restructuring concerned the Bank's pension plan. For these employees, if they were 55 years of age at the date of their termination, or if they were between 53 and 55 years of age and their severance entitlement (a two-year maximum) would be sufficient to bridge them to age 55, they would be entitled to have the normal early retirement actuarial reduction under the pension plan waived. In other words, they would be eligible to receive an immediate, unreduced pension upon leaving the Bank. In normal circumstances, if they elected to retire at age 55, they could receive an immediate, reduced pension or a deferred, unreduced pension at age 65. This waiver of the early retirement pension reduction was a significant benefit to those employees terminated during this period. I accept the evidence of pensions expert Michael Banks that this was a very generous benefit, and uncommon in the workplace. At page 3 of his report, he writes that over the course of a 4-year period ending October 31, 2004, there were 1,795 terminations of employment at CIBC of employees aged 20-53 and 700 retirements at age 55 and over (including those individuals between 53-55 years old who were bridged to age 55).\n[16] As will be addressed later, the core of Mr. Durrer's Complaint is that CIBC didn't allow him to continue to work to the bridgeable age of 53 years. Had he been permitted, with his maximum 24-month severance period, he would have reached the target age of 55 years. He then would have been entitled to the pension reduction waiver and an immediate, unreduced pension. Thus, CIBC's actions prevented him from accessing this benefit. CIBC responded by saying that Mr. Durrer simply did not qualify for this generous benefit which it was not legally required to provide to its terminated employees in the first place. Mr. Durrer was 48 years old in October 1999 when he received notice that his position in the Compliance Department would be eliminated, effective January 7, 2000. Even after his subsequent three temporary positions over a 2.5 year period (he was 50.5 years old at that point) and his 2-year severance are added to the mix, he would be at the 52.5 yard post - still 2.5 years short of the bridging requirement.\n[17] CIBC introduced one-time amendments to its RSP, effective September 1, 1999. It established working notice period payouts and enhanced severance to employees in Canada who were given notice of job elimination as a result of the restructuring. I accept the evidence of the Bank that some employees were successful in obtaining temporary positions (e.g., Mr. Durrer) that allowed them the opportunity to either develop new skills to get a new permanent position or to give them additional time to find a job outside CIBC. As will be dealt with later, the intention or goal of its program was not to allow employees to use the vehicle of temporary jobs or assignments to accumulate time to qualify for pension bridging, but simply as a means to an end of finding a permanent job within CIBC or transitioning to work outside CIBC.\nD. Introduction of the Employee Transition Support Program (ETSP) [18] In April 2001, CIBC introduced its Employee Transition Support Program (ETSP) which replaced EC and RSP. Employees were given the option to either remain on EC and RSP or elect to be in ETSP. Mr. Durrer elected to participate in ETSP - the benefits under ETSP were greater than under the former programs. While he would continue to receive a 2-year severance amount, the dollar amount of the total package (including other supports) was greater under ETSP. The waiver of early retirement pension reductions was the same, and for Mr. Durrer, he still did not qualify for this generous benefit.\n[19] One notable difference between the former and latter programs concerned the formal role of the supporting manager. Under ETSP, while the supporting manager would assist the terminated employee in finding alternate work, the onus was on the employee to be more responsible and accountable for his\/her job search. As will be seen later, regardless of what program Mr. Durrer was under at a given time, he was very proactive and showed a lot of initiative in seeking permanent and temporary work within CIBC. He was not so diligent with regard to searching for work outside CIBC. He testified: So there was absolutely no doubt, my job search was focused internally. Later, he stated:\nBut as I said earlier and I will say it numerous timing [sic] again, I had a lot invested in CIBC. My life, my working lifetime, was invested there. I had substantial investment in the pension fund and I had a career that I loved.\nI guess in my own mind I wasn't going to just go away, I was going to go out fighting, and I think that I did that for the balance of my time at CIBC.\nE. Restructuring in the Compliance Departments [20] The new CEO appointed a new Senior Vice-President for Compliance - the Bank's Chief Compliance Officer. This individual, Eric Young, was brought in from the New York office and commuted back and forth from New York to Toronto. He was entrusted with the responsibility of developing a new Compliance Department bank-wide. At that time, CIBC had three Compliance Departments - one in the Personal & Commercial group; one in World Markets; and one in the Corporate Centre. He ultimately decided to consolidate the three departments into a single, integrated and effective department. I accept Mr. Young's evidence that while cost-cutting was a factor or consideration (albeit not a driving one), he was given no mandate or direction regarding the amount of costs to reduce or how to go about it. The goal from his perspective was not to reduce costs but to come up with an effective compliance function. In fact, he testified that any cost-savings from his exercise would probably need to be reinvested in the end product. He was given no specific budget ceiling.\n[21] From Mr. Young's perspective, much needed to be done in his task. In his testimony, he referred to his contemporaneous handwritten notes which were entered as an exhibit. The notes outlined the old world of compliance at the Bank vs. the new world that he envisaged. When he arrived, the Compliance Departments were fraught with duplication, sometimes triplication of functions, part-time in nature, and too passive. He envisaged going from three Compliance Departments to one, where the Department would be multi-disciplinarian in nature (i.e., composed of lawyers, accountants, etc.). The compliance officers would be more proactive (not sitting in an ivory tower issuing notices of compliance policy...or regulatory changes to the business users), full-time and possess specialized training and expertise. He wanted his compliance officers to be more institutionally independent, like auditors. The new world of compliance was to look very different from the old world. Reform and restructuring were also key, according to Mr. Young, because of the changing nature of compliance in the banking industry. It was growing more complex, with greater legislative and regulatory pressures. The risk exposure to the Bank was also increasing. His overriding goal was to protect the Bank overall.\n[22] Part of the restructuring of Compliance would affect the personnel in the three Compliance Departments. He testified that he had no preconceived notions regarding how many positions would be left. What was certain is that there would be fewer. This is not surprising given his view that there was duplication, and sometimes triplication occurring in the compliance functions at CIBC. One area of redundancy was at the management levels of the three Compliance Departments.\n(i) The Process Used by Mr. Young [23] Mr. Young had to decide which positions to keep, which were to be eliminated and which ones would be modified or restructured. And of course, what to do with the employees who held these positions in the three Compliance Departments. He interviewed various people in the Compliance Departments, especially the executives\/managers and compliance officers. He also spoke with the business people (the CIBC employees who would liaise and interact with the compliance officers) to get their perspectives on compliance functions and their opinion about various managers\/officers in compliance: whether they added value. In addition, Mr. Young consulted with Human Resources, including Cindy Nicholls, Senior Human Resources Consultant, who would deal with Mr. Durrer in the ensuing years.\n[24] Importantly, Mr. Young interviewed (sometimes more than once) all employees whose positions he was considering to eliminate or whose employment he was considering to terminate. He also looked at their performance records and personnel files.\n(ii) The Criteria Used by Mr. Young [25] CIBC entered into evidence excerpts from Mr. Young's notebook, which he made in the fall of 1999 and handed over to CIBC when he left its employ. Much was made in examination-in-chief and cross-examination regarding these excerpts. Suffice to say that they involved short-form notes with arrows and were diagram-like. They certainly were not prose-like or written in complete sentences. His memory was fairly good, notwithstanding the events took place over seven years ago.\n[26] Having carefully examined the excerpts from his notebook and his testimony about them, I find that Mr. Young considered the following major factors when deciding whether to keep an employee in compliance:\nDid the employee understand what compliance is and means; How much regulatory or compliance experience (including education) did the employee possess; and What were the perceptions of the business people regarding the compliance employee and whether he or she added value to the new world model of the Compliance Department.\n[27] From reviewing the evidence of Mr. Young, I find that, to a lesser degree, he also factored in the compensation (salary and benefits) of various employees in deciding whether to keep them. One of the notebook excerpts on its face could have been used as a basis for his assessment as to whether to keep those employees and\/or as a performance assessment for awarding bonuses or team dollars to them, which Mr. Young testified occurred during the same period (October 1999). In re-examination, he said the notes were used for both purposes. I accept his evidence on this point.\n[28] I also find that Mr. Young was not just determining who to keep and who to terminate in the three Compliance Departments. He was also looking at which positions to keep, which to eliminate and which to split and distribute to other positions. This included examining the question of redundancy of management level positions (like Mr. Durrer's) in the three Compliance Departments.\n(iii) The Result: Positions Were Eliminated and Employment Was Terminated [29] I accept Mr. Young's evidence that this function was not an easy task. Based on the evidence, I find that the result of Mr. Young's decisions was a single Compliance Department with a diversified composition by gender, age, background and experience.\n[30] Two charts created by CIBC and a contemporaneous handwritten note of Mr. Young were entered into evidence regarding the age composition of employees whose positions were eliminated\/employment terminated and those retained by him. The evidence suggests that the employees in the merged and modified chart below were executives\/managers in Compliance.\nEmployees Positions Eliminated2\nNAME AGE AT RESTRUCTURING AGE RELATIVE TO MR. DURRER1\nDan Durrer 48 --\nEmployee A 51 older\nEmployee B 49 older\nEmployee C 44 younger\nEmployee D 38 younger\nEmployee E 40 younger\nEmployees Retained\nNAME AGE AT RESTRUCTURING AGE RELATIVE TO MR. DURRER1\nEmployee F 52 older\nEmployee G 52 older\nEmployee H 59 older\nEmployee I 40 younger\n1This column was added by me.\n2One of the charts had the headings Employees Positions Eliminated and Employees Retained. The other chart read Retained and Terminated. From reviewing the viva voce and documentary evidence, I believe that those managers whose positions were eliminated, also had their employment terminated.\n[31] The above chart shows that the employees who were retained (except for Employee I) were the three oldest ones, including Employee H who was 11 years older than Mr. Durrer. Further, three of the employees whose positions were eliminated were younger than Mr. Durrer. I will deal with the significance of this later in these Reasons. Suffice to say that it is probative evidence that there was no targeting by Mr. Young of Mr. Durrer or others on account of their respective ages.\nF. Mr. Young's Consideration of Mr. Durrer and His Position [32] Mr. Young made the decision to eliminate Mr. Durrer's position and not to redeploy him within the new Compliance Department. He averred that Mr. Durrer's position - Director, Business Risk and Control Consulting, Retail Banking - was redundant and unnecessary and that he had transferred approximately fifty percent of its functions and responsibilities to other employees in the Bank. Regarding his decision to eliminate Mr. Durrer's position, Mr. Young stated: I didn't need that many people to do these different activities [such as Mr. Durrer's duties] within the department. What he meant was that he did not need a full-time manager to carry out Mr. Durrer's duties. The Complainant did not challenge this evidence.\n[33] The focus of Mr. Durrer's testimony was not about the bona fides of Mr. Young's decision to eliminate his position, or even that he wasn't redeployed within Compliance. Rather, Mr. Durrer was upset that CIBC ended his then-28-month extended working notice period in April 2002, preventing him from getting a fourth temporary job (and a fifth if required) to get him to the magic age of 53 years, and thus bridgeable to 55 and the immediate, unreduced pension. The irony is, if Mr. Durrer had gotten a permanent job within CIBC (as he claims he was seeking as well as temporary jobs), he would no longer have been eligible for ETSP and therefore, not entitled to either a severance package or the pension bridging benefit - the latter of which has been his focus throughout this case (the brass ring as CIBC's counsel puts it). I find that Mr. Young had legitimate, business reasons, untainted by Mr. Durrer's age, for arriving at his decision to eliminate Mr. Durrer's position. I acknowledge Mr. Young's expertise in compliance matters within the banking industry. It was his job to make that call and he was well positioned to do so.\n[34] What about Mr. Young's decision not to redeploy Mr. Durrer within the new Compliance Department? Mr. Young testified that Mr. Durrer didn't meet his qualifications for a job in the new model of Compliance at CIBC. Indeed, Mr. Durrer had spent most of his working life at CIBC in retail banking. He had been in Compliance for less than three years. He met with Mr. Durrer a couple of times, reviewed his personnel file and spoke with his managers and business users. Mr. Young felt the Complainant didn't understand compliance issues. Mr. Young stated: He was more of a project manager and hadn't been with Compliance that long. Mr. Young also said business users he spoke with thought Mr. Durrer didn't have the skills that brought value to compliance. Simply put, he didn't have the legal\/accounting\/regulatory experience that others had and that Mr. Young was looking for. Regarding Mr. Durrer's grade 12 education, Mr. Young said he would have kept him on, notwithstanding his lack of post-secondary education, if he had had the experience and understanding of compliance issues. By Mr. Durrer's own admission, he was more of a generalist in an industry that was becoming more in need of specialists, as was the case in compliance.\nG. Mr. Durrer's Age as a Consideration [35] Mr. Young was asked whether he knew Mr. Durrer's age. After all, it was in his personnel file, which he reviewed. Based on his various answers to many questions in direct, cross and re-examination, I find that he might have seen Mr. Durrer's birth date, but that he certainly wasn't looking for it. Whether he saw his birth date is not a major issue. After all, by just doing the mathematical computation (Mr. Durrer had by 1999 been working at CIBC for over 28 years and knowing that he couldn't have started employment much less than 18 years of age), he knew Mr. Durrer had to be in his late 40s at a minimum. Mr. Young knew that he wasn't dealing with a 25 or 35-year old employee.\n[36] More importantly, did age play a factor in Mr. Young's decision to eliminate his position and\/or not to redeploy him within the Compliance Department? I think not. I accept his evidence that: If he had the experience then I would have conserved1 him for other positions, but he didn't have the experience and I didn't need the position.\n[37] He was queried about the issue of age in various parts of his examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination. Because this is a key issue and some of his evidence upon first examination was somewhat equivocal or ambiguous, I cite the various excerpts of the transcript on this issue below:\nExamination-in-chief (p. 564 of transcript)\nMR. GROSMAN: In evaluating Mr. Durrer and in making the decision to eliminate his position, did age play any factor whatsoever?\nMR. YOUNG: No.\nCross-examination (pp. 588-89, 594)\nMR. MORIN: ...At the time he had received notice, Mr. Durrer had just turned 48 years old. Is that your recollection, sir?\nMR. YOUNG: In terms of the letting him go, yes.\nMR. MORIN: Okay.\nMR. YOUNG: In terms of age, no, because it was not really important to me. And what I mean by that is particularly having come from the States, age was really something not to be considered. But, you know, based on -- you base decisions on performance and need.\n... ...\nMR. MORIN: Having looked at the personnel file, you would have looked at his date of birth?\nMR. YOUNG: I could have, sure.\nMR. MORIN: All right.\nMR. YOUNG: I guess I want to just emphasize it was not a primary factor.\n... ...\nMR. MORIN: So in reviewing that personnel file as part of the overall review into his background, you knew what his date of birth was and you knew what his age was?\nMR. YOUNG: I could have, sure. I wasn't looking for it, I'll put it that way.\nRe-direct examination (pp. 640-42)\nMR. GROSMAN: ...Do you have any recollection of seeing Mr. Durrer's birth date?\nMR. YOUNG: No, if I could elaborate a little?\nMR. MORIN:2 Sure, that's fine.\nMR. YOUNG: Having come from the States, birth dates are less relevant in terms of -- less relevant in terms of criteria. It's just a different environment, so having come from there, it wasn't something that I was looking for.\nMR. GROSMAN: What do you mean by less relevant?\nMR. YOUNG: It's -- age discrimination is -- well, first, the States is very litigious. Second, because of that, asking for or considering age is a red flag in terms of just managing people generally in the States.\nIt's something to be sensitized to. So having come up to Canada to restructure the department and just to manage people, and just given the experience of managing that I have had even up to that point, I knew birth dates and age were less relevant in terms of running the department.\nMR. GROSMAN: Okay. And so when you come to assess Mr. Durrer is age a factor at all?\nMR. YOUNG: It's a factor, not a driving factor. It's -- you know, going back to experience, performance, value added, et cetera.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Sorry, age is a factor, not a driving factor. A factor in terms of what?\nMR. YOUNG: It's just performance, just being a compliance officer or any employee, age is -- particularly in terms of restructuring, it's out there, I guess is what I'm trying to say, but it's not a driving factor in terms of whether to keep or not keep employees.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Sorry, one second. It's not a driving factor in terms of whether to keep or not keep employees, but it's a factor in terms of whether you're going to keep or not keep employees, is that correct?\nMR. YOUNG: Yes, and the reason why I say that, having come from the States, as a manager, a manager should be sensitive to not making decisions because of age.\n[38] At first look, one could interpret some of Mr. Young's statements as tantamount to an admission of liability: that age, however small, was a consideration in his decision not to keep Mr. Durrer in the Compliance Department. However, when considering all of his evidence and his actions regarding the Compliance restructuring exercise, a different picture emerges. I find that age was not a factor used by Mr. Young to the detriment of the Complainant. I make this finding for several reasons:\nThe objective evidence of the chart showing the employees by age whose positions were eliminated\/retained suggests that Mr. Durrer's age was not used against him; In several exchanges above, Mr. Young repeats the statements that considering age constitutes discrimination and is not to be done - a red flag. He also flatly denies in examination-in-chief that he considered age as a factor in his decision to eliminate Mr. Durrer's position; No one ever asked Mr. Young how age was used as a factor in Mr. Durrer's case and whether it was used to his benefit, to his detriment or not at all - a neutral factor. Hypothetically speaking, if Mr. Young considered Mr. Durrer's age as a positive factor (with the attendant advantages like experience, maturity, knowing his way around the Bank, etc.), but the non-age-based negative factors weighed heavier, that would not constitute differentiating adversely against Mr. Durrer on account of his age per subsection 7(b) of the CHRA; I interpret his comment it's out there and it's not a driving factor as meaning that one cannot ignore age - it's in an employee's personnel file, one can do the math re: years of services and in talking with an employee, a manager can tell if someone is 25 or 55 years of age, to use an example. Age is a self-evident characteristic. That is different from saying, for example, that one used an employee's age to his\/her detriment, acting on pejorative, stereotypical, ageist prejudices, resulting in an employee being denied employment; and Mr. Young, holding the senior compliance position that he did which involves complex legal and regulatory issues and having worked in a litigious environment like the United States', is sensitized (as he stated in his testimony) to the legal prohibition that an employer cannot terminate an individual's employment because of his or her age.\n[39] I wish to point out that I find Mr. Young a credible witness. He was candid in his testimony.\nH. October 19, 1999: Notice of Termination Given to Mr. Durrer [40] On October 19, 1999, Mr. Young and Cindy Nicholls, Senior Human Resources Consultant, met with Mr. Durrer. He was told that his position was being eliminated, effective January 2000. He was given a letter offering him a 12-week notice of termination, a severance package of 24-months' salary and other supports, including vocational rehabilitation and counseling, in recognition of his over 28 years of service with CIBC and pursuant to the RSP and EC. The RSP stated that, The notice period, whether used as working notice or taken as payment in lieu is provided in addition to applicable severance payments. Employees also could use the termination notice period to find a temporary assignment or permanent position within CIBC.\n[41] As part of the termination package, Mr. Durrer met with an outplacement officer on that day to prepare him to search for alternate employment both within and outside CIBC. The Bank also provided him with internal job search support from Ms Nicholls, who met and\/or communicated with him (in person, by phone or e-mail) many times over the course of the next 2.5 years to discuss and assist in his re-employment plans.\nI. Mr. Durrer's Employment Post-October 19, 1999: the Three Temporary Assignments [42] For the next 28 months, Mr. Durrer extended his working notice period of 12 weeks with the Bank through project assignments. I find that this was contrary to the purpose and intent of the EC\/RSP and ETSP policies. I accept the evidence from Ms Nicholls that no other employee stayed in these programs for as long a time as Mr. Durrer, via the vehicle of temporary positions.\n[43] I also find that the wording of the ETSP, while not absolutely clear, supports the reasonable conclusion that ETSP employees were not to stay on that program for a long period of time. The section entitled Temporary Assignments found at page 12 of the ETSP Employee Guide reads:\nOne way for employees to develop their capabilities and position themselves for alternate employment within CIBC is through a temporary job assignment.\nHow Do Temporary Assignments Work?\nIn general, temporary assignments should be less than 12 months duration.\nThe employee's notice period will continue to run even if the employee receives a temporary assignment.\nIf the employee is on temporary assignment when the notice period ends, the employee's employment with CIBC will terminate, and severance will be paid, at the end of the assignment unless the employee secures another position before then.\nThe employee will be provided the opportunity to continue the search for a permanent position within CIBC while on temporary assignment.\nNOTE\nShould the employee find alternate employment within CIBC during the course of a temporary assignment, the employee will no longer be entitled to a severance payment under the Program.\n[44] I find that CIBC uses the term position above to refer to a permanent position and temporary assignment to refer to a temporary position. A reasonable interpretation is that the Bank also is using the term alternate employment to refer to a permanent position. For example, looking at the first sentence above (One way for employees...), it would not make sense if alternate employment meant a temporary assignment. It would then read: One way for employees to develop their capabilities and position themselves for a temporary assignment within CIBC is through a temporary job assignment. While not perfectly clear, I am more inclined to believe that the bullet In general, temporary assignments should be less than 12 months duration meant that employees should not be in ETSP for more than 12 months in total. It did not mean that ETSP employees could take as many temporary assignments as they wished, provided that each was under 12 months' duration. If one takes that same interpretation (i.e., that CIBC is using the term position to refer to a permanent one), then the third bullet above would suggest that if an employee is in a temporary assignment when his\/her notice period ends, his\/her employment will terminate unless the employee secures a permanent position before then.\n[45] CIBC did not express its concerns with the practice vis-a-vis Mr. Durrer until he first raised the issue with Ms Nicholls on March 21, 2002 - 28 months after getting his notice of termination. So while a more reasonable interpretation of the policy as found in the ETSP Employee Guide is that the temporary jobs were a means to the end of finding alternate permanent employment, I can understand how Mr. Durrer came to believe that it was okay for him to go from temporary job to temporary job (while also looking for a permanent one).\n[46] The three subsequent temporary positions held by Mr. Durrer were:\nBusiness Deployment (Implementation) Leader, Measure and Manage Project: January 4, 2000-May 13, 2001. He was told about this opportunity by Ms Nicholls and was assisted by her in obtaining the job; Process Leader, Base Transaction Financial Project: May 16, 2001-January 31, 2002; and Branch Banking Process Mapping project: February 1, 2002-March 29, 2002.\n[47] CIBC agreed to maintain the two weeks that Mr. Durrer had remaining from his initial notice of position elimination in 1999, which allowed him a further two weeks to find alternate employment within CIBC. Unless Mr. Durrer found another position, his moving date of termination would crystallize on April 12, 2002 - his last day of employment at CIBC.\nJ. April 4, 2002 Meeting and the Issue of No More Temporary Assignments [48] On April 4, 2002, Ms Nicholls gave Mr. Durrer his final termination letter. I accept and acknowledge Mr. Durrer's evidence that this was a very stressful moment for him. After 31 years of service, it looked like his working relationship with CIBC was over.\n[49] In his testimony, Mr. Durrer stated that he learned for the first time at this meeting that CIBC would not extend his employment via a fourth temporary position, if he found one. If he did not come up with a permanent position at CIBC by April 12, 2002, his employment would be terminated. Based on Ms Nicholls' evidence as well as documentary evidence (i.e., e-mails), it is clear that Ms Nicholls and her colleagues in Human Resources had indicated by March 21, 2002 their displeasure at Mr. Durrer continuing to go from temporary position to temporary position with a severance package at the end of it. But did Ms Nicholls outright refuse to consider a fourth temporary position? And as will be discussed later, even if that were so, absent her actions being age-based, would a blanket refusal constitute a violation of section 7 of the CHRA? Mr. Durrer's contemporaneous notes of the conversation between him and Ms Nicholls on March 21, 2002 read:\n3. If I were to secure another ST [short-term, temporary] assignment, say 6-8 months, would HR support?\na. [Ms Nicholls' answer] Didn't know. Would look into this. Would speak to Jackie Stewart. Wanted to speak to Lori Kennedy. Wouldn't commit on when she would get back to me.\n[50] In cross-examination, Mr. Durrer acknowledged that in his March 21st conversation with Ms Nicholls, when asked if Human Resources would support a fourth short-term assignment if he found one, Ms Nicholls replied, I'll look into it; we'll consider it, yes. I note that it was Mr. Durrer who raised the issue for the first time.\n[51] CIBC disputes Mr. Durrer's assertion that it told him on April 4, 2002 that it would no longer entertain extending his working notice period yet again with a fourth temporary position. Ms Nicholls testified that she simply meant that Mr. Durrer could not keep extending his notice period indefinitely with the view that he would also get the 24-month salary severance at the end of it. She averred that she did not mean that he was barred from getting a fourth temporary assignment. She stated that had he come up with one, she would have checked with her superior to see if it would be fine.\n[52] The e-mail of Lori Kennedy (of Human Resources) to Ms Nicholls dated April 11, 2002 (the day before Mr. Durrer's final day as a CIBC employee) deals with Ms Kennedy's discussion with Mr. Durrer. It reiterates the view that Human Resources was taking the position that it would not look favourably upon Mr. Durrer continuing in a fourth temporary position. However, Ms Kennedy's e-mail did state, I also offered to follow up with my Risk client to see what they had and they are not in a position to help him out at this time... That might suggest that Human Resources would have been open to extending him in a fourth temporary assignment, if one was available. Ms Kennedy was not called as a witness. I do not know for example, if Ms Kennedy offered to help find him a fourth temporary job with her Risk client or a contract position.\n[53] Examining the testimony of Ms Nicholls and Mr. Durrer and the e-mails that were exchanged in this one month period, I come to the conclusion that CIBC certainly gave the impression that it would not look kindly on extending Mr. Durrer's employment if he found a fourth temporary job, but CIBC did not outright refuse to consider it. I also find that CIBC did not prevent Mr. Durrer from looking for another temporary position or a permanent one, as he clearly did.\n[54] Mr. Durrer secured neither a fourth temporary job nor a permanent one at CIBC by April 12, 2002. We will never know whether CIBC would have allowed Mr. Durrer to remain an employee in a fourth temporary job. I should also add that even if CIBC had indicated to him that a fourth temporary job was unacceptable, Mr. Durrer's actions were not ones of acceptance. He continued to scramble for a temporary or permanent position, showing his proactive initiative, as he always had demonstrated over the last 2.5 years. In cross-examination, Mr. Durrer stated that after April 4th, I looked for full-time [permanent job] primarily. I held out hope because of all the things I contributed to the bank over the years that if I had a term assignment, that it would be considered.\nK. Termination Date and Post-Termination [55] Mr. Durrer received his letter of confirmation that his working relationship with CIBC as an employee would come to an end on April 12, 2002. He was 50.5 years of age. On May 1, 2002, CIBC hired him back on a contract basis as a Business Analyst (not in the Compliance Department). He worked on contract from June 5, 2002 to February 21, 2003.\n[56] On July 23, 2002, Mr. Durrer filed a Complaint with the Commission, alleging that CIBC had discriminated against him by refusing to continue his employment due to his age, in contravention of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. As of the last day of hearing on November 22, 2006, Mr. Durrer had not accepted any of the severance packages offered to him by CIBC. He has also filed an action in the Superior Court of Justice against CIBC mirroring this Complaint.\nV. THE LAW [57] The initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the CHRA rests with the Complainant or the Commission: Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28 (O'Malley). Once that is established, the burden then shifts to the Respondent to establish a justification or explanation for the discriminatory practice or action. If that is done, the Complainant or Commission has the burden of showing that such a justification or explanation was a pretext for the discriminatory practice or action: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1)(1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 38474.\n[58] Also relevant to the instant case is the legal principle that: It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue in order that the complaint may succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors [however small] for the employer's decision: Morris v. Canada (Armed Forces)(2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 69.\nA. Definition of Discrimination [59] There is no definition of discrimination in the CHRA. One often quoted definition was formulated by McIntrye J. in an early section 15 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 175:\nI would say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.\nB. Age as a Prohibited Ground [60] Age is one of the enumerated prohibited grounds of discrimination found in subsection 3(1) of the CHRA. The CHRA provides various defences, exceptions and justifications to what otherwise would be discriminatory practices related to age such as issues concerning membership in employee associations, mandatory retirement, insurance and pension plans: ss. 9(2), 15(1)(b)-(d). The CHRA also provides a bona fide occupational requirement\/justification based on age: ss. 15(1)(a), 15(1)(g). Some of the defences\/exceptions are unique to the prohibited ground of age. The foregoing illustrates Parliament's legislating of certain exceptions to the general principle that age discrimination is unlawful.\nC. Applicable Statutory Provision [61] The Complaint involves allegations that CIBC violated the following section of the CHRA on the prohibited ground of age:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nVI. ANALYSIS A. Did CIBC eliminate Mr. Durrer's position in October 1999 because of his age? [62] Based on the findings I made earlier on this issue, I find that CIBC did not eliminate Mr. Durrer's position in October 1999 because of his age. Mr. Young eliminated the position for lawful business reasons: the position was redundant and not needed in CIBC's newly consolidated, single Compliance Department model. No one replaced Mr. Durrer in that position: it was eliminated as a result of the restructuring. The chart herein shows there was no age pattern in terms of the managers in Compliance whose positions were eliminated and those whose positions were not and were retained.\n[63] Mr. Young was brought in by the new CEO of CIBC with a mandate to create the most effective Compliance Department possible. Mr. Young has the expertise to do so. Mr. Durrer does not challenge this. I would add that it is not the Tribunal's mandate to second-guess the business merit of Mr. Young's management decisions, but rather, to determine if they were tainted by discrimination.\n[64] The fact that CIBC saved money from eliminating Mr. Durrer's position per se does not make the act a discriminatory one under the CHRA. If that was so, then no employer could eliminate any position that results in a cost-savings because the employee holding that position could argue age discrimination regardless of his\/her age: i.e., if he or she was 25 years of age, he or she was discriminated against because he or she was young; if he or she was 60 years old, the employee was treated adversely because he or she was old. The concepts of young and old are of course relative.\nB. Did CIBC decide not to transfer Mr. Durrer to another position in the same department (Compliance) because of his age? [65] Based on my earlier findings, I find that Mr. Young's decision not to offer Mr. Durrer a position in the new Compliance Department was not made, in whole or in part, because the Complainant was 48 years old. I accept his evidence that he had the difficult task of downsizing from three Compliance Departments to one. Mr. Durrer did not possess the compliance experience, background and understanding of compliance issues that Mr. Young was looking for. The chart reproduced in these Reasons demonstrates from an objective perspective that employees older than Mr. Durrer were retained (including one 11 years older) and ones younger than Mr. Durrer were let go. There is no pattern of targeting of older workers (in this case, ones close to Mr. Durer's age). In fact there is no age pattern at all. I accept Mr. Banks' evidence that, The experienced rate of termination under the ETSP program is uniform for employees aged anywhere between 31 and 52. There is no indication of selection by age in this range.\n[66] Regarding the excerpts from the transcript of Mr. Young's evidence reproduced earlier in these Reasons, I make the following observations and findings. I examined carefully Mr. Young's entire testimony, as well as the documentary evidence adduced. I do not take Mr. Young as saying he used Mr. Durrer's age to the latter's detriment in deciding whether to keep him in the Compliance Department. Indeed, Mr. Young was never asked if age was a factor in his mind, did he use it to Mr. Durrer's benefit, detriment or was it a neutral factor? Of course, Mr. Young either knew Mr. Durrer's exact age or had an idea of his proximate age. He said, it's out there. Just as he knew Mr. Durrer was male. That doesn't mean he punished Mr. Durrer for being 48 years old by not giving him a position in the revamped Compliance Department. In other words, Mr. Durrer's age was not counted against him by Mr. Young in his decision not to redeploy Mr. Durrer in the new Compliance Department. Mr. Durrer was not retained because he lacked the qualifications sought by Mr. Young and relative to the other employees in the three Compliance Departments under consideration.\n[67] To find otherwise and to hold that CIBC ought to have kept him employed in the new Compliance Department, because Mr. Durrer was 48 years old and notwithstanding that he lacked the qualifications sought, would have troubling consequences. It would mean that the mere age of an employee (and it could be any age) is more important than experience, education, value-addedness, etc. In essence, age becomes the deciding or primary factor, not whether the employee is qualified.\nC. Did CIBC interfere with Mr. Durrer's attempts to seek redeployment within CIBC because of his age? [68] This was the crux of Mr. Durrer's case: by not allowing him to take a fourth temporary assignment and crystallizing his date of termination, CIBC prevented Mr. Durrer from reaching the bridgeable age of 53, which stopped him from realizing his goal - an immediate, unreduced pension. Throughout his testimony and in pre-referral letters from Mr. Durrer to the Commission, this issue was the focal point of Mr. Durrer's concern about how CIBC treated him. In his testimony, he said, Why couldn't they make an exception for me? There was lots of work. He also said words to that effect in other parts of his testimony. He even testified that they had bridged other people who did not meet the EC\/RSP and ETSP criteria for bridging: (i.e., the employee's job was being eliminated, and he or she was neither 55 years old nor 53-55 with enough severance to bridge them to 55). At the hearing, CIBC denied having done this. Mr. Durrer produced no probative evidence of CIBC having bridged other people falling outside the eligibility criteria.\n[69] The Complainant states that various e-mails from Ms Nicholls and other human resources people in 2002 illustrate that CIBC was frustrating his attempts to find other work. Per my earlier findings of fact, I do not find this to be the case. On the contrary, I find that CIBC provided assistance to Mr. Durrer from the moment he was notified that his position was being eliminated in October 1999. CIBC offered him a very generous severance package, which as of the last day of the hearing, he had not accepted. The EC\/RSP and ETSP paid a premium to workers 45 and older. Mr. Durrer was offered the maximum 24-month severance package. CIBC provided him with vocational rehabilitation counseling and training. Ms Nicholls met and spoke with him right from the start. Indeed, it was as a result of her suggestion and assistance that Mr. Durrer got his first temporary assignment. I also accept her evidence that she met frequently with other CIBC Human Resources staff about leads for Mr. Durrer.\n[70] In addition, CIBC allowed Mr. Durrer and others similarly situated to continue to look for permanent work within CIBC, or even temporary work with the goal of finding a permanent job in CIBC. He had access to the computerized internal job postings system at CIBC. Indeed, under the EC\/RSP and ETSP, displaced employees like Mr. Durrer received preferential consideration over other employees applying for the same position, but who were not in the EC\/RSP or ETSP programs. Employees like Mr. Durrer were to identify themselves on their application, and if they were equally qualified as the non-ETSP applicant, the former would win the job competition. Mr. Durrer's detailed log shows he applied for many jobs (most being temporary). Indeed, Mr. Durrer held three successive temporary positions from January 2000-April 2002: almost 2.5 years after he was given notice of termination. All during this time Mr. Durrer was accruing pension and other benefit entitlements. CIBC also hired him back on a contract for a 9-month period in June 2002. Simply put, I find that CIBC treated Mr. Durrer well and with respect during what was no doubt a difficult time for him. Indeed, there are e-mails entered into evidence from the Complainant wherein he was thanking CIBC managers and staff for their assistance.\n[71] By way of the Agreed Statement of Facts, Mr. Durrer held three temporary positions over a 28-month period. That is probative evidence per se that CIBC did not frustrate his attempts to find permanent or temporary work on account of his age. Indeed, for all we know, his age and all its attendant benefits (e.g., experience, maturity, etc.) might have contributed to his getting one, two or all three of those temporary positions.\n[72] Mr. Durrer had used the word conspiracy in his testimony and in a letter to the Commission to describe CIBC's action in preventing him from finding further work to reach the bridgeable age. His counsel showed more restraint. He said CIBC's actions did not constitute a conspiracy, nor were they done deliberately or intentionally, but they showed a willful disregard, an act of utter neglect, shameful. I do not find that CIBC's actions constituted any of those things, nor were they on account of his age.\n[73] As indicated in the section dealing with findings of fact, one will never know whether CIBC ultimately would have allowed Mr. Durrer to continue into a fourth (or fifth or sixth, if necessary) temporary assignment to reach the bridgeable age of 53. Per my earlier finding, I believe CIBC would have considered allowing Mr. Durrer to take a fourth temporary assignment. The evidence is clear that, as of the April 12, 2002 effective date of termination (and even at the April 4th meeting where Mr. Durrer said he learned for the first time that CIBC wouldn't let him continue in a fourth temporary job), Mr. Durrer had neither secured nor even tentatively secured a temporary or permanent job at CIBC.\n[74] Even if I had found that CIBC refused to consider a fourth temporary job, Mr. Durrer has not satisfied me that such a refusal was tied to his age, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA. And if Mr. Durrer had secured a permanent job at that time, he would no longer have been eligible for ETSP and thus would not be entitled to either the severance payment or the waiver of the early retirement pension reduction, both of which were his goals.\n(i) Avoiding Pension Liability [75] In his Statement of Particulars, the Complainant pleads that CIBC terminated Mr. Durrer at age 50.5 [on April 12, 2002] in an effort to defeat Mr. Durrer's pension entitlement and its pension obligations.\n[76] I find no merit to this allegation. First, Mr. Durrer did not lose any pension entitlement or benefits as of April 12, 2002 under the CIBC Pension Plan. They remain intact. He simply did not qualify for the pension reduction waiver. As of today at age 55, he can start to receive an actuarially reduced pension or wait to age 65 to receive a full, unreduced pension. Second, if his allegation is that the Bank was defeating his future pension entitlement and its future pension obligations by preventing him from working another 2.5 years to reach the bridgeable age of 53, I still disagree. Had CIBC really wanted to avoid any further pension obligations to Mr. Durrer, it would have dismissed him without cause in October 1999, and not allowed him to continue at the Bank for the next 2.5 years in temporary assignments. During that time, he was accruing additional pension benefits. As CIBC's counsel stated, if that was his client's intention, it had the reverse effect, of increasing the Bank's pension obligation to Mr. Durrer. That doesn't make much business sense if its goal was to get rid of Mr. Durrer to save some money.\n[77] I also accept Mr. Banks' statement that the impact on pension liabilities of the termination of employees by CIBC, pursuant to the ETSP program has been immaterial. Accordingly, the impact on pension liabilities from only one employee's pension (i.e., Mr. Durrer's) would have been negligible.\nVII. CONCLUSION [78] There is no doubt that it was a sad and stressful time for Dan Durrer. His entire working life had been spent at CIBC. And by all accounts, he was a hard-working and successful employee. However, for the foregoing reasons, his age played no adverse part in his employment termination from CIBC. Accordingly, the Complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

Upon her return to work at the end of her leave, she asked Bell to provide her with a work schedule that would enable her to go home and breastfeed her child at the same time every day. She alleges that in turning down her request, Bell refused to accommodate her. This, in her view, constitutes discrimination based on her sex and family status, in violation of s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission opted not to appear at the hearing. Ms. Cole led her case on her own, without any representation on her behalf. Bell was represented by legal counsel.\nI. FACTS [3] Ms. Cole began working at Bell in 1987, initially as a clerk in the billing department. By 2000, she was employed at Bell's Toronto call centre (also called the Mass Queue), which provided customer service to Bell clients. In February 2000, Ms. Cole took maternity leave from work to give birth to her second child. Shortly before taking her leave, Ms. Cole was informed that she had been accepted to work in a new call centre department known as the High Value Queue (HVQ). This department was being established at the time as a pilot project to provide priority service to Bell's larger customers. Ms. Cole had not begun working at HVQ when she left on her maternity leave.\n[4] Ms. Cole's son was born on February 27, 2000. Unfortunately, he was born with a congenital heart defect, for which he had to undergo angioplasty when he was only four months old. Ms. Cole was told by her child's physicians that he would likely require surgery to repair the heart defect as he got older. Given his condition, they recommended that she breastfeed him for as long as possible in order to strengthen his immune system.\n[5] Theresa Agnew, who is a nurse by profession, was qualified by the Tribunal to testify at the hearing as an expert in the area of breastfeeding and mastitis. Ms. Agnew happens to be the spouse of Ms. Cole's brother. Bell did not raise any objection in this regard and I did not find that her family connection impacted on her credibility as an expert witness. Ms. Agnew explained in her evidence that the colostrum in mother's milk has numerous immunological properties that can provide immense benefit to children, particularly those with health-related problems that make them more susceptible to infection. She testified that children with congenital heart disease are prone to bacterial infections, so much so that, for instance, antibiotics are often prescribed for them even when they are just having their teeth cleaned by a dentist. Through breastfeeding, these children become less susceptible to the contraction of these infections, and become better equipped to fight them if they are contracted.\n[6] Ms. Cole followed the advice of her son's physicians and breastfed him exclusively until he reached about seven months of age, at which point she also began to feed him some solid food. By January 2001, her son had settled into a routine of being breastfed regularly about three to four times a day: at 6:30 a.m., 4:30 p.m., between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m., and occasionally overnight between 2:00 to 3:00 a.m.\n[7] Around January 20, 2001, Ms. Cole called and left a voice mail message for Elizabeth Long, who was the wellness manager at the Mass Queue call centre where Ms. Cole had been working prior to taking her maternity leave. The wellness manager's duties included dealing with employees' issues regarding maternity and disability leave, as well as helping the call centre's manager (or team leader) to monitor the attendance of employees and the reliability of their performance. Ms. Long was responsible, in this regard, for about 350 employees.\n[8] In her voice mail message, Ms. Cole asked for authorization to take one hour personal granted unpaid (PGU) time off work per day in order to nurse her baby. Bell supervisors had the discretion to grant employees PGU time off from their normal work schedules to tend to personal matters, such as going to a doctor's appointment or attending a child's school play. Receiving PGU time off work does not have a negative impact on an employee's work record.\n[9] Given Ms. Cole's seniority within Bell, she was usually assigned shifts beginning at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 4:00 p.m., Monday to Friday. According to Ms. Cole, on some rare occasions, perhaps no more often than three times per year, she would be assigned an 8:15 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. shift. Her request to Ms. Long, therefore, consisted of asking to leave work one hour in advance of her normal end of shift, as PGU time. This would have enabled her to join her son at his caregiver's home, and nurse him by 4:30 p.m., in accordance with his feeding schedule. Ms. Cole also explained that usually, as the afternoon feeding time approached, her breast milk began to leak. By leaving earlier from work, she would minimize any leaking that would take place at her workplace. She described in her testimony the odour associated with leaking breast milk and the embarrassment she would feel if the leaking became visible through her clothes.\n[10] Ms. Cole knew that another employee, Barb Kustec, had previously been granted PGU time off work to breastfeed her child at the workplace. Ms. Kustec's daughter had several allergies and it had been recommended that she continue breastfeeding her for as long as possible. In June 2000, Ms. Kustec sought and obtained authorization to take an extra fifteen minutes of PGU time off work after her 30 minute lunch break. Her husband would bring the child to the office at this time and she would nurse her. Ms. Cole testified that she had assumed that her request for time off at the end of the day would inconvenience Bell less than the accommodation granted to Ms. Kustec, which was occurring during the busy lunch hour when many employees were taking their breaks.\n[11] On January 22, 2001, Ms. Long replied by e-mail to Ms. Cole's voice mail message. Ms. Long pointed out that upon Ms. Cole's return from maternity leave, she was to report directly to the HVQ call centre and that her file had been forwarded there. Any future enquiries were to be directed to her new team leader at HVQ, Maria Bozzelli.\n[12] Although Ms. Cole's file was apparently now in the hands of HVQ, Ms. Long nevertheless took it upon herself to comment on Ms. Cole's request for PGU time off work. She wrote:\nYour request for PGU unfortunately cannot be honoured. The other options would be changing your preferences for lunch etc etc to accommodate your needs that the staffing associate within the HVQ could help you with.\n[13] Ms. Cole replied to Ms. Long by e-mail as well. She wrote:\nI would like to know more information on why 60 minutes daily PGU is denied for me to nurse my baby. Is all PGU denied? Can I have 15 minutes a day? Or 30 minutes? Or 45 minutes?\n[14] Ms. Long answered Ms. Cole's e-mail on February 2, 2001, with the following note:\nI would recommend that you pursue your request with your new dept in HVQ, for us in the Mass queue we are in constant hiring mode and therefore can not substantiate granting PGU.\n[15] Ms. Cole did not speak to Ms. Long about her request thereafter. She returned to work on February 26, 2001, commencing immediately in the HVQ department. A few days later, Ms. Cole approached Ms. Bozzelli to discuss the matter. She spoke to her about her son's heart condition and of his physicians' recommendation that he be breastfed for as long as possible. Ms. Bozzelli testified that both she and Ms. Cole became quite emotional during the course of this conversation.\n[16] Ms. Cole had perceived Ms. Long's replies to her previous requests as a denial by Bell of PGU time off work. Consequently, she did not repeat this request to Ms. Bozzelli. Instead, Ms. Cole asked that her shifts always end by 4:00 p.m. She hoped that by wearing breast pads, she might be able to capture her leaking breast milk while at work, and that if she left by 4:00 p.m., she would reach her son just in time for his next feeding.\n[17] Ms. Bozzelli realized that Ms. Cole was effectively seeking a permanent 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift. She told Ms. Cole that given the possibility that the seniority rights of other employees may be affected, she needed to consult with her own second level manager, Kam Rawal, before granting the request. Ms. Bozzelli testified that she contacted Mr. Rawal about Ms. Cole's request. She claims that Mr. Rawal told her that since Ms. Cole was asking for a medical restriction, medical documentation in support thereof would have to be provided to Bell. Mr. Rawal did not testify at the hearing.\n[18] According to Ms. Bozzelli, she then contacted Ms. Cole to advise her that she must submit medical documentation confirming the accommodation that she required due to her son's health problems. Ms. Bozzelli assured Ms. Cole that until such time as the documents were submitted, she would only be assigned 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shifts.\n[19] Ms. Cole's recollection of this conversation differs somewhat. She testified that she was merely told that a doctor's note was needed in order for her request to be granted. She found it curious that a note was necessary given that, with the exception of perhaps three days per year, her shift would in any event ordinarily end at 4:00 p.m. Nonetheless, she agreed to provide a note from her doctor.\n[20] On March 23, 2001, Ms. Cole met with her family physician and obtained from her a note, written on the physician's prescription notepad. The note said, This is to certify that Hayley Cole has been advised to leave work at 4 p.m. daily for medical reasons. The note did not make any mention of Ms. Cole's child or his heart condition.\n[21] Ms. Cole brought the note to Ms. Bozzelli who forwarded it on to Bell's Disability Management Group (DMG) offices in Montreal. The DMG manages all disability, occupational health and accommodation claims regarding Bell employees. The DMG is staffed with case managers who review the medical information received and make decisions, in consultation with a physician, regarding the employees' entitlements to short and long term disability benefits and accommodation.\n[22] Ms. Bozzelli testified that she did not look at the note before forwarding it to the DMG. In order to respect Bell employees' privacy, the content of all medical documentation submitted by them is viewed solely and confidentially by the DMG. Accordingly, if the DMG determines, based on the medical evidence submitted by the employee, that medical restrictions are justified, the DMG will simply advise the employee's supervisor of the nature of the restrictions and how they should be accommodated. The details about the employee's disability or illness on which the DMG's decision is based are not disclosed to the supervisor.\n[23] The DMG found that the note from Ms. Cole's physician was insufficiently detailed. Ms. Cole was therefore asked to provide a second note, which would set out a diagnosis and duration of the suggested restrictions to her work schedule. On May 11, 2001, Ms. Cole visited her family physician again, informed her of the DMG's request, and asked for a second medical note. The physician obliged and prepared another note, again handwritten on a sheet from her prescription pad. The second note said, This is to certify that Hayley Cole has been advised to leave work at 4 p.m. daily for 12 months from today's date for prevention of recurrent mastitis. Ms. Cole testified that her physician included the reference to mastitis because the doctor thought maybe that's what Bell was looking for. Ms. Cole's physician did not testify at the hearing.\n[24] Ms. Agnew stated in her evidence that mastitis is an infection that occurs within breast tissue, which often is caused by clogged ducts. Some of the factors that may lead to this latter condition include engorgement of the breast (which can occur when the breast is not emptied of milk often enough), fatigue and stress, cracked nipples that allow bacteria to be introduced, and changes or decreases in the frequency of feedings. If the clogging is left unchecked, bacteria enter the ducts, which could develop into a local infection and in the worst cases, transfer into the bloodstream causing a systemic infection.\n[25] Ms. Cole experienced mastitis around the third or fourth month after giving birth. Her family physician prescribed antibiotics and advised her to keep on nursing regularly. As Ms. Agnew explained in her evidence, one of the typical treatments for mastitis is frequent breastfeeding, particularly from the infected breast. After about two weeks, Ms. Cole's mastitis went away. She had not had another instance of mastitis by the time she returned to work in February 2001. Ms. Agnew testified that a small percentage of mothers experience chronic or recurring mastitis. Mastitis is most likely to initially arise within the first 24 months after birth. However, if a woman experiences recurring mastitis in this period, the infection could recur even after the 24th month, although the likelihood is very rare.\n[26] The DMG reviewed the physician's second note and determined that the recommended fixed work schedule constituted a preventive measure that the DMG felt should be accommodated if possible. Upon receiving a message to this effect from the DMG, Ms. Bozzelli implemented the recommendation and ensured that Ms. Cole was assigned exclusively 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shifts for a 12 month period ending on May 24, 2002. Ms. Bozzelli testified that other HVQ employees noticed that Ms. Cole was always getting the same shift hours and inquired about this. Ms. Bozzelli explained to them that this decision related to a personal matter of Ms. Cole's, the details of which could not be shared.\n[27] In March 2002, as the end of the 12 month period was approaching, DMG case worker, Stephanie Houle, contacted Ms. Cole to inform her that the existing medical note on file would not be valid for much longer. If Ms. Cole needed to continue to be accommodated with fixed shift hours beyond May 24, 2002, her physician would need to file a new report, by filling out a two-page DMG form called a Physician's Report to Disability Management Group, also known by its identification number, BC1935.\n[28] Interestingly, the instructions on the form direct the employee to complete the form in the event that he or she is absent from work for more than seven calendar days for illness\/off-duty injury, or for one full day for an on-duty injury\/occupational disease. There is no evidence that Ms. Cole was ever absent from work due to illness or injury in the manner described in the form, after her return to work following her maternity leave. The DMG asked her to submit the form nonetheless.\n[29] Ms. Cole's physician completed the form on May 22, 2002. She described the nature and frequency of Ms. Cole's current treatment as working consistent hours. In answer to the question of whether a progressive return-to-work plan was suggested, the physician wrote, Able to work full-time, full duties but maintain consistent hours Monday to Friday 8-4. Bell had recently initiated Saturday shifts at the HVQ call centre, which all ran from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. If Ms. Cole's shift were to end so late in the day, she would never be able to reach her child for his 4:30 feeding. Ms. Cole claims that she mentioned this situation to her physician, who therefore opted to include the Monday to Friday reference in the report. Ms. Cole forwarded the completed BC1935 form to the DMG.\n[30] Dr. Liliane Demers is a consulting physician with the DMG. She testified that the DMG was not ready to support further accommodation in Ms. Cole's case, after reviewing her BC1935 form. She noted that the physician's diagnosis of recurrent mastitis did not specify the number of episodes that had occurred nor was any treatment for any such episodes described. No proposed follow-up appointments with the patient were mentioned either. Dr. Demers pointed out that mastitis most frequently occurs in the first six months after birth. At this point, Ms. Cole's son was already over two years old.\n[31] The DMG's decision that further accommodation would not be supported was apparently conveyed to HVQ management but, according to Ms. Cole, none of the details brought up in Dr. Demers' testimony were ever communicated to her. Instead, she claims that she was merely told by Liz Brownrigg, the wellness manager responsible for attendance at HVQ, that her physician's report had been rejected. The conversation with Ms. Brownrigg seemed to have centred on the issue of the Saturday shift, since in an e-mail message dated May 31, 2002, Ms. Cole wrote to Ms. Houle:\nLiz referred me to you to find out what information you require from my doctor to support Saturday exemption. Do I need to have my doctor complete another 1935?\n[32] Ms. Houle replied by e-mail on June 3, 2002:\nWe do need to understand the medical condition that prevents you to work on Saturdays (your treating physician can add this information on the bc1935 [form and sign] beside it).\n[33] Accordingly, Ms. Cole returned to her physician and asked her to add the additional requested information on the same form. The physician added several additional lines in the margin of the form's sheet so that it now read as follows:\nAble to work full-time, full duties but maintain consistent hours Monday to Friday 8-4 to continue regularly scheduled breastfeeding to prevent recurrence of mastitis - Saturday work schedule is different won't apply [sic].\n[34] Ms. Cole forwarded the revised BC1935 form to the DMG.\n[35] On August 7, 2002, Ms. Houle sent an e-mail message to Ms. Brownrigg stating that although it was recommended that Ms. Cole work consistent hours, the DMG did not support on a medical basis the physician's recommendation that she work specific hours and\/or days of work. Ms. Houle added that it was up to Ms. Cole's managers to decide if they would accommodate this request for those specific hours or days of work. Ms. Brownrigg, in turn, informed Ms. Cole verbally that the DMG no longer supported her claim for accommodation on medical grounds.\n[36] Ms. Cole decided to speak to the force wellness communication manager at HVQ, Melanie Blackall, about her situation. Ms. Blackall's duties included managing staffing requirements within the department. Ms. Blackall testified that Ms. Cole seemed confounded by the DMG's response, and wondered aloud how her physician could write the medical report any differently. Ms. Blackall replied that she had nothing to suggest; she just knew the DMG found the second report insufficient. From May to September, 2002, Ms. Cole had already been assigned to work three Saturday shifts ending at 5:30 p.m., which she had managed to avoid by using her sick leave days or exchanging shifts with other employees. These adjustments did not have any impact on her salary. On weekdays, Bell continued to assign Ms. Cole 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shifts exclusively.\n[37] On September 27, 2002, Ms. Cole told Ms. Blackall that she had scheduled an appointment to meet her physician again on October 7, 2002, in order to obtain another BC1935 report to submit to the DMG. Ms. Blackall advised Ms. Cole, as confirmed in a subsequent e-mail, that unless the DMG would be varying its position after the new report was filed, Ms. Cole should be prepared to be on regular scheduling as of October 14th, 2002, without any of the restrictions on shift assignments that had been in place previously. Ms. Cole interpreted Ms. Blackall's remarks as meaning that she should prepare herself to stop nursing since she would no longer be exclusively assigned fixed shifts ending at 4:00 p.m. Ms. Blackall acknowledged in her evidence that by her body language and tone of voice, Ms. Cole demonstrated that she was clearly upset with this news.\n[38] As scheduled, Ms. Cole visited her physician and obtained another BC1935 report containing more information than in the previous reports. Under the heading Nature and frequency of current treatment, the physician wrote working consistent hours with consecutive days off. Under the heading Extent of disability, the physician wrote that Ms. Cole can perform all tasks but needs to work consistent hours i.e. 8 - 4 daily with 2 consecutive days off in order to maintain a regular schedule of breastfeeding and 2 days off to pump breast milk for storage for the remainder of the week in order to avoid mastitis. The physician indicated that these restrictions would apply for approximately one year.\n[39] The report was forwarded to the DMG. Late in October, Ms. Blackall learned that the DMG had again decided the medical information did not support the restrictions Ms. Cole's physician had recommended. Ms. Blackall sought instructions from a higher level manager, Karen Neave. Ms. Neave advised her that she would be taking care of the matter from that moment on and instructed her to ensure that Ms. Cole was maintained on 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shifts in the meantime.\n[40] Given Ms. Blackall's previous notice by e-mail that Ms. Cole should be prepared to work regular shifts (i.e. possibly beyond 4:00 p.m.) if the DMG did not alter its position, Ms. Cole testified that she resigned herself to the expectation of later shifts. She therefore stopped her son's 4:30 p.m. feedings on October 8 or 9, 2002. By Christmas 2002, Ms. Cole had stopped the 10:00 p.m. feedings, and by March or April, 2003, she had stopped nursing him altogether.\n[41] On November 4, 2002, Ms. Blackall instructed her staffing manager by e-mail that effective immediately, until further notice, Hayley will be working 8-4 tours due to her medical restrictions. Ms. Cole says she was never given a copy of this e-mail nor was she ever provided with this information. She continued to work in the HVQ call centre until January 2003, when it was dismantled. Between October 2002 and January 2003, Ms. Cole was only assigned to work three shifts beyond 4:00 p.m., twice in late October and once early in November. After she notified Ms. Blackall about these assignments, Ms. Blackall adjusted them back to 4:00 p.m. Thus, taken as a whole, between May 2002, when Ms. Cole's initial period of guaranteed work shifts was to expire, and January 28, 2003, when she left HVQ, Ms. Cole did not in fact ever work any shift where she was scheduled to finish past 4:00 p.m.\n[42] After the HVQ call centre was dismantled, Ms. Cole was assigned to the Move Queue, which apparently is a large call centre, like the Mass Queue. Ms. Cole testified that given the higher number of employees at the Move Queue and her level of seniority by this point, she was certain to receive Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shifts.\n[43] The wellness manager who oversaw the Move Queue call centre was Ms. Long, the same wellness manager to whom Ms. Cole had addressed her original request for PGU time off work. Ms. Long testified that in February 2003, she had begun to focus on improving attendance at the call centres for which she was responsible. One of the measures she adopted to address the significant attendance problem that had developed was to work closely with the DMG to ensure that all the supporting documentation for persons on medical leave was in order and that employees would return to work as soon as medically possible. In conducting her review of employees for whom restrictions had been put in place, she discovered that Bell was formally continuing to maintain restrictions with respect to Ms. Cole's work shifts. The DMG informed Ms. Long that there was no longer any documentation on file to support these continued restrictions.\n[44] Consequently, on March 5, 2003, Ms. Long wrote an e-mail message to Ms. Cole advising her that in light of the information obtained from the DMG, her medical restrictions with respect to shift scheduling were being removed. Ms. Long added that if Ms. Cole felt that the restrictions were still applicable, she should file a new BC1935 form. Ms. Long testified that she never got a reply from Ms. Cole to this e-mail.\n[45] On April 14, 2004, Ms. Cole filed her human rights complaint with the Commission.\nII. ANALYSIS A. What must Ms. Cole demonstrate to establish discrimination in this case? [46] Ms. Cole alleges that in the course of her employment, Bell engaged in a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of s. 7 (b) of the Act, by directly or indirectly differentiating adversely in relation to her, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Sex and family status are included amongst the prohibited grounds of discrimination enumerated in s. 3 of the Act.\n[47] Complainants in human rights cases must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28).\n[48] Once the prima facie case is established, it is incumbent upon the respondent to reasonably or satisfactorily explain the otherwise discriminatory practice (see Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at para. 23; Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 at para. 26-7).\n[49] Moreover, an employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if it can establish that its refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (s. 15(1)(a) of the Act). For any practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2) of the Act).\nB. Does differential treatment with respect to breastfeeding constitute discrimination on the basis of sex and family status? [50] Ms. Cole alleges that Bell's treatment of her request for time off work to nurse her son was discriminatory on the basis of her sex and family status. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, in Poirier v. British Columbia (Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Recreation and Housing) (1997), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/87 (B.C.H.T.), addressed the question of whether differential treatment of a woman based on the fact that she is breastfeeding is a form of sex discrimination. The Tribunal referred to the Supreme Court's decision in Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, in which Chief Justice Dickson stated that the capacity to become pregnant is unique to the female gender. A distinction based on pregnancy is therefore a distinction based on sex. The B.C. Tribunal in Poirier held that the same reasoning applies to breastfeeding as well. The capacity to breastfeed is unique to the female gender. Consequently, discrimination on the basis that an individual is breastfeeding is a form of sex discrimination. I agree with this interpretation.\n[51] It would seem that a parallel could be drawn regarding the ground of family status. Since Ms. Cole was the mother of the child whom she wanted to breastfeed, treating her differentially in this regard would constitute discrimination on the basis of her family status as a parent. However, Ms. Cole did not advance any argument at the hearing with respect to the family status portion of her complaint, nor did she direct the Tribunal to any evidence in support thereof. Her submissions focussed on the proposition that the alleged discriminatory conduct was based on her sex. I therefore can only assume that Ms. Cole opted to no longer pursue the family status aspect of her complaint. In the circumstances, it would in my view be a breach of fairness and natural justice for me to attempt to formulate arguments at this point in support of this aspect of the complaint, and make findings thereon (see Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48 at para. 8). The case based on family status is therefore dismissed.\nC. Is there prima facie evidence establishing that Ms. Cole was differentially treated in the course of employment, on the basis of her sex? [52] Shortly before returning to work, Ms. Cole contacted Bell management (i.e. Ms. Long) to make a special request as a breastfeeding mother. She wanted to nurse her son at his afternoon feeding time. Could Bell authorize her to leave work one hour earlier each day, thereby giving her plenty of time to return to her son and feed him? Bell would not be obliged to pay her salary while she was off work (PGU).\n[53] Ms. Long's initial response was unambiguous: Your request for PGU unfortunately cannot be honoured. When Ms. Cole asked whether this refusal was final or whether a shorter PGU time period would be acceptable, Ms. Long replied that in her Mass Queue department, they were in constant hiring mode and cannot substantiate granting PGU.\n[54] Bell contends that Ms. Cole should have ignored these remarks from Ms. Long since she was going to be working at the HVQ call centre upon her return, a department for which Ms. Long was not responsible. Indeed, Ms. Long prefaced her comments in the second e-mail with a recommendation that Ms. Cole pursue her request with the HVQ department.\n[55] Nevertheless, Ms. Cole perceived Ms. Long's replies as a denial of her request for PGU time. Was Ms. Cole's perception reasonable? She testified that prior to her return to work, she understood that her employment was still linked to the Mass Queue. After all, when she left on maternity leave, she was still working at the Mass Queue. Consequently, she assumed that until she began working at HVQ, Ms. Long remained her wellness manager.\n[56] Furthermore, even though Ms. Long indicated that Ms. Cole's file was now in the hands of the HVQ, Ms. Long took it upon herself just the same to address Ms. Cole's PGU request in both of her e-mails. Ms. Cole found herself being told twice by this Bell manager that PGU cannot be honoured or substantiated. In effect, Bell was strongly discouraging her in her attempts to obtain leave to breastfeed her child in the manner requested by her. In the circumstances, it was in my view reasonable for Ms. Cole to conclude that Bell would not be granting her any PGU time to breastfeed her child.\n[57] Ms. Cole, therefore, decided not to pursue the PGU option with Ms. Bozzelli. She pared down her request to what she viewed as a bare minimum, an assurance that her work shift would end at 4:00 p.m., thereby enabling her to make the commute to her child's caregiver's home just in time to feed him. Bell's reaction to this request is key to the outcome of this case. Rather than treat this as a request by an employee, who is both a woman and a mother, for a modification to her work schedule that would enable her to nurse her child with regularity, Bell opted to convert the matter into a medical issue. Ms. Bozzelli was instructed to ask Ms. Cole to provide medical information in support of her request. Why was this necessary? Dr. Demers acknowledged in her testimony, as did Bell's counsel in final argument, that the act of breastfeeding is not a disability. I will return to this question later in this decision.\n[58] Bell pointed out at the hearing that Ms. Cole was in fact ultimately accommodated in the first year with a guaranteed 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. work schedule. This accommodation was not, however, in response to a mother's request to breastfeed her child, but as the request of an ill or disabled employee in need of accommodation to avoid recurrence of an illness. This approach to her request resulted, one year later, in Ms. Cole's being told that her accommodation would formally end due to the unlikelihood of any future recurrence of mastitis, even though she was still nursing her son and required a guaranteed 4:00 p.m. shift end to ensure that she could feed him by 4:30 p.m.\n[59] Thus, Bell never really addressed Ms. Cole's request, as a mother, for a fixed shift end that would enable her to breastfeed her son at his afternoon feeding time. Does this fact establish prima facie that Ms. Cole was discriminated against on the basis of her sex? In my view, it does.\n[60] Section 7(b) of the Act states that it is a discriminatory practice to directly or indirectly differentiate adversely in relation to an employee in the course of employment. The purpose of the Act, as articulated in s. 2, is to extend the scope of application of the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have, and to have their needs accommodated, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discrimination based on, amongst other factors, their sex.\n[61] In their working lives, women face particular challenges and obstacles that men do not. A woman who opts to breastfeed her baby takes on a child-rearing responsibility which no man will truly ever face. In order for a working mother to bestow on her child the benefits that nursing can provide, she may require a degree of accommodation. Otherwise, she may end up facing a difficult choice that a man will never have to address. On the one hand, stop nursing your child in order to continue working and make a living for yourself and your family. On the other hand, abandon your job to ensure that your child will be breastfed. This dilemma is unique to women employees and results in their being differentiated adversely, in the course of their employment. It has the potential to create precisely the type of obstacle that would deny women an opportunity equal to others, to make for themselves the lives they are able and wish to have (s. 2 of the Act) .\n[62] In the present case, Bell's reaction, in at the very least strongly discouraging Ms. Cole's request, as a mother, for PGU time to breastfeed her child, presented Ms. Cole with just such a dilemma, one that a male colleague would not have had to face. As such, Ms. Cole was subjected to adverse differential treatment.\n[63] Furthermore, her subsequent request to Bell for a relatively slight adjustment to her work schedule, which would have enabled her to nurse her son, was in effect turned down as well. Bell never addressed this request as that of a nursing mother. Instead, by referring the matter to the DMG, Ms. Cole was treated as an ill or disabled employee. She was required to visit her physician repeatedly to obtain medical notes and reports. Thus, not only did Bell strongly discourage her initial request for PGU but when she significantly attenuated her request to merely a guarantee of a 4:00 p.m. shift end, Bell subjected her to conditions and specifications (i.e. the filing of medical reports to justify nursing) that a male Bell employee would obviously never have been subjected to. Her status as a nursing mother was integral to her requests, and the denial of these requests had a unique impact on her as a woman, and more specifically, as a nursing mother. As such, there is a clear nexus between the adverse treatment that she received and her status as a woman.\n[64] A prima facie case of differential treatment based on Ms. Cole's sex has therefore been established.\nD. What is Bell's answer to the prima facie case? [65] Since Ms. Cole has established a prima facie case of discrimination, it is now incumbent upon Bell to provide an answer to the case.\n[66] According to s. 15(1) a) of the Act, it would not be a discriminatory practice if Bell's refusal to grant PGU time or its specification that Ms. Cole obtain a medical report justifying her early departure request was based on a bona fide occupational requirement. In order to establish this defence, Bell must demonstrate that accommodation of the individual or class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on Bell, considering health, safety and cost (s. 15(2)). Indeed, as the Supreme Court decision in (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 at para. 21 (Grismer)) would indicate, to avail itself of this defence, an employer must demonstrate that it has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship.\n[67] Bell contends, however, that before the duty to accommodate is engaged, an employee must request an accommodation measure and objectively demonstrate the need for this measure. Furthermore, Bell argues that the employee must also provide relevant information in support of her request, which must be clear, detailed and sufficient to support it.\n[68] In the present case, Bell points out that when Ms. Cole first approached Ms. Bozzelli, she explained that she required the adjustment to her work schedule to nurse her son and thereby build up his immunity to infections, to which he was particularly susceptible due to his heart condition. If this was the need that required accommodation, Bell contends that Ms. Cole failed to provide sufficient information to document the need. When Bell asked her to file a physician's note in support of her request, the medical documents produced made no mention of her son's condition. No one at the DMG ever learned of his illness. Had they been aware of it, it is possible that the DMG would have reached a different conclusion in 2002, and perhaps would have continued to support her accommodation request, without requesting additional medical documentation.\n[69] Bell's argument, however, does not take into account a fundamental point. Why should the son's health be a consideration when dealing with Ms. Cole's request? Should it make any difference what motivation this parent may have had when making her request for some time off work to breastfeed her child? Ms. Cole's principal objective was to build up her son's immunities given his proneness to infection and the likelihood of future surgery. The incentive for Ms. Kustec was to help her daughter deal with her allergies. As Ms. Agnew indicated in her expert evidence, the benefits to be gained through breastfeeding are numerous and accrue not only to the child and the mother, but to society as a whole. As was also pointed out in Qu\u00e9bec (Comm. des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) et Gigu\u00e8re v. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) (2003), 47 C.H.R.R. D\/67, 2003 QCTDP 88 at paras. 53-7, these benefits have been recognized internationally in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Canada in 1991. The promotion for breastfeeding has been one of the major goals of the World Health Organization for almost three decades.\n[70] Thus, although Ms. Cole advised Bell management of her own prime motivation for continuing to breastfeed her baby after returning to work, Bell's reaction should only have been to consider this request as that of any mother making a request to her employer for measures that would enable her to continue breastfeeding her child. Bell's requirement that Ms. Cole provide medical proof to support the request was not justified. Bell may have had some basis to impose this condition if it had any reason to question whether Ms. Cole had indeed given birth 12 months earlier or doubted her sincerity when she explained that she was still breastfeeding her child. But there is no evidence before me of any such question or doubt ever having been raised in this case.\n[71] The decision by Bell to request medical proof was unfortunate, as it ultimately created the potential for Ms. Cole to lose the benefit of guaranteed work shifts by May 2002. I am persuaded from Ms. Cole's evidence that she was surprised by Bell's initial request for a physician's note and that she did not know quite what to make of it. But she decided to go along with the request. Her primary concern was her child's well-being. If Bell management insisted on a doctor's note, she would make sure that they would get a doctor's note.\n[72] I would note incidentally that given my finding that the request for a medical note was unjustified, little really turns on whether or not Ms. Bozzelli actually specified to Ms. Cole that the medical note should make specific mention of the son's illness. In any event, I find Ms. Cole's evidence more credible in this regard. Ms. Bozzelli remained in the hearing room while Ms. Cole and all her other witnesses testified. Ms. Bozzelli therefore had the benefit of listening to Ms. Cole's version of the facts before giving her own testimony. Moreover, given Ms. Cole's desire and willingness to make all efforts to ensure that she would be able to breastfeed her son, as is apparent to me from the entirety of her evidence, it seems highly improbable that she would have failed to follow up on the request for this type of medical information if Ms. Bozzelli had really been as explicit as she claims.\n[73] On the contrary, it is quite obvious from the minimal information provided in the doctor's first note that neither Ms. Cole nor her physician comprehended what Bell was exactly seeking. Ms. Cole had already explained her situation to her manager. Yet Bell was asking for more information as to why Ms. Cole's health required accommodation. Indeed, the BC1935 form that she was asked to complete in 2002 addressed employee illness or disability only. It was not intended to deal with illness of an employee's family member. And why should it have? The DMG's role was to assess the medical restrictions of Bell employees. Ms. Cole had no such medical restrictions, but Bell's request compelled her to, in effect, find a medical restriction (mastitis), in order to obtain the accommodation she was seeking for her son's needs. However, since mastitis was unlikely to occur beyond 24 months following the birth (a point upon which both Ms. Agnew and Dr. Demers concur), Ms. Cole's claim for accommodation was certain to be refused once the child reached two years of age, in 2002.\n[74] In this sense, the DMG was justified in refusing its continued support of Ms. Cole's accommodation. But the DMG's opinion should have been immaterial. The matter should not have been before the DMG in the first place since Ms. Cole was not ill or disabled, she was a nursing mother without any health issues of her own.\n[75] Bell agrees that the act of breastfeeding is not a disability but contends that an employer has a right to request supporting, objective evidence from an employee who requests accommodation to nurse her child. The employee must demonstrate a need, not just a mere preference. To place things in the context of this case, a mother may prefer to feed a child at a certain time of the day, but does she need to do so? Bell claims that the burden rests on the employee to make this demonstration, arguing that an employer has no obligation to take an employee's request at face value. Bell's counsel suggested an analogy could be drawn from the situation where an employee seeks religious accommodation (a religious holiday off work, for example). An employer would be justified in requesting confirmation from the employee's cleric of the genuineness of the religious practice. Similarly, it was argued, an employer would be justified in asking a woman to provide medical proof that the breast feeding accommodation she seeks is necessary. Bell did not provide any legal authority in support of this argument.\n[76] Moreover, I disagree with the premise of this analogy. In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 551 at para. 43, a case dealing with freedom of religion, the Supreme Court held that the emphasis in such matters is on the personal choice of religious beliefs. An expert or authority on religious law is not the surrogate for an individual's affirmation of what his or her religious beliefs are. Requiring proof of the established practices of a religion to gauge the sincerity of belief diminishes the very freedom that is sought to be protected. A claimant may choose to adduce expert evidence to demonstrate that his or her belief is consistent with the practices or beliefs of other adherents of the faith, but while such evidence may be relevant to a demonstration of sincerity, it is not necessary (Syndicat Northcrest, at para. 54).\n[77] Following Bell's analogy, if it is not necessary for a claimant of religious freedom to provide so-called objective evidence of religious practices to establish the sincerity of his or her religious beliefs, why should a mother have to produce objective evidence to prove her sincerity when she declares that she is nursing her infant and needs accommodation to continue to do so after returning to work. In my view, in the absence of any evidence that would lead the employer to doubt the sincerity of the female employee's assertion (i.e. that she has an infant whom she is nursing), she should not have to prove to her employer that nursing her child is necessary. As was pointed out in the labour arbitration case of Re: Carewest and H.S.A.A. (2001), 93 L.A.C. (4th) 129 at 160, breastfeeding, which is obviously unique to the female gender, is as intimately connected to child birth as pregnancy and should be safeguarded in the same way (see also Gigu\u00e8re, supra at para. 60).\n[78] I therefore disagree with Bell's contention that an employer is justified in asking its employee to provide some independent proof of her need to breastfeed her child. Consequently, Bell's request, in the present case, that Ms. Cole produce medical evidence to support her request for accommodation was not justified. Bell can therefore not put forth her failure to provide medical documentation regarding her child's condition to the DMG as a reasonable or satisfactory explanation.\nE. Did Bell establish that it made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship? [79] In the present case, not only has Bell failed to establish that it made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship, but there is no evidence indicating that Bell ever tried to accommodate Ms. Cole's request as a mother to breastfeed her child. Her initial request for PGU time off work was strongly discouraged. Her subsequent petition to receive a guaranteed 4:00 p.m. end of shift was not properly addressed. While it is true that in fact she was assigned fixed shifts for the following year, it was not to accommodate Ms. Cole's needs as a mother, but rather as a disabled or ill person. As I have already explained, this mischaracterization later resulted in the potential loss of her guaranteed shifts and forced her to repeatedly return to her physician to obtain one new medical report after another.\n[80] Bell's failure to accommodate Ms. Cole's request is not surprising given the fact that, as Dr. Demers testified, Bell has no policy on accommodating employees with respect to breastfeeding. Decisions are made on a case by case basis by individual managers. We know, for instance, that Ms. Kustec's request was accommodated. Ms. Long told Ms. Cole that she would not grant PGU time for breastfeeding, certainly with respect to employees in her department, although she raised the possibility of exploring other options (lunch etc. etc.).\n[81] Not only is there an absence of any attempt to accommodate Ms. Cole as a mother, but the evidence put before the Tribunal suggests that accommodating Ms. Cole with a guaranteed shift end at 4:00 p.m. would not have imposed any hardship on Bell whatsoever, let alone undue hardship. Given her seniority, she was entitled to those shifts on all but a handful of days each year. Ms. Bozzelli alluded in her evidence to some comments that some other employees apparently made when they noticed that Ms. Cole's shifts were always ending at 4:00 p.m. No further details were given about these comments, nor was any evidence brought forth about any ramifications arising from these observations by the other employees. There was therefore no evidence adduced on the implications of any possible impact on the seniority rights of other employees.\n[82] Furthermore, Bell did not even demonstrate that Ms. Cole's request for an earlier shift end (up to an hour earlier) was unreasonable. The employer would not have been required to pay her a salary while she was absent as it would have been designated as PGU time off work. Moreover, the absence would have been at the end of the day. Ms. Cole testified that in her experience, there would usually be no more than one person on a work break at 3:45 p.m. More people were away from their stations at the lunch hour when Ms. Kustec was given her PGU time off to breastfeed her child. Bell's only evidence in this regard was a comment made by Ms. Long that it would be hard for her to say what the demands would have been when Ms. Cole made her requests. Ms. Long added that right now (i.e. in November 2006, when she testified), Bell has a real need for people from 4:00 to 5:00 and that lunch was never an issue.\n[83] In my view, Bell has not established on the balance of probabilities that in 2002, Ms. Cole's daily departure up to one hour before her ordinary shift end would have caused undue hardship to Bell.\n[84] I therefore find that Bell has not established the defence set out in s. 15(1) (a) and s. 15 (2) of the Act.\n[85] Since no other reasonable or satisfactory explanation or exemption has been established to rebut the prima facie case of discrimination, I find that Ms. Cole was discriminated against by Bell on the basis of her sex, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Act, and that her complaint has therefore been substantiated.\nF. What Remedies does Ms. Cole seek? (i) An order pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act [86] Ms. Cole is seeking an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act, that Bell take measures to prevent the discriminatory practice that occurred in the present case from recurring in the future. She points out that Bell does not inform its female employees who are returning to work after their maternity leave of the possibility of requesting accommodation from the employer in order to breastfeed their children. Ms. Cole argues that had she been aware of her rights in this respect, she would have been more forceful in her request for accommodation by, for instance, not rescinding her initial request for PGU time off work.\n[87] As I have already noted, Bell acknowledges that it does not have any formal policy with regard to the accommodation of its employees who wish to breastfeed. The matter is dealt with on a case by case basis. Bell did not lead any evidence indicating that it provides any information to its employees relating to this form of accommodation at the present time.\n[88] In my view, Ms. Cole's request for this order is reasonable. Both Bell's management and its staff at large will stand to benefit from a greater understanding of their respective rights and obligations under the Act in relation to this particular issue. This could, in turn, prevent discriminatory practices similar to the present one from occurring in the future.\n[89] I therefore order Bell to take measures, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to prevent the discriminatory practice cited in this case or a similar practice from occurring in the future. These measures shall include the establishment of a policy relating to requests by Bell employees for accommodation with regard to breastfeeding that is consistent with the findings in this decision. Bell employees, and particularly parents who are the most likely to be directly affected by the policy, should be made aware of the substance of the policy in an effective manner.\n(ii) Compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53(2)(e)) [90] Ms. Cole is asking that Bell be ordered to compensate her for the pain and suffering that she experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. She is seeking the maximum amount available under s. 53(2)(e), $20,000.\n[91] Part of her claimed pain and suffering relates to her not obtaining up to an hour of PGU time at the end of her shift. By being compelled to leave her work no earlier than 4:00 p.m., she was only able to reach her son just before his next feeding, and about 12 hours after his last feeding. As a result, her milk tended to build up and eventually began to leak. She wore breast pads to try to prevent the leaks from appearing on her clothes. There was an odour associated with the leakage. She described the circumstances as humiliating for her. Ms. Cole acknowledged that leakage could occur at any time during the course of the day, but she claimed that the leakages were more frequent as the time for her son's next feeding neared.\n[92] Ms. Cole also testified that there were occasions towards the end of her shift when she was caught in a conversation with a customer that she could not immediately terminate. As a result, her return to her son would sometimes be delayed by up to 15 minutes. This delay would render her breasts even more engorged, which caused her some physical pain.\n[93] Ms. Cole also described how inconvenienced she felt at having to repeatedly return to her physician to obtain medical letters and reports to justify the accommodation she was seeking even though she was neither sick nor disabled. She also spoke of the angst and uncertainty she experienced when she learned, in May 2002, that the accommodation that had been provided to her until then would soon be ending, unless she could provide the medical evidence that would satisfy Bell and the DMG.\n[94] In addition, Ms. Cole explained the emotional pain and loss she felt at having to cease nursing her son in October 2002, following Ms. Blackall's remarks of September 27, 2002. I am not, however, persuaded that these remarks were the cause for Ms. Cole's decision to stop breastfeeding her child in October 2002. While it is true that Ms. Blackall's remarks are a reflection of Bell's ongoing failure to properly address Ms. Cole's requests, it should also be noted that Ms. Blackall never actually told Ms. Cole that her fixed shift ends would cease. Indeed, Ms. Cole was never assigned a shift ending beyond 4:00 p.m. after November 2002, and formally, Bell did not terminate the medical accommodation until February 2003. Ms. Cole must in fact have been aware or at least had a sense that Bell had not officially changed its position in this regard. This is apparent from the fact that on the three occasions in October and November 2002, when she was assigned some shifts that ended after 4:00 p.m., she immediately contacted Ms. Blackall, who promptly corrected the problem and made sure that her shifts would end by 4:00 p.m.\n[95] Ms. Cole acknowledged that it was always up to her to decide when to stop breastfeeding. Her child's paediatrician had merely advised her to continue for as long as she and her son were comfortable with it.\n[96] I am therefore not persuaded that Ms. Cole's decision to ultimately stop breastfeeding was so much associated with Ms. Blackall's notice as it was with her personal choice to bring the nursing to an end. Any pain and suffering that Ms. Cole may have as stemming from her decision to stop nursing her child in October 2002 is, in my view, too remote to be attributed to Bell's discriminatory conduct.\n[97] Finally, I cannot ignore the significant fact that from May 2001 until February 2003, when Ms. Cole left HVQ, she was never required to actually work any shift that was scheduled to extend beyond 4:00 p.m. There were a few occasions when, in order to achieve this result, Ms. Cole had to use her sick leave days or switch shifts with other employees, but the fact remains that she never worked a shift that was scheduled to end beyond 4:00 p.m.\n[98] Given all of these circumstances, I order Bell to pay Ms. Cole the sum of $5,000 as compensation pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act.\n(iii) Special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act. [99] Ms. Cole seeks an award of special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act. She alleges that Bell recklessly engaged in the discriminatory practice against her. By offhandedly refusing her request for as little as 15 minutes PGU time, without any further assessment of her situation, and in the second phase, mischaracterizing her situation as that of a disabled or ill employee and compelling her to return repeatedly to her physician, Bell acted recklessly.\n[100] According to Black's Law Dictionary, recklessness is present in conduct that evinces disregard of or indifference to consequences. The rendering of recklessly in the French version of the Act is inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, which would seem to contemplate conduct that is engaged in without any prior reflection (un manque de refl\u00e9xion; qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9, pes\u00e9: Le petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise - 2006).\n[101] In my view, the term in either language can be ascribed to Bell's discriminatory practice in this case. Ms. Long did not appear to have reflected on the consequences of her rather abrupt response to Ms. Cole's PGU request. Bell's subsequent decision to treat Ms. Cole's case as a medical matter was also taken without any consideration of whether breastfeeding should be treated in the same manner as a disability or illness in the first place. This decision gave rise to a number of unfortunate consequences for Ms. Cole, including the inconvenience of numerous unnecessary trips to her physician.\n[102] Section 53(3) states that compensation of as much as $20,000 can be awarded pursuant thereto. Taking into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the fact that Bell's discriminatory actions were not truly wilful nor malicious, I order Bell to pay Ms. Cole $2,000 as special compensation under s. 53(3).\n(iv) Lost income [103] Ms. Cole requests compensation for her lost wages arising from the discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 53(2)(c). This claim can be divided into three classes. The first relates to the occasions when she had to leave work without pay in order to meet her physician and obtain the medical notes and forms that the DMG had requested. The second form of claim is in regard to the time spent by her away from work to attend the hearing into her complaint as well as the two unsuccessful mediation sessions that preceded the hearing. Finally, she is also requesting compensation for the three days that she spent preparing for the hearing (one of which was a work day that she took as PGU time off without pay).\n[104] With respect to the first class of claim, I order Bell to pay Ms. Cole the wages that she lost while attending at her physician's office to obtain the requested medical notes and reports.\n[105] In respect of the other two types of claims, in my view, there is no evidence before me of any exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify awarding such damages (see Canada (A.G.) v. Lambie (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303, [1996] F.C.J. No. 1695 (F.C.T.D.); Woiden v. Lynn (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296 (C.H.R.T.)). Ms. Cole's claims under these heads of damages are therefore dismissed.\n(v) Interest [106] Interest is payable in respect of the monetary awards made in this decision (s. 53(4) of the Act). The interest shall be calculated in accordance with Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure, but given the relatively tardy filing of Ms. Cole's human rights complaint in relation to the discriminatory practice, the interest shall run from the date of the complaint's filing, April 14, 2004.\n(vi) Retention of jurisdiction by the Tribunal [107] The Tribunal will retain jurisdiction to receive evidence, hear further submissions and make further orders, with regard to any disputes or difficulties arising from the interpretation or implementation of the remedies ordered.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

This motion followed a letter that the complainant had sent to the parties, as well as to the Tribunal, on March 22, 2007, advising that such a motion would be filed.\nI. The position of the parties A. The complainant [2] The complainant\u2019s motion is based on the fact that her situation has changed since the hearing schedule was set because she has been employed since December 11, 2006, at the Conseil de la justice administrative du Qu\u00e9bec, a body monitoring the ethical conduct of about 500 administrative judges.\n[3] The complainant submits that it is impossible for her to be absent from her current employment for more than two weeks per month and that she would have to resign from her job if she were forced to be absent. Moreover, the complainant submits that, short of resigning from her job, she would only be able to be present before the Tribunal when her work schedule would so permit.\n[4] According to the complainant, the body that employs her cannot do without her for 6 or 7 consecutive weeks. In her arguments, the complainant claims that she makes up one-third of the body\u2019s resources and that her absence would deprive six million potential litigants from Quebec of her services.\n[5] In a letter dated February 23, 2007, the complainant also states that she was not able to find a reasonable accommodation with her employer with regard to the continued periods of absence related to the hearing of this complaint.\n[6] The complainant is therefore asking the Tribunal to adhere to the Tribunal\u2019s usual practice, namely a maximum of two weeks of hearing at a time (letter dated March 22, 2007).\n[7] That being said, at the hearing of March 26, 2007, the complainant however argued before the Tribunal that she was prepared to resign from her employment if the hearing of her complaint took place over two consecutive months.\n[8] Finally, the complainant informed the Tribunal that if there were federal elections, she was a likely candidate for the New Democratic Party. She would then have to be absent for an indeterminate period, namely for the period of the electoral campaign. The complainant argued that she could hardly imagine not being available to almost 85,000 constituents for the period of the electoral campaign. As for her job, the complainant pointed out that, under her collective agreement, she would be entitled to unpaid leave.\nB. The Commission [9] As for the Commission, it submits that the complainant\u2019s request is aimed at accommodating her and that it is not capricious on her part, given the difficulties transgender persons have finding employment.\n[10] For the Commission, requiring the complainant to be present for four consecutive weeks is extremely difficult for her. Moreover, denying the complainant\u2019s request would prevent her from fully participating in the hearing of her complaint. The Commission argues that the complainant has the right to be accommodated and reiterates that the Commission will make itself available, whatever the outcome.\n[11] At the hearing, the Commission did not make any concrete suggestion regarding the manner in which it proposed to resume the hearings if the Tribunal were to grant the complainant\u2019s motion.\nC. The respondent\u2019s position [12] For the respondent, the Canadian Armed Forces, amending the hearing schedule that has already been established is not something that can be envisaged. Rather, in this case, the complainant\u2019s request is excessive and no evidence was heard justifying any amendment whatsoever to the hearing calendar. According to the respondent, the current schedule must be maintained, with the exception of minor changes.\n[13] The respondent argues that the amendment of the present schedule would be prejudicial to it just when it is ready to tender its evidence. The respondent states that its witnesses are called in a logical order and to change the order of the respondent\u2019s witnesses would, at this stage, would be prejudicial.\n[14] Moreover, the respondent argues that changing the hearing schedule would have the effect of cancelling several weeks of hearings already scheduled. The respondent argues that the Tribunal, contrary to what the complainant alleges, must control the conduct of the hearing and determine the hearing dates while respecting the rights of the parties. It points out that the hearing schedule, as established, does not result from a decision by one of the parties, but from a consensus by all the parties.\n[15] According to the respondent, the complainant must accept the consequences associated with the hearing of her complaint and the undertakings made by counsel. It points out that the complainant\u2019s multiple activities should not dictate the conduct of this case and the hearing schedule.\n[16] The respondent submits that this case should be closely and tightly managed and that the Tribunal must ensure that the hearings proceed in a reasonable manner.\n[17] The respondent therefore asks the Tribunal to maintain the present hearing schedule.\nII. Discussion [18] The Tribunal finds that the complainant is a very busy person. On top of her current employment, she is the Webmaster of the website for the Conseil de la justice administrative. As well, she teaches ethics at the L\u00e9vis Campus of the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, she sits or sat on several committees or commissions, intends to be a candidate in the next federal elections. The complainant is also involved in litigation before the Tax Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal. Two cases are currently before the Tribunal where she is the complainant.\n[19] In this regard, the Tribunal is aware of the fact that the complainant is involved in a case scheduled to proceed before the Tribunal during the weeks of April 17 and 24, 2007. These dates were set once the dates in this case were known. The complainant\u2019s acceptance of these dates makes it so that she has six consecutive weeks of hearings in April and May, a situation which does not appear to be acceptable to her employer.\n[20] Given her many activities and the new job that she has, the complainant argues that it would be preferable for her if the Tribunal were to sit for only two weeks each month. That would make it possible for her not to resign from her current employment. I would add, in passing, that there was no evidence submitted to the Tribunal to the effect that the complainant would be compelled to resign from her employment if the Tribunal did not grant her motion.\n[21] In this case, the Tribunal is aware that the actual hearing schedule places many constraints on the parties, as well as on the Tribunal. That being said, the Tribunal reminds the parties that the hearing dates in this matter were set, for the better part, in October and December 2006 with the consent of all the parties. Several days of hearings were then used to prepare the hearing schedule. Once the schedule was established, the Tribunal made the necessary arrangements to reserve hearing rooms in various places. The scheduling of the hearing dates in this matter also had an impact on the availability of the member to hear other complaints and set dates in other matters pending before the Tribunal.\n[22] In the current state of the case, four weeks of hearings are scheduled for May, five weeks of hearings in July and one week in October. Another week of hearing may be necessary in October so that, if need be, the complainant can tender evidence in reply.\n[23] Amending the current schedule at this stage of the proceedings as suggested by the complainant, when the respondent is about to tender its evidence, i.e. having a maximum of two weeks per month to accommodate her would involve:\nCancelling two weeks of hearing in May and postponing them until July because the member is not available in June; cancelling the arrangements made to reserve hearing rooms; rescheduling the testimony of the respondent\u2019s medical experts to July, irrespective of their availability; Postponing five weeks of hearing from the month of July to October and November, as the member is not available in August and September; cancelling the arrangements made to reserve hearing rooms; the uncertainty of the availability of the respondent\u2019s expert witnesses at later dates; Postponing the testimony of Dr. Beltrami, scheduled for the week of October 22, 2007; Scheduling two weeks of hearing in October for the resumption of the respondent\u2019s evidence; Scheduling two weeks of hearing in November for the resumption of the respondent\u2019s evidence; Scheduling two weeks of hearing in December: one week for the respondent to close its evidence and one week to hear Dr. Beltrami\u2019s testimony in the context of the Commission\u2019s evidence; Scheduling another week of hearing in January for the complainant to possibly tender evidence in reply.\n[24] As a matter of fact, a change to the current schedule as initially proposed by the complainant, who has finished tendering her evidence, would mean that the respondent would be compelled to adduce its evidence over a period of eight months, i.e. from May to December 2007, while according to the current schedule, the respondent\u2019s evidence would be closed at the beginning of August. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this would not serve the interests of justice and would prejudice the respondent which, at this stage of the proceedings, has had the presence of its witnesses, both ordinary and expert, secured for some time.\n[25] At the hearing, the complainant, even though she proposed that the hearings be limited to two weeks a month so that she does not lose her job, as she submits, argued nevertheless that she was prepared to resign from her job if the hearings took place over a period of two consecutive months.\n[26] To ensure that the hearing of this complaint proceeds properly, one party cannot simply propose a new modus operandi without specifying the ins and outs and leave the determination of a new hearing schedule to a later date, without regard to the availability of the member, counsel, and witnesses. The sound management of a hearing does not permit this.\n[27] The complainant was aware of the hearing schedule currently in effect when she accepted her new job. In December 2006, when the complainant got her new job, she should have informed her employer of the state of the judicial proceedings before the Tribunal and the time required to deal with them.\n[28] The Tribunal is prepared to accommodate the parties insofar as the party\u2019s request is reasonable and the proposed alternatives are viable. The alternatives proposed by the complainant in this case, i.e. two consecutive months of hearing or two weeks of hearing per month, are not reasonable at this stage of the hearing of her complaint.\n[29] In this case, the parties have the duty to respect the undertakings that were made, on an informed basis, with regard to how this case will proceed.\n[30] Finally, it is important to note that once the respondent\u2019s evidence is closed, there will still be several days of hearing for which the schedule has not yet been determined, if only for Dr. Beltrami\u2019s testimony during the week of October 22, 2007.\n[31] With regard to the continuance of the hearings in this case, the parties will in due course be able to make all of the submissions they deem worthwhile. For now, the schedule already established must be observed.\nIII. Decision [32] For the considerations stated above, the complainant\u2019s motion to amend the existing hearing schedule is denied. The hearing will therefore resume, as scheduled, on April 30, 2006, and the hearings shall proceed according to the hearing schedule already sent to the parties.\nSigned by\nPierre Deschamps Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario April 5, 2007\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1047\/2805\nStyle of Cause: Micheline Montreuil v.

Hadjis\n[1] On March 30, 2007, Ms. Gaucher sent a letter to the Tribunal seeking an adjournment of the hearing, which had been scheduled to resume on April 16, 2006, in Edmonton. As she stated in her letter dated March 30, 2007, the reason for her request was that she had yet to find a lawyer to represent her.\n[2] On April 5, 2007, Ms. Gaucher was informed that I had denied her request and that the reasons for my ruling would follow.\n[3] In the meantime, before I issued my reasons, Ms. Gaucher sent an e-mail message to the Tribunal, on April 11, 2007, in which she indicated that since she had not been granted a further adjournment, she had no choice but to discontinue her action. As of the date and time when I am signing this present ruling, the Tribunal has yet to receive a more formal request to withdraw the complaint.\n[4] Whether or not such a request will be forthcoming, I believe that it is still necessary for me to set out my reasons for refusing Ms. Gaucher's most recent request for a postponement of the hearing into her complaint.\n[5] Ms. Gaucher filed her complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on June 16, 1998. The Commission in turn referred the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry on February 26, 2004. Since the referral, Ms. Gaucher has been represented by two different lawyers, the last of which she dismissed on November 1, 2006. By this point, the Tribunal had heard evidence over a total of almost three weeks. The first two weeks of hearings were conducted in Edmonton and the third week in Halifax. Ms. Gaucher had not closed her case by then, but it would appear that most of her intended witnesses had already testified.\n[6] When Ms. Gaucher notified the Tribunal that she had dismissed her lawyer, she requested an adjournment of the hearing, which was at that time scheduled to continue for a little over two weeks, commencing on December 7, 2006. The Tribunal was also scheduled to hear the evidence of one witness by video conference, on November 28, 2006. On November 3, 2006, a case management conference call was conducted, to deal in part with the adjournment request. The Tribunal granted the adjournment, but informed the parties in clear and unambiguous terms that the case would proceed on the next scheduled hearing dates, irrespective of whether the Complainant had managed to retain legal counsel by then or not.\n[7] The parties informed the Tribunal that they were available to continue the case in April, and consequently, the Tribunal scheduled hearing dates for a two-week period beginning on April 16, 2007, to take place in Edmonton.\n[8] A number of case management conference calls took place regularly in the months thereafter. On each such occasion, Ms. Gaucher explained that she had still been unable to find another lawyer to represent her in this case. I informed her that whatever the outcome of her search, I expected her to proceed, with or without counsel, when the case resumed in April.\n[9] During the case management conference call that was conducted on March 29, 2007, Ms. Gaucher reiterated that she had yet to find new counsel and asked the Tribunal for another adjournment. As was noted in a follow up letter from the Tribunal, I directed that given the number of postponements that had already taken place in this matter (three postponements prior to the start of the hearing and another postponement when Ms. Gaucher dismissed her legal counsel in November 2006), the hearing could not be delayed any further. I instructed Ms. Gaucher to arrange to call her witnesses for the April hearing dates. I also informed her that if, as she indicated, one of her witnesses resided in Manitoba, arrangements could be made to have her testify by video conference.\n[10] On March 30, 2007, Ms. Gaucher sent a letter to the Tribunal again requesting an adjournment. It is this last request that I am addressing in this ruling. She has basically asked me to revisit my earlier decision. I see no reason to change it. She cited certain difficulties that she has had obtaining approval for Legal Aid funding. She also indicated that her prior legal counsel withheld her file for a number of months, although I note from her letter that she apparently only attempted to retrieve the file on January 26, 2007, almost three months after she dismissed her lawyer.\n[11] Ms. Gaucher claimed in her letter that she was unable to make arrangements to have some of her witnesses testify during the upcoming hearing dates because she was not in possession of her file, which included the list of potential witnesses that her legal counsel had prepared as part of the Tribunal's documentary disclosure process. Yet, on February 6, 2007, the Tribunal sent her a copy on CD of all the correspondence in the Tribunal case file, including her former counsel's Statements of Particulars, which contained the witness lists. Ms. Gaucher pointed out that the CD was sent to her old address and delivery was therefore delayed. She had not, however, informed the Tribunal of her new address.\n[12] The Respondent, for its part, does not consent to this most recent adjournment request. Respondent counsel refers to the prejudice caused to it by the significant time and expense that is wasted each time counsel and witnesses are required to prepare for resumption of a hearing that is adjourned. She points out that there is a public interest in the timely conclusion of discrimination complaints.\n[13] Indeed, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (s. 48.9 of the Canadian Human Rights Act). In my view, to require Ms. Gaucher to complete her case at this stage, some nine years after she filed her complaint, three years after it was referred to the Tribunal, and three weeks into her evidence, after four prior adjournments, would not be in breach of the requirements of natural justice. Ms. Gaucher acknowledged during the conference calls that she was having great difficulty finding a lawyer who would be willing to take up her file at this stage of the case and who was familiar enough with human rights law to take on the responsibility. Given these circumstances, there does not appear to be any reasonable expectation of Ms. Gaucher's finding a lawyer in the foreseeable future.\n[14] In my view, to allow Ms. Gaucher to delay her case for what amounts to an indefinite period, without any resolution, would be unfair and unacceptably prejudicial to the Respondent. At some point, all parties must complete their cases. It is perhaps unfortunate that the Complainant has been unable to retain legal counsel, but this concern is outweighed by the unfairness to the other party of allowing this matter to remain unfinished, halfway through the evidence, while the Complainant continues to search indefinitely for a lawyer.\n[15] These are the reasons for which I turned down Ms. Gaucher's latest request for an adjournment.\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

[1] La pr\u00e9sente plainte porte sur la question de savoir si Postes Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Sandy Lipp (n\u00e9e Culic) en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et de son sexe (grossesse) en 2000 et 2001 au Centre de traitement du courrier \u00e0 Regina, et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi)\nII. QUELS SONT LES FAITS QUI ONT DONN\u00c9 LIEU AU D\u00c9P\u00d4T DE LA PLAINTE? [2] Sandy Lipp a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel comme commis des postes \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes \u00e0 Regina en 1991. Les commis des postes s'occupent de la t\u00e2che importante qui consiste \u00e0 trier et \u00e0 distribuer le courrier au Canada.\n[3] En 1995 et 1997, Mme Lipp a subi des blessures dans la r\u00e9gion du cou, de l'\u00e9paule et de la t\u00eate. En mars 2000, Postes Canada a reconnu dans une lettre qu'elle a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Lipp que celle-ci souffrait d'une invalidit\u00e9 partielle permanente (IPP).\n[4] Par suite de son \u00e9tat d'IPP, Mme Lipp s'est vu imposer certaines restrictions quant aux t\u00e2ches qu'elle pouvait accomplir en tant que commis des postes. L'une de ces restrictions \u00e9tait que, d'ordinaire, elle ne pouvait travailler que six heures par jour.\n[5] En juin 2000, Mme Lipp a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, c'est-\u00e0-dire le quart du soir, au Centre de traitement du courrier. Les commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein travaillent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des quarts de travail de huit heures. Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada a exig\u00e9 qu'on lui remette des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tablissant que Mme Lipp pouvait travailler sans aucun danger au-del\u00e0 de la limite de six heures de travail mentionn\u00e9e dans sa lettre d'IPP.\n[6] Mme Lipp a produit des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9manant de son m\u00e9decin dans lesquels il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle pouvait travailler \u00e0 temps plein (huit heures) sur des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Postes Canada et Medisys, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'experts-conseils m\u00e9dicaux qui s'occupe des questions de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail de Postes Canada, avaient des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 ces renseignements. Elles craignaient notamment que ces renseignements ne fournissaient pas une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale objective quant aux restrictions et quant aux capacit\u00e9s de Mme Lipp.\n[7] Malgr\u00e9 ses r\u00e9serves, Postes Canada a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp, en octobre 2000, le poste \u00e0 temps plein du troisi\u00e8me quart de travail. On lui a permis d'occuper ce poste car les t\u00e2ches de ce dernier avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es.\n[8] Postes Canada a toutefois dit \u00e0 Mme Lipp qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours tenue de fournir d'autres documents m\u00e9dicaux concernant ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Par cons\u00e9quent, pendant qu'elle occupait le poste \u00e0 temps plein, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp d'aller subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant (EMI) \u00e0 Regina. En raison d'un malentendu quant \u00e0 la date, Mme Lipp n'est pas all\u00e9e subir l'EMI \u00e0 Regina en avril 2001.\n[9] Au cours du m\u00eame mois, Mme Lipp a pris un cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9. Elle fut diagnostiqu\u00e9e comme souffrant d'une d\u00e9pression majeure ainsi que de troubles anxieux.\n[10] \u00c0 l'automne 2001, Mme Lipp a inform\u00e9 Postes Canada qu'elle \u00e9tait en bonne sant\u00e9 et qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 retourner au travail. Postes Canada lui a dit que, avant de retourner au travail, elle devrait subir deux examens m\u00e9dicaux ind\u00e9pendants \u00e0 Winnipeg. L'un de ces EMI devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois et l'autre par un psychiatre.\n[11] Mme Lipp \u00e9tait enceinte \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et elle a dit \u00e0 Postes Canada qu'elle ne pouvait pas se d\u00e9placer en raison des difficult\u00e9s que lui causait sa grossesse. Elle a refus\u00e9 de subir les EMI. Postes Canada lui a impos\u00e9 une suspension disciplinaire sans solde parce qu'elle avait refus\u00e9 de subir les EMI.\n[12] Le 18 mars 2003, Mme Lipp a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[13] Mme Lipp a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des griefs dans lesquels elle pr\u00e9tendait que Postes Canada avait viol\u00e9 la convention collective en accusant un retard d\u00e9raisonnable \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans ses fonctions et en lui imposant une suspension disciplinaire sans solde. Le 16 avril 2004, un arbitre a rejet\u00e9 les griefs de Mme Lipp (Le Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes c. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Re Culic) (16 avril 2004), Regina, Griefs du syndicat no 820-00-00046 et 00051 (Norman).\n[14] Le 28 septembre 2005, la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Postes Canada a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e sur le fondement du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de Postes Canada et a ordonn\u00e9 que l'on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte (Culic c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2006 TCDP 06).\nIII. QUELLES SONT LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE DANS LA PR\u00c9SENTE PLAINTE? [15] Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance que les probl\u00e8mes de t\u00eate, de cou et d'\u00e9paule de Mme Lipp constituaient une d\u00e9ficience, et, constituaient, par cons\u00e9quent, un motif de distinction illicite en vertu de la Loi. De m\u00eame, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait enceinte \u00e0 l'automne 2001 et qu'un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel en raison de sa grossesse constituait un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel en raison du sexe.\n[16] Au cours de l'audience, toutefois, on a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si la plainte devait comprendre l'all\u00e9gation que, en refusant de permettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp de retourner au travail \u00e0 l'automne 2001, Postes Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Lipp en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes psychologiques ou de ses soi-disant probl\u00e8mes psychologiques. Dans ses conclusions finales \u00e9crites, l'avocat de Postes Canada a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il ne s'opposait nullement \u00e0 l'ajout de cette all\u00e9gation dans la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, je l'ai ajout\u00e9e aux all\u00e9gations figurant dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[17] Au deuxi\u00e8me jour de l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. J'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait recevable pour le motif qu'elle \u00e9tait pertinente aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte et que la jurisprudence l'\u00e9tayait fortement (Ford Motor Co. of Canada c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) (2001), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 465). J'ai toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que je reporterais au moment de la d\u00e9cision finale le prononc\u00e9 de ma d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir quelle importance j'accorderai aux conclusions de l'arbitre. Compte tenu que les conclusions de l'arbitre sont pertinentes \u00e0 l'explication de Postes Canada quant \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite discriminatoire, je traiterai de l'importance que je leur ai accord\u00e9es dans la partie de ma d\u00e9cision qui traite de l'explication de Postes Canada.\n[18] Les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instance sont donc les suivantes :\nLes exigences relatives \u00e0 la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp, notamment l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina, \u00e9taient-elles discriminatoires; La mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada formulait ses demandes de renseignements \u00e9tait-elle discriminatoire; L'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail \u00e0 l'automne 2001 \u00e9tait-elle discriminatoire.\nIV. QUE DOIT-ON PROUVER DANS LA PR\u00c9SENTE INSTANCE AFIN D'\u00c9TABLIR QU'IL Y A EU DISCRIMINATION? [19] Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi (La Loi, article 7).\n[20] Il incombe d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28 (O'Malley), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9num\u00e8re les r\u00e8gles fondamentales concernant l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, la question \u00e0 laquelle on doit r\u00e9pondre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve prima facie est la suivante : existe-t-il une preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e9tayant les all\u00e9gations de Mme Lipp selon lesquelles elle a fait l'objet d'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, en contravention de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi et (ou) on a refus\u00e9 de l'employer ou de continuer de l'employer, en contravention de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi?\n[22] Si on r\u00e9pond \u00e0 la question susmentionn\u00e9e par l'affirmative, il revient alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable qui d\u00e9montre que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite discriminatoire ne s'est pas produite ou que la conduite \u00e9tait d'une quelconque fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Si une explication raisonnable est fournie par l'intim\u00e9e, il revient alors \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9montrer que l'explication ne constitue qu'un pr\u00e9texte et que le comportement de l'employeur \u00e9tait effectivement empreint de discrimination (Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, paragraphe 38474 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[23] La conduite peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant non discriminatoire si, en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi, il est \u00e9tabli qu'elle constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). Le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que pour que la conduite soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne constitueraient une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nV. QUELLES SONT LES ALL\u00c9GATIONS RELATIVES \u00c0 LA PREUVE PRIMA FACIE? [24] Les all\u00e9gations de Mme Lipp ont trait \u00e0 deux p\u00e9riodes de temps distinctes. Le premier ensemble d'all\u00e9gations a trait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps comprise entre juin 2000, lorsqu'elle a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, et octobre 2001, lorsque son cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 a pris fin. Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que la conduite suivante de la part de Postes Canada durant la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de temps constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience :\nDurant les r\u00e9unions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9daient les quarts de travail, Postes Canada lui posait toujours des questions quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches; Postes Canada exigeait qu'elle fournisse des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux concernant sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein comme commis des postes et elle exigeait notamment qu'elle aille subir un EMI \u00e0 Regina; Postes Canada lui envoyait souvent des lettres n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions et \u00e0 propos de la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux concernant sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[25] Le deuxi\u00e8me ensemble d'all\u00e9gations a trait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps comprise entre octobre 2001, lorsque Mme Lipp a inform\u00e9 Postes Canada qu'elle voulait retourner au travail, et d\u00e9cembre 2001, lorsqu'on a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp une suspension disciplinaire sans solde pour avoir refus\u00e9 d'aller subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp pr\u00e9tend que la conduite suivante de la part de Postes Canada durant la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode de temps constitue une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience et (ou) sa d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue et (ou) son sexe :\nPostes Canada a refus\u00e9 de lui permettre de retourner au travail \u00e0 l'automne de 2001 tant qu'elle n'irait pas subir deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg; Postes Canada lui a impos\u00e9 une suspension disciplinaire sans solde.\nVI. LA PREMI\u00c8RE P\u00c9RIODE DE TEMPS : JUIN 2000 - OCTOBRE 2001. A. L'ALL\u00c9GATION NO 1 : Les questions r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Lipp durant les r\u00e9unions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9daient les quarts de travail quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. [26] Lors de l'audience, Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, durant les r\u00e9unions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9daient les quarts de travail, on lui posait toujours des questions quant \u00e0 savoir si ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales l'emp\u00eachaient d'ex\u00e9cuter certaines t\u00e2ches r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Les r\u00e9unions qui ont lieu avant les quarts de travail durent environ de 10 \u00e0 15 minutes et sont anim\u00e9es par le chef de quart avant le d\u00e9but de chaque quart de travail. La preuve non contredite a \u00e9tabli que l'objet de ces r\u00e9unions est l'attribution de t\u00e2ches individuelles aux employ\u00e9s du quart de travail et la discussion de questions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales se rapportant au centre de traitement.\n[27] Dans son argumentation finale, l'avocate de Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que les questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re lors des r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant les quarts de travail constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. L'avocate de Mme Lipp a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que le processus par lequel les t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9es durant les r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant les quarts de travail \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce que les calendriers de travail \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par ordinateur et ne tenaient pas compte des limites fonctionnelles des employ\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, de par sa nature m\u00eame, le processus d'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier de travail des employ\u00e9s n\u00e9cessitait que l'on pose des questions aux employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 propos de leurs capacit\u00e9s et cela a entra\u00een\u00e9 une discrimination syst\u00e9mique contre les employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[28] Postes Canada a soulev\u00e9 des objections quant au fait que les questions susmentionn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois lors de l'audience. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devrait refuser de les traiter, compte tenu que leur divulgation tardive l'a priv\u00e9e d'une possibilit\u00e9 suffisante de r\u00e9pondre aux questions soulev\u00e9es. L'avocat de Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 que s'il avait su que la question de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration par ordinateur des calendriers de travail \u00e9tait en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce, il aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de traiter pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de ce point. Si le Tribunal consentait \u00e0 examiner cette all\u00e9gation dans le cadre de la plainte, le fait que Postes Canada ait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve quant \u00e0 cette question en raison de sa divulgation tardive lui causerait un pr\u00e9judice important.\n[29] Je souscris \u00e0 la position de l'intim\u00e9e sur cette question. Comme le Tribunal l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Uzoaba c. Service correctionnel du Canada (1994), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/361, lorsque l'on se penche sur la question de savoir si l'on doit examiner des all\u00e9gations qui ne font pas partie de la plainte initiale, la principale question \u00e0 trancher est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si l'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u un avis suffisant des all\u00e9gations qu'il devra r\u00e9futer, compte tenu des r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure. Des d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes rendues par le Tribunal ont confirm\u00e9 ce point (voir, par exemple, Parent c. Canada (Forces canadiennes 2005 TCDP 37).\n[30] L'avocate de Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me de l'interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 avant le quart de travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans le formulaire de plainte. Dans ce formulaire, Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, en juillet 1996, son m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait incapable de fixer une date \u00e0 laquelle elle serait compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9tablie et serait capable de retourner \u00e0 ses t\u00e2ches habituelles. Elle a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Par la suite, la SCP me demandait \u00e0 tous les mois, devant mes coll\u00e8gues, si j'avais toujours besoin de mesures d'accommodement et me demandait de demander \u00e0 mon m\u00e9decin de remplir et de soumettre les formulaires et les questionnaires de l'\u00e9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail.\n[31] Selon moi, l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e figurant dans le formulaire de plainte n'est pas assez pr\u00e9cise pour constituer un avis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e que la question de l'interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 durant les r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le quart de travail et la question de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration par ordinateur des calendriers de travail seraient soulev\u00e9es lors de l'audience. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s durant l'audience indiquaient que les r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le quart de travail avaient lieu \u00e0 tous les jours. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, trois \u00e0 quatre fois par semaine, lors des r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le quart de travail, on lui posait des questions sur sa capacit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter certaines t\u00e2ches. Par cons\u00e9quent, il me semble que la d\u00e9claration faite dans le formulaire de plainte ne renvoyait pas aux all\u00e9gations relatives aux questions pos\u00e9es avant le quart de travail ou aux calendriers de travail g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par ordinateur.\n[32] De plus, je n'ai pu trouver dans les documents pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l'audience aucun autre renvoi aux questions pos\u00e9es avant le quart de travail ou au calendrier de travail. En pr\u00e9paration pour l'audience, la plaignante a fourni un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions superficiel. L'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions additionnelles. Elles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies.\n[33] Le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'obtenir l'autorisation du Tribunal, les parties ne peuvent pas soulever au cours de l'audience des questions ou pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s avant l'audience. Lors de l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune objection quant \u00e0 l'admission de la preuve sur cette question. Toutefois, lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante a formul\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans ses conclusions finales que le processus de l'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier de travail et l'interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 avant le quart de travail \u00e9taient discriminatoires, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 des objections. Je crois qu'il est juste d'affirmer que ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas avant les conclusions finales que l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a su quelle utilisation on ferait de la preuve sur ces points.\n[34] L'intim\u00e9e a subi un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9faut de la part de la plaignante de soulever, avant l'audience, la question de l'interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 avant le quart de travail et la question de l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le processus d'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier de travail. Comme l'avocate l'a elle-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9, Postes Canada n'a fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant au processus d'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier de travail et, en particulier, elle n'a fourni aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant aux contraintes excessives qui seraient occasionn\u00e9es par une modification du programme d'ordinateur qui permettrait de rendre l'interrogatoire inutile. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas re\u00e7u un avis suffisant qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de produire un tel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, je consid\u00e9rerai que les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l'interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 avant le quart de travail et \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le processus d'\u00e9tablissement du calendrier ne font pas partie de la plainte.\nB. L'ALL\u00c9GATION NO 2 - L'exigence que Mme Lipp produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux concernant sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 temps plein comme commis des postes constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. [36] Mme Lipp a reconnu que lorsqu'elle a postul\u00e9 pour un poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes en juin 2000, Postes Canada avait le droit de lui demander des assurances de la part de son m\u00e9decin selon lesquelles elle \u00e9tait capable d'accomplir en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches d'un poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes. Toutefois, le 29 juin 2000, lorsque le m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit un billet mentionnant que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 effectuer des t\u00e2ches l\u00e9g\u00e8res pendant un quart de travail de huit heures, l'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires aurait d\u00fb, selon Mme Lipp, prendre fin.\n[37] Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada disposait suffisamment de renseignements confirmant la validit\u00e9 des renseignements fournis dans le billet du m\u00e9decin. En particulier, Postes Canada a affect\u00e9 Mme Lipp au poste \u00e0 temps plein. Celle-ci a occup\u00e9 ce poste pendant six mois. Ce geste, selon elle, d\u00e9montre qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 temps plein selon un r\u00e9gime de t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'insistance que Mme Lipp produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires et aille subir un EMI \u00e0 Regina \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable et imposait \u00e0 Mme Lipp un fardeau que n'avait pas \u00e0 supporter les autres employ\u00e9s qui occupaient des postes \u00e0 temps plein.\n(1) Existe-t-il une preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e9tayant l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e ? [38] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'un poste de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein est apparu sur le troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, elle a pos\u00e9 sa candidature quant \u00e0 celui-ci. Selon la convention collective, en tant que commis des postes \u00e0 temps partiel de rang le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, elle avait droit au poste. Toutefois, Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste, le directeur du troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, M. David Slater lui a dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas obtenir ce poste parce que Postes Canada avait besoin d'une personne qui \u00e9tait capable d'ex\u00e9cuter l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches du quart de travail \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater lui a dit de se procurer un billet du m\u00e9decin mentionnant qu'elle \u00e9tait capable d'accomplir le quart de travail de huit heures.\n[39] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que c'est ce qu'elle a fait. Elle a produit un billet \u00e9manant de son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Chooi, mentionnant que, \u00e0 compter du 29 juin, elle pouvait passer du [traduction] travail \u00e0 temps partiel au travail \u00e0 temps complet (8 heures par jour) \u00e0 t\u00e2ches r\u00e9duites.\n[40] Un mois apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut produit le billet du m\u00e9decin, Medisys a inform\u00e9 Mme Lipp qu'elle avait besoin de plus de renseignements que ceux qui figuraient dans le billet. Medisys a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp de remettre \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin un ensemble de questions formul\u00e9es par une m\u00e9decin de Medisys, la Dr Lori Koz. Cet ensemble de questions s'appelle une Saisie de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux (SRM). Mme Lipp devait remettre la SRM \u00e0 Medisys au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2000.\n[41] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne comprenait pas pourquoi elle devait produire des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 propos de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, avant de poser sa candidature pour le poste \u00e0 temps plein, elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs occasions pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures, et ce, malgr\u00e9 la limite de six heures de travail qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. C'\u00e9tait parce que Postes Canada lui avait offert des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou parce qu'elle lui avait fix\u00e9 des quarts de travail de huit heures.\n[42] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Slater une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2000 dans laquelle elle lui demandait pourquoi elle devait faire remplir une SRM. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Slater si Postes Canada avait tenu compte du fait qu'en ayant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement travaill\u00e9 pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures alors qu'elle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e travailler \u00e0 temps partiel, elle avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures.\n[43] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses questions. Toutefois, elle a fait remplir le SRM par son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Chooi.\n[44] Dans sa lettre de pr\u00e9sentation au Dr Chooi, la Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y aurait un certain nombre de t\u00e2ches comprises dans le poste de commis des postes que Mme Lipp ne pourrait pas accomplir si elle \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer des t\u00e2ches l\u00e9g\u00e8res. La Dr Koz a mentionn\u00e9 que Postes Canada d\u00e9sirait obtenir des \u00e9claircissements quant \u00e0 savoir quels facteurs avaient chang\u00e9 de telle sorte que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait maintenant capable d'augmenter son nombre d'heures de travail, mais n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'accomplir des t\u00e2ches plus lourdes, notamment la t\u00e2che qui consiste \u00e0 trier le courrier surdimensionn\u00e9. La Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre que Postes Canada d\u00e9sirait \u00e9tablir si Mme Lipp \u00e9tait capable de participer \u00e0 un plan de retour graduel au travail et d'accomplir toutes les t\u00e2ches d'un commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein.\n[45] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse aux questions pos\u00e9es par la Dr Koz dans la SRM, le Dr Chooi a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Lipp avait besoin de travailler \u00e0 temps plein afin de gagner assez d'argent pour lui permettre de ma\u00eetriser sa situation financi\u00e8re. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Lipp ne pouvait pas trier le courrier surdimensionn\u00e9 et qu'elle avait atteint son am\u00e9lioration m\u00e9dicale maximum. Le Dr Chooi a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu'il estimait que Mme Lipp subirait un dommage physique si elle effectuait un retour graduel au travail.\n[46] Les renseignements de la SRM ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 Medisys. Medisys a examin\u00e9 les renseignements de la SRM et les a \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du dossier m\u00e9dical de Mme Lipp. Medisys a ensuite fourni ce que l'on appelle un Rapport d'enqu\u00eate \u00e0 Postes Canada. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits ont \u00e9tabli que les Rapports d'enqu\u00eate visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e de l'employ\u00e9 en ne fournissant \u00e0 Postes Canada que les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour que celle-ci puisse fournir les accommodements appropri\u00e9s en milieu de travail ou r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dical qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s par l'employ\u00e9.\n[47] Dans un Rapport d'enqu\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 20 septembre 2000, la Dr Lori Koz, de Medisys, a mentionn\u00e9 que les renseignements fournis par le Dr Chooi concordaient avec les renseignements ant\u00e9rieurs figurant au dossier. La Dr Koz a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu que Mme Lipp souffrait de cet \u00e9tat depuis un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es, la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il y ait un changement important dans ses restrictions \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait mince. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il serait donc peut-\u00eatre bon que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI.\n[48] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 1er octobre 2000, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e au poste \u00e0 temps plein au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que personne, \u00e0 Postes Canada ou \u00e0 Medisys, n'avait mentionn\u00e9 que son affectation \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein d\u00e9pendait de la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[49] N\u00e9anmoins, le 18 octobre 2000, Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'elle devait aller subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant (EMI), \u00e0 Winnipeg, le 30 octobre 2000.\n[50] M. Keith Jeworski, pr\u00e9sident de la section locale de Regina du Syndicat des travailleurs et des travailleuses des postes, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'alin\u00e9a 33.10c) de la convention collective pr\u00e9voyait que Postes Canada pouvait exiger qu'un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant soit effectu\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin choisi par elle. Toutefois, M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, les demandes d'EMI \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s rares \u00e0 Regina. Avant le cas de Mme Lipp, Postes Canada, \u00e0 sa connaissance, n'avait jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune demande d'EMI.\n[51] Mme Lipp a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada de r\u00e9examiner la d\u00e9cision de l'envoyer subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Elle \u00e9tait malade en avion et il lui \u00e9tait p\u00e9nible de voyager sur les autoroutes parce que son premier mari s'\u00e9tait tu\u00e9 dans un accident sur l'Autoroute 1.\n[52] Postes Canada a accueilli la demande de Mme Lipp de ne pas se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg et a accept\u00e9 de fixer la tenue de l'EMI \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Regina. Dans la lettre informant Mme Lipp que le rendez-vous serait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre date, M. Dale Hippe, la directrice du Service du courrier, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la capacit\u00e9 de Postes Canada \u00e0 accommoder Mme Lipp dans un poste permanent \u00e0 t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es et particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'accommoder en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 son [traduction] passage imminent au statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein d\u00e9pendait de la compr\u00e9hension de ses limitations physiques ainsi que de l'incidence de ces limitations sur les activit\u00e9s de Postes Canada ainsi que sur les coll\u00e8gues de travail de Mme Lipp.\n[53] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a occup\u00e9 le poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es jusqu'au 2 avril 2001. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a eu aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es de son poste. Elle n'a pris aucun cong\u00e9 de maladie ou quelque autre cong\u00e9 que ce soit en raison de probl\u00e8mes occasionn\u00e9s par le fait qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 temps plein.\n[54] Le ou vers le 22 mars 2001, Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'elle devait aller subir un EMI \u00e0 Regina le 2 avril 2001, lequel EMI serait effectu\u00e9 par le Dr Milo Fink. Toutefois, Mme Lipp et M. Jeworski ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que, en raison d'une confusion quant \u00e0 une proposition de modification de la date fix\u00e9e pour le rendez-vous, Mme Lipp n'est pas all\u00e9e subir l'EMI. Mme Lipp est par la suite partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle a subi, le 30 juillet 2001, un EMI qu'elle avait report\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir manqu\u00e9 celui d'avril. Toutefois, lorsqu'elle s'est rendue au rendez-vous, elle a appris que celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 \u00e0 son insu.\n[55] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait subi un grand stress \u00e9motionnel \u00e0 la suite des demandes voulant qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et des demandes voulant qu'elle se rende \u00e0 des rendez-vous. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il lui \u00e9tait difficile d'organiser les rendez-vous et de pr\u00e9voir le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour s'y rendre. Elle \u00e9prouvait du stress \u00e0 chaque fois qu'elle recevait une lettre exigeant qu'elle fournisse davantage de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Elle comprenait qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle fournisse des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 propos de son incapacit\u00e9 mais elle estimait que Postes Canada lui demandait des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires.\n(2) Les conclusions du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de l'all\u00e9gation no 2 [56] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que Mme Lipp a \u00e9tabli prima facie que l'insistance de la part de Postes Canada qu'elle aille subir un EMI \u00e0 Regina constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur son incapacit\u00e9.\n[57] Bien que le t\u00e9moignage rendu par Mme Lipp tout au long de l'audience n'a pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait cr\u00e9dible, j'estime que les renseignements qu'elle a fournis \u00e0 propos des all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles. Par exemple, son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle avait travaill\u00e9 pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises avant de poser sa candidature pour le poste \u00e0 temps plein a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement par un t\u00e9moignage fourni par M. Slater dans lequel celui-ci a mentionn\u00e9 que, entre mars et juin 2000, Mme Lipp avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 22 reprises au quart de travail de huit heures. Son t\u00e9moignage concernant les all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 logique, direct et ne comprenait aucun embellissement.\n[58] Mme Lipp a produit des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux faisant \u00e9tat qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, mais qu'elle ne pouvait pas accomplir des t\u00e2ches plus exigeantes que les t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es qu'elle ex\u00e9cutait. Postes Canada a alors permis \u00e0 Mme Lipp d'occuper, avec t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es, le poste \u00e0 temps plein. Mme Lipp a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein pendant 6 mois jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle parte en cong\u00e9. Rien n'indiquait que Mme Lipp \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es d'un poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes.\n[59] Malgr\u00e9 le fait que Mme Lipp accomplissait \u00e0 temps plein des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es, Postes Canada a continu\u00e9 d'exiger qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires pour \u00e9tablir qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de faire le travail. Mme Lipp a souffert d'un stress \u00e9motif important lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u les demandes voulant qu'elle produise des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires et les demandes voulant qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 un rendez-vous car celles-ci \u00e9taient formul\u00e9es d'une mani\u00e8re qui laissait planer un doute quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de son emploi. De plus, il \u00e9tait difficile pour Mme Lipp de produire les renseignements et de se rendre aux rendez-vous.\n[60] J'estime que Mme Lipp a \u00e9tabli prima facie que les demande r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de Postes Canada qu'elle \u00e9tablisse sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. Mme Lipp \u00e9tait trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des employ\u00e9s n'ayant aucune d\u00e9ficience en ce sens que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de son emploi \u00e0 temps plein \u00e9tait conditionnelle \u00e0 la satisfaction, d'une mani\u00e8re jug\u00e9e acceptable par Postes Canada, aux demandes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux satisfaisants \u00e0 propos de son incapacit\u00e9. Compte tenu que les demandes d\u00e9coulaient de la pr\u00e9occupation exprim\u00e9e par Postes Canada que l'incapacit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp pourrait emp\u00eacher celle-ci d'ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches d'un poste de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein, j'estime que la diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de la part de Postes Canada \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Lipp \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que celle-ci avait une d\u00e9ficience.\n(3) Postes Canada a-t-elle une explication raisonnable \u00e0 fournir quant \u00e0 sa pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire? [61] D\u00e8s que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable qui d\u00e9montre que la conduite discriminatoire ne s'est pas produite tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que la conduite \u00e9tait, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, non discriminatoire. La conduite discriminatoire peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e non discriminatoire si, en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi, il est \u00e9tabli qu'elle constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ).\n[62] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'exigence voulant que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Afin d'\u00e9tablir cette affirmation, Postes Canada doit d\u00e9montrer que la prise de mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 l'emploi \u00e0 temps plein de Mme Lipp, en l'absence des renseignements fournis par l'EMI, lui imposerait une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[63] En d\u00e9cidant si l'existence d'une EPJ a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il est utile de se rappeler les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin) et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer)).\n(4) La preuve \u00e9taye-t-elle l'all\u00e9gation que l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e?\n[64] M. Slater et M. Hippe ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 propos des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'exiger que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI. M. Slater a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re directe et a franchement reconnu qu'il ne se souvenait pas tr\u00e8s bien des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Il a prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises les mots [traduction] nous aurions ou j'aurais avant de fournir son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 propos de ce qui, selon lui, s'\u00e9tait produit. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai accord\u00e9 moins d'importance \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage quant \u00e0 certaines questions parce qu'il ne se souvenait pas tr\u00e8s bien des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et qu'il semblait que, parfois, il tentait, \u00e0 partir de son examen des documents durant l'audience, de reconstituer ce qu'il avait fait. Toutefois, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le fait que M. Slater a franchement admis \u00e0 certains moments qu'il existait certains probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont Postes Canada avait men\u00e9 les choses. De plus, il n'a pas sembl\u00e9 exag\u00e9rer ou embellir les renseignements qu'il a fournis. N'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 du fait que sa m\u00e9moire des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tait faible, j'aurais accord\u00e9 beaucoup d'importance \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage.\n[65] La m\u00e9moire des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de M. Hippe \u00e9tait un peu meilleure que celle de M. Slater m\u00eame si celui-ci avait moins particip\u00e9 aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Lui aussi a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re directe et franche. Son t\u00e9moignage quant aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette \u00e9poque a \u00e9t\u00e9 coh\u00e9rent en lui-m\u00eame et a bien r\u00e9sist\u00e9 au contre-interrogatoire.\n[66] J'estime que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et pour les motifs qui suivent, l'exigence que Mme Lipp produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels par le biais d'un EMI et qu'elle subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\na) L'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux par le biais d'une saisie de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux (SRM) et d'un EMI est rationnellement li\u00e9e aux fonctions du poste.\n[67] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir pour \u00e9valuer si l'employeur a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une d\u00e9fense d'EPJ consiste \u00e0 identifier l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme contest\u00e9e et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si celui-ci est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 57). \u00c0 ce stade-ci, l'accent doit \u00eatre mis non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en litige, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[68] Selon les t\u00e9moignages de M. Hippe et de M. Slater, Postes Canada a exig\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux objectifs \u00e0 propos des restrictions d'ordre m\u00e9dical pour les raisons suivantes : (1) afin qu'elle puisse voir \u00e0 ce que les employ\u00e9s soient capables d'accomplir de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire les t\u00e2ches de leur poste; (2) afin qu'elle puisse accommoder comme il se doit les employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience; (3) afin qu'elle puisse maximiser le nombre et la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches que peuvent accomplir les employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience dans les limites de leurs restrictions.\n[69] M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada exige la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux objectifs concis de la part des employ\u00e9s qui ont une d\u00e9ficience ou qui souffrent de blessures afin de lui permettre de voir \u00e0 ce qu'ils travaillent de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et productive dans les limites de leurs restrictions.\n[70] En ce qui a trait au troisi\u00e8me objet, M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada exige que les employ\u00e9s fournissent des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour \u00e0 toutes les fois qu'ils occupent un nouveau poste ou qu'il y a un changement dans leurs restrictions de telle sorte qu'elle puisse \u00e9tablir quelle est la meilleure fa\u00e7on de maximiser le travail potentiel que les employ\u00e9s peuvent accomplir dans les limites de leurs restrictions. Les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux concernant les restrictions d'un employ\u00e9 permettent \u00e0 Postes Canada d'\u00e9tablir comment elle peut atteindre l'objectif d'efficacit\u00e9 et de productivit\u00e9 en milieu de travail sans compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre de l'employ\u00e9 ou des autres employ\u00e9s.\n[71] Compte tenu de la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e, je suis convaincu que l'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux est rationnellement li\u00e9e aux objectifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, d'accommodement et de productivit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. De plus, je suis convaincu que les trois objectifs sont valides. Postes Canada est tenue de voir \u00e0 ce que l'objectif de productivit\u00e9 et d'efficacit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s soient atteint sans compromettre son obligation d'accommodement des employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience et sans compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la sant\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. Pour ce faire, Postes Canada exige la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour sur les restrictions des employ\u00e9s lorsqu'il y a des changements quant aux restrictions ou quant aux t\u00e2ches.\nb) Postes Canada a exig\u00e9 la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires, notamment par le biais de l'EMI, en croyant sinc\u00e8rement que cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin d'atteindre les objectifs susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[72] Une fois \u00e9tablie la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral vis\u00e9 par l'employeur, ce dernier doit franchir la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son objet, et sans qu'il ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 60). \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape de l'analyse de l'EPJ, l'accent doit \u00eatre mis sur la preuve relative \u00e0 la subjectivit\u00e9 des points de vue de l'intim\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la norme particuli\u00e8re, laquelle est en l'esp\u00e8ce l'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[73] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que Postes Canada a formul\u00e9 l'exigence que Mme Lipp produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires et subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina en croyant sinc\u00e8rement que cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[74] M. Slater et M. Hippe ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que, ni le billet \u00e9manant du m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp, ni le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate \u00e9manant du Dr Koz, ne leur a procur\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux clairs, objectifs dont ils avaient besoin afin de voir \u00e0 ce que Mme Lipp fasse l'objet de mesures d'accommodement s\u00e9curitaires dans le cadre du poste \u00e0 temps plein.\n[75] Le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate \u00e9manant du Dr Koz , de Medisys, dat\u00e9 du 20 septembre 2000, faisait \u00e9tat qu'un nombre important des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dical de Mme Lipp \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des renseignements subjectifs que celle-ci a fournis \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin. La Dr Koz s'est demand\u00e9e s'il \u00e9tait possible qu'il y ait un changement important dans l'\u00e9tat de Mme Lipp, compte tenu que celle-ci travaillait en fonction de restrictions m\u00e9dicales depuis un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es. La Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il serait peut-\u00eatre utile qu'un EMI soit effectu\u00e9 avant que l'on analyse de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive de quelle mani\u00e8re on pourrait accommoder Mme Lipp chez Postes Canada.\n[76] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate de Medisys aurait fait l'objet d'une discussion lors d'une r\u00e9union hebdomadaire de gestion des cas avec les directeurs. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, suite au Rapport d'enqu\u00eate, il doutait que, m\u00eame avec les r\u00e9sultats de l'ARM, Postes Canada disposait des renseignements suffisants pour pouvoir accommoder Mme Lipp quant au poste \u00e0 temps plein.\n[77] M. Slater a franchement reconnu qu'il \u00e9tait inhabituel d'exiger qu'un employ\u00e9 produise d'autres renseignements m\u00e9dicaux une fois qu'il occupe un poste. Toutefois, selon M. Slater, Postes Canada a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme de Mme Lipp \u00e0 travailler au-del\u00e0 de la limite de 6 heures qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. C'est pourquoi Postes Canada lui a demand\u00e9 de subir un EMI, m\u00eame si elle occupait le poste \u00e0 temps plein depuis six mois.\n[78] J'estime que Postes Canada a exig\u00e9 la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires, notamment par le biais de l'EMI en croyant sinc\u00e8rement que cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin d'atteindre l'objectif consistant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Lipp de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire afin qu'elle puisse faire un travail productif.\nc) L'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[79] La derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape qu'il faut franchir pour d\u00e9cider si l'exigence de production de renseignements additionnels constitue une EPJ exige que Postes Canada d\u00e9montre que cette mesure \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre les objectifs mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape no 1. Pour ce faire, Postes Canada doit \u00e9tablir qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'accommoder Mme Lipp sans subir une contrainte excessive.\n[80] Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que Postes Canada d\u00e9tenait tous les renseignements dont elle avait besoin pour \u00e9tablir qu'elle pouvait travailler \u00e0 temps plein, en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Elle a donc pr\u00e9tendu que la prise de mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard quant au poste, en l'absence des renseignements fournis par le biais de l'ARM et de l'EMI, n'aurait impos\u00e9 aucune contrainte excessive \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[81] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle \u00e9tait tenue de voir \u00e0 ce que la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp ne soit pas compromise par le fait de travailler plus que ce qui lui est permis. Elle a de plus pr\u00e9tendu que les risques pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s en permettant \u00e0 Mme Lipp de conserver son poste \u00e0 temps plein en l'absence des renseignements fournis par le biais de l'ARM et de l'EMI pourraient imposer une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Postes Canada. Je souscris \u00e0 cet argument, et ce, pour les raisons qui suivent.\n[82] L'article 124 du Code canadien du travail pr\u00e9voit que l'employeur doit veiller \u00e0 la protection de ses employ\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail (L.R.C. 1985, ch. L-2, article 124). La jurisprudence mentionne de plus que lorsqu'il affecte un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre poste, un employeur a non seulement le droit, mais il a \u00e9galement l'obligation d'obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux raisonnablement complets \u00e0 propos de l'\u00e9tat de l'employ\u00e9 afin de voir \u00e0 ce que celui-ci puisse ex\u00e9cuter en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches de son poste (Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) et C.U.P.E., Loc. 43, Re (1991), 22 L.A.C. (4e) 216; Belliveau c. Steel Co. of Canada [1988] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 11 (Q.L.), paragraphe 51; Mazuelos c. Clark 2000 BCHRT 1, paragraphe 46).\n[83] Lorsque l'employ\u00e9 demande une modification de sa t\u00e2che, il a l'obligation correspondante de collaborer en fournissant les renseignements exig\u00e9s (La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Le Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (Grief Reniak) (1998), 73 L.A.C. (4e) 15). Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux fournis par l'employ\u00e9 sont inad\u00e9quats aux fins de la protection de sa sant\u00e9 et de sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9, un employeur a le droit de faire d'autres enqu\u00eates.\n[84] La preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce indique que le travail effectu\u00e9 par les commis des postes peut \u00eatre r\u00e9p\u00e9titif et exigeant sur le plan physique. M. Hippe a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'on est plus exigeant envers les commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein; ceux-ci travaillent de plus longues heures que les commis \u00e0 temps partiel et on s'attend \u00e0 ce qu'ils accomplissent un plus grand \u00e9ventail de t\u00e2ches. M. Slater a expliqu\u00e9 que Postes Canada a permut\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s dans le plus grand nombre possible d'emplois diff\u00e9rents dans le traitement du courrier afin de voir \u00e0 ce que tous les employ\u00e9s effectuent un bon \u00e9ventail de t\u00e2ches, et ce, afin d'\u00e9viter les probl\u00e8mes de microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s constituaient un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[85] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ses blessures \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes de coiffe des rotateurs, de fibromyalgie et de d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence de la colonne cervicale. M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, compte tenu des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de Mme Lipp, on craignait que si elle travaillait plus de six heures pendant une longue p\u00e9riode de temps, cela r\u00e9duirait \u00e0 n\u00e9ant la limite de 6 heures et exposerait Mme Lipp \u00e0 des risques. Le fait que Mme Lipp ait occup\u00e9 le poste \u00e0 temps plein pendant 6 mois n'a pas eu pour effet de dissiper les pr\u00e9occupations de M. Slater quant \u00e0 l'incidence \u00e0 long terme du travail \u00e0 temps plein sur Mme Lipp. Si jamais Mme Lipp se blessait au travail parce qu'elle a travaill\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 de ses capacit\u00e9s physiques, Postes Canada serait tenue responsable des cons\u00e9quences.\n[86] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'elle travaillait \u00e0 temps plein, elle devenait fatigu\u00e9e et \u00e9puis\u00e9e. Bien qu'elle ait affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a pris aucun cong\u00e9 de maladie, ni aucun cong\u00e9 sans solde au cours de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein, M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada redoutait que cela se produise. Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada avait besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 propos des restrictions de Mme Lipp, de telle sorte que les probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 long terme de cette derni\u00e8re pourraient \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9s.\n[87] Le billet du m\u00e9decin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au d\u00e9part \u00e0 Postes Canada faisait tout simplement \u00e9tat que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait capable de travailler \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches l\u00e9g\u00e8res pendant des quarts de travail complets (8 heures). M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le billet ne comprenait aucune explication quant aux facteurs qui avaient pu changer de telle sorte que Mme Lipp puisse travailler \u00e0 temps plein sans courir aucun risque. Postes Canada avait des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la signification de l'expression t\u00e2ches l\u00e9g\u00e8res et quant \u00e0 savoir si on pouvait demander \u00e0 Mme Lipp de travailler plus de 8 heures par jour comme on le demandait parfois aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein. Compte tenu de ces pr\u00e9occupations, Postes Canada a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp de demander \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin de remplir un questionnaire d'ARM.\n[88] Les r\u00e9ponses du m\u00e9decin aux questions figurant dans l'ARM n'\u00e9taient pas particuli\u00e8rement utiles. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 quels facteurs avaient chang\u00e9 pour que l'on puisse permettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp d'augmenter son nombre d'heures de travail \u00e0 huit heures, le Dr Chooi a r\u00e9pondu que Mme Lipp avait besoin de travailler \u00e0 temps plein afin d'obtenir une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui lui permettrait de ma\u00eetriser sa situation financi\u00e8re. Elle \u00e9tait devenue veuve et avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre soin d'elle-m\u00eame. La d\u00e9claration du m\u00e9decin selon laquelle Mme Lipp avait besoin de travailler \u00e0 temps plein ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 la question de savoir quels changements s'\u00e9taient produits dans son \u00e9tat physique entre mars 2000 et octobre 2000, de telle sorte qu'on puisse lui permettre de travailler plus d'heures que la limite de 6 heures fix\u00e9e en mars 2000.\n[89] Sur la foi des r\u00e9ponses du Dr Chooi, Medisys a remis \u00e0 Postes Canada, en septembre 2000, un Rapport d'enqu\u00eate qui donnait \u00e0 penser que la tenue d'un EMI pourrait permettre d'obtenir les renseignements objectifs dont Postes Canada avait besoin pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question susmentionn\u00e9e ainsi qu'aux autres questions concernant les restrictions de Mme Lipp.\n[90] Compte tenu de la nature du travail qui est effectu\u00e9 par les commis des postes, de la nature des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dical de Mme Lipp ainsi que des restrictions r\u00e9cemment \u00e9tablies, je suis convaincu qu'il \u00e9tait l\u00e9gitime que Postes Canada soit pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l'accommodement \u00e0 long terme, en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de Mme Lipp dans le cadre du poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes. Les renseignements fournis dans le billet du m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp et dans l'ARM ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux pr\u00e9occupations de Postes Canada. Postes Canada \u00e9tait tenue de voir \u00e0 ce Mme Lipp ne soit pas plac\u00e9e dans une situation o\u00f9 elle pourrait se blesser.\n[91] Existaient-ils des moyens autres que l'EMI qui auraient pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s afin d'obtenir les renseignements dont Postes Canada avait besoin afin de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp. M. Hippe et M. Slater ont affirm\u00e9 dans leurs t\u00e9moignages que le processus visant \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux est le suivant : un billet du m\u00e9decin est fourni par l'employ\u00e9; si des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires sont exig\u00e9s concernant les restrictions de l'employ\u00e9, on demande \u00e0 celui-ci de demander \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin de remplir une \u00c9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail (EAPT); si ces renseignements sont incomplets ou insatisfaisants, on demande au m\u00eame m\u00e9decin de remplir une ARM, laquelle consiste en une s\u00e9rie de questions concernant les probl\u00e8mes d'ordre m\u00e9dical et les restrictions de l'employ\u00e9; si les renseignements figurant dans l'ARM ne fournissent pas les renseignements clairs et objectifs dont on a besoin pour accommoder l'employ\u00e9 comme il se doit, la tenue d'un EMI est exig\u00e9e. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 sa connaissance, d\u00e8s qu'un ARM et un EAPT ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis, l'EMI est le dernier moyen dont on dispose pour obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux objectifs lorsque les renseignements fournis par le m\u00e9decin de l'employ\u00e9 sont insuffisants.\n[92] J'accepte que, durant la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de temps, Postes Canada et Medisys ont d'abord examin\u00e9 et \u00e9puis\u00e9 tous les moyens possibles, autre que la tenue d'un EMI, afin d'obtenir les renseignements dont Postes Canada avait besoin pour remplir son obligation l\u00e9gale de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 de Mme Lipp. La tenue de l'EMI \u00e9tait donc le dernier moyen permettant d'obtenir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires.\n[93] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Postes Canada a \u00e9tabli que le renoncement \u00e0 l'exigence de la tenue d'un EMI lui aurait fait subir une contrainte excessive : Postes Canada aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e du dernier moyen dont elle disposait afin de s'assurer qu'elle remplissait son obligation de prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp.\n(5) La conclusion du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation no 2 [94] Compte tenu des conclusions susmentionn\u00e9es, je conclus que l'exigence que Mme Lipp produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels et subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nC. L'ALL\u00c9GATION NO 3 - Les communications r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et n\u00e9gatives entre Postes Canada et Mme Lipp concernant les restrictions de cette derni\u00e8re et la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient discriminatoires.\n[95] Mme Lipp pr\u00e9tend que, dans la salle de travail, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 de nombreuses questions, elle a fait l'objet de nombreux commentaires \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions et a elle fait l'objet d'une surveillance particuli\u00e8rement intense de son travail. Elle pr\u00e9tend de plus que les demandes de l'intim\u00e9e qu'elle produise des documents m\u00e9dicaux et qu'elle subisse un EMI \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s souvent accompagn\u00e9es de menaces de prise de mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 son \u00e9gard si elle ne produisait pas les renseignements exig\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9lai imparti. Cela, selon elle, constitue une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(1) Existe-t-il une preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 l'appui de l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e? a) Les questions pos\u00e9es et les commentaires faits dans la salle de travail en rapport avec la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp\n[96] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, vers l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste \u00e0 temps plein en juin 2000, son superviseur l'a approch\u00e9e dans l'atelier, il a crois\u00e9 ses bras et lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Qu'es-tu capable de faire au juste? Que peux-tu faire?. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que les travailleurs autour d'elle ont arr\u00eat\u00e9 de travailler et se sont mis \u00e0 la regarder. Elle s'est sentie humili\u00e9e et elle a eu honte.\n[97] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater l'abordait quotidiennement afin de discuter avec elle de ses restrictions d'ordre m\u00e9dical, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux ou de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle subisse un examen m\u00e9dical. Parfois, il lui demandait si elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e voir un m\u00e9decin. Selon elle, cela \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9.\n[98] Mme Lipp a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater allait parfois la voir lorsqu'elle travaillait seule et lui disait que si elle ne produisait pas les documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 temps, elle ferait l'objet d'une mesure disciplinaire. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater lui remettait des formulaires m\u00e9dicaux dans la salle de travail. Elle n'aimait pas cette fa\u00e7on de faire car elle attirait davantage l'attention sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[99] Mme Janice Karchewski, une d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale \u00e0 Postes Canada, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de Mme Lipp. Mme Karchewski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la question Qu'es-tu capable de faire? lui avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e dans la salle de travail alors que, elle aussi, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, comme d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale, elle savait que cette question \u00e9tait assez souvent pos\u00e9e aux personnes qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, elle, ainsi que d'autres personnes, trouvaient cela tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.\n[100] Mme Louise Shoeman a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de Mme Lipp. Mme Shoeman travaille pour Postes Canada depuis 27 ans. Elle est \u00e9galement commis des postes et elle a travaill\u00e9 au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail sur le m\u00eame \u00e9tage que Mme Lipp. Mme Shoeman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait observ\u00e9 les \u00e9changes qui avaient eu lieu entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater [traduction] r\u00e9primandait constamment Mme Lipp et lui posait constamment des questions \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions.\n[101] Mme Shoeman a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d'une confrontation entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater, laquelle confrontation a pris naissance lorsque M. Slater s'est mis \u00e0 surveiller Mme Lipp. Il a approch\u00e9 Mme Lipp et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui poser des questions \u00e0 propos de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter l'\u00e9ventail complet de ses t\u00e2ches. Mme Shoeman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsque M. Slater parlait avec Mme Lipp, il se penchait et pla\u00e7ait son visage tr\u00e8s proche du visage de cette derni\u00e8re. Il lui parlait sur un ton fort et sec. Mme Shoeman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il arrivait souvent que Mme Lipp pleure \u00e0 la fin des conversations qu'elle avait eues avec M. Slater.\n[102] M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il y avait eu de nombreux conflits entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater en rapport, dans une certaine mesure, avec l'utilisation par Mme Lipp de cong\u00e9s de maladie par le pass\u00e9. M. Jeworski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Lipp n'\u00e9tait pas la seule employ\u00e9e \u00e0 avoir eu des probl\u00e8mes avec le style de gestion de M. Slater.\n[103] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en janvier 2001, alors qu'elle travaillait \u00e0 temps plein au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, un poste \u00e0 temps plein s'est ouvert sur le quart de nuit (le premier quart de travail) dans la section Courrier d'acheminement. Elle a pos\u00e9 sa candidature et a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 ce poste qu'elle a occup\u00e9 jusqu'au 4 mars 2001, puis elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau affect\u00e9e au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail. Postes Canada a de nouveau affect\u00e9 Mme Lipp au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail parce que ses restrictions ne pouvaient faire l'objet d'aucun accommodement dans le premier quart de travail.\n[104] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'elle s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois, le 4 mars 2001, au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail auquel elle venait d'\u00eatre de nouveau affect\u00e9e, elle a d\u00e9couvert que ses coll\u00e8gues de travail avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s, avant son retour, qu'elle revenait au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait sentie humili\u00e9e et stigmatis\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nb) Surveillance \u00e9troite\n[105] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle \u00e9tait surveill\u00e9e plus \u00e9troitement que ne l'\u00e9taient les autres employ\u00e9s. Elle a d\u00e9crit un incident au cours duquel elle a vu M. Slater regarder sa montre alors qu'elle se rendait aux toilettes, puis la regarder alors qu'elle sortait des toilettes. Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon elle, M. Slater \u00e9tait toujours en train de la surveiller. D'autres personnes ont \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 cela et lui en ont fait la remarque. Mme Shoeman \u00e9tait l'une des personnes qui a vu M. Slater surveiller Mme Lipp. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[106] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a vu M. Slater se cacher derri\u00e8re des colonnes et la surveiller pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en train de travailler.\nc) Lettres \u00e9manant de Postes Canada\n[107] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle recevait tout le temps des lettres de la part de Postes Canada \u00e0 propos de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels et que, le plus souvent, ces lettres \u00e9taient accompagn\u00e9es de menaces de prise de mesures disciplinaires. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon elle, Postes Canada envoyait ces lettres parce que sa d\u00e9ficience lui occasionnait des ennuis et qu'elle cherchait une fa\u00e7on de se d\u00e9barrasser d'elle. Les lettres qui posaient cens\u00e9ment probl\u00e8me \u00e9taient les suivantes :\n(i) Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 14 ao\u00fbt 2000, \u00e9manant de M. Slater, faisant \u00e9tat que Mme Lipp n'avait pas retourn\u00e9 le questionnaire d'ARM.\n[108] Dans cette lettre, M. Slater mentionnait que le questionnaire d'ARM concernant la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 alors qu'il aurait d\u00fb l'\u00eatre au plus tard le 9 ao\u00fbt 2000. M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Il est important que vous r\u00e9alisiez que l'incertitude entourant votre \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 peut nuire \u00e0 notre capacit\u00e9 de vous accommoder pour votre promotion au sein de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Si votre d\u00e9cision est de ne pas remettre le questionnaire \u00e0 votre m\u00e9decin, votre statut actuel de personne ayant une d\u00e9ficience partielle permanente est tout ce dont nous disposons pour travailler.\n(ii) Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 17 novembre 2000, \u00e9manant de M. Dale Hippe, mentionnant que la tenue de l'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Regina\n[109] M. Hippe a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Lipp pour l'informer qu'elle ne serait pas oblig\u00e9e de subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Il a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la tenue d'un autre examen serait fix\u00e9e \u00e0 Regina en mars 2001. M. Hippe a ajout\u00e9 que la [traduction] promotion en suspens de Mme Lipp au statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein d\u00e9pendait de l'obtention de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions.\n(iii) Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 mars 2001, \u00e9manant de M. Slater, informant Mme Lipp qu'elle devait subir un EMI le 2 avril 2001\n[110] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, un certain jour en mars 2001, alors qu'elle se trouvait \u00e0 son poste de travail, son superviseur, Brian Kanciruk, s'est approch\u00e9 d'elle, a crois\u00e9 ses bras et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00c9claire-moi. Iras-tu \u00e0 ce rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin?. Mme Lipp n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de ce rendez-vous et elle a dit \u00e0 M. Kanciruk que lorsqu'elle recevrait les documents relatifs au rendez-vous, elle le pr\u00e9viendrait. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait embarrass\u00e9e parce que ses coll\u00e8gues de travail avaient entendu la conversation.\n[111] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le jour suivant, elle a re\u00e7u une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 mars 2001, de la part de M. Slater, mentionnant qu'elle devait subir un EMI le 2 avril et qu'il ressortait des remarques qu'elle avait faites \u00e0 M. Kanciruk qu'elle songeait \u00e0 ne pas se rendre au rendez-vous. Dans sa lettre, M. Slater mentionnait que si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas au rendez-vous le 2 avril 2001, \u00e0 15 h00, elle pourrait faire l'objet d'une mesure administrative qui pouvait aller jusqu'\u00e0 la modification de son statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein PO4 \u00e0 celui \u00e0 de PO4 \u00e0 temps partiel. Dans cette m\u00eame lettre, M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que d'autres mesures administratives touchant les mesures d'accommodement et l'emploi pouvaient \u00e9galement devoir \u00eatre prises jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la tenue d'un autre examen puisse \u00eatre fix\u00e9e. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp de dire imm\u00e9diatement si elle avait oui ou non l'intention de se pr\u00e9senter au rendez-vous.\n[112] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle fut tr\u00e8s irrit\u00e9e par cette tournure des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Elle n'avait pas dit \u00e0 M. Kanciruk qu'elle ne se rendrait pas subir l'EMI. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un exemple de la raison pour laquelle elle refusait de s'adresser directement \u00e0 la direction de Postes Canada; elle estimait que ses paroles \u00e9taient mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es contre elle. Elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 communiquer par l'interm\u00e9diaire du syndicat.\n(iv) Un avis de 24 heures, dat\u00e9 du 2 avril 2001, de la tenue d'une entrevue - Le rendez-vous d'EMI manqu\u00e9 du 2 avril 2001.\n[113] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a pas pu se rendre au rendez-vous d'EMI du 2 avril 2001. Elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9e quant au choix de la date et elle avait fait d'autres projets pour cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Elle a appel\u00e9 Keith Jeworski pour voir si celui-ci ne pourrait pas transf\u00e9rer son rendez-vous \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9 de Postes Canada qui, selon ce qu'elle savait, \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 subir un EMI avec le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin le 9 avril. Elle a par la suite re\u00e7u une note de service de la part de Darlene Black, une infirmi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'emploi de Medisys qui travaillait au Centre de traitement du courrier de Regina, confirmant que son rendez-vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 au 9 avril. La note de service \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 28 mars 2001 et \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Slater avec copie conforme \u00e0 Mme Lipp.\n[114] Mme Lipp s'est rendue comme pr\u00e9vu au travail dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du 2 avril 2001; ses projets personnels \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus pour le d\u00e9but de la journ\u00e9e. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que son superviseur, Kevin Zimmerman, l'avait imm\u00e9diatement approch\u00e9e, l'avait suivie dans la salle de travail et, d'une voix forte, lui avait demand\u00e9 ce qu'elle faisait au travail. Lorsqu'elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour travailler, M. Zimmerman lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n'\u00e9tait pas chez son m\u00e9decin. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un petit groupe de personnes s'\u00e9tait form\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 et \u00e9coutait leur conversation. M. Zimmerman a continu\u00e9 de lui poser des questions \u00e0 propos du rendez-vous. Elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s embarrass\u00e9e, elle s'est mise \u00e0 pleurer et elle a dit ce qui suit : [traduction] parle \u00e0 Keith, parle \u00e0 Keith (il s'agissait de Keith Jeworski, le pr\u00e9sident du syndicat). Mme Lipp est ensuite all\u00e9e voir sa d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale, Lindy Freegone, afin d'obtenir de l'aide.\n[115] Plus tard cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0, M. Slater a abord\u00e9 Mme Lipp dans la salle de travail et lui a remis un avis mentionnant qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une rencontre avec la direction afin de discuter de la raison pour laquelle elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'EMI le 2 avril 2001. On a menac\u00e9 de prendre une mesure disciplinaire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e0 la rencontre.\n[116] Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle fut tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e par cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement. Elle ne pouvait pas croire que Postes Canada \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re contre elle parce qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 un rendez-vous qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre date. Elle a quitt\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de son quart de travail, puis elle est tomb\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n(v) Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 3 avril 2001, \u00e9manant de M. Slater, mentionnant que tant que Mme Lipp n'aurait pas fourni de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 propos de son cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle serait en cong\u00e9 sans solde.\n[117] Dans cette lettre, M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une \u00c9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail (EAPT), d\u00fbment remplie, devait \u00eatre produite au plus tard le 5 avril 2001 afin de justifier le cong\u00e9 de maladie de Mme Lipp. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tant que ces documents n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us, Mme Lipp serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en cong\u00e9 sans solde. Une EAPT est un formulaire qui doit \u00eatre rempli par le m\u00e9decin de l'employ\u00e9. Il ne constitue pas un diagnostic m\u00e9dical; l'EAPT \u00e9num\u00e8re tout simplement les restrictions de l'employ\u00e9 et la dur\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue de ces restrictions.\n[118] Mme Lipp a produit l'EAPT d\u00fbment rempli le 5 avril 2001.\n(vi) Une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 juin 2001, de la part de M. Slater \u00e0 Mme Lipp, \u00e0 propos de son [traduction] r\u00e9cent refus de subir un EMI et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me rendez-vous d'EMI.\n[119] Le 7 juin 2001, M. Slater a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Lipp afin de [traduction] clarifier [la position de Postes Canada] concernant [son] r\u00e9cent refus de subir un EMI. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Postes Canada tentait pour la troisi\u00e8me fois de fixer un EMI et qu'elle serait oblig\u00e9e de se soumettre \u00e0 celui-l\u00e0. Sa pr\u00e9sence devait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e dans les 48 heures de la r\u00e9ception de la lettre. Le dernier paragraphe de la lettre \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nCette situation nous a plac\u00e9s dans une position administrative qui peut compromettre votre emploi au sein de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes. Veuillez r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente lettre le plus t\u00f4t possible afin d'att\u00e9nuer la possibilit\u00e9 que d'autres mesures administratives ou disciplinaires ne soient prises. Si vous avez d'autres questions, vous pouvez communiquer avec moi au 761-6304.\n[120] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette lettre l'avait compl\u00e8tement atterr\u00e9e. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas volontairement qu'elle avait manqu\u00e9 le rendez-vous du 2 avril 2001; elle \u00e9tait sous l'impression qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre date. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon elle, cette lettre signifiait que si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas au rendez-vous d'EMI le 30 juillet 2001, lequel rendez-vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9 de son propre chef, elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Toutefois, sans qu'elle ne le sache, le troisi\u00e8me rendez-vous d'EMI, pr\u00e9vu pour le 30 juillet 2001, a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 par Medisys en juin 2001.\n(vii) Une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 8 juin 2001, \u00e9manant de M. Dale Hippe, ainsi qu'une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 13 juin 2001, \u00e9manant de M. Slater, mentionnant que Mme Lipp devait produire une ARM.\n[121] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le ou vers le 13 juin 2001, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle a re\u00e7u un colis de Postes Canada qui contenait une enveloppe scell\u00e9e ainsi que trois lettres de pr\u00e9sentation. La premi\u00e8re lettre, dat\u00e9e du 8 juin 2001, \u00e9manait de Medisys et informait Mme Lipp qu'elle devait produire une ARM concernant son aptitude actuelle au travail et que celle-ci devait \u00eatre remplie par son m\u00e9decin au plus tard le 26 juin 2001. La deuxi\u00e8me lettre portait la m\u00eame date et \u00e9manait de M. Hippe. Lui \u00e9galement a inform\u00e9 Mme Lipp qu'elle devait produire l'ARM au plus tard le 26 juin. Il a affirm\u00e9 que si elle avait besoin d'aide en rapport avec cette demande, elle n'avait qu'\u00e0 communiquer directement avec l'infirmi\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 du travail.\n[122] La troisi\u00e8me lettre, dat\u00e9e du 13 juin 2001, \u00e9manait de M. Slater. Dans cette lettre, M. Slater d\u00e9clarait qu'elle devait apporter des \u00e9claircissements quant \u00e0 son absence actuelle. On lui demandait de faire remplir l'ARM au plus tard le 25 juin 2001, un jour plus t\u00f4t que ce qui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 par les auteurs des deux autres lettres. M. Slater a ajout\u00e9 que si Mme Lipp ne produisait pas les documents et ne donnait aucune explication acceptable, [traduction] des mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu'au renvoi de Postes Canada seraient prises contre elle.\n[123] Une copie de la lettre du 13 juin 2001, de la part de M. Slater \u00e0 Mme Lipp, a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 la Sun Life du Canada, Compagnie d'Assurance-Vie, et une autre copie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le dossier personnel de Mme Lipp. Lorsqu'elle est partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie en avril 2001, Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Sun Life. Cette demande fut d'abord rejet\u00e9e, mais, environ un an et demi plus tard, l'appel que Mme Lipp avait interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli.\n[124] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la lettre \u00e9manant de M. Slater et le colis relatif \u00e0 l'ARM ont eu pour effet d'augmenter son taux d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. On lui demandait de subir un EMI en juillet et de produire une ARM dans un d\u00e9lai de 12 jours. En huit jours, M. Slater a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Lipp deux lettres lui demandant de faire remplir une ARM et de subir un EMI. Il l'a menac\u00e9 de prise de mesures disciplinaires contre elle pouvant aller jusqu'au renvoi de Postes Canada si elle ne se conformait pas \u00e0 ces demandes. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle craignait que, peu importe ce qu'elle ferait, elle perdrait son emploi.\n[125] De plus, il a sembl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp que le colis exp\u00e9di\u00e9 par Medisys, dans lequel se trouvaient les documents relatifs \u00e0 l'ARM, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu entre le 8 juin 2001 et le 13 juin 2001, et ce, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 M. Slater d'ajouter sa lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. Non seulement le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 pour se conformer \u00e0 la demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 raccourci en raison de ce retard, l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 26 juin 2001 fix\u00e9e par Medisys avait \u00e9t\u00e9 raccourcie d'une journ\u00e9e par M. Slater.\n[126] En juillet 2001, Keith Jeworski a \u00e9crit une lettre de plainte \u00e0 Dale Hippe \u00e0 propos de la lettre de M. Slater. Il s'\u00e9levait contre le fait que le dossier relatif \u00e0 l'ARM exp\u00e9di\u00e9 par Medisys avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9 par la direction de Postes Canada afin de permettre \u00e0 M. Slater d'y ajouter une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation. M. Jeworski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que non seulement cela contrevenait au droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp, mais cela r\u00e9duisait le temps dont cette derni\u00e8re disposait pour r\u00e9pondre. Fait plus important, la lettre comportait des menaces de prise de mesures disciplinaires et de renvoi de Postes Canada. M. Jeworski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Il semble qu'il s'agisse d'un changement dans la proc\u00e9dure habituelle suivie par la direction lorsqu'elle demande qu'un questionnaire m\u00e9dical soit rempli. Cela renforce davantage la croyance de Mme Lipp que M. Slater agit par animosit\u00e9 personnelle. M. Jeworski a demand\u00e9 que la lettre de menaces du 13 juin soit retir\u00e9e du dossier personnel de Mme Lipp et que des mesures soient prises afin de voir \u00e0 ce que cela ne se reproduise plus \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[127] M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que si un employ\u00e9 refuse de fournir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux par le biais d'une ARM, cela ouvre la voie \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que l'on prenne des mesures administratives, notamment que l'on demande la tenue d'un EMI. Toutefois, l'omission de remplir une ARM ne pouvait pas entra\u00eener la prise d'une mesure disciplinaire. Rien dans la convention collective ou dans la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage ne justifiait la prise d'une telle mesure. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Jeworski a estim\u00e9 que la lettre de M. Slater \u00e9tait inopportune.\n[128] L'ARM a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie le 15 juin 2001 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par Medisys le 22 juin 2001. L'ARM faisait \u00e9tat que Mme Lipp souffrait d'une d\u00e9pression importante ainsi que de troubles anxieux li\u00e9es au conflit qu'elle vivait au travail. Le m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp a mentionn\u00e9 qu'un changement de milieu de travail ou de quart de travail h\u00e2terait la gu\u00e9rison de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[129] Dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate de Medisys r\u00e9sumant les r\u00e9sultats de l'ARM, la Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait pour le moment inapte au travail. Elle a de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] [...] nous devons r\u00e9gler le plus t\u00f4t possible les probl\u00e8mes en l'esp\u00e8ce, lesquels semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s en grande partie par le milieu de travail. Si nous n'agissons pas, Mme Lipp souffrira peut-\u00eatre encore plus longtemps de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(2) Les conclusions du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de l'all\u00e9gation no 3 [130] Dans l'ensemble, en ce qui concerne l'all\u00e9gation no 3, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. Toutefois, certains aspects de l'all\u00e9gation ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9s. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp a sembl\u00e9, \u00e0 certains moments, quelque peu exag\u00e9r\u00e9 et peu vraisemblable. Par exemple, ses d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles M. Slater lui posait des questions \u00e0 tous les jours \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience ou de ses besoins d'ordre m\u00e9dical et se cachait derri\u00e8re les colonnes afin de l'\u00e9pier semblaient un peu farfelues. De plus, bien qu'il puisse \u00eatre vrai que M. Slater comptait le temps que Mme Lipp prenait pour aller aux toilettes, je ne vois rien qui permette d'\u00e9tablir un lien entre ce comportement et la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp et je n'ai entendu aucun t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard selon lequel Mme Lipp aurait fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui dont faisait l'objet les autres employ\u00e9s n'ayant aucune d\u00e9ficience.\n[131] Je conclus toutefois \u00e0 l'existence d'une preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e9tablissant prima facie que la direction de Postes Canada a fr\u00e9quemment soumis Mme Lipp, dans la salle de travail, \u00e0 des interrogatoires et des commentaires agressifs et n\u00e9gatifs \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux ou qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente aux rendez-vous. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Karchewski. Je conclus que les d\u00e9clarations de Mme Karchewski \u00e0 propos des questions pos\u00e9es dans la salle de travail \u00e9taient convaincantes parce que celle-ci a parl\u00e9 en connaissance de cause ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir de son exp\u00e9rience comme d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale. Elle a parl\u00e9 du fait que, elle et d'autres personnes, se faisaient souvent poser la question [traduction] qu'es-tu capable de faire par la direction de Postes Canada alors qu'elles travaillaient sous le r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es.\n[132] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Jeworski a \u00e9tay\u00e9 dans une certaine mesure celui de Mme Lipp. Celui-ci a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu de nombreux conflits entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater et que le pr\u00e9sent conflit existait toujours \u00e0 l'heure actuelle. Mme Shoeman a produit un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 propos des mauvais rapports qui existaient entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater en raison des restrictions de Mme Lipp.\n[133] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus \u00e0 l'existence d'une preuve cr\u00e9dible \u00e9tablissant prima facie que les questions pos\u00e9es et les demandes formul\u00e9es par Postes Canada, notamment la demande de production de documents m\u00e9dicaux, en rapport avec la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp, \u00e9taient souvent pos\u00e9es ou formul\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re agressive et irrespectueuse, et ce, \u00e0 la vue et au su de tout le monde. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Lipp a estim\u00e9 qu'elle faisait l'objet d'un traitement n\u00e9gatif en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve donnent \u00e0 penser que, parmi les causes importantes de la d\u00e9pression et des troubles anxieux de Mme Lipp, il y avait le traitement n\u00e9gatif que celle-ci avait re\u00e7u de la part de Postes Canada \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions physiques et il y avait l'exigence qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels.\n[134] De m\u00eame, quant autres lettres de Postes Canada, notamment quant \u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par M. Slater \u00e0 Mme Lipp, la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que Postes Canada a port\u00e9 une attention n\u00e9gative inhabituelle \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience ainsi qu'aux exigences entourant cet \u00e9tat. Les demandes de production de documents m\u00e9dicaux, de r\u00e9ponse aux questions et de pr\u00e9sence aux rendez-vous \u00e9taient imp\u00e9ratives et faisaient pratiquement toujours \u00e9tat de cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives quant \u00e0 l'emploi de Mme Lipp si celle-ci ne se conformait pas aux demandes. Le lien avec son statut d'employ\u00e9e ayant une d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait toujours \u00e9vident pour ce qui \u00e9tait des questions et des demandes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, des demandes de pr\u00e9sence aux rendez-vous ou de la prise de mesures d'accommodement en rapport avec sa d\u00e9ficience. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 on pouvait penser que ces questions ou ces demandes constituaient des avis de mauvaise conduite ou d'insubordination, celles-ci ont presque certainement min\u00e9 le sentiment de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi de Mme Lipp.\n[135] Par cons\u00e9quent, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation no 3, je conclus qu'une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de la d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n(3) Postes Canada a-t-elle une explication raisonnable \u00e0 fournir quant \u00e0 sa pratique discriminatoire? [136] Postes Canada a essentiellement fourni trois r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la preuve prima facie concernant l'all\u00e9gation no 3 : a) elle a ni\u00e9 que Mme Lipp aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi fr\u00e9quemment interrog\u00e9e, et ce, de fa\u00e7on aussi n\u00e9gative, dans la salle de travail ou que des confrontations ont eu lieu quant aux demandes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et quant aux pr\u00e9sences aux rendez-vous; b) elle a pr\u00e9tendu que les communications par lettre avec Mme Lipp et les discussions avec elle dans la salle de travail, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles se sont produites, ne constituaient pas une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de la d\u00e9ficience, mais constituaient plut\u00f4t des mesures n\u00e9cessaires prises par Postes Canada afin de traiter le cas d'une employ\u00e9e r\u00e9calcitrante; c) c'est en raison d'une rupture de la communication avec Medisys que les demandes de renseignements formul\u00e9es en juin 2001 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans des intervalles rapproch\u00e9s.\n[137] Pour les motifs suivants, je conclus que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n'\u00e9tayent pas les explications donn\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9e en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation.no 3.\na) Le d\u00e9menti quant aux questions fr\u00e9quentes et n\u00e9gatives qui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Lipp dans la salle de travail \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience\n[138] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n'\u00e9tayent pas le d\u00e9menti de Postes Canada quant aux questions fr\u00e9quentes et n\u00e9gatives qui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Lipp dans la salle de travail \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience. Au contraire, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayent fortement la position de Mme Lipp.\n[139] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquent que M. Slater a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 la gestion du dossier de Mme Lipp. M. Slater a lui-m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en 2000 et 2001, il participait plus activement qu'aujourd'hui \u00e0 la gestion des dossiers des travailleurs qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es.\n[140] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tablissent \u00e9galement que les superviseurs de Postes Canada et M. Slater ont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement eu l'occasion d'interroger les employ\u00e9s dans la salle de travail quant \u00e0 leurs restrictions. M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que certains superviseurs ont pu dire \u00e0 des travailleurs dans la salle de travail que, en raison des restrictions de l'un des employ\u00e9s, un autre employ\u00e9 devrait effectuer une partie du travail de ce dernier.\n[141] M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il parlait de temps \u00e0 autre avec Mme Lipp de diff\u00e9rentes questions, notamment de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que celle-ci produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Il a d\u00e9crit Mme Lipp comme \u00e9tant parfois sur la d\u00e9fensive, mais il a ni\u00e9 l'avoir vue pleurer. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne se rappelait d'aucune confrontation qu'il aurait eue avec Mme Lipp \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions et \u00e0 propos des demandes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux.\n[142] Par contre, Mme Lipp et Mme Shoeman se rappellent tr\u00e8s bien de confrontations qui ont eu lieu \u00e0 propos des restrictions de Mme Lipp et \u00e0 propos des demandes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que M. Slater parlait tr\u00e8s fort, sur un ton tr\u00e8s f\u00e2ch\u00e9, \u00e0 Mme Lipp. Celle-ci a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ces confrontations avaient eu lieu r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Mme Shoeman a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de l'une de ces confrontations et a cru bon d'intervenir car celle-ci tournait \u00e0 l'hostilit\u00e9.\n[143] Comme M. Slater se souvenait mal des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de fournir un t\u00e9moignage r\u00e9futant la preuve prima facie pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante sur ce point. De m\u00eame, M. Hippe n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moignage r\u00e9futant le t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour le compte de la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Mme Lipp a fr\u00e9quemment \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e et confront\u00e9e par la direction de Postes Canada, dans la salle de travail, \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience, de ses restrictions et de la demande de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, et ce, de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative.\nb) Le manque de collaboration de la part de Mme Lipp\n[144] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que les lettres envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Lipp, les discussions qui ont eu lieu dans la salle de travail et les menaces de prise de mesure disciplinaire ne constituaient pas une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp, mais constituaient plut\u00f4t des mesures non discriminatoires prises afin de s'occuper du cas d'une employ\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9calcitrante. Existe-t-il un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui appuie cette all\u00e9gation?\n[145] J'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur ce point et j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion, pour les motifs qui suivent, que, bien que Mme Lipp n'ait pas toujours collabor\u00e9 comme elle aurait d\u00fb avec Postes Canada, son manque \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'explique pas la fr\u00e9quence et la nature fortement n\u00e9gative des communications que Postes Canada a entretenues avec elle.\n[146] La preuve indique que Mme Lipp a pris un certain temps avant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re demande d'ARM. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par Medisys le 21 juillet 2000. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne comprenait pas pourquoi cette demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite compte tenu qu'elle avait fourni un billet du m\u00e9decin mentionnant qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures et compte tenu, \u00e9galement, qu'elle avait travaill\u00e9 pendant des quarts de travail de huit heures avant de poser sa candidature pour le poste \u00e0 temps plein en juin 2000. Pour cette raison, elle a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Slater, une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 21 ao\u00fbt 2000, dans laquelle elle lui posait un certain nombre de questions.\n[147] M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait pas re\u00e7u la lettre susmentionn\u00e9e. Quoi qu'il en soit, Mme Lipp s'est finalement rendue au bureau de son m\u00e9decin et lui a fait remplir l'ARM, puis l'a retourn\u00e9e avant la date limite du 8 septembre 2000. Cela s'est pass\u00e9 environ un mois et demi apr\u00e8s que l'ARM lui fut envoy\u00e9e. Je peux comprendre que du point de vue de Postes Canada, il semblait que, \u00e0 ce stade, Mme Lipp ne collaborait pas enti\u00e8rement avec elle.\n[148] Toutefois, entre le 8 septembre 2000 et l'automne 2001, moment o\u00f9 Mme Lipp a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maladie, je ne distingue que tr\u00e8s peu de preuve chez cette derni\u00e8re d'un refus de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes formul\u00e9es par Postes Canada quant \u00e0 la production de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience. De plus, M. Jeworski et Mme Lipp ont tous les deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que ni l'un ni l'autre n'avait fait valoir \u00e0 Postes Canada que Mme Lipp ne se soumettrait pas \u00e0 un EMI.\n[149] Il est vrai que Mme Lipp et le syndicat ont exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes lorsque Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e le 18 octobre 2000 qu'elle devrait subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg le 27 novembre 2000. Mme Lipp et le syndicat ont dit \u00e0 Postes Canada qu'il serait difficile pour Mme Lipp de se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg afin de subir l'EMI parce que, entre autres raisons, Mme Lipp avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 voyager. M. Hippe a reconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'exigence de la tenue d'un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg et, le 17 novembre 2000, il a mentionn\u00e9 que l'examen aurait lieu \u00e0 une autre date, \u00e0 Regina.\n[150] Selon moi, cela ne constitue pas un refus de collaborer. Mme Lipp et le Syndicat ont exprim\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes qui, selon Postes Canada, \u00e9taient suffisamment l\u00e9gitimes pour que l'on modifie le lieu o\u00f9 l'EMI devait avoir lieu.\n[151] Par la suite, Mme Lipp a appris par son superviseur, M. Brian Kanciruk, qu'on lui avait fix\u00e9 un rendez-vous d'EMI \u00e0 Regina. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp quant \u00e0 cette rencontre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Kanciruk l'avait interrog\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9sobligeante quant \u00e0 son intention de subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas encore re\u00e7u les documents et qu'elle pr\u00e9viendrait Postes Canada d\u00e8s qu'elle les recevrait. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp concernant cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par aucun autre t\u00e9moignage.\n[152] Par cons\u00e9quent, la lettre de M. Slater du 26 mars 2000 dans laquelle celui-ci d\u00e9clarait qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que Mme Lipp songeait \u00e0 ne pas subir l'EMI \u00e9tait une mauvaise description de la situation. Mme Lipp n'avait pas refus\u00e9 de subir l'EMI; elle avait mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle examinerait la question d\u00e8s qu'elle recevrait les documents.\n[153] En fin de compte, sans que ce soit de sa faute, Mme Lipp n'a pas subi l'EMI dont la tenue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 2 avril 2001 \u00e0 Regina. Elle a tent\u00e9, par le biais de son syndicat, d'\u00e9changer le rendez-vous avec celui d'un autre employ\u00e9 parce que la date fix\u00e9e se conciliait mal avec les projets personnels qu'elle avait planifi\u00e9s pour cette date. Postes Canada n'a pas consult\u00e9 Mme Lipp avant de fixer la date. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas que l'on puisse raisonnablement affirmer que les tentatives de Mme Lipp d'\u00e9changer son rendez-vous avec celui d'un autre employ\u00e9 constituait un refus de collaborer.\n[154] M. Jeworski a franchement reconnu qu'il avait commis une erreur en tentant d'organiser l'\u00e9change. Il semble que Postes Canada \u00e9tait sous l'impression que Mme Lipp se pr\u00e9senterait au rendez-vous du 2 avril 2001 alors que Mme Lipp croyait qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter au rendez-vous le 9 avril 2001. M. Jeworski a parl\u00e9 avec Postes Canada pour lui mentionner que c'est lui qui avait fait une erreur et que ce n'\u00e9tait pas la faute de Mme Lipp.\n[155] Toutefois, dans sa lettre du 7 juin 2006, M. Slater a qualifi\u00e9 le d\u00e9faut de la part de Mme Lipp de se pr\u00e9senter aux deux rendez-vous d'EMI qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des refus de se pr\u00e9senter. Il a alors menac\u00e9 Mme Lipp de la renvoyer si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me rendez-vous d'EMI, celui-l\u00e0 fix\u00e9 au 30 juillet 2000. Mme Lipp s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce rendez-vous et a appris qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 sans qu'elle en soit avis\u00e9e.\n[156] Le 3 avril 2001, le jour apr\u00e8s que Mme Lipp fut partie en cong\u00e9 de maladie, M. Slater a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp dans laquelle il mentionnait qu'elle devait produire un formulaire d'EAPT d\u00fbment rempli au plus tard le 5 avril 2001, sinon elle serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en cong\u00e9 sans solde. M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que ce genre de lettre n'est pas envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque employ\u00e9 qui prend un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas pourquoi la lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e mais que, possiblement, c'\u00e9tait parce que Postes Canada avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des documents de la part de Mme Lipp. Celle-ci a fourni les documents demand\u00e9s le 5 avril 2001.\n[157] Selon moi, il ressort de la preuve que, bien que Mme Lipp ait pris du temps \u00e0 acquiescer \u00e0 la demande voulant qu'elle subisse un EMI \u00e0 l'automne 2000, elle s'est par la suite conform\u00e9e aux demandes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de production de documents et de pr\u00e9sence aux rendez-vous formul\u00e9es par Postes Canada. Il est vrai que Mme Lipp a dit \u00e0 Postes Canada qu'elle ne voulait pas se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg afin de subir un EMI. Les motifs qu'elle a invoqu\u00e9s pour ce refus n'\u00e9taient toutefois pas futiles. De plus, Postes Canada a accept\u00e9 ces motifs et a accept\u00e9 de fixer la tenue de l'EMI \u00e0 Regina.\n[158] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hippe donne fortement \u00e0 penser que, en fait, c'\u00e9tait l'incapacit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp \u00e0 accomplir l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches de son poste qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur important dans le comportement n\u00e9gatif de Postes Canada \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada avait toujours eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que Mme Lipp soit incapable de trier le courrier surdimensionn\u00e9. Postes Canada esp\u00e9rait que cette restriction dispara\u00eetrait et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle a constamment demand\u00e9 des renseignements \u00e0 propos des restrictions de Mme Lipp. M. Hippe a rapidement nuanc\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse en mentionnant que constamment signifiait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et qu'il s'agissait peut-\u00eatre d'un mot trop fort pour affirmer que Postes Canada avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter la restriction. Selon moi, les d\u00e9clarations de M. Hippe ainsi que sa r\u00e9alisation manifeste des cons\u00e9quences de ces derni\u00e8res \u00e9taient r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices. Elles donnaient fortement \u00e0 penser que la conduite de Postes Canada \u00e9tait, dans une large mesure, motiv\u00e9e par une r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 accepter l'ensemble des restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp.\nc) Rupture de la communication avec Medisys\n[159] M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la d\u00e9livrance de deux demandes de renseignements, l'une le 7 juin 2001, ordonnant que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI le 30 juillet 2001, et l'autre le 13 juin 2001, demandant que Mme Lipp produise une ARM, n'auraient pas d\u00fb se produire. Les deux lettres comprenaient des menaces de prise de mesures disciplinaires pour omission de se conformer et elles ont toutes les deux \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par M. Slater.\n[160] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il avait fait cela, M. Slater a admis qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9trange que [traduction] [l'on demande] en m\u00eame temps, ou presque en m\u00eame temps, un EMI et une ARM. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Postes Canada n'avait de toute \u00e9vidence pas communiqu\u00e9 avec Medisys \u00e0 propos de ceci parce que si elle l'avait fait, l'une des deux demandes de production de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une meilleure communication aurait pu permettre d'\u00e9viter ce probl\u00e8me.\n[161] Le fait demeure, toutefois, que c'est M. Slater qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9, \u00e0 quelques jours d'intervalle, la lettre demandant \u00e0 Mme Lipp de subir un EMI et la lettre demandant \u00e0 Mme Lipp de faire remplir une ARM. Il a lanc\u00e9 l'avertissement concernant la prise de mesures disciplinaires. On peut d\u00e9duire, par cons\u00e9quent, que M. Slater savait que les deux demandes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. On aurait pu facilement rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 toute rupture de communication avec Medisys en appelant celle-ci. Pour ce motif, l'explication de M. Slater voulant que c'\u00e9tait parce qu'il y avait eu rupture de communication avec Medisys que deux lettres comportant des menaces avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9es dans un intervalle de six jours ne me semble pas raisonnable.\nd) Autres communications inexpliqu\u00e9es avec Mme Lipp\n[162] Selon moi, il y a d'autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements pour lesquels Postes Canada n'a fourni aucune explication raisonnable. Par exemple, lorsque Mme Lipp ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au rendez-vous d'EMI \u00e0 Regina le 2 avril 2001, M. Slater a \u00e9mis un Avis d'entrevue de 24 heures demandant \u00e0 Mme Lipp de se pr\u00e9senter afin de discuter des raisons pour lesquelles elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, comme on lui avait demand\u00e9, au rendez-vous d'EMI. Mme Lipp fut avertie que si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, elle pourrait faire l'objet d'une mesure disciplinaire distincte.\n[163] M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on ne prendrait jamais une telle mesure. Postes Canada n'a jamais pris aucune mesure disciplinaire contre une personne parce que celle-ci ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 une entrevue. M. Slater a admis que l'avertissement devrait \u00eatre retir\u00e9 de l'avis et que les formulaires ne soient plus utilis\u00e9s.\n[164] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il avait envoy\u00e9 une copie de la lettre du 12 juin \u00e0 la Sun Life, M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre parce qu'il savait qu'une demande de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. D'ordinaire, on n'envoie pas une telle lettre \u00e0 la Sun Life, sauf si cela est demand\u00e9. M. Slater a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir jamais re\u00e7u aucune demande de la sorte. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'expliquer pourquoi il avait envoy\u00e9 la lettre.\n(4) La conclusion du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation no 3 [165] Je conclus que, en me fondant sur la preuve susmentionn\u00e9e, Postes Canada n'a fourni aucune explication raisonnable pour r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Lipp que la conduite de Postes Canada, durant la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode, constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. Je n'accepte pas l'affirmation de Postes Canada que les menaces de prise de mesures disciplinaires et les rappels fr\u00e9quents quant \u00e0 la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient exclusivement fond\u00e9s sur le fait que Mme Lipp tardait \u00e0 produire les renseignements. Je crois plut\u00f4t qu'un facteur important dans la diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dont faisait l'objet Mme Lipp \u00e9tait que Postes Canada avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les restrictions de Mme Lipp quant aux t\u00e2ches de son poste qui d\u00e9coulaient de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[166] J'accepte que Postes Canada doive demander r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement aux employ\u00e9s qui font l'objet de restrictions relatives au travail des renseignements quant \u00e0 savoir s'il y a eu des changements dans leurs restrictions qui pourraient avoir une incidence sur l'accommodement dont ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient ou qui pourraient leur permettre de faire un travail plus productif. Toutefois, il y a une limite importante \u00e0 observer en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les demandes de renseignements doivent \u00eatre raisonnables; elles ne peuvent pas \u00eatre mena\u00e7antes ou \u00e0 ce point fr\u00e9quentes qu'elles constituent un lourd fardeau pour les employ\u00e9s.\n[167] Des menaces r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es de prise de mesures disciplinaires et de renvoi pour ne pas avoir fourni des renseignements quant \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience qui ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur des pr\u00e9occupations valables quant \u00e0 la collaboration constituent, selon moi, une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. De m\u00eame, des questions fr\u00e9quentes et injustifi\u00e9es pos\u00e9es \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 ayant une d\u00e9ficience ainsi que des discussions avec lui \u00e0 propos de ses restrictions et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux constituent une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Elles imposent \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 ayant une d\u00e9ficience un fardeau qui n'est pas impos\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s n'ayant aucune d\u00e9ficience.\n[168] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, Postes Canada s'est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de fournir une explication raisonnable.\nVII. LA DEUXI\u00c8ME P\u00c9RIODE - MME LIPP DEMANDE \u00c0 RETOURNER AU TRAVAIL A. L'ALL\u00c9GATION NO 4 - Le refus de permettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp de retourner au travail tant qu'elle ne se serait pas soumise \u00e0 l'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Aper\u00e7u\n[169] En septembre 2001, Mme Lipp a appel\u00e9 Postes Canada pour dire qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. Elle a produit un billet du m\u00e9decin ainsi qu'une \u00c9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail confirmant qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail le 9 octobre 2001. Par la suite, elle a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait fait l'objet du m\u00eame genre de traitement et du m\u00eame genre de demandes de renseignements dont elle avait fait l'objet durant la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode et que cela avait abouti \u00e0 la demande qu'elle se soumette \u00e0 deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada l'avait trait\u00e9e au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode de temps et la demande qu'elle se soumette aux EMI constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience (notamment sur son \u00e9tat psychologique) et sur son sexe (elle \u00e9tait enceinte lorsque l'exigence relative \u00e0 l'EMI a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e).\n(1) Existe-t-il une preuve cr\u00e9dible qui \u00e9taye l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e? [170] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait appris qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte le ou vers le 14 juillet 2001. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, vers la fin de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, elle croyait qu'elle serait capable de retourner au travail. Elle a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait besoin de retourner au travail. Sa demande d'assurance invalidit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e (cette d\u00e9cision fut par la suite annul\u00e9e en appel et elle s'est vu accorder les prestations demand\u00e9es avec r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9).\n[171] Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait compt\u00e9 le nombre de semaines pendant lequel elle devrait travailler au taux pr\u00e9vu pour le travail \u00e0 temps plein afin d'\u00eatre admissible aux prestations de maternit\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur l'assurance-emploi, puis elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la date \u00e0 laquelle elle retournerait au travail.\n[172] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 18 septembre 2001, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada et l'a inform\u00e9e qu'elle avait l'intention de retourner au travail le 9 octobre 2001. Postes Canada a dit \u00e0 Mme Lipp que, avant qu'elle lui permette de retourner au travail, elle devrait obtenir des renseignements additionnels confirmant qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. Mme Lipp a d'abord produit un billet de son m\u00e9decin, dat\u00e9 du 10 octobre 2001, mentionnant qu'elle ne souffrait plus de troubles anxieux, ni de d\u00e9pression et qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 accomplir ses t\u00e2ches - des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es de grande dimension et de petite dimension (les mots grande dimension et petite dimension renvoient au tri du courrier effectu\u00e9 en fonction de la dimension des lettres.)\n[173] Le m\u00eame jour, Mme Lipp a fait remplir une EAPT par son m\u00e9decin. L'EAPT mentionnait que Mme Lipp ne souffrait plus de troubles anxieux, ni de d\u00e9pression. De plus, le m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp a mentionn\u00e9 que, physiquement, celle-ci \u00e9tait capable de lever et de transporter des charges de 9 kilos, mais seulement du plancher jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de la taille, de lever et de transporter des charges de 2 kilos, mais seulement de la hauteur de la taille jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur des \u00e9paules. L'EAPT mentionnait \u00e9galement qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable de lever ou de transporter des charges plus haut que les \u00e9paules.\n[174] Finalement, Mme Lipp a fait remplir une ARM \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'avait pas fait remplir l'ARM lorsqu'on lui avait demand\u00e9 parce qu'elle croyait que tout ce qu'elle devait faire, c'est-\u00e0-dire produire un billet du m\u00e9decin et une EAPT, elle l'avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\n[175] L'ARM, dat\u00e9e du 29 octobre 2001, faisait \u00e9tat que Mme Lipp souffrait toujours de troubles anxieux, mais que ceux-ci \u00e9taient bien contr\u00f4l\u00e9s. Mme Lipp ne prenait plus de m\u00e9dicaments, mais elle avait recours au contr\u00f4le du stress naturel. Dans l'ARM, le Dr Van Heerden a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il croyait qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus n\u00e9cessaire que les t\u00e2ches exig\u00e9es par le poste soient toujours modifi\u00e9es. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] La patiente croit qu'elle sera en mesure de s'acquitter de ses fonctions. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le conflit qu'elle avait eu avec son patron constituait toujours un probl\u00e8me, mais que Mme Lipp avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par son syndicat qu'il n'y aurait plus de probl\u00e8me si une bonne communication \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie.\n[176] Dans l'ARM, le Dr Van Heerden a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, en ce qui a trait aux restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp, celle-ci ne pouvait pas lever des objets lourds au-dessus de ses \u00e9paules. Aucune autre restriction n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e et le m\u00e9decin a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Lipp devrait \u00eatre capable de trier le courrier l\u00e9ger. Le Dr Van Heerden, en parlant des restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp, a d'abord mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas le m\u00e9decin traitant en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la blessure \u00e0 l'\u00e9paule ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat chronique de la coiffe des rotateurs de Mme Lipp.\n[177] Dans son Rapport d'enqu\u00eate du 30 octobre 2001, la Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les restrictions physiques soulign\u00e9es par le Dr Van Heerden dans l'ARM ne concordaient pas avec les restrictions mentionn\u00e9es dans l'EAPT que ce m\u00eame m\u00e9decin avait produit 20 jours plus t\u00f4t, le 10 octobre 2001. Le Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle h\u00e9siterait \u00e0 approuver les restrictions et les limites physiques mentionn\u00e9es par le Dr Van Heerden dans l'ARM tant que la divergence ne serait pas tir\u00e9e au clair.\n[178] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon lui, la divergence \u00e0 laquelle la Dr Koz faisait allusion dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait que, dans l'EAPT, le Dr Van Heerden avait \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 des restrictions importantes concernant la capacit\u00e9 physique de Mme Lipp. Toutefois, dans l'ARM, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie tout juste 20 jours apr\u00e8s l'EAPT, le Dr Van Heerden a tout simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Lipp n'\u00e9tait pas capable de lever des objets lourds au-dessus de son \u00e9paule et que, \u00e0 part cela, elle ne faisait l'objet d'aucune autre restriction. M. Hippe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si l'ARM \u00e9tait pris au pied de la lettre, cela signifierait que Mme Lipp pourrait effectuer un plus grand nombre de t\u00e2ches.\n[179] Par cons\u00e9quent, il semble que lorsque la Dr Koz a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate qu'elle h\u00e9siterait \u00e0 approuver les restrictions soulign\u00e9es dans l'ARM, elle voulait dire par l\u00e0 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 approuver une augmentation de l'\u00e9ventail des t\u00e2ches que pouvait effectuer Mme Lipp en se fondant sur ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit dans l'ARM. Elle avait besoin de plus de pr\u00e9cisions avant de faire cela.\n[180] La Dr Koz a donc recommand\u00e9 la tenu d'une rencontre avec M. Hippe et les chefs de service de Postes Canada afin de discuter du cas de Mme Lipp et de choisir un m\u00e9canisme qui permettrait de clarifier la divergence. Elle n'a donn\u00e9 aucune indication sur ce qu'elle voulait dire par m\u00e9canisme. Rien dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate n'indiquait qu'il existait des doutes quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat psychologique de Mme Lipp.\n[181] Postes Canada a ensuite demand\u00e9 que Mme Lipp assiste \u00e0 une r\u00e9union le 8 novembre 2001 afin de discuter du Rapport d'enqu\u00eate. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Hippe, M. Slater, Mme Karchewski, M. Jeworski et Mme Darlene Black, une infirmi\u00e8re travaillant pour Medisys, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre 2001. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Hippe a commenc\u00e9 la r\u00e9union en lui disant qu'il voulait qu'elle se rende \u00e0 un rendez-vous d'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Postes Canada l'enverrait l\u00e0-bas par avion ou par autobus et qu'elle pourrait se faire accompagner par un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical. Mme Lipp a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'aimait pas prendre l'avion et qu'elle ne voulait pas conduire pour se rendre aussi loin pendant sa grossesse. De plus, elle avait toujours peur de rouler sur l'autoroute en raison du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari qui s'\u00e9tait produit sur l'autoroute.\n[182] Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a dit \u00e0 M. Hippe que son m\u00e9decin lui avait conseill\u00e9 de n'entreprendre aucun voyage en raison des probl\u00e8mes de crampes ut\u00e9rines qu'elle \u00e9prouvait. Dans sa famille, il y avait eu des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de fausse couche; elle ne voulait pas mettre sa grossesse en danger.\n[183] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 si elle ne pouvait pas \u00e9viter l'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg en fixant un autre rendez-vous, cette fois-ci avec le Dr Fink \u00e0 Regina, \u00e0 une date ant\u00e9rieure au 23 novembre. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Hippe a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne voyait aucune raison de s'objecter \u00e0 cette proposition. L'infirmi\u00e8re de Medisys, Darlene Black, a toutefois affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il serait possible de fixer le rendez-vous \u00e0 une autre date dans un d\u00e9lai aussi court.\n[184] Mme Karchewski, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e syndicale, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union. Son t\u00e9moignage concernant la r\u00e9union a confirm\u00e9 celui de Mme Lipp.\n[185] M. Jeworski, qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Lipp avait fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes quant au voyage \u00e0 Winnipeg parce qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte et qu'elle avait eu des probl\u00e8mes avec sa grossesse. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada avait propos\u00e9 un certain nombre de solutions de rechange pour faire face au probl\u00e8me engendr\u00e9 par la peur des voyages de Mme Lipp. Mais Mme Lipp a \u00e9galement fait part d'un probl\u00e8me de conflit de rendez-vous car elle avait un rendez-vous chez sa gyn\u00e9cologue \u00e0 la m\u00eame date que l'EMI. M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Postes Canada attendait une confirmation de la part de Mme Lipp qu'elle se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 l'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Bien que la possibilit\u00e9 que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina avec le Dr Fink fut discut\u00e9e, aucun engagement ne fut pris par Postes Canada \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La direction a tout simplement mentionn\u00e9 que la proposition serait examin\u00e9e. Mme Lipp a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle examinerait la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle subisse l'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[186] Le ou vers le 15 novembre 2001, Mme Lipp a re\u00e7u une lettre de la part de Darlene Black, de Medisys, mentionnant ce qui suit : [traduction] comme il fut convenu lors de la discussion du 8 novembre 2001, des rendez-vous d'examens m\u00e9dicaux ind\u00e9pendants \u00e0 Winnipeg ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris pour vous et voici l'itin\u00e9raire. La lettre faisait ensuite mention de la date, de l'heure et de l'endroit pr\u00e9vus pour la tenue des deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle entendait parler pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il y aurait deux EMI. Il ne ressort pas clairement de la preuve comment au juste Mme Lipp a \u00e9tabli que l'un des deux rendez-vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 avec un psychiatre, mais ces renseignements lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis sans que l'on sache comment apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut re\u00e7u la lettre de Darlene Black.\n[187] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la lettre susmentionn\u00e9e l'avait laiss\u00e9e perplexe parce que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que Mme Black avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre, il n'y avait eu aucune discussion au cours de la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire subir deux EMI \u00e0 Mme Lipp. La discussion concernant l'EMI qui a eu lieu lors de la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre 2001 a port\u00e9 sur les restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp et non pas sur son \u00e9tat psychologique.\n[188] M. Jeworski a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 d'apprendre que Mme Lipp devrait subir, \u00e0 Winnipeg, un EMI effectu\u00e9 par un psychiatre ainsi qu'un EMI effectu\u00e9 par un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois, et ce, avant qu'elle ne puisse retourner au travail. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que rien lors de la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre n'avait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il y aurait un rendez-vous avec un psychiatre \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[189] Entre-temps, Mme Lipp a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 reporter au 16 novembre 2001 le rendez-vous avec le Dr Fink, le sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois. Elle a appel\u00e9 Keith Jeworski pour l'informer de cela. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des discussions qui ont eu lieu avec Postes Canada et Medisys lors de la r\u00e9union du 8 novembre, Mme Lipp croyait que le rendez-vous avec le Dr Fink \u00e9liminait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle aille voir un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[190] Mary Lou Woodfield, la deuxi\u00e8me vice-pr\u00e9sidente de la section locale du STTP, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle entretenait de bons rapports avec M. Hippe et qu'elle croyait qu'elle serait peut-\u00eatre en mesure de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me relatif aux EMI. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Hippe et qu'elle lui avait demand\u00e9 s'il envisagerait la possibilit\u00e9 de faire venir les m\u00e9decins de Winnipeg \u00e0 Regina afin que ceux-ci effectuent les EMI. M. Hippe a dit \u00e0 Mme Woodfield qu'il ne paierait pas pour faire venir un m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Regina. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il [traduction] n'irait pas jusque l\u00e0.\n[191] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au rendez-vous avec le Dr Fink le 16 novembre 2001, croyant que cela entra\u00eenerait l'annulation d'au moins un des EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Le Dr Fink \u00e9tait un m\u00e9decin dont Postes Canada avait retenu les services dans le pass\u00e9 pour effectuer des EMI. Elle n'avait aucune raison de croire qu'il ne conviendrait pas \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[192] Mme Lipp s'est \u00e9galement rendue \u00e0 un rendez-vous chez son m\u00e9decin le 16 novembre 2001. Celui-ci a \u00e9crit un billet qui \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nElle est actuellement enceinte de 23 semaines et elle souffre parfois de crampes ut\u00e9rines. Nous pr\u00e9f\u00e8rerions donc que vous trouviez un autre m\u00e9decin et un autre psychologue plus pr\u00e8s de chez elle de telle sorte qu'elle n'ait pas \u00e0 se rendre aussi loin. Elle a peur de voyager en avion et cette peur a empir\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite des r\u00e9cents \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Le Dr J Alton est un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois qui pourrait peut-\u00eatre vous aider.\n[193] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le billet susmentionn\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[194] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait re\u00e7u une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 18 novembre 2001, de la part de M. Slater, mentionnant que si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas aux rendez-vous d'EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg, elle ferait l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux rendez-vous parce qu'elle ne voulait pas nuire \u00e0 sa grossesse.\n[195] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001, Mme Lipp a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e par lettre qu'elle faisait l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde de la part de Postes Canada. M. Slater a mentionn\u00e9 dans cette lettre que si sa grossesse ne lui permettait pas de se rendre au rendez-vous d'IME, alors Mme Lipp devait fournir imm\u00e9diatement des documents \u00e0 cet effet. D'autres dispositions seraient prises quant \u00e0 l'EMI apr\u00e8s sa grossesse.\n[196] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 d\u00e9cembre 2001, George Britton, secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la section locale du STTP \u00e0 Regina, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Slater et lui a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 subir les EMI et que, en fait, elle avait subi un EMI qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 le 16 novembre 2001 par le Dr Fink. M. Slater a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de M. Britton le 1er janvier 2002. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre de r\u00e9ponse que l'EMI du Dr Fink ne pourrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 car c'est le m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp qui l'a envoy\u00e9e voir le Dr Fink et non pas Postes Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'examen du Dr Fink ne pouvait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant vraiment un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant.\n(2) La conclusion du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de l'all\u00e9gation no 4 [197] Je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable quant au refus de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions sans qu'elle subisse d'abord les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a produit un billet du m\u00e9decin et une EAPT mentionnant qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail le 9 octobre 2001. Elle a ensuite produit une ARM qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par Medisys. Selon l'ARM, Mme Lipp \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 beaucoup moins de restrictions physiques que son m\u00e9decin ne l'avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'EAPT ant\u00e9rieur. Toutefois, la m\u00e9decin de Medisys n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 ent\u00e9riner cette conclusion tant que la divergence entre l'EAPT et l'ARM ne serait pas tir\u00e9e au clair. Rien dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate ne donnait \u00e0 penser que l'on ne devrait pas permettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp de retourner au travail.\n[198] N\u00e9anmoins, Postes Canada a demand\u00e9 que Mme Lipp subisse d'abord un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant qu'elle lui permette de retourner au travail. Au d\u00e9but, il semblait que l'EMI ne devait avoir lieu qu'avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e0 Winnipeg. Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'il servirait \u00e0 traiter les questions en suspens concernant son aptitude \u00e0 long terme \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Toutefois, rien dans les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux fournis \u00e0 Postes Canada ne soulevait de question \u00e0 propos de sa capacit\u00e9 physique \u00e0 retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein sous le r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es dont elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait depuis avril de cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L'ARM donnait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 penser que Mme Lipp pourrait retourner au travail assujettie \u00e0 moins de restrictions qu'en avril 2001.\n[199] Il est devenu \u00e9vident par la suite que Postes Canada avait des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 psychologique de Mme Lipp \u00e0 travailler car elle voulait envoyer celle-ci consulter \u00e9galement un psychiatre \u00e0 Winnipeg. Rien, toutefois, dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate du Dr Koz n'indiquait que l'\u00e9tat psychologique de Mme Lipp posait probl\u00e8me. Il semblerait donc que, malgr\u00e9 le manque de renseignements \u00e0 la disposition de Postes Canada mentionnant que Mme Lipp souffrait toujours d'une d\u00e9pression ainsi que de troubles anxieux, Postes Canada estimait que l'\u00e9tat psychologique de Mme Lipp constituait un obstacle \u00e0 son retour au travail.\n[200] Il est de jurisprudence constante que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience englobe la diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665; Milazzo c. Autocar Connaisseur Inc. et l'Association des autocaristes canadiens 2003 TCDP 37, paragraphes 82 \u00e0 88). Je conclus donc que Mme Lipp a \u00e9tabli prima facie que le refus de Postes Canada de lui permettre de retourner au travail tant qu'elle ne subirait pas les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience psychologique per\u00e7ue et sur une d\u00e9ficience physique r\u00e9elle (probl\u00e8me de cou, d'\u00e9paule, de colonne vert\u00e9brale et de fibromyalgie).\n[201] Cela, cependant, ne met pas fin \u00e0 l'analyse relative \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[202] Je conclus qu'il existe \u00e9galement une preuve prima facie que l'insistance de la part de Postes Canada que les EMI aient lieu \u00e0 Winnipeg constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de Mme Lipp. Au lieu de permettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp de subir l'EMI \u00e0 Regina, comme elle voulait le faire ant\u00e9rieurement, Postes Canada a demand\u00e9 que MmeLipp se soumette \u00e0 deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail. Mme Lipp a inform\u00e9 Postes Canada qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes avec sa grossesse et qu'elle estimait qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas capable de voyager; elle craignait subir une fausse couche. Elle a obtenu un billet, dat\u00e9 du 16 novembre 2001, de la part de son m\u00e9decin, mentionnant qu'elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait n'entreprendre aucun voyage en raison des crampes ut\u00e9rines dont elle souffrait. Le m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp a mentionn\u00e9 le nom d'un autre m\u00e9decin qui pourrait effectuer l'EMI \u00e0 Regina.\n[203] Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait remis le billet susmentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada mais elle n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 quand ou comment. M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il ne se souvenait pas avoir re\u00e7u ce renseignement. Toutefois, lors de l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente instance, le billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans le dossier de documents de l'intim\u00e9e et non pas dans celui de la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp selon lequel elle avait remis le billet concernant sa grossesse \u00e0 Postes Canada. Je conclus \u00e9galement que Mme Lipp et le syndicat savaient qu'il \u00e9tait important pour Postes Canada qu'on lui fournisse des documents m\u00e9dicaux en temps utile. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Postes Canada a re\u00e7u le billet vers la date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit, c'est-\u00e0-dire le 16 novembre 2001.\n[204] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg ne semble pas discriminatoire. Comme M. Jeworski l'a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, pour de nombreux employ\u00e9s, se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg ne poserait aucun probl\u00e8me. Toutefois, pour Mme Lipp, cette exigence posait un probl\u00e8me compte tenu de ses inqui\u00e9tudes ainsi que de celles de son m\u00e9decin quant \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e qu'elle se d\u00e9place pendant sa grossesse. Cette exigence apparemment neutre a eu pour effet d'imposer \u00e0 Mme Lipp un fardeau qui n'\u00e9tait pas impos\u00e9 aux autres employ\u00e9s : Mme Lipp devait choisir entre son emploi et mettre potentiellement sa grossesse en p\u00e9ril. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si l'exigence ne visait pas particuli\u00e8rement Mme Lipp en tant que femme, elle avait un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur celle-ci en raison de son sexe. Pour cette raison, je conclus qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (grossesse) a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n(3) L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable? [205] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait des motifs raisonnables de douter de la validit\u00e9 des rapports du m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp \u00e0 propos de son \u00e9quilibre psychologique. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que ceci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive par l'arbitre dont la d\u00e9cision fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. De plus, il y avait la question non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e de la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Lipp \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein et, en plus de tout cela, il y avait la question de la divergence entre l'EAPT et l'ARM produits par le Dr Van Heerden en octobre 2001 qui devait \u00eatre tir\u00e9e au clair.\n[206] Compte tenu de l'incertitude concernant la sant\u00e9 mentale et la sant\u00e9 physique de Mme Lipp, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que l'exigence que celle-ci subisse des EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail constituait une EPJ. Postes Canada a de plus pr\u00e9tendu qu'il n'y avait aucun m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Regina qui \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer les EMI. Par cons\u00e9quent, les EMI devaient \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[207] Enfin, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle ne d\u00e9tenait pas suffisamment de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pour \u00e9tablir que Mme Lipp avait besoin de mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 sa grossesse. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a pr\u00e9tendu que Mme Lipp avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de collaboration quant aux efforts d'accommodement.\n[208] La plaignante a pr\u00e9tendu qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne justifiait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires. De plus, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'\u00e9tayait l'affirmation que Postes Canada subirait une contrainte excessive en r\u00e9int\u00e9grant Mme Lipp dans le poste \u00e0 temps plein.\n[209] La plaignante et l'intim\u00e9e ont toutes les deux soumis de la jurisprudence qui, selon elles, appuient leur position. La plaignante a invoqu\u00e9 Code Electric Products Ltd. c. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers [2005] B.C.A.A.A. no 14, quant \u00e0 l'affirmation que les risques en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre importants avant qu'une demande de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux avant le retour au travail ne soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une EPJ. Dans cette cause, l'arbitre Burke a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si le refus de l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le plaignant dans son travail d'op\u00e9rateur de machine, sans qu'il ne produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires et sans qu'il ne s'engage \u00e0 subir une th\u00e9rapie, \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Le plaignant souffrait de troubles bipolaires ainsi que de consommation abusive de cannabis et d'alcool. Il a soumis une preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9quivoque \u00e0 propos de son aptitude \u00e0 retourner au travail. L'arbitre a soulign\u00e9 que, si on appliquait l'analyse effectu\u00e9e dans Meiorin, l'exigence en litige dans cette cause \u00e9tait que le plaignant prouve qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail avant de retourner au travail puis qu'il suive une th\u00e9rapie dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[210] L'arbitre a conclu que les deux premi\u00e8res exigences du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de l'accommodement sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive, l'arbitre a soulign\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s par les m\u00e9decins qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans cette cause. Ceux-ci ont affirm\u00e9 dans leurs t\u00e9moignages qu'il existait un risque important de d\u00e9ficience dans le jugement du plaignant si celui-ci devait souffrir d'un \u00e9pisode psychotique. Compte tenu que le plaignant travaillait dans une entreprise industrielle dans laquelle il faisait fonctionner une machine qui tranche le m\u00e9tal avec une grande lame au rythme de 30 \u00e0 40 tranches par minute, son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 posait un risque important. L'arbitre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la situation \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle d'un bureau o\u00f9 les questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont diff\u00e9rentes.\n[211] L'arbitre a conclu que, compte tenu de l'incertitude quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, de la gravit\u00e9 de son \u00e9tat et de la nature du lieu de travail, une contrainte excessive serait occasionn\u00e9e si l'aptitude du plaignant \u00e0 retourner au travail n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tablie de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate.\n[212] L'intim\u00e9e invoque la d\u00e9cision Brimacombe c. Northland Road Services Ltd. [1998] B.C.H.R.T.D. no 34 (Q.L.). Brimacombe \u00e9tait un m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde. On a diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez lui le syndrome de fatigue chronique. Il souffrait d'\u00e9tourdissements, de fatigue et de probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9quilibre pendant son travail. Il a arr\u00eat\u00e9 de travailler et il est parti en cong\u00e9 de maladie, puis, lorsqu'il est revenu, il a produit un billet du m\u00e9decin mentionnant qu'il pourrait faire fonctionner des machines comme, par exemple, conduire un camion, mais qu'il ne pourrait faire aucun travail manuel. Le billet ne donnait toutefois aucune explication quant \u00e0 la maladie, les capacit\u00e9s, les restrictions et quant aux risques d'un accident occasionn\u00e9 par l'\u00e9tat du plaignant.\n[213] Le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a conclu que l'exigence que le plaignant produise un billet du m\u00e9decin plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e et que s'il retournait au travail sans produire ce billet, cela aurait pour effet de cr\u00e9er un risque important quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'importance du risque couru par le plaignant et ses coll\u00e8gues de travail \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rable. En tant que m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde, M. Brimacombe travaillait sur des machines lourdes et autour de machines lourdes, comme des tracteurs, des charrues, des niveleuses, etc. Afin de permettre \u00e0 M. Brimacombe de retourner au travail sans produire un billet qui mentionnait davantage de d\u00e9tails quant \u00e0 sa maladie et quant \u00e0 ses restrictions aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour l'intim\u00e9e, pour ses coll\u00e8gues de travail et, dans certaines circonstances, pour le public. De plus, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que l'employeur ne disposait, sans renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, d'aucun moyen pour organiser convenablement les t\u00e2ches de l'emploi.\n[214] Ces causes donnent \u00e0 penser que l'exigence que l'employ\u00e9 produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires et (ou) subisse un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant avant qu'on puisse lui permettre de retourner au travail constituera vraisemblablement une EPJ lorsque la preuve m\u00e9dicale disponible jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent n'est pas claire et qu'il existe un risque important quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et (ou) la sant\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 et des autres personnes autour de lui. Lorsque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est en jeu, l'ampleur du risque et l'identit\u00e9 de ceux qui le supportent sont des facteurs pertinents (Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne.) (1990), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417, paragraphe 63). Toutefois, le risque ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment ind\u00e9pendant qui justifie la discrimination; il fait plut\u00f4t partie de l'analyse quant \u00e0 savoir si la suppression de l'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires cr\u00e9e une contrainte excessive (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, paragraphe 30).\n[215] La nature de la d\u00e9ficience et les conditions de travail sont des facteurs qui devraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre pris en compte dans l'appr\u00e9ciation de savoir si l'exigence de subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant constitue une EPJ. En vertu du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, l'intim\u00e9e peut \u00e9galement d\u00e9montrer que le co\u00fbt de l'accommodement de la plaignante, en l'absence de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, constituait une contrainte excessive.\na) Les \u00e9tapes deux et trois de l'analyse effectu\u00e9e dans Meiorin : l'exigence de subir des EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg est-elle rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 des objectifs l\u00e9gitimes et a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi? [216] Je crois qu'il est logique dans le contexte de l'all\u00e9gation susmentionn\u00e9e d'analyser ensemble les deux premi\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de l'analyse effectu\u00e9e dans Meoirin.\n[217] Il ressort de la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage dans ce domaine qu'un employeur a le droit de demander des preuves sur l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un employ\u00e9 lorsqu'il retourne au travail apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 absent \u00e0 la suite d'une maladie. L'exigence de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e n\u00e9cessaire afin que l'on puisse assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la sant\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 qui retourne au travail ainsi que celle de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail et afin que l'on puisse faciliter le processus d'accommodement (Re Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Canada Ltd. et United Rubber Workers, section locale 113 (1979) 3 L.A.C. (2d) 12; Code Electric Products Ltd, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 100 Brimacombe, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 83).\n[218] Dans l'analyse que j'ai faite dans la premi\u00e8re partie des pr\u00e9sents motifs, j'ai conclu que l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'objectif qui consiste \u00e0 s'assurer que Postes Canada l'accommode de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire de telle sorte qu'elle puisse faire un travail productif dans le cadre de son poste de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein. J'ai \u00e9galement conclu que l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI \u00e0 Regina a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans la croyance honn\u00eate et sinc\u00e8re que cette mesure \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'atteinte de ces objectifs. Pour les m\u00eames motifs, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que l'exigence que Mme Lipp se rende aux deux EMI \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e aux objectifs qui consistent \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce que l'on accommode Mme Lipp de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et productive dans le cadre du poste \u00e0 temps plein.\n[219] Il s'agit maintenant de d\u00e9cider si l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans la croyance honn\u00eate et sinc\u00e8re que cette mesure \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'atteinte de ces objectifs.\n[220] M. Hippe et M. Slater ont tous les deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz leur avait dit que Mme Lipp ne devrait pas retourner au travail tant qu'elle n'aurait pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats des EMI. Ceux-ci ont de plus affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz n'avait plus confiance dans la personne qui effectuait les EMI \u00e0 Regina, c'est-\u00e0-dire le Dr Fink. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le Dr Koz lui avait dit qu'il n'y avait aucun autre m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Regina qui pouvait faire subir les EMI.\n[221] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage susmentionn\u00e9, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que Postes Canada a formul\u00e9 l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail en croyant honn\u00eatement et sinc\u00e8rement que cette mesure \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin de voir \u00e0 ce que l'on accommode Mme Lipp de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et productive dans le cadre du poste \u00e0 temps plein.\n[222] Comme c'est souvent le cas, la question la plus difficile \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9e doit r\u00e9pondre est la suivante :\nb) L'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse des EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg \u00e9tait-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'atteinte de l'objectif qui consiste \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce que ce que l'on accommode Mme Lipp de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire et productive dans le cadre du poste \u00e0 temps plein? [223] \u00c0 ce stade-ci, Postes Canada doit d\u00e9montrer que l'exigence d'envoyer Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg afin qu'elle y subisse les EMI \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire en ce sens qu'elle n'aurait pas pu accommoder Mme Lipp sans subir une contrainte excessive (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 62). Postes Canada doit d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a examin\u00e9 les solutions de rechange \u00e0 l'envoi de Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg afin qu'elle y subisse les EMI et que les solutions de rechange examin\u00e9es qu'elle a rejet\u00e9es, l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour des motifs appropri\u00e9s (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 65; voir \u00e9galement Audet c. CCFNC 2006 TCDP 25, paragraphe 62). Une preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, quant au co\u00fbt de l'accommodement d'une personne n'est pas acceptable; l'intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer d'une mani\u00e8re r\u00e9elle et concr\u00e8te de quelle fa\u00e7on les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait de fournir un accommodement constitueraient pour lui une contrainte excessive (Audet, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 106).\n[224] Pour analyser la troisi\u00e8me partie du crit\u00e8re de l'EPJ, j'ai divis\u00e9 la question de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n\u00c9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Lipp subisse un examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant? \u00c9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois? \u00c9tait-il raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire que l'on emp\u00eache Mme Lipp de retourner travailler tant qu'elle n'aurait pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats des EMI? \u00c9tait-il raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire que l'on exige que les EMI soient effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 Winnipeg?\n(i) \u00c9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Lipp subisse un examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant?\n[225] Mme Lipp a produit un billet du m\u00e9decin mentionnant qu'elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. L'arbitre a jug\u00e9 que Postes Canada, par le biais de sa m\u00e9decin consultante, la Dr Koz, avait des motifs raisonnables de douter de la validit\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux fournis par le Dr Van Heerden quant \u00e0 savoir si Mme Lipp \u00e9tait psychologiquement apte \u00e0 travailler.\n[226] La Dr Koz n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente cause. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz lui avait dit que Mme Lipp ne devrait pas retourner au travail tant que l'on n'aurait pas obtenu les r\u00e9sultats des EMI. Il ne pouvait toutefois pas expliquer pourquoi la Dr Koz \u00e9tait de cette opinion. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne connais pas les renseignements dont disposait la Dr Koz pour donner \u00e0 penser que Mme Lipp souffrait toujours d'un \u00e9tat psychologique qui l'aurait expos\u00e9 ou expos\u00e9 d'autres personnes \u00e0 des risques si elle retournait travailler sans d'abord subir un examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant. Le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve du Dr Koz dont j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi \u00e9tait le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate, dat\u00e9 du 30 octobre 2001, qu'elle a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et qui ne mentionnait rien quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat psychologique de Mme Lipp. Dans ce rapport, la Dr Koz n'a rien relev\u00e9 dans l'ARM produit par le Dr Van Heerden qui l'aurait amen\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre en doute la d\u00e9claration du m\u00e9decin selon laquelle Mme Lipp \u00e9tait psychologiquement apte \u00e0 retourner travailler.\n[227] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la principale raison pour laquelle Postes Canada avait dout\u00e9 de la validit\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tait que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait appris d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre que Mme Lipp avait besoin de retourner travailler, et ce, pour des raisons financi\u00e8res; les prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 qu'elle recevait de la Sun Life avaient pris fin. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi cela l'amenait \u00e0 douter de l'aptitude de Mme Lipp \u00e0 retourner au travail, M. Hippe a r\u00e9pondu qu'il croyait qu'elle retournait au travail parce qu'elle \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e et non pas parce qu'elle \u00e9tait capable. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait que son \u00e9tat psychologique avait chang\u00e9. Toutefois, je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucune preuve qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en la possession de Postes Canada au moment o\u00f9 Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de retour au travail qui appuierait cette d\u00e9claration.\n[228] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu, compte tenu de la preuve dont je suis saisi, qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que Postes Canada exige que Mme Lipp subisse un examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant afin de l'accommoder de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire dans le cadre de son poste de commis des postes. N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame si je devais conclure que cette mesure \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, cela ne mettrait pas fin \u00e0 l'analyse. Je serais toujours tenu d'examiner si Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de ne pas r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions et d'exiger que celle-ci se rende \u00e0 Winnipeg pour subir l'EMI. Par cons\u00e9quent, je vais proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'analyse comme s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que Postes Canada exige la tenue d'un examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant.\n(ii) \u00c9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire d'exiger la tenue d'un EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e0 propos des restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp?\n[229] En plus de l'examen psychiatrique ind\u00e9pendant, Mme Lipp devait subir un EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois afin que celui-ci \u00e9value ses restrictions physiques. M. Hippe et M. Slater ont tous les deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que l'exigence de la tenue d'un EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la divergence entre l'EAPT et l'ARM produits par le Dr Van Heerden. Bien qu'il ne soit pas clair pour moi, compte tenu de la preuve, que la tenue d'un EMI \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin que l'on puisse clarifier cette divergence, je suis dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'il est toujours n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI afin que l'on clarifie ses restrictions physiques quant au poste \u00e0 temps plein de commis des postes.\n[230] M. Slater a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que cette exigence constituait toujours une question en litige pour Postes Canada \u00e0 la suite du cong\u00e9 de maladie de Mme Lipp. \u00c0 l'automne 2001, Mme Lipp \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cong\u00e9 depuis un certain temps et Postes Canada \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein et quant \u00e0 la nature exacte de ses restrictions. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs que j'ai invoqu\u00e9s dans la partie pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, laquelle traite de l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI, je conclus que la tenue d'un EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois afin que l'on clarifie les restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp est toujours n\u00e9cessaire.\n(iii) \u00c9tait-il raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire que l'on ne r\u00e9int\u00e8gre pas Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions tant qu'elle n'aurait pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats des EMI?\n[231] Bien que l'exigence que Mme Lipp subisse un EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois ainsi qu'un EMI avec un psychiatre \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, la question \u00e9vidente qui se pose est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que l'on ne r\u00e9int\u00e8gre pas Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions tant qu'elle n'aurait pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats de ces EMI. Compte tenu que, avant que Mme Lipp ne parte en cong\u00e9 pour cause de stress, Postes Canada \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 accommoder Mme Lipp quant au poste \u00e0 temps plein sans d'abord d\u00e9tenir les r\u00e9sultats des EMI, Postes Canada doit maintenant d\u00e9montrer quels facteurs avaient chang\u00e9 pour justifier que l'on ne r\u00e9int\u00e8gre pas Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions \u00e0 l'automne 2001.\n[232] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz lui avait dit que Mme Lipp ne devrait pas rentrer au travail tant qu'elle n'aurait pas subi les EMI et qu'elle n'aurait pas fourni les r\u00e9sultats au Dr Koz. Malheureusement, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la Dr Koz n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Personne d'autre n'a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant aux questions relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 ou aux co\u00fbts qui pourraient \u00eatre occasionn\u00e9s si Mme Lipp \u00e9tait r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans son emploi \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es qu'elle a occup\u00e9 entre octobre 2000 et avril 2001.\n[233] Par cons\u00e9quent, on n'a soumis aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi Mme Lipp ne devrait pas travailler en attendant que des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires soient recueillis. Mme Lipp posait-elle un risque particulier en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour elle-m\u00eame ou pour les autres personnes autour d'elle, un risque tel qu'on ne pouvait pas lui permettre de retourner au travail? Dans l'affirmative, pourquoi est-ce que ce fut le cas en octobre 2001, mais pas en octobre 2000, alors que Mme Lipp fut affect\u00e9e au poste \u00e0 temps plein malgr\u00e9 le fait que Medisys ne d\u00e9tenait aucun r\u00e9sultat d'EMI? Ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9es en suspens durant l'audience. Toutefois, les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 ces questions \u00e9taient essentielles quant \u00e0 la conclusion de savoir si la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de Mme Lipp dans son poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es en attendant que les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis imposeraient une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[234] M. Hippe a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que, comme le conflit en milieu de travail avec M. Slater n'\u00e9tait pas encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9, il \u00e9tait risqu\u00e9 que Mme Lipp retourne au travail. Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, M. Hippe a avou\u00e9 que Postes Canada estimait que cela ne constituait pas un obstacle au retour au travail de Mme Lipp. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le processus de r\u00e8glement des conflits aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris d\u00e8s que Mme Lipp aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de retour au travail. Toutefois, bien que le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate du 10 juillet 2001, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 pendant que Mme Lipp \u00e9tait encore en cong\u00e9 de maladie, mentionnait que le processus de r\u00e8glement des conflits devrait \u00eatre entrepris, rien dans le Rapport d'enqu\u00eate du 30 octobre 2001, alors que Mme Lipp voulait retourner au travail, n'indiquait qu'on avait toujours besoin de r\u00e9gler le conflit.\n[235] En fait, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Mme Lipp ne d\u00e9sirait pas rencontrer Postes Canada \u00e0 son retour au travail afin de discuter du conflit qu'elle avait eu avec M. Slater. Au lieu de cela, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son syndicat, elle a demand\u00e9 que M. Slater se tienne \u00e0 au moins 10 pieds d'elle et qu'il ne communique avec elle que par l'interm\u00e9diaire du chef d'\u00e9quipe.\n[236] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les besoins op\u00e9rationnels du Centre \u00e9taient tels qu'exiger que M. Slater ne communique avec Mme Lipp que par l'interm\u00e9diaire du chef d'\u00e9quipe occasionnerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Postes Canada. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il y aurait une urgence et que le chef d'\u00e9quipe ne se trouverait pas dans l'immeuble, il faudrait que M. Slater puisse \u00eatre capable de communiquer avec Mme Lipp.\n[237] M. Jeworski a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada ce qui, selon lui, constituerait une solution raisonnable au conflit en milieu de travail qui avait entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9part de Mme Lipp en cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 au stress. Il savait que la solution voulant que M. Slater se tienne \u00e0 une distance d'au moins 10 pieds de Mme Lipp \u00e9tait irr\u00e9alisable. M. Jeworski a toutefois affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, pour l'essentiel, l'objectif de r\u00e8glement du conflit et l'objectif de retour au travail r\u00e9ussi de Mme Lipp pouvaient \u00eatre atteints tout simplement en suivant la cha\u00eene de commandement habituel qui existait au Centre de traitement du courrier. Dans le cours normal des choses, la plus grande partie des communications dans la salle de travail se font entre le superviseur et l'employ\u00e9. Les directeurs comme M. Slater n'entrent en jeu que lorsque le superviseur ne se trouve pas dans l'immeuble ou qu'il est en pause ou que lorsque quelque chose d'exceptionnel se produit.\n[238] M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait fait une proposition \u00e0 Postes Canada qui, selon lui, constituait un compromis raisonnable. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait accept\u00e9 la proposition. Selon la proposition, on permettrait \u00e0 Mme Lipp de retourner au travail \u00e0 la condition qu'elle soit toujours tenue de se soumettre aux EMI. On s'efforcerait de trouver des m\u00e9decins qui se trouvent \u00e0 Regina ou pr\u00e8s de Regina, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi Postes Canada attendrait jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la grossesse de Mme Lipp soit termin\u00e9e. On suivrait les voies de communication normales qui existent dans le Centre; M. Slater ferait de son mieux pour ne pas empirer la situation avec Mme Lipp.\n[239] M. Jeworski croyait que ce plan fonctionnerait parce que, normalement, les employeurs ont h\u00e2te que les employ\u00e9s retournent au travail. De plus, il ne s'agissait pas l\u00e0 d'une proposition radicale; le syndicat ne cherchait pas \u00e0 faire renvoyer M. Slater ou \u00e0 le faire muter dans une autre section. Mme Lipp ne cherchait pas \u00e0 se soustraire aux EMI. Postes Canada avait toutefois fix\u00e9 une limite et n'a pas accept\u00e9 la proposition. M. Jeworski a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, quant \u00e0 Postes Canada [traduction] les EMI devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 avant le retour au travail.\n[240] J'estime que la proposition de M. Jeworski \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable. Postes Canada n'a produit aucun t\u00e9moignage quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle elle avait rejet\u00e9 la proposition. De plus, rien n'indiquait qu'une telle proposition aurait occasionn\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour Postes Canada.\n[241] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Postes Canada n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire de ne pas r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions tant que les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis.\n(iv) \u00c9tait-il raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire d'exiger que les EMI soient effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 Winnipeg?\n[242] Si on pr\u00e9sume que la tenue de l'EMI avec un psychiatrique et que la tenue de l'EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e9taient raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaires, la question qui se pose est donc de savoir s'il \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire d'exiger que Mme Lipp subisse ces examens \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[243] Une fois de plus, l'intim\u00e9e invoque la d\u00e9cision rendue par l'arbitre, lequel a entendu et semble avoir accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Koz selon lequel elle avait de bonnes raisons d'avoir perdu confiance en le Dr Fink. Ces raisons n'\u00e9taient pas mentionn\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre. L'arbitre semble donc avoir accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il n'y avait aucun sp\u00e9cialiste \u00e0 Regina qui pouvait effectuer l'un ou l'autre EMI. On m'a exhort\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter ces conclusions plut\u00f4t que le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Koz sur ces points et \u00e0 conclure, par cons\u00e9quent, que Postes Canada n'avait pas d'autre choix que d'envoyer Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[244] J'ai certaines r\u00e9serves \u00e0 propos de la conclusion susmentionn\u00e9e. Premi\u00e8rement, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision sur la question de la chose jug\u00e9e, il semble que les questions en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues lors de l'arbitrage, ni examin\u00e9es par l'arbitre dans sa d\u00e9cision. De plus, l'avocate de Mme Lipp n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience; seuls le syndicat et Postes Canada avaient qualit\u00e9 pour agir. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'avocate de Mme Lipp n'a pas eu l'occasion de poser au Dr Koz des questions fond\u00e9es sur une analyse de l'affaire fond\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne. Par exemple, elle n'a pas eu l'occasion d'examiner la nature de la difficult\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9ment occasionn\u00e9e par l'exigence que les EMI aient lieu \u00e0 Regina ou dans les environs de Regina.\n[245] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le billet \u00e9manant du m\u00e9decin de Mme Lipp mentionnant qu'un autre m\u00e9decin, le Dr Alport, \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer au moins l'un des EMI \u00e0 Regina a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Il ne ressort pas clairement de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre si cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve \u00e0 l'audience et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Dr Koz. Toutefois, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve est pertinent \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il existait des solutions de rechange raisonnables \u00e0 l'exigence voulant que l' EMI concernant les restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp soit effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 Winnipeg. Compte tenu que la Dr Koz n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, on n'a donc pas eu l'occasion de demander au Dr Koz si elle avait examin\u00e9 cette solution ou d'autres solutions.\n[246] Enfin, m\u00eame si l'on accepte qu'il n'y avait personne \u00e0 Regina qui pouvait effectuer l'EMI quant aux restrictions physiques de Mme Lipp, la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre ne traite d'aucun t\u00e9moignage de la part du Dr Koz quant \u00e0 savoir s'il n'y avait pas une personne \u00e0 Regina qui pouvait effectuer l'EMI portant sur les questions d'ordre psychiatrique.\n[247] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision rendue par l'arbitre quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que Mme Lipp subisse les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg n'est pas applicable en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nPostes Canada a-t-elle tent\u00e9 de trouver et d'examiner des solutions autres que la solution qui consiste \u00e0 envoyer Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg?\n[248] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz lui avait dit qu'elle ne connaissait aucun m\u00e9decin en Saskatchewan qui effectuait des EMI. Toutefois, M. Hippe a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon lui, il y avait peut-\u00eatre un ou deux m\u00e9decins dans la province qui effectuaient des EMI. De plus, Postes Canada avait en sa possession un billet, dat\u00e9 du 16 novembre 2001, \u00e9manant du Dr Van Heerden, qui laissait entendre qu'un m\u00e9decin, le Dr Alport, pourrait peut-\u00eatre effectuer l'EMI portant sur les restrictions physiques. Rien n'indiquait que M. Hippe avait examin\u00e9 ces possibilit\u00e9s ou avait demand\u00e9 que la Dr Koz fasse les enqu\u00eates appropri\u00e9es. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, comme la Dr Koz \u00e9tait originaire de Winnipeg, elle avait \u00e9tabli des relations avec des m\u00e9decins de cette ville qui pouvaient effectuer les IME. M. Hippe a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il acceptait la d\u00e9claration du Dr Koz selon laquelle les EMI devraient \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[249] De m\u00eame, on n'a soumis aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve concernant les efforts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits afin de savoir s'il y avait des m\u00e9decins \u00e0 Regina qui \u00e9taient capables d'effectuer l'EMI portant sur les questions d'ordre psychiatrique. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que Postes Canada a s\u00e9rieusement tent\u00e9 de savoir s'il y avait d'autres m\u00e9decins \u00e0 Regina ou en Saskatchewan qui auraient pu effectuer les EMI.\nLe fait d'accommoder Mme Lipp aurait-il impos\u00e9 une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Postes Canada?\n[250] Bien que j'aie conclu que de nombreuses solutions de rechange quant \u00e0 l'accommodement de Mme Lipp n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es par Postes Canada, le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit qu'un employeur peut n\u00e9anmoins justifier une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable quant \u00e0 une personne en d\u00e9montrant que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la personne lui imposeraient une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[251] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, \u00e0 un certain moment, le syndicat a mentionn\u00e9 qu'une fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Lipp en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9placement serait que Postes Canada fassent venir les m\u00e9decins de Winnipeg \u00e0 Regina afin que ceux-ci rencontrent Mme Lipp. Mme Woodfield a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Hippe lui avait cat\u00e9goriquement affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les co\u00fbts de ces d\u00e9placements.\n[252] \u00c0 l'audience, toutefois, il incombait \u00e0 Postes Canada d'\u00e9tablir, au moyen d'une preuve qui \u00e9tait plus qu'une preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ou une preuve conjecturale, que les co\u00fbts engag\u00e9s afin de faire venir les sp\u00e9cialistes de Winnipeg en avion imposeraient \u00e0 Postes Canada une contrainte excessive. Aucune preuve en ce sens n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\n[253] De m\u00eame, en d\u00e9cembre 2001, le syndicat a propos\u00e9 que Postes Canada accepte le rapport d'EMI du Dr Fink plut\u00f4t que le rapport d'EMI d'un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e0 Winnipeg. Postes Canada a r\u00e9pondu que comme c'\u00e9tait le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Lipp qui avait envoy\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re voir le Dr Fink, le rapport de ce dernier n'\u00e9tait plus consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un rapport d'EMI. M. Hippe a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Dr Koz avait \u00e9galement perdu confiance dans le Dr Fink et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le rapport de ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas acceptable. Toutefois, M. Hippe n'a pas pu affirmer pourquoi la Dr Koz avait perdu confiance dans le Dr Fink et quelles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences de l'acceptation du rapport pour Postes Canada.\n[254] Encore une fois, en l'absence de preuve quant au genre de contrainte qu'imposerait \u00e0 Postes Canada le simple fait d'accepter les recommandations du Dr Fink plut\u00f4t que d'envoyer Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg, on se retrouve avec un certain nombre de questions sans r\u00e9ponse qui sont essentielles \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce stade du crit\u00e8re de l'EPJ. Le fait de suivre les recommandations du Dr Fink aurait-il engendr\u00e9 un risque inacceptable en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour Mme Lipp ou pour ses coll\u00e8gues de travail? Cela aurait-il occasionn\u00e9 des co\u00fbts impossibles \u00e0 g\u00e9rer pour Postes Canada? Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne traitait de ces questions.\n[255] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que Postes Canada n'a pas \u00e9tabli que le fait que Mme Lipp ne subisse pas les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg aurait pour cons\u00e9quence de lui imposer une contrainte excessive.\nMme Lipp a-t-elle refus\u00e9 une solution raisonnable quant \u00e0 la question de l'accommodement?\n[256] Les cours de justice ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 ne peut pas refuser un accommodement raisonnable pour le motif que la solution de rechange qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re n'imposera pas une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l'employeur (Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l'Environnement 2003 CAF 133, paragraphe 77). Par cons\u00e9quent, s'il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Mme Lipp a refus\u00e9 un accommodement raisonnable qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert par Postes Canada, alors il n'importe pas que Postes Canada ait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les solutions de rechange susmentionn\u00e9es lui auraient impos\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[257] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait fait des efforts consid\u00e9rables afin de trouver un accommodement quant \u00e0 la crainte qu'avait Mme Lipp d'avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait fait un certain nombre d'offres visant \u00e0 encourager Mme Lipp \u00e0 accepter de se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg. Par exemple, MmeLipp serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 partir du 7 novembre 2001 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle se soumette aux EMI. De plus, divers moyens de transport pour se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts, notamment l'autobus, l'avion et l'automobile. On lui permettait de se faire accompagner par un repr\u00e9sentant syndical. Enfin, on a laiss\u00e9 entendre que les frais qu'occasionnerait la pr\u00e9sence du partenaire de Mme Lipp pourraient \u00eatre d\u00e9fray\u00e9s, bien que Mme Lipp ait affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e quant \u00e0 cette solution de rechange.\n[258] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu que ces efforts visant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Lipp \u00e9taient raisonnables et que rien de plus n'\u00e9tait exig\u00e9. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Les solutions de rechange qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes par Postes Canada ne r\u00e9pondaient pas \u00e0 la crainte qu'avait Mme Lipp de voyager en raison de sa grossesse.\n[259] M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il savait que Mme Lipp avait eu des probl\u00e8mes lors de grossesses ant\u00e9rieures et qu'elle avait pu subir des fausses couches dans le pass\u00e9. Il savait qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par sa grossesse et que, en cons\u00e9quence, elle ne voulait pas voyager. M. Hippe a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9galement pu \u00eatre en possession d'un certain nombre de renseignements indiquant que Mme Lipp souffrait de crampes ut\u00e9rines. Toutefois, il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'il avait parl\u00e9 avec la Dr Koz, celle-ci lui avait dit que les crampes ut\u00e9rines faisaient partie du processus normal des grossesses. Sur la foi de cette d\u00e9claration du Dr Koz, M. Hippe a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que Mme Lipp devrait \u00eatre capable de se rendre \u00e0 Winnipeg.\n[260] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a soulign\u00e9 l'importance de la prise en compte des besoins individuels de la personne qui demande un accommodement (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 62). Les g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations s'appliquant aux grossesses normales ne peuvent donc pas servir de fondement \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de ne fournir aucun accommodement \u00e0 une personne quant \u00e0 ses besoins particuliers. Alors que l'opinion du Dr Koz \u00e9tait un facteur dont on devait tenir compte en \u00e9valuant les besoins de Mme Lipp en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, elle n'est qu'un facteur parmi d'autres dont on aurait d\u00fb tenir compte.\n[261] Mme Lipp \u00e9tait certainement tenue d'informer Postes Canada des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de sa grossesse (Desormeaux c. O.C. Transpo 2003 TCDP 2, paragraphe 110, conf. par 2005 CAF 311). La preuve a \u00e9tabli que c'est ce qu'elle a fait.\n[262] De plus, m\u00eame sans prendre en compte la grossesse de Mme Lipp, je conclus que les offres d'accommodement faites par Postes Canada n'\u00e9taient pas raisonnables. Selon moi, l'exigence que Mme Lipp se rende \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la province afin de subir un EMI de deux jours n'aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre impos\u00e9e qu'en dernier recours. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une lourde obligation \u00e0 laquelle Mme Lipp devait se conformer parce qu'elle \u00e9tait une travailleuse ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada \u00e9tait tenue d'examiner \u00e0 fond toutes les solutions de rechange possibles avant d'envoyer Mme Lipp \u00e0 Winnipeg afin de subir les EMI. La preuve indique que Postes Canada ne l'a pas fait.\n[263] Compte tenu de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, je conclus que l'offre d'accommodement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Mme Lipp en ce qui a trait au voyage \u00e0 Winnipeg n'\u00e9tait pas une offre raisonnable.\n(4) Les conclusions du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation no 4 [264] Pour l'ensemble des motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que Postes Canada n'a pas \u00e9tabli que l'exigence que Mme Lipp se soumette \u00e0 deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg avant de pouvoir retourner au travail \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le refus de Postes Canada de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions tant qu'elle ne se serait pas soumise aux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience (r\u00e9elle et apparente) et le sexe.\nB. L'ALL\u00c9GATION NO 5 - L'imposition d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde (1) La preuve prima facie [265] Si Mme Lipp n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enceinte et n'avait eu aucune d\u00e9ficience, elle n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e dans une situation o\u00f9 elle devait choisir entre faire l'objet d'une mesure disciplinaire et mettre en p\u00e9ril la sant\u00e9 de son foetus. Pour ce motif, je conclus qu'une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n(2) L'explication de l'intim\u00e9e [266] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle avait impos\u00e9 la mesure disciplinaire susmentionn\u00e9e pour des motifs non discriminatoires, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle avait impos\u00e9 une mesure disciplinaire \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e pour cause d'insubordination. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, Postes Canada s'est fond\u00e9e sur le raisonnement de l'arbitre qui a jug\u00e9 que Mme Lipp avait fait le choix tactique de ne pas aller subir les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg. L'attitude provocante de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard justifiait l'imposition d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde.\n[267] La question dont je suis saisi ne consiste pas, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans l'arbitrage, \u00e0 savoir si Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'imposer une suspension disciplinaire sans solde \u00e0 Mme Lipp. La question \u00e0 laquelle je dois r\u00e9pondre est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si Postes Canada a \u00e9tabli, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve, que le statut de femme enceinte et de travailleuse ayant une d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp n'a pas constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de lui imposer une suspension disciplinaire sans solde ou que la mesure disciplinaire constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Postes Canada n'a pas soulev\u00e9 ce dernier argument. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne traiterai pas de cette question.\n[268] Postes Canada n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve contredisant le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp selon lequel son refus d'aller subir les EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg ne constituait aucunement de l'insubordination; il s'agissait plut\u00f4t d'une d\u00e9cision principalement fond\u00e9e sur l'inqui\u00e9tude qu'elle avait quant \u00e0 l'effet que le voyage pourrait avoir sur sa grossesse. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 subir les EMI, mais qu'elle ne pouvait pas quitter la ville afin de les subir. Elle a fait part de son probl\u00e8me \u00e0 Postes Canada et elle lui a remis un billet du m\u00e9decin qui prouvait le bien-fond\u00e9 de cette pr\u00e9occupation. M. Hippe savait que Mme Lipp avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 certaines difficult\u00e9s avec ses grossesses dans le pass\u00e9 et il savait que celle-ci avait peur de voyager car elle craignait que cela nuise \u00e0 sa grossesse, mais il a plut\u00f4t choisi de suivre la d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que lui avait faite la Dr Koz selon laquelle il \u00e9tait normal qu'une femme souffre de crampes ut\u00e9rines durant le deuxi\u00e8me trimestre d'une grossesse. Postes Canada n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 l'appui de ce qui semblait \u00eatre un argument voulant que l'inqui\u00e9tude de Mme Lipp en rapport avec sa grossesse n'\u00e9tait tout simplement qu'une excuse pour ne pas se subir l'EMI.\n[269] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp quant \u00e0 ses inqui\u00e9tudes en rapport avec sa grossesse et compte tenu que celle-ci a fait part de ces inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 Postes Canada, je conclus que l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le refus de Mme Lipp de subir les EMI constituait de l'insubordination et que pour cette raison elle a \u00e0 juste titre fait l'objet d'une mesure disciplinaire ne constituait pas une explication raisonnable justifiant la conduite de Postes Canada.\n(3) La conclusion du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation no 5 [270] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que l'imposition d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde \u00e0 Mme Lipp constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et sur le sexe de Mme Lipp.\nVIII. QUELLE EST LA CONCLUSION DU TRIBUNAL QUANT \u00c0 LA RESPONSABILIT\u00c9? [271] Lorsque Mme Lipp a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste \u00e0 temps plein offert quant au troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'exiger que celle-ci produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tablissant qu'elle \u00e9tait capable d'accomplir de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire les t\u00e2ches du poste et \u00e9tablissant l'ampleur de ses restrictions compte tenu de sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle elle \u00e9tait maintenant capable de travailler au-del\u00e0 de la limite de 6 heures. Lorsque Postes Canada a affect\u00e9 Mme Lipp au poste, elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'exiger que celle-ci subisse un EMI afin de d\u00e9terminer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme de sa charge de travail.\n[272] Toutefois, la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle Postes Canada a mis en oeuvre les exigences susmentionn\u00e9es \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Les communications r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, n\u00e9gatives et mena\u00e7antes que Postes Canada a entretenues avec Mme Lipp \u00e0 propos de sa d\u00e9ficience et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'elle produise des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[273] L'exigence persistante de Postes Canada que Mme Lipp subisse, \u00e0 l'automne 2001, un EMI en rapport avec ses restrictions physiques, apr\u00e8s sa p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 de maladie, constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Toutefois, le refus de Postes Canada de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son ancien poste \u00e0 t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es tant qu'elle ne se serait pas soumise \u00e0 deux EMI \u00e0 Winnipeg, l'un avec un psychiatre et l'autre avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois, constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et sur le sexe. Enfin, l'imposition d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[274] Postes Canada a re\u00e7u un avis insuffisant que l'all\u00e9gation no 1 allait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e durant l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ai pas tenu compte de cette all\u00e9gation et je l'ai rejet\u00e9e.\nIX. QUELLE EST LA MESURE DE REDRESSEMENT APPROPRI\u00c9E? A. Une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Postes Canada de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions [275] Mme Lipp sollicite une ordonnance, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, enjoignant \u00e0 Postes Canada de la r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans ses fonctions de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein, et ce, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis. Elle d\u00e9clare que sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration devrait \u00eatre progressive et devrait comprendre une orientation quant \u00e0 tout nouveau processus et (ou) toute nouvelle proc\u00e9dure qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9s depuis son d\u00e9part du travail en avril 2001.\n[276] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que lorsque le Tribunal conclut que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, il peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la victime de discrimination, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[277] J'ai conclu que Postes Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Lipp en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et de son sexe lorsqu'elle a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer cette derni\u00e8re dans ses fonctions le 9 octobre 2001. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans ses fonctions de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein sur le troisi\u00e8me quart de travail sous r\u00e9serve des conditions suivantes :\nPostes Canada, en collaboration avec le syndicat, Medisys et Mme Lipp, mettra en oeuvre, le plus t\u00f4t possible, un retour progressif au travail ainsi qu'un programme d'orientation; Le retour au travail se fera en tenant compte des restrictions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies en mars 2000; Lors de son retour au travail, Mme Lipp, en collaboration avec Postes Canada, fixera \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e possible un rendez-vous d'EMI avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois afin d'\u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tat actuel de sa sant\u00e9 et afin de d\u00e9terminer l'ampleur de ses restrictions physiques actuelles; Postes Canada, en collaboration avec Medisys, fixera, dans la mesure du possible, un rendez-vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois \u00e0 Regina, et si cela n'est pas possible, \u00e0 un endroit le plus rapproch\u00e9 possible de Regina. D\u00e8s que les r\u00e9sultats de l'EMI auront \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus, Postes Canada, en collaboration avec le syndicat, Medisys et Mme Lipp, d\u00e9terminera la mesure d'accommodement qu'il convient d'accorder \u00e0 Mme Lipp dans le cadre de sa fonction de commis des postes \u00e0 temps plein.\nB. Une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Postes Canada de mettre fin \u00e0 sa conduite discriminatoire et de s'occuper des facteurs sous-jacents et des effets de cette conduite [278] J'ai conclu que bien que Postes Canada \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'exiger la production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires de la part de Mme Lipp, la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle a fait cette demande \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Des demandes fr\u00e9quentes et n\u00e9gatives de production de renseignements, des questions et des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs formul\u00e9s dans la salle de travail \u00e0 propos des restrictions de travail, des menaces fr\u00e9quentes de prise de mesures disciplinaires accompagnant les demandes de renseignements constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dans laquelle la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp \u00e9tait devenue le centre de l'attention n\u00e9gative de Postes Canada \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[279] Dans le but de r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes, Mme Lipp a sollicit\u00e9 une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 M. Slater de ne pas communiquer directement avec elle, sauf en cas d'urgence. D'apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages fournis par M. Hippe et M. Jeworski, je conclus qu'il ne convient pas de d\u00e9livrer cette ordonnance. En tant que directeur du troisi\u00e8me quart de travail, M. Slater doit pouvoir communiquer avec tous ses employ\u00e9s lorsque cela est n\u00e9cessaire et non pas seulement dans les cas d'urgence. Bien que la proposition de M. Jeworski de suivre la ligne de communication normale, laquelle va du directeur au superviseur et du superviseur \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9, soit une bonne proposition, il faut quelque chose de plus. Il me semble que, ce dont on a besoin en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est d'une mesure de redressement qui portera sur les facteurs d'attitude et de comportement qui, au d\u00e9part, ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la discrimination. Il n'y a pas seulement M. Slater qui a particip\u00e9 aux actes que j'ai jug\u00e9s discriminatoires.\n[280] Selon moi, le traitement inflig\u00e9 par Postes Canada \u00e0 Mme Lipp donne \u00e0 penser que certains membres de la direction au Centre de traitement du courrier \u00e0 Regina croyaient qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'adopter une approche agressive en mati\u00e8re de gestion des employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience comme Mme Lipp. Selon moi, cette m\u00e9thode ne convient pas. Postes Canada est tenue, en tant qu'employeur, en collaboration avec le syndicat et ses employ\u00e9s, de voir \u00e0 ce que le milieu de travail soit exempt de toute discrimination.\n[281] Par cons\u00e9quent, afin de corriger la pratique discriminatoire et afin d'emp\u00eacher qu'elle ne se reproduise, j'ordonne ce qui suit en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) :\nPostes Canada doit mettre fin \u00e0 la conduite qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e discriminatoire en l'esp\u00e8ce, en particulier, en ce qui a trait aux demandes inutiles de production de renseignements \u00e0 propos de la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Lipp, y compris les demandes qui sont accompagn\u00e9es par des menaces injustifi\u00e9es de prise de mesures disciplinaires; En collaboration avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, Postes Canada doit fournir de la formation sur la sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres de la direction de Postes Canada au Centre de traitement du courrier de Regina en rapport avec la gestion et l'accommodement des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience; En collaboration avec Mme Lipp et le syndicat, Postes Canada doit s'engager \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre le conflit entre Mme Lipp et M. Slater et (ou) offrir \u00e0 Mme Lipp les services d'un conseiller, choisi par elle, qui lui prodiguera des conseils d'encouragement pendant une p\u00e9riode de temps raisonnable lors de son retour au travail.\n[282] Rien dans la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ne limite ou ne restreint l'obligation de Mme Lipp de r\u00e9pondre, de fa\u00e7on opportune, \u00e0 la demande de Postes Canada qu'elle fournisse des comptes rendus r\u00e9guliers quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 ou qu'elle informe Postes Canada de tout changement quant \u00e0 ses restrictions ou quant \u00e0 sa situation. De plus, rien dans la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ne limite ou restreint le droit de Postes Canada de demander, en conformit\u00e9 avec la convention collective, la tenue, dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es, d'un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant.\nC. Indemnisation pour perte de salaire [283] C'est au plaignant qu'il incombe d'\u00e9tablir le droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 (O'Connor c. Town Taxi (1987) Ltd., 2000 BCHRT 9, paragraphe 60). Pour \u00e9tablir ce droit, le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'un certain lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l'acte discriminatoire et la pr\u00e9tendue perte (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan (1991), 85 D.L.R. (4th) 473 (C.A.F.)). Afin de s'acquitter de ce fardeau, le plaignant doit simplement prouver qu'il existe une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que l'acte discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 ait caus\u00e9 le dommage pour lequel il demande \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9. La preuve de l'\u00e9tendue de ce dommage est une autre question. Toute incertitude concernant l'\u00e9tendue du dommage doit \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration dans l'\u00e9valuation du montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il convient d'accorder (Chopra c. Sant\u00e9 Canada 2004 TCDP 27; conf. par Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) 2006 CF 9).\n[284] Mme Lipp pr\u00e9tend qu'elle devrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour perte de salaire quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 9 octobre 2001, date \u00e0 laquelle son m\u00e9decin l'a inform\u00e9e qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de retourner au travail, et la date \u00e0 laquelle elle retournera au travail en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance du Tribunal.\n[285] J'ai divis\u00e9 la demande d'indemnisation pour perte de salaire de la plaignante en des p\u00e9riodes de temps distinctes afin de faciliter l'analyse.\n1. 9 octobre 2001 - 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001\n[286] J'ai conclu que le refus de Postes Canada de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer Mme Lipp dans son poste \u00e0 temps plein, le 9 octobre 2001, \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada de verser \u00e0 Mme Lipp tous les salaires et avantages qu'elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir entre le 9 octobre 2001 et le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001, date \u00e0 laquelle elle a fait l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire.\n2. 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001 - 16 mars 2005\n[287] J'ai \u00e9galement conclu que l'imposition, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001, d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Donc, en principe, Postes Canada est tenue de verser \u00e0 Mme Lipp les salaires et les avantages qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s durant la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle elle faisait l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde. Toutefois, la preuve n'est pas claire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9cise durant laquelle cette suspension a eu lieu. Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon elle, m\u00eame au moment de l'audience, elle faisait toujours l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde. Toutefois, la preuve ne montre pas clairement que c'est vraiment le cas. De plus, pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que, sur le plan de la cha\u00eene de causalit\u00e9, vu les faits qui sont survenus, la perte de salaire pour l'ensemble de la p\u00e9riode allant du 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui ne peut donner lieu \u00e0 une indemnisation car elle est trop indirecte.\n[288] Mme Lipp fait l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde depuis le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001 en attendant la r\u00e9ception par Postes Canada des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux exig\u00e9s.\n[289] Le 16 mars 2002, Mme Lipp a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 son premier enfant. Postes Canada a approuv\u00e9 la demande de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 faite par Mme Lipp pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 16 mars 2002 et le 16 mars 2003.\n[290] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a re\u00e7u certains montants de prestation d'assurance-emploi pr\u00e9vus par la loi pour la p\u00e9riode de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Toutefois, elle n'a pas re\u00e7u le plein montant qu'elle aurait re\u00e7u si on lui avait permis de retourner au travail le 9 octobre 2001. De plus, elle n'a pas re\u00e7u, de Postes Canada, la prestation compl\u00e9mentaire pour la p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective.\n[291] Le 7 avril 2003, M. Hippe a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Lipp une lettre mentionnant que son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 avait pris fin et qu'aucune autre demande de cong\u00e9 n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue. La lettre de M. Hippe mentionnait que si Mme Lipp d\u00e9sirait retourner au travail, elle devrait d'abord remplir une EAPT. Si elle ne retournait pas l'EAPT d\u00fbment remplie au plus tard le 21 avril 2003, Postes Canada estimerait qu'elle ne d\u00e9sirait pas ou \u00e9tait incapable d'ex\u00e9cuter ses t\u00e2ches \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[292] Plut\u00f4t que de faire remplir le formulaire et de retourner au travail, Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde, du 16 mars 2003 au 16 mars 2005, deux p\u00e9riodes d'un an de cong\u00e9 sans solde en raison de la r\u00e9installation du conjoint. On a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande. L'article 27.05 de la convention collective lui permettait de faire cela.\n[293] Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son \u00e9poux (avec lequel elle n'\u00e9tait pas encore mari\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque) avait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Weyburn parce qu'il y avait trouv\u00e9 un emploi et, \u00e9galement, parce que le couple voulait acheter une maison plus grande afin d'\u00e9lever leur famille. On ne sait trop quand le mari de Mme Lipp a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Weyburn, mais il semble que ce fut avant le 7 avril 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle Postes Canada a demand\u00e9 que Mme Lipp fasse part de ses intentions quant \u00e0 son retour au travail.\n[294] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle voulait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e quant au salaire qu'elle n'a pas re\u00e7u durant la p\u00e9riode des cong\u00e9s en raison de la r\u00e9installation du conjoint, c'est-\u00e0-dire durant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 16 mars 2003 et le 16 mars 2005. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'aurait demand\u00e9 aucun cong\u00e9 de r\u00e9installation pour d\u00e9m\u00e9nager avec son mari \u00e0 Weyburn si on lui avait permis de retourner au travail en octobre 2001. C'est parce qu'elle n'avait re\u00e7u aucun revenu \u00e0 temps plein depuis octobre 2001 qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de vendre sa maison et son chalet et de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager avec son mari \u00e0 Weyburn. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si on lui avait permis de retourner au travail en octobre 2001, elle n'aurait pas eu \u00e0 vendre sa maison \u00e0 Regina et elle aurait pu demeurer l\u00e0 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que son mari soit de nouveau affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Regina.\n[295] Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa relation avec son mari, lequel \u00e9tait son copain \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait relativement nouvelle et qu'elle h\u00e9sitait \u00e0 emm\u00e9nager avec lui si t\u00f4t dans leur relation. Toutefois, comme elle a fait l'objet d'une suspension sans solde, elle a d\u00fb d\u00e9m\u00e9nager avec son conjoint \u00e0 Weyburn.\n[296] J'estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t contradictoire et peu vraisemblable. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle n'aurait pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Weyburn avec son mari n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes financiers engendr\u00e9s par Postes Canada. Toutefois, elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son mari avait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Weyburn non seulement pour des raisons d'emploi mais \u00e9galement parce que le couple voulait acheter une plus grande maison pour \u00e9lever leur famille. Mme Lipp a de plus affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Weyburn avec son \u00e9poux parce qu'ils allaient avoir un enfant.\n[297] Au vu de cette preuve, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il existait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que, n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de la conduite discriminatoire de Postes Canada, Mme Lipp n'aurait pas demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde un cong\u00e9 sans solde en raison de la r\u00e9installation du conjoint. Je conclus plut\u00f4t, au vu de la preuve, qu'il est fort probable que Mme Lipp aurait demand\u00e9 qu'on lui accorde ce cong\u00e9 en raison de la r\u00e9installation du conjoint peu importe qu'on lui ait permis ou non de retourner au travail en octobre 2001. Dans sa lettre du 7 avril 2003, M. Hippe invitait Mme Lipp \u00e0 retourner au travail. Elle a choisi de ne pas retourner. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Postes Canada n'est tenue de lui verser aucune r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 16 mars 2003 et le 16 mars 2005.\n[298] Toutefois, Postes Canada est tenue de verser \u00e0 Mme Lipp la diff\u00e9rence entre le revenu et les avantages qu'elle aurait re\u00e7us si elle \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e au travail le 9 octobre 2001 et ce qu'elle a vraiment re\u00e7u pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et le 16 mars 2003.\n3. La p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 16 mars 2005 et aujourd'hui\n[299] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, elle et sa famille, sont retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 Regina en mars 2005. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle avait donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 une deuxi\u00e8me fille. Mme Lipp a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle se souvient d'avoir rempli une formule de demande de cong\u00e9 pour obligations familiales. La convention collective pr\u00e9voyait un cong\u00e9 sans solde pour s'occuper des enfants d'\u00e2ge pr\u00e9scolaire. Mme Lipp a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, alors que l'arbitrage \u00e9tait en cours, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qu'elle voulait tout simplement attendre que les questions juridiques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es avant de retourner au travail.\n[300] Postes Canada a pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenue d'indemniser Mme Lipp pour les salaires que celle-ci aurait gagn\u00e9s entre mars 2005 et aujourd'hui parce que, \u00e0 aucun moment durant cette p\u00e9riode, Mme Lipp n'a exprim\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 de retourner au travail ou affirm\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[301] Selon moi, la preuve a \u00e9tabli que Mme Lipp a choisi de ne pas retourner au travail apr\u00e8s mars 2005. Bien qu'elle ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon elle, elle faisait toujours l'objet d'une suspension disciplinaire sans solde, Mme Lipp savait que Postes Canada \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 envisager son retour au travail apr\u00e8s qu'une EAPT eut \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie. Elle a choisi de ne pas faire cela. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que, \u00e0 partir du 16 mars 2005, Mme Lipp a choisi de ne pas retourner au travail parce qu'elle d\u00e9sirait rester \u00e0 la maison et s'occuper de ses enfants, comme en t\u00e9moigne le fait qu'elle a rempli la formule de cong\u00e9 pour obligations familiales ou parce qu'elle voulait attendre que les questions juridiques soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9es avant de retourner au travail ou pour ces deux raisons \u00e0 la fois. Postes Canada ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenue d'indemniser Mme Lipp quant aux salaires et avantages pour une p\u00e9riode durant laquelle celle-ci a choisi de ne pas travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune ordonnance d'indemnisation salariale pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 16 mars 2005 et aujourd'hui ne sera d\u00e9livr\u00e9e.\nLa conclusion quant \u00e0 l'indemnisation pour perte de salaire\n[302] Par cons\u00e9quent, en conclusion, j'ordonne que Postes Canada indemnise Mme Lipp quant \u00e0 aux pertes de salaire, de prestations de maternit\u00e9 et autres avantages qu'elle a subies au cours de la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 9 octobre 2001 et le 16 mars 2003. Bien que j'aie entendu certains t\u00e9moignages concernant les montants qui devraient pris en compte dans le calcul du montant \u00e0 accorder, ceux-ci \u00e9taient incomplets. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis incapable de fixer le montant \u00e0 accorder. Les parties sont encourag\u00e9es \u00e0 conclure une entente sur cette question. Le calcul des montants dus devrait tenir compte des avantages pr\u00e9vus par la loi, des paiements d'assurance et de toute autre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pertinente re\u00e7us au cours de la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 9 octobre 2001 et le 16 mars 2003.\n[303] Compte tenu des conclusions susmentionn\u00e9es, je garde comp\u00e9tence quant \u00e0 cet aspect de l'adjudication dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de conclure une entente quant au montant \u00e0 accorder. Les parties doivent informer le Tribunal dans un d\u00e9lai de 60 jours de la r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision si une entente n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue.\nD. Indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral [304] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral. Compte tenu de la preuve qui suit, je conclus que la conduite discriminatoire de Postes Canada a occasionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp beaucoup de douleur et beaucoup de souffrances.\n[305] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'elle a arr\u00eat\u00e9 de travailler en avril 2001, elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s perturb\u00e9e. Mme McCarron, la psychologue qui a trait\u00e9 Mme Lipp, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsque Mme Lipp s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 son bureau, elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir, elle avait des id\u00e9es suicidaires, elle faisait des cauchemars, elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se concentrer et elle avait tr\u00e8s peur et se sentait tr\u00e8s seule.\n[306] Mme McCarron a mesur\u00e9 le degr\u00e9 d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression dont souffrait Mme Lipp en se servant de l'inventaire d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 de Burns et de l'inventaire de d\u00e9pression de Beck. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Lipp a obtenu un r\u00e9sultat \u00e9lev\u00e9 quant au degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9pression et qu'elle \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement anxieuse. Mme McCarron a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Lipp souffrait de crises de panique lorsque les discussions tenues durant les s\u00e9ances de consultation avaient trait au milieu de travail.\n[307] Le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Lipp a \u00e9mis un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression majeure et de troubles anxieux puis a mentionn\u00e9 que le conflit en milieu de travail \u00e9tait un facteur qui emp\u00eacherait Mme Lipp de se r\u00e9tablir. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le simple fait de parler du milieu de travail avait pour effet de rendre Mme Lipp davantage anxieuse.\n[308] Mme Lipp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 l'exception de l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 sur le quart de nuit, c'est-\u00e0-dire de janvier 2001 \u00e0 mars 2001, elle \u00e9tait toujours stress\u00e9e au travail. Elle s'est sentie humili\u00e9e par les questions et les commentaires concernant sa d\u00e9ficience et par les demandes incessantes de production de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, Mme Lipp a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 l'automne 2001, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 absente du travail pendant six mois, elle se sentait beaucoup mieux. Elle \u00e9tait heureuse et elle avait h\u00e2te de retourner au travail. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle ne prenait plus aucun m\u00e9dicament et qu'elle \u00e9tait capable de contr\u00f4ler son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes naturelles de diminution du stress.\n[309] Postes Canada a laiss\u00e9 entendre que les r\u00e9actions de Mme Lipp aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se d\u00e9roulaient dans le milieu de travail \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9es et d\u00e9raisonnables. Toutefois, le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait les t\u00e9moignages de M. Slater et de M. Hippe selon lesquels Mme Lipp n'avait aucune raison d'\u00eatre perturb\u00e9e. Cela ne suffit pas \u00e0 mettre en doute le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Lipp \u00e0 propos de ses souffrances.\n[310] Je conclus que la conduite de Postes Canada a plac\u00e9 Mme Lipp dans un climat de travail extr\u00eamement n\u00e9gatif qui a engendr\u00e9 beaucoup de douleur et beaucoup de souffrances et qui a beaucoup contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa d\u00e9pression ainsi qu'\u00e0 ses troubles anxieux.\n[311] Mme Lipp a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui adjuge un montant de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnisation pour douleur et souffrances. Bien que je souscrive \u00e0 l'opinion que Mme Lipp a beaucoup souffert par suite de la conduite discriminatoire de Postes Canada, l'importance et la dur\u00e9e de ces souffrances ne justifient pas, selon moi, l'adjudication du montant maximum. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9crites, j'ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada de verser \u00e0 Mme Lipp un montant de 12 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnisation pour la douleur et les souffrances qu'elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es.\nE. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale - paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi [312] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 une victime d'un acte discriminatoire une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. L'avocat de Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que la conduite de Postes Canada \u00e9tait incontestablement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, notamment en ce qui a trait au traitement dont Mme Lipp a fait l'objet pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie et lorsqu'elle a tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail \u00e0 l'automne 2001. L'avocat de Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que, \u00e0 ce chapitre, il y a lieu d'ordonner \u00e0 Postes Canada de verser le montant d'indemnisation maximum.\n[313] Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la conduite de Postes Canada \u00e9tait irresponsable. M. Slater et M. Hippe ont tous les deux affirm\u00e9 dans leurs t\u00e9moignages que certains aspects du cas de Mme Lipp auraient dus \u00eatre trait\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente. M. Slater a admis avoir envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Lipp, pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, des lettres qui n'auraient pas d\u00fb lui \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la preuve donne \u00e0 penser que Postes Canada a adopt\u00e9 une approche tr\u00e8s agressive et tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative quant \u00e0 la gestion des restrictions de Mme Lipp et quant \u00e0 la gestion de sa participation aux effectifs. Je conclus que cette gestion a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans \u00e9gard aux cons\u00e9quences qu'elle pourrait avoir sur Mme Lipp.\n[314] Toutefois, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'opinion que la conduite de Postes Canada en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait si flagrante qu'il est justifi\u00e9 d'adjuger le montant maximum permis en vertu de la Loi. Dans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, j'estime qu'il serait appropri\u00e9 d'ordonner le paiement d'un montant de 10 000 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada, en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, de verser \u00e0 Mme Lipp la somme de 10 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnisation.\nF. Lettre d'excuse [315] L'avocat de Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que bien que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans Stevenson c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9) 2003 CFPI 341, ait jug\u00e9 que le Tribunal ne peut pas ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de s'excuser, les intentions et les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la Loi permettent au Tribunal d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre que ses actes ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion de discrimination par le Tribunal. Dans Stevenson, la Cour a jug\u00e9 que bien que le Tribunal, dans cette cause, e\u00fbt tir\u00e9 une conclusion d\u00e9favorable au Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (SCRS), cela ne signifiait pas que le SCRS croyait que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessairement juste ou que le SCRS avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Stevenson. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de contrainte et de sanction dans le fait d'ordonner la pr\u00e9sentation d'excuses. Elle a par cons\u00e9quent jug\u00e9 que le pouvoir d'ordonner que des lettres d'excuses soient remises \u00e0 un plaignant qui a eu gain de cause doit \u00eatre soi express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi, soi conf\u00e9r\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on n\u00e9cessairement implicite (un pouvoir inh\u00e9rent).\n[316] Selon moi, il existe \u00e9galement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de contrainte dans le fait de demander \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de remettre \u00e0 Mme Lipp une lettre reconnaissant que ses actes ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion de discrimination par le Tribunal. D'apr\u00e8s le raisonnement de la Cour dans Stevenson, je conclus que je ne suis pas habilit\u00e9 par la Loi \u00e0 ordonner que l'intim\u00e9 produise une telle lettre.\nG. Les d\u00e9pens [317] Mme Lipp a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e sur la base avocat-client pour les frais juridiques qu'elle a engag\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite du pr\u00e9sent conflit. Dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que la jurisprudence penchait en faveur du pouvoir du Tribunal d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi (Mowat c. Forces Arm\u00e9es Canadiennes 2006 TCDP 49, paragraphe 27). Je souscris \u00e0 l'opinion que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens.\n[318] Je ne suis toutefois pas d'avis que le Tribunal est autoris\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 adjuger des d\u00e9pens sur la base avocat-client. La jurisprudence donne plut\u00f4t \u00e0 penser que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer les d\u00e9pens raisonnables au titre des honoraires d'avocat. Dans Stevenson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a repris \u00e0 son compte les propos tenus par la Cour dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Thwaites [1994] 3 C.F. 38 (C.F.P.I.), en mentionnant que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme accordant au Tribunal le pouvoir d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens raisonnables au titre des honoraires d'avocat. La d\u00e9cision Stevenson traitait d'une adjudication de d\u00e9pens encourus avant le renvoi d'une plainte au Tribunal. Dans Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Brooks, 2006 CF 500, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Stevenson \u00e0 l'adjudication de d\u00e9pens encourus pour la repr\u00e9sentation par avocat en cours, y compris la repr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 l'audience devant le Tribunal.\n[319] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que Postes Canada paye \u00e0 Mme Lipp les d\u00e9pens raisonnables qu'elle a engag\u00e9s pour retenir les services d'une avocate, avant et pendant l'audience, en rapport avec sa plainte de pr\u00e9tendues pratiques discriminatoires, laquelle plainte fut jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[320] L'avocate de Mme Lipp n'a produit aucune preuve quant \u00e0 la question des d\u00e9pens. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis incapable de d\u00e9livrer une ordonnance en rapport avec le montant de cette adjudication. Nous encourageons toutefois les parties \u00e0 conclure une entente quant au montant des d\u00e9pens raisonnables dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je garde comp\u00e9tence quant \u00e0 cet aspect de l'adjudication dans le cas o\u00f9 les parties n'arriveraient pas \u00e0 conclure une entente. Les parties doivent aviser le Tribunal dans les 60 jours de la r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision si aucune entente n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue.\nH. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [321] En vertu du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables en rapport avec toute adjudication faite dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'indemnisation pour perte de salaires et avantages courent \u00e0 partir du point milieu entre le 9 octobre 2001 et le 16 mars 2003. Quant \u00e0 l'indemnisation pour souffrances et douleur et quant \u00e0 l'indemnisation pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3), les int\u00e9r\u00eats courent \u00e0 compter de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. En aucun cas, le montant total payable en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne doit d\u00e9passer 20 000 $. De m\u00eame, le montant total payable en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne doit pas d\u00e9passer 20 000 $.\nKaren A.

L'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 au Tribunal qu'il avait pris la d\u00e9cision de ne pas appeler le Dr Lachance comme t\u00e9moin, et ce, pour des raisons d'ordre m\u00e9dical. L'intim\u00e9 veut toutefois d\u00e9poser en preuve le certificat m\u00e9dical sign\u00e9 par la Dre Bailliu.\n[2] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 4 avril 2007, le plaignant demande la divulgation de certains documents qui, selon lui, sont pertinents au t\u00e9moignage de la Dre Bailliu et demande \u00e9galement la divulgation de renseignements par voie de pr\u00e9cisions.\n[3] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 que l'objet d'une requ\u00eate en divulgation est de fournir au requ\u00e9rant des documents qui, selon lui, sont pertinents et non pas de lui fournir des renseignements au moyen de pr\u00e9cisions.\n[4] \u00c0 l'audience, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 divulguer un certain nombre des documents demand\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 ceux-ci ont trait au certificat m\u00e9dical rempli par la Dre Bailliu le 14 septembre 2006.\n[5] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 fournir le curriculum vitae de la Dre Bailliu, le dossier m\u00e9dical du Dr Lachance ainsi que des documents se rapportant au dossier m\u00e9dical du Dr Lachance, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ceux-ci ont trait au certificat m\u00e9dical rempli par la Dre Bailliu le 14 septembre 2006.\n[6] La question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce a trait \u00e0 la comparution de la Dre Bailliu comme t\u00e9moin dans le cadre de la production d'un certificat m\u00e9dical qu'elle a sign\u00e9 le 14 septembre 2006 et qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du Dr Lachance.\n[7] \u00c0 ce stade-ci de l'instance, la production du certificat m\u00e9dical de la Dre Bailliu n'est pas en cause. Ce qui est toutefois en cause c'est la divulgation de certains documents qui, selon le plaignant, peuvent \u00eatre pertinents quant au t\u00e9moignage de la Dre Bailliu advenant le cas o\u00f9 celle-ci serait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[8] Le Tribunal conclut que le curriculum vitae de la Dre Bailliu, le dossier m\u00e9dical du Dr Lachance que celle-ci a en sa possession ainsi que tous les documents li\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation du Dr Lachance peuvent \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage.\n[9] Le Tribunal ordonne donc que l'intim\u00e9 se conforme \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant quant \u00e0 la divulgation des documents mentionn\u00e9s aux sous-alin\u00e9as (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) de la requ\u00eate du plaignant, c'est-\u00e0-dire la divulgation du curriculum vitae de la Dre Bailliu, du dossier m\u00e9dical du Dr Lachance, tout compte d'honoraires professionnels, et ce, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces documents ont trait au certificat m\u00e9dical rempli par la Dre Bailliu le 14 septembre 2006, sous r\u00e9serve du privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l'avocat ou du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[10] Le Tribunal est d'opinion que les documents ou les pr\u00e9cisions mentionn\u00e9s aux sous-alin\u00e9as (viii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii) de la requ\u00eate du plaignant ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents, compte tenu de la nature du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 t\u00e9moignage de la Dre Bailliu. Le plaignant n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les documents ou les renseignements mentionn\u00e9s dans ces sous-alin\u00e9as ont trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation faite par la Dre Bailliu, en date du 14 septembre 2006, de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du Dr Lachance.\n[11] L'avocat du plaignant pourra toujours, si la Dre Bailliu est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, contre-interroger cette derni\u00e8re quant \u00e0 savoir sur quels renseignements ou sur quels documents elle s'est fi\u00e9e lorsqu'elle a rempli son certificat m\u00e9dical et pourra contester son opinion quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 actuel du Dr Lachance.\n[12] Quant aux renseignements demand\u00e9s aux sous-alin\u00e9as (xiv) et (xv) de la requ\u00eate du plaignant, l'avocat de ce dernier pourra interroger la Dre Bailliu quant \u00e0 ces questions, si celle-ci est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[13] Le Tribunal ordonne que les documents suivants soient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avocat du plaignant :\nLe curriculum vitae actuel de la Dre Bailliu - requ\u00eate, sous-alin\u00e9a a)(i); Le dossier m\u00e9dical du Dr Lachance d\u00e9tenu par la Dre Bailliu, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le certificat m\u00e9dical - Requ\u00eate, sous-alin\u00e9a a)(iii); Les documents, les notes, la correspondance li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation faite par la Dre Bailliu du Dr Lachance dans son certificat m\u00e9dical du 14 septembre 2006 - Requ\u00eate, sous-alin\u00e9as a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vii); Les documents, comme les factures, relatifs \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont la Dre Bailliu a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e pour avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le certificat dat\u00e9 du 14 septembre 2006, ainsi que les documents relatifs \u00e0 son mandat, sous r\u00e9serve du privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l'avocat ou du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige - Requ\u00eate, sous-alin\u00e9as a)(v), (vi);\n[14] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 doit remettre \u00e0 l'avocat du plaignant une copie des documents susmentionn\u00e9s d\u00e8s qu'il aura fini de les examiner.\n[15] L'avocat du plaignant ne doit pas divulguer les documents re\u00e7us ou les renseignements li\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux-ci \u00e0 quiconque, sauf aux employ\u00e9s de son bureau qui sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler directement sur le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[16] L'avocat du plaignant doit retourner \u00e0 l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s si la Dr Bailliu n'est pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 13 avril 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT901\/2104\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nShiv Chopra c.

Martinez par M. Fromm, M. Vigna a soulev\u00e9 une question de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en rapport avec une question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Martinez par M. Fromm quant aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents scolaires de M. Martinez, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment quant \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il a obtenu son baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s arts.\n[2] M. Martinez a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la divulgation de ce renseignement aurait une incidence sur sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il craignait que ce renseignement soit diffus\u00e9 sur le Web et qu'on puisse l'utiliser pour obtenir des renseignements personnels suppl\u00e9mentaires sur lui, lesquels renseignements pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment.\n[3] M. Martinez a notamment mentionn\u00e9 que M. Fromm, dans une \u00e9mission de radio diffus\u00e9e le soir sur le site Web de Stormfront, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de M. Martinez dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[4] Cette question de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a fait place \u00e0 une question plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale portant sur le contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez, plus particuli\u00e8rement sur la question de savoir si oui ou non le contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez devait se d\u00e9rouler \u00e0 huis clos ou faire l'objet d'une interdiction de publication.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties quant aux questions susmentionn\u00e9es, M. Vigna a propos\u00e9 que, afin de traiter la question de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par lui-m\u00eame et par M. Martinez, le Tribunal visionne le DVD qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis \u00e0 M. Vigna par M. Fromm et que M. Fromm avait l'intention d'utiliser au cours du contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez. Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 et a visionn\u00e9 le DVD en question, en pr\u00e9sence de l'ensemble des parties, au cours d'une s\u00e9ance \u00e0 huis clos.\n[6] Le DVD produit en preuve comme pi\u00e8ce V-1 que le Tribunal a visionn\u00e9 comprend des s\u00e9quences de diff\u00e9rents \u00e9v\u00e9nements ayant trait \u00e0 des rassemblements ou \u00e0 des protestations tenus en 2004 par le groupe de M. Fromm (Canadian Association for Free Expression) en appui \u00e0 la remise en libert\u00e9 de Ernst Zundel. Les deux premi\u00e8res parties du DVD ont \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9es par M. Jurgen Neumann. La troisi\u00e8me partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par la CBC et a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9e sur NERVE, un programme de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision de la CBC. Deux autres parties traitent d'autres protestations auxquelles l'ARA (Anti Racist Action) a particip\u00e9.\n[7] M. Fromm a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le DVD a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 et mont\u00e9 par M. Marc Lemire. Au d\u00e9but du DVD, le nom de M. Martinez appara\u00eet. Celui-ci est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un fanatique et un terroriste.\n[8] La partie visionn\u00e9e montre, notamment, M. Fromm qui s'adresse \u00e0 une foule qui manifeste en appui \u00e0 la remise en libert\u00e9 de Ernst Zundel et montre \u00e9galement des opposants \u00e0 la manifestation. On peut voir M. Martinez, dont le visage est en partie couvert, en train de manifester avec le groupe ARA (Anti Racist Action).\n[9] En plus du DVD, M. Vigna a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des extraits tir\u00e9s de diff\u00e9rents sites Web (pi\u00e8ces V-2 \u00e0 V-6).\n[10] La pi\u00e8ce V-2 comprend trois images de M. Martinez. Ces images faisaient partie du DVD visionn\u00e9 par le Tribunal. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9es sur le site Web de Canadian Redwatch.\n[11] En ce qui concerne les pi\u00e8ces V-3 \u00e0 V-6, elles comprennent un certain nombre de messages affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de Stormfront. Certains de ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par M. Fromm. Ils comprennent des propos peu flatteurs \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Martinez. La pi\u00e8ce V-5 comprend une publicit\u00e9 figurant sur un DVD portant sur Shane Ruttle Martinez. M. Martinez y est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un des dirigeants de l'ARA, un communiste et un terroriste. Il y est mentionn\u00e9 que le DVD se vend au co\u00fbt de 20 $.\n[12] Le Tribunal doit trancher la question de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par M. Vigna et M. Martinez au cours du contre-interrogatoire de ce dernier par M. Fromm quant \u00e0 savoir si le contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez devait se d\u00e9rouler \u00e0 huis clos ou si une interdiction de publication devait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e, emp\u00eachant ainsi la diffusion du contenu du contre-interrogatoire sur le Web.\n[13] \u00c0 l'audience, en rapport avec la question que le Tribunal doit trancher, M. Vigna a renvoy\u00e9 au paragraphe 52(1) et aux alin\u00e9as 52(1)c) et d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lesquels sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\nL'instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction s'il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique;\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n[14] Il ressort de la preuve que M. Martinez est un d\u00e9fenseur des droits de la personne membre de l'ARA et qu'il a par le pass\u00e9 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des rassemblements et \u00e0 des protestations organis\u00e9s par des groupes militant en faveur de la libert\u00e9 d'expression en rapport avec Ernst Zundel. La s\u00e9quence visionn\u00e9e par le Tribunal montre que M. Martinez a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements et qu'il ne craignait pas d'afficher publiquement ses opinions.\n[15] Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que M. Martinez a fait l'objet de nombreux messages affich\u00e9s sur des sites Web. Ces messages n'\u00e9taient pas tr\u00e8s flatteurs \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Celui-ci a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9 et qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti avili par le contenu de ces messages. Selon lui, ces messages sont insultants et diffamatoires.\n[16] M. Martinez a toutefois reconnu que, en soi, les messages ne comprenaient aucune menace directe quant \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9, mais il estimait n\u00e9anmoins que sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 serait compromise si son contre-interrogatoire \u00e9tait affich\u00e9 sur le Web, compte tenu des renseignements qui figurent sur lui dans diff\u00e9rents sites Web.\n[17] Le Tribunal estime que les messages affich\u00e9s ne constituent pas une menace directe et imm\u00e9diate \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Martinez de telle sorte que leur existence justifierait une interdiction de publication quant au t\u00e9moignage que rendra M. Martinez au cours du contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par M. Fromm.\n[18] Comme on l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9, le DVD visionn\u00e9 par le Tribunal d\u00e9crit M. Martinez, dans son introduction, comme \u00e9tant un fanatique ainsi qu'un terroriste. Il semble que cela suscite des craintes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Martinez.\n[19] Il convient de pr\u00e9ciser que ce qui est en litige en rapport avec la demande d'interdiction de publication n'est pas la diffusion du DVD mais la publication du t\u00e9moignage que rendra M. Martinez lors du contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par M. Fromm.\n[20] La preuve entendue en rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Martinez a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait part publiquement de ses opinions concernant certains groupes et certaines questions et fait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'objet d'animosit\u00e9 et de ressentiment. L'imposition d'une interdiction de publication du contenu de son contre-interrogatoire ne changera rien \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat de chose.\n[21] Il faut rappeler que les instances en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont publiques et que ce n'est que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles que le Tribunal devrait tenir des s\u00e9ances \u00e0 huis clos ou imposer une interdiction de publication.\n[22] Somme toute, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve produite, le Tribunal conclut que la Commission et M. Martinez n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Martinez serait compromise si une interdiction de publication n'\u00e9tait pas ordonn\u00e9e en rapport avec le t\u00e9moignage qu'il rendra dans le cadre du contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par M. Fromm.\n[23] Il convient de souligner que l'interrogatoire principal de M. Martinez a eu lieu au cours d'une audience publique et qu'il ne fut pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l'audience se tienne \u00e0 huis clos ou qu'une interdiction de publication soit ordonn\u00e9e.\n[24] Cela dit, si au cours du contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez des questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 surgissent, le Tribunal traitera ces derni\u00e8res au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'elles se pr\u00e9senteront et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, rendra des ordonnances afin de voir \u00e0 ce que des renseignements personnels confidentiels ne soient pas diffus\u00e9s si le Tribunal estime que la diffusion de ces renseignements pourrait compromettre de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9rieuse la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Martinez.\n[25] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la demande d'interdiction de publication du t\u00e9moignage que rendra M. Martinez au cours du contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par M. Fromm est rejet\u00e9e.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 12 avril 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1120\/0206\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nCentre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales c. www.bcwhitepride.com\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION SUR REQU\u00caTE DU TRIBUNAL :\nLe 12 avril 2007\nONT COMPARU :\nFo Niemi\nPour le plaignant\nGiacomo Vigna\nPour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\nPaul Fromm\nPour l'intim\u00e9",

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), agissant pour le compte du Service correctionnel du Canada et du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant l'obtention d'une ordonnance portant que l'intitul\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente cause soit modifi\u00e9 et que les parties dressent une liste des personnes qui peuvent retirer un avantage d'une \u00e9ventuelle indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Aucune observation n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant.\nUne ordonnance portant que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soit inscrit comme intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause [3] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral souligne que la pr\u00e9sente cause comporte des all\u00e9gations de discrimination contre un employeur. Dans le contexte de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l'employeur est la Couronne du chef du Canada. Toutefois, en vertu de la pr\u00e9rogative royale, des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires ne peuvent \u00eatre intent\u00e9es contre la Couronne. De plus, les minist\u00e8res ne sont pas des entit\u00e9s juridiques. Ainsi, ni le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, ni le Service correctionnel du Canada ne peuvent \u00eatre constitu\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend que l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 afin de l'inscrire comme intim\u00e9 dans la plainte, comme l'exige le paragraphe 23(1) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l'\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif, L.R.C 1985, ch. C-50. La Commission consent \u00e0 cette demande.\n[4] Le Tribunal a en fait d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une ordonnance comparable dans Plante c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2003 TCDP 28, et j'ai personnellement entendu des causes dans lesquelles il fut ordonn\u00e9 d'apporter des modifications semblables durant le processus de gestion de l'instance (Morin c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, dossier du Tribunal no T739\/4402) et durant l'audience (Maillet c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, dossier du Tribunal no T935\/5504).\n[5] Je ferai donc droit \u00e0 la demande du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. \u00c0 l'avenir, j'esp\u00e8re que ces questions seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par les parties avant le renvoi des plaintes au Tribunal.\nUne ordonnance portant que les parties dresse une liste des personnes qui peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une \u00e9ventuelle indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal [6] Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte que les personnes occupant les postes de chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint au sein du Service correctionnel du Canada font l'objet d'un traitement discriminatoire car il n'y a pas parit\u00e9 salariale pour un travail de valeur \u00e9quivalente. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend qu'il serait utile que l'ensemble des parties ainsi que le Tribunal sachent d'entr\u00e9e de jeu qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera d'une \u00e9ventuelle indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce par le Tribunal. Par exemple, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9clare que, avec ces renseignements, il [traduction] sera plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de comprendre la responsabilit\u00e9 potentielle \u00e0 laquelle il s'expose et recueillera la preuve qu'il d\u00e9sire soumettre. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que si le Tribunal sait quelles sont les personnes qui ont occup\u00e9 les postes et la dur\u00e9e pendant laquelle elles les ont occup\u00e9es, le calcul de l'indemnit\u00e9 potentielle sera simplifi\u00e9.\n[7] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral propose donc que les parties dressent une liste, sur une base continue, des chefs d'\u00e9quipe adjoint qui peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal. La liste comprendrait les noms des personnes qui occupent le poste de chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint depuis 1995 et elle ferait \u00e9tat de la dur\u00e9e pendant laquelle ces personnes ont occup\u00e9 ce poste.\n[8] La Commission, pour sa part, pr\u00e9tend que, lors d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas, l'ensemble des parties ont accept\u00e9 de dresser une telle liste. N\u00e9anmoins, la Commission consent \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de l'ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9.\n[9] J'estime que cette demande est raisonnable et une ordonnance en ce sens est d\u00e9livr\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nUne ordonnance portant que le nom du plaignant soit substitu\u00e9 par les noms des personnes qui ont travaill\u00e9 comme chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint [10] Le formulaire de plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le 30 septembre 2003 par une personne nomm\u00e9e John Wiseman. Au haut du formulaire, sous l'en-t\u00eate Votre nom, les renseignements suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits :\nJohn Wiseman\nVice-pr\u00e9sident r\u00e9gional\nAssociation canadienne des surveillants correctionnels au nom\ndes chefs d'\u00e9quipe adjoint\ndans les p\u00e9nitenciers pour femmes\n[11] Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, la Commission a nomm\u00e9 un enqu\u00eateur pour enqu\u00eater sur la plainte. Dans le rapport d'enqu\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 1er mai 2006, le nom du plaignant est mentionn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant l'Association canadienne des surveillants correctionnels (ACSC). Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2006, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour le pr\u00e9venir que la Commission avait examin\u00e9 la plainte de l'Association canadienne des surveillants correctionnels et avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander que le Tribunal instruise la plainte.\n[12] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral souligne que l'ACSC est une association b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. Comme les chefs d'\u00e9quipe adjoint sont exclus du champ des n\u00e9gociations collectives, l'ACSC n'est pas un agent n\u00e9gociateur qui les repr\u00e9sente. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ajoute que l'ACSC n'est pas incorpor\u00e9e et, pour cette raison, n'est pas une personne morale ni une personne physique. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend, par cons\u00e9quent, que l'ACSC n'a pas la capacit\u00e9 juridique d'agir comme partie dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[13] Selon le paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, un individu ou un groupe d'individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend que le sens ordinaire des mots individu ou groupe d'individus d\u00e9montre que le l\u00e9gislateur pr\u00e9voyait que seuls des individus, agissant seuls ou avec d'autres individus, dans le cadre d'une fin commune, auraient le droit de d\u00e9poser des plaintes. La capacit\u00e9 juridique d'agir comme partie dans une instance n'est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e qu'aux personnes physiques ou personnes cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le l\u00e9gislateur. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e9tend que, comme le sens ordinaire du paragraphe 40(1) confirme que le l\u00e9gislateur ne voulait permettre qu'aux personnes physiques d'agir comme plaignants, une association de volontaires comme l'ACSC ne peut pas agir comme plaignante.\n[14] La Commission adopte un point de vue diff\u00e9rent. Elle pr\u00e9tend que l'ACSC constitue un groupe d'individus au sens du paragraphe 40(1). M\u00eame si, comme le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le pr\u00e9tend, la disposition peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e plus \u00e9troitement comme signifiant que seul un individu ou un groupe compos\u00e9 d'individus identifi\u00e9s peuvent d\u00e9poser des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, cette interpr\u00e9tation contredirait de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente le principe bien \u00e9tabli que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re qui favorise davantage la protection et la promotion des droits de la personne.\n[15] Malheureusement, tout ce d\u00e9bat semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9 et laiss\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce qui est vraiment au cur du litige : la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 30 septembre 2003. Selon moi, la simple lecture de la plainte r\u00e9v\u00e8le que ce n'est pas l'ACSC qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte, mais plut\u00f4t M. Wiseman. Le nom du plaignant mentionn\u00e9 au haut du formulaire est manifestement celui de John Wiseman. Il est peut-\u00eatre le vice-pr\u00e9sident r\u00e9gional de l'ACSC, mais c'est son nom qui figure comme \u00e9tant celui du plaignant.\n[16] Le statut de plaignant de M. Wiseman appara\u00eet clairement ailleurs sur le formulaire de plainte. Seule sa signature figure au bas du formulaire. Rien n'indique que M. Wiseman a sign\u00e9 au nom d'un groupe ou d'un organisme. De plus, la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration de M. Wiseman qui figure au haut du formulaire est ainsi libell\u00e9e : [traduction] J'ai des motifs raisonnables de croire que j'ai fait l'objet de discrimination en cours d'emploi (non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original). Rien dans cette d\u00e9claration ne donne \u00e0 penser que M. Wiseman d\u00e9pose le formulaire de plainte comme repr\u00e9sentant de l'ACSC ou d'un autre groupe.\n[17] De plus, apr\u00e8s que M. Wiseman eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, la Commission a demand\u00e9 et a obtenu, en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 40(2) de la Loi, une confirmation \u00e9crite de la part d'un certain nombre d'individus travaillant comme chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint (c'est-\u00e0-dire les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s victimes de discrimination) selon laquelle ils consentaient au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Les copies de 25 formulaires sign\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9es aux observations de la Commission sur la requ\u00eate. La premi\u00e8re ligne figurant sur 18 de ces formulaires est ainsi libell\u00e9e : [traduction] Je consens \u00e0 ce que John Wiseman ou son rempla\u00e7ant d\u00e9sign\u00e9 agisse pour mon compte \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Sur les sept autres formulaires, le nom ACSC est inscrit apr\u00e8s les mots rempla\u00e7ant d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Manifestement, l'ensemble de ces individus ont nomm\u00e9 M. Wiseman comme repr\u00e9sentant. Ils l'ont \u00e9galement autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9signer un rempla\u00e7ant. Toutefois, d'apr\u00e8s les documents dont je suis saisi, rien n'indique que M. Wiseman a modifi\u00e9 sa plainte afin de d\u00e9signer l'ACSC ou quiconque d'autre comme plaignant ou comme son rempla\u00e7ant avant le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal par la Commission. Le Tribunal n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'aucune demande de modification depuis le renvoi de la plainte. Je ne peux que pr\u00e9sumer que j'ai affaire \u00e0 la m\u00eame plainte que M. Wiseman a initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission et j'ai, par cons\u00e9quent, affaire au m\u00eame plaignant, c'est-\u00e0-dire M. Wiseman.\n[18] Pour l'ensemble de ces motifs, il me semble que l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause en l'esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on inexacte d\u00e8s l'instant o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Plut\u00f4t, c'est le nom de M. Wiseman qui devrait figurer comme plaignant au lieu de celui de l'ACSC.\n[19] Je souligne que m\u00eame s'il s'av\u00e8re que M. Wiseman n'est pas lui-m\u00eame victime de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e pratique discriminatoire (p. ex., s'il s'av\u00e8re qu'il n'a jamais travaill\u00e9 comme chef adjoint d'\u00e9quipe), il a toujours le droit, en vertu de la Loi, de d\u00e9poser une plainte en tant qu'individu s'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne s'est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire. (paragraphes 40(1) et 40(2)).\n[20] Je rejette donc la demande du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance portant que le nom du plaignant soit remplac\u00e9 par les noms des personnes qui ont sign\u00e9 les formulaires de consentement susmentionn\u00e9s. Toutefois, compte tenu du texte figurant sur le formulaire de plainte, j'ordonne au greffe du Tribunal de modifier l'intitul\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente cause en inscrivant le nom de John Wiseman comme plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nOrdonnance [21] J'ordonne que\nl'intitul\u00e9 de la cause soit modifi\u00e9 et que le nom Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soit inscrit comme \u00e9tant celui de l'intim\u00e9; les parties dressent, sur une base continue, une liste des chefs d'\u00e9quipe adjoints qui peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une \u00e9ventuelle indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Cette liste comprendra les noms des individus qui occupent le poste de chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint depuis 1995 et fera \u00e9tat de la dur\u00e9e de leur emploi comme chef d'\u00e9quipe adjoint; l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause soit modifi\u00e9 et que le nom John Wiseman soit inscrit comme \u00e9tant celui du plaignant.\n[22] J'ordonne de plus que ces modifications de l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause entrent en vigueur \u00e0 compter de la d\u00e9livrance de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que l'on scinde l'audience portant sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte. \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l'audience, le Tribunal entendrait la preuve concernant les all\u00e9gations de discrimination soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant. Si le Tribunal devait conclure que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, une seconde audience portant sur les redressements demand\u00e9s par le plaignant aurait lieu.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e sugg\u00e8re que la preuve \u00e0 \u00eatre entendue concernant la question des redressements pourraient \u00eatre tr\u00e8s longue et co\u00fbteuse en temps. C'est pourquoi l'intim\u00e9 propose de tenir deux audiences distinctes faisant en sorte que si le plaignant devait \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, il n'y aurait aucune raison d'entendre la preuve portant sur les redressements.\n[3] Je tiens cependant \u00e0 souligner que, selon les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, les t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s de la plupart des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 \u00eatre appel\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e traitent, au moins en partie, des questions concernant les all\u00e9gations de discrimination soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant. Dans les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les deux parties, il est clair que les questions concernant l'\u00e9volution de la carri\u00e8re du plaignant ne sont pas uniquement reli\u00e9es aux redressements demand\u00e9s; elles sont \u00e9galement reli\u00e9es \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination.\n[4] En outre, il ne faut pas oublier la disposition au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) qui pr\u00e9voit que l'instruction des plaintes doit se faire sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. La plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce concerne des incidents qui ont eu lieu en 2000. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2002 et le licenciement du plaignant qui s'en est suivie a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e il y a de \u00e7a presque quatre ans, soit en juin 2003. Vu tout le temps qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis, il serait injustifi\u00e9 et non conforme aux objectifs de la Loi de retarder davantage le r\u00e8glement final de toutes les questions soulev\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[5] J'ordonne donc que la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne soit pas scind\u00e9e. Le Tribunal tranchera toutes les questions en litige, y compris celles portant sur les redressements, lors de l'audience qui doit d\u00e9buter le 28 mai 2007.\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Le 25 janvier 2005, Michel Knight (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de l\u2019Outaouais (l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985), ch. H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport en commun qui dessert les communaut\u00e9s de Gatineau, et des environs, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Sur le plan constitutionnel, elle est de juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en raison de ses activit\u00e9s de transport interprovincial. En effet, ses autobus transportent quotidiennement des passagers de la rive qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de la rivi\u00e8re des Outaouais vers la ville d\u2019Ottawa, en Ontario. L\u2019intim\u00e9e emploi \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 750 employ\u00e9s, dont 108 employ\u00e9s \u00e0 son service d\u2019entretien.\nA. Les faits ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte de M. Knight [3] Le plaignant est actuellement un travailleur autonome dans l\u2019am\u00e9nagement et l\u2019entretien paysager. Le 5 mai 1998, alors qu\u2019il travaillait comme commis-boucher, au March\u00e9 Frais, \u00e0 Gatineau, il a subi un accident de travail. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il a subi un traumatisme de la main droite lorsqu\u2019il a mis, par accident, sa main dans un hachoir \u00e0 viande. Selon le rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale, il a subi une blessure extr\u00eamement importante des tissus mous et des os de l\u2019index droit qui ont n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 une amputation. Il a \u00e9galement subi de multiples lac\u00e9rations et endommagement du nerf sensitif du majeur droit.\n[4] Suite \u00e0 cet accident, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en charge par le Dr Christopher Carter, chirurgien orthop\u00e9diste, qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019amputation de l\u2019index de la main droite. Le Dr Carter a consolid\u00e9 la l\u00e9sion le 4 ao\u00fbt 1998 et a conclu que le plaignant avait des limitations fonctionnelles permanentes, notamment :\nne peut serrer la main droite aussi fort que la main gauche, la puissance de la pr\u00e9hension est diminu\u00e9e d\u2019environ 50%, ne peut ex\u00e9cuter des activit\u00e9s qui demandent de la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 manuelle, ne peut saisir ou manipuler de petits objets, intol\u00e9rance au froid pour toute la main droite.\n[5] Suite \u00e0 cet accident, le plaignant a re\u00e7u des indemnit\u00e9s de remplacement de revenu de la Commission de la Sant\u00e9 et de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 au Travail (la CSST), de la province du Qu\u00e9bec. Il a alors re\u00e7u 90 pour-cent du salaire net qu\u2019il faisait dans son travail de boucher. Il recevra ces indemnit\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ou vers le mois de juin 2001. Les limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant lui ont \u00e9galement donn\u00e9 droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 forfaitaire pour d\u00e9ficit anatomique physiologique. Cette indemnit\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 10 812,52$. La lettre de la CSST avisant le plaignant de cette d\u00e9cision indiquait que son atteinte permanente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e par le Dr Carter \u00e0 12,55%, auquel pourcentage la CSST avait ajout\u00e9 2,50% pour douleurs et perte de jouissance de la vie. Cette d\u00e9cision de la CSST n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n[6] La CSST a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 un rapport d\u2019orientation du plaignant afin de clarifier, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de tests psychom\u00e9triques et d\u2019entrevues, ses int\u00e9r\u00eats, ses aptitudes et ses aspirations. \u00c0 la suite de ce rapport, une planification de carri\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en tenant compte des limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant. Compte tenu du caract\u00e8re permanent et d\u00e9finitif des limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises, le plaignant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019un programme de r\u00e9orientation professionnelle financ\u00e9 par la CSST. Le dossier de la CSST montre que le plaignant, suite \u00e0 sa rencontre avec le conseiller en orientation, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019inscrire aux cours suivants :\nCours de m\u00e9canique d\u2019ascenseur (1er choix) Techniques polici\u00e8res (2i\u00e8me choix) Technique du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique \u2013 fabrication d\u2019outils (3i\u00e8me choix)\n[7] Selon le dossier, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 au cours de m\u00e9canique d\u2019ascenseur parce que le cours \u00e9tait complet. Il a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 au cours de techniques polici\u00e8res. Toutefois, suite \u00e0 une discussion entre la responsable du dossier du plaignant \u00e0 la CSST. et le responsable du programme de techniques polici\u00e8res, ce dernier, inform\u00e9 des limitations fonctionnelles, a confirm\u00e9 que le plaignant ne pourrait pas exercer le m\u00e9tier de policier. Il fut donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette profession ne respectait pas les capacit\u00e9s r\u00e9siduelles du plaignant.\n[8] Toujours selon le dossier de la CSST, la responsable a, par la suite, t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9e au responsable du programme en Technologie du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique \u2013 fabrication d\u2019outils, pour discuter avec lui des limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant. Ce dernier confirma qu\u2019il ne voyait pas de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ce que le plaignant puisse r\u00e9ussir cette formation. Il ajouta que les t\u00e2ches de technicien en fabrication d\u2019outil ne demande pas de dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 manuelle, ni de travailler au froid. La CSST statue donc que la mesure de r\u00e9adaptation la plus appropri\u00e9e pour le plaignant est une formation en technologie du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique \u2013 fabrication d\u2019outils.\n[9] De septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le plaignant s\u2019est inscrit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole des adultes \u00e0 Gatineau afin de compl\u00e9ter ses \u00e9tudes secondaires. Le 16 janvier 1999, le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec lui d\u00e9livre son dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes secondaires. Par la suite, dans le cadre de son programme de r\u00e9orientation professionnelle, le plaignant s\u2019inscrit, \u00e0 l\u2019automne 1999, dans un programme de Technologie du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique \u2013 fabrication d\u2019outils, \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale, \u00e0 Ottawa. Le 8 juin 2001, il obtient son dipl\u00f4me. Les frais de scolarit\u00e9 pour ce cours, se chiffrant \u00e0 8,000$, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par la CSST. La CSST a \u00e9galement pay\u00e9 certains frais aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 ce programme de formation dont un plein d\u2019essence par semaine en plus des frais de stationnement afin de permettre au plaignant de se rendre \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4me en technologie du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique, le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 pendant un certain temps chez une entreprise du nom de Concert Airline, \u00e0 Gatineau, \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien op\u00e9rateur. En 2002, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter ce travail pour aller suivre un cours en m\u00e9canique de v\u00e9hicules lourds routiers.\n[11] Pour ce cours, le plaignant s\u2019est inscrit au Centre professionnel de l\u2019Outaouais, \u00e0 Gatineau. La preuve montre que le plaignant avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 cette formation bien avant d\u2019entreprendre son programme de Technologie du g\u00e9nie m\u00e9canique, \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 coll\u00e9giale. En effet, dans le dossier de la CSST, la responsable du dossier du plaignant, a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note le 28 juillet 1999, dans laquelle elle \u00e9crit :\nLe [travailleur] s\u2019est inscrit et a d\u00e9but\u00e9 une formation de m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde de son plein gr\u00e9. Lors d\u2019une rencontre avec le [travailleur], j\u2019ai analys\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches d\u2019un m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde [versus] les [limitations fonctionnelles] du [travailleur], le milieu physique, les aptitudes et la capacit\u00e9 physique. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la description des t\u00e2ches du syst\u00e8mes rep\u00e8res, ceux-ci ne rencontrent pas les [limitations fonctionnelles] du [travailleur]. [Ce travail] exige de travailler au froid, une habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 mouvoir les doigts rapidement et avec pr\u00e9cision, \u00e0 mouvoir les mains habilement et avec facilit\u00e9 et \u00eatre capable de faire des distinctions par le toucher\n[12] Le 17 juin 2004, le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation du Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9livre au plaignant un dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes professionnelles en m\u00e9canique de v\u00e9hicules lourds routiers.\n[13] Dans le cadre de son programme de formation en m\u00e9canique de v\u00e9hicules lourds routiers, le plaignant devait faire deux stages en milieu de travail. Les deux stages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le premier stage a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 entre le 23 mai et le 6 juin, 2003. Le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi ce stage avec succ\u00e8s. Sur la Fiche d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du stagiaire, le responsable des stages, Mario Tanguay, un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a inscrit : Tr\u00e8s bon sens de la m\u00e9canique, bonne initiative, tr\u00e8s bon rendement.. Lors de ce stage, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait travaill\u00e9 dans le garage sous la supervision d\u2019un m\u00e9canicien. Il dit avoir touch\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode de deux semaines \u00e0 tout ce qui a trait \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique. Il ajoute que l\u2019absence de son index droit ne lui a caus\u00e9 aucun probl\u00e8me.\n[14] Suite \u00e0 ce stage, il a fait une demande pour un emploi d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a obtenu le poste de man\u0153uvre et a travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, du 20 juin au 25 ao\u00fbt 2003, soit la dur\u00e9e du contrat d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Pendant ce travail d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, il a effectu\u00e9 divers travaux dont la peinture ext\u00e9rieure et int\u00e9rieure; l\u2019entretien ext\u00e9rieur et paysager. Il a \u00e9galement tond la pelouse et nettoy\u00e9 les aires de travail avec un pulv\u00e9risateur (jet wash).\n[15] Le deuxi\u00e8me stage a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 du 5 au 23 avril 2004. Encore une fois, le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi son stage avec succ\u00e8s. Les commentaires du responsable de stage sont \u00e9galement positifs \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. M. Tanguay note particuli\u00e8rement que le plaignant a un tr\u00e8s bon esprit d\u2019\u00e9quipe, ma\u00eetrise bien la formation, ex\u00e9cute avec fiabilit\u00e9 les travaux et qu\u2019il est un excellent stagiaire.\n[16] \u00c0 la suite de ce deuxi\u00e8me stage, le plaignant a exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 revenir travailler chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a alors pos\u00e9 sa candidature afin d\u2019occuper le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Le plaignant r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 un concours visant \u00e0 recruter des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service temporaires sur appel, ce qui signifie que les personnes embauch\u00e9es ne sont pas titulaires d\u2019un poste et ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019aucune garantie d\u2019heure de travail. Il semblerait que l\u2019obtention d\u2019un poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 est la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un poste de m\u00e9canicien.\n[17] Le travail est assign\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service sur appel au besoin. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le contrema\u00eetre \u00e9value pour la semaine suivante les t\u00e2ches et assigne ces t\u00e2ches aux employ\u00e9s permanents sur une base d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Les quarts de travail sont assign\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s permanents pour une p\u00e9riode de quatre \u00e0 cinq mois. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019assignation des t\u00e2ches aux employ\u00e9s permanents, une nouvelle assignation de t\u00e2ches est faite aux employ\u00e9s permanents volants, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire aux employ\u00e9s permanents \u00e0 qui quarante heures de travail sont garanties \u00e0 chaque semaine, mais qui ne sont pas titulaires d\u2019un quart de travail en particulier. Les quarts qui demeurent libres sont, par la suite, assign\u00e9s aux pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s sur appel. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s permanents pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent travailler sur les quarts de jour et de soir, les employ\u00e9s sur appel sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement assign\u00e9s les quarts de nuit.\n[18] Selon la description d\u2019emploi du poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, le titulaire travaille sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du contrema\u00eetre \u2013 service et r\u00e9usinage. Il assure le service sur les v\u00e9hicules par l\u2019entretien p\u00e9riodique des autobus. Il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des autobus avant leur d\u00e9part, effectue le plein de carburant et des lubrifiants et proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019air dans les pneus. De plus, il nettoie tous les v\u00e9hicules et ex\u00e9cute toutes autres t\u00e2ches connexes demand\u00e9es par son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat.\n[19] Le 25 mai 2004, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a contact\u00e9 le plaignant et lui a propos\u00e9 de passer un test de comp\u00e9tence pour le poste pour lequel il avait postul\u00e9. Le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi ce test et il a obtenu une entrevue. Dans un document \u00e9manant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et intitul\u00e9 Le comit\u00e9 de gestion en bref\u2026r\u00e9union du 1er juin 2004, il est fait mention que les services du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, temps partiel, sur appel.\n[20] Le 26 mai 2004, comme tous les autres candidats retenus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a contact\u00e9 le plaignant et lui a demand\u00e9 de passer un examen m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9-embauche pratiqu\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin conseil d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Dr Pierre Matte. Avant l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical, chaque candidat est demand\u00e9 de compl\u00e9ter le formulaire m\u00e9dical d\u2019examen pr\u00e9-emploi. Il est ensuite vu par le m\u00e9decin conseil.\n[21] Dans le formulaire d\u2019 examen pr\u00e9-emploi, remplit par le plaignant le 1er juin 2004, des questions portant sur ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnels sont pos\u00e9es. \u00c0 la question Avez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un accident de travail ou maladie professionnelle?, le plaignant r\u00e9pond positivement et mentionne l\u2019accident \u00e0 l\u2019index de la main droite du 5 mai 1998. Toutefois, il laisse en blanc la partie portant sur les limitations fonctionnelles.. De m\u00eame, \u00e0 la question Recevez-vous ou avez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u un montant forfaitaire suite \u00e0 une maladie ou une blessure ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 une incapacit\u00e9 permanente?, il coche la case non. Le formulaire est sign\u00e9 par le plaignant le 1er juin 2004.\n[22] Lors de cette m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le Dr Matte a alors constat\u00e9 que le plaignant avait subi un accident du travail avec comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019amputation de l\u2019index de la main droite. Il a alors inform\u00e9 le plaignant que son embauche serait retard\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il \u00e9value son dossier de la CSST avant qu\u2019il puisse se prononcer sur son cas. Avec l\u2019autorisation du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CSST d\u2019acheminer le dossier du plaignant au Dr Matte.\n[23] Le 5 juillet 2004, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le dossier de la CSST, la Chef en gestion des ressources humaines de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Lucie Plouffe, a fait parvenir une lettre au Dr Matte dans laquelle elle lui demande de se prononcer sur la capacit\u00e9 physique du plaignant d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le travail de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Elle joint \u00e9galement \u00e0 la lettre une description d\u2019emploi du poste de propos\u00e9 au service et, \u00e0 titre d\u2019informations suppl\u00e9mentaires, elle \u00e9num\u00e8re le type de charge que le travailleur pourrait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 soulever dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son travail:\nOuverture de la porte moteur, 90 fois\/jour (75 lbs) (En contre-interrogatoire, M. Langlois, chef \u00e0 l\u2019entretien des v\u00e9hicules, expliquera que le 75 lbs se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au poids total de la porte, non \u00e0 la force exig\u00e9e pour ouvrir cette porte.) Vidange de la bo\u00eete de perception, tourner la sonde 35 fois\/jour Faire le plein de carburant de 90 autobus\/jour (enclenchement du pistolet) Lavage ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019autobus avec brosse de 6 pieds D\u00e9placer baril d\u2019huile et graisse au besoin 205 litres (45 gallons) \u2013 (En contre-interrogatoire, M. Langlois expliquera qu\u2019il y a des chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs pour transporter ces barils) Travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur pour enlever la neige (occasionnel) Lavage int\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019aide de vaporisateur \u00e0 jet (3000 lbs de pression) \u2013 (En contre-interrogatoire, M. Langlois pr\u00e9cisera que la pression est cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le moteur utilis\u00e9 et non par l\u2019enclenchement du vaporisateur.) Lavage sous caisse avec vaporisateur \u00e0 jet Lavage de pi\u00e8ces, doit soulever pi\u00e8ces de moteur qui varient entre 5 et 75 lbs La porte qui donne vers l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur s\u2019ouvre et se ferme r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement durant la journ\u00e9e.\n[24] Cette description avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par M. Langlois \u00e0 la demande de Lucie Plouffe et de Jacynthe Poulin, la conseill\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. M. Langlois explique qu\u2019elles lui avaient demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une liste des t\u00e2ches pour un employ\u00e9 avec une limitation fonctionnelle \u00e0 la main.\n[25] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re du mandat qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9, ainsi que du dossier d\u2019accident de travail et des limitations fonctionnelles permanentes du plaignant, le Dr Matte a conclu, le 14 juillet 2004, que le plaignant ne rencontrait pas les exigences du poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr Matte reconna\u00eetra, entre autres, que la limitation fonctionnelle qui indiquait que la puissance de la pr\u00e9hension [du plaignant \u00e9tait] diminu\u00e9e d\u2019environ 50% est une description relativement impr\u00e9cise. Il pr\u00e9cise que sans avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 celle-ci, il s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur une force de pr\u00e9hension moyenne, qu\u2019il dit \u00eatre d\u2019environ 50 kilos. Cons\u00e9quemment, il en a conclu que la force de pr\u00e9hension du plaignant avec sa main droite \u00e9tait de 25 \u00e0 30 kilos. Toutefois, lorsque contre-interrog\u00e9 par le plaignant, il admettra qu\u2019une femme, qui a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s cette force de pr\u00e9hension, pourrait effectivement effectuer les t\u00e2ches de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Il s\u2019empresse de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il ne s\u2019attarde pas uniquement \u00e0 une t\u00e2che mais \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de celles-ci.\n[26] Il ajoute \u00e9galement que le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service demande de travailler au froid \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s sont requis de laver les autobus. De plus, la porte moteur s\u2019ouvre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u2013 selon le Dr Matte, elle s\u2019ouvre 90 fois par jour parce qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 90 autobus qui partent \u2013 pour laisser entrer les autobus afin qu\u2019ils puissent \u00eatre lav\u00e9s. En hiver, le froid entre lorsque la porte est ouverte, l\u2019eau pour laver les autobus est froide et les autobus sont pleins de glace et de givre. Il en conclut donc que le plaignant ne peut effectuer ces t\u00e2ches en raison de la limitation fonctionnelle qui dit qu\u2019il souffre d\u2019intol\u00e9rance au froid pour toute la main droite.\n[27] Le Dr Matte ajoute \u00e9galement que le lavage d\u2019autobus exige que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 manipule un jet d\u2019eau d\u2019une pression de 3 000 livres. Il pr\u00e9cise que ce travail requiert une bonne force de pr\u00e9hension constante de 20 \u00e0 25 kilos. Il mentionne aussi que les titulaires de ce poste sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9placer des gros barils de 45 gallons, ce qui demande une bonne pogne. Pendant une bonne partie de son t\u00e9moignage principal, le Dr Matte a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9crire le travail que doivent effectuer les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour en conclure que le plaignant ne pouvait ex\u00e9cuter ces t\u00e2ches en raison de ses limitations fonctionnelles.\n[28] En contre-interrogatoire, il pr\u00e9cisera qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier les limitations du plaignant puisque la blessure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consolid\u00e9e et que des limitations permanentes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises. Il ajoute : Pour moi permanent, c\u2019est permanent. \u00c7a veut dire que dans 20 ans, \u00e7a va \u00eatre encore permanent. Lorsque contre-interrog\u00e9 par le plaignant, le Dr Matte pr\u00e9cisera que sa responsabilit\u00e9 et ses obligations dans un dossier CSST. sont de respecter les limitations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises par le m\u00e9decin traitant, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, celles fix\u00e9es par le Dr Carter.\n[29] Ayant pris en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des travaux qu\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 doit accomplir ainsi que les limitations permanentes du plaignant, le Dr Matte conclut que le plaignant ne peut effectuer le travail d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\n[30] Avant de prendre une position finale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du dossier du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9uni son comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement, compos\u00e9 de Lucie Plouffe et de Jacynthe Poulin, repr\u00e9sentantes de la direction des ressources humaines, et de deux employ\u00e9s cadres de la direction de l\u2019entretien, soit Claude Renaud, le directeur, et Sylvain Martel, le chef d\u2019ing\u00e9nierie \u00e0 la direction de l\u2019entretien. Le comit\u00e9 s\u2019est r\u00e9uni afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accommoder le plaignant. Apr\u00e8s analyse du dossier, le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019accommoder le plaignant, sans contrainte excessive, afin de lui permettre d\u2019occuper la fonction de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 tout en respectant ses limitations fonctionnelles.\n[31] Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, selon le compte-rendu de la rencontre du comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement qui s\u2019est tenue le 20 juillet 2004, le comit\u00e9 s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sommairement sur les postes de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service \u2013 lavage int\u00e9rieur et concierge pour voir s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019accommoder le plaignant dans ces postes. Le comit\u00e9 en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas compatibles avec ces postes. Le comit\u00e9 s\u2019est \u00e9galement pench\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9server la fonction de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au carburant, dans le poste pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, au plaignant puisque celle-ci pourrait r\u00e9pondre aux limitations de ce dernier. Cependant, le document poursuit en indiquant que comme il n\u2019est pas envisageable d\u2019\u00e9liminer la possibilit\u00e9 du travail de nuit et l\u2019aspect de rotation entre les fonctions (quart de travail moins populaire et habituellement effectu\u00e9 par les moins anciens), celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9. De plus, le comit\u00e9 conclut qu\u2019il ne voit pas comment il pourrait r\u00e9server [cette] fonction [au plaignant] sans affecter le moral des \u00e9quipes et m\u00eame [leur] stabilit\u00e9. Le comit\u00e9 conclut \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucun autre poste n\u2019est disponible pour lequel le plaignant pourrait se qualifier. Il affirme \u00e9galement n\u2019avoir pas examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un nouveau poste, car celui-ci serait assujetti aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019affichage de la convention collective, en plus de cr\u00e9er une contrainte financi\u00e8re. Finalement, un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 car les t\u00e2ches auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 similaires \u00e0 celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9valu\u00e9es.\n[32] Lors de son interrogatoire Mme Plouffe ajoutera qu\u2019il y aurait peut-\u00eatre eu un poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu offrir au plaignant. Or, elle ajoute que sans en avoir fait une analyse exhaustive, elle avait d\u2019embl\u00e9e \u00e9limin\u00e9 ce poste car elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait faire un rapport ergonomique pour un chauffeur qui s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9 \u00e0 un pouce et le rapport soulignait des charges importantes au niveau de la conduite du v\u00e9hicule. Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, elle reconna\u00eetra que le rapport d\u2019orientation de carri\u00e8re pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la CSST sugg\u00e9rait comme travail possible pour le plaignant celui de chauffeur d\u2019autobus.\n[33] Mme Plouffe a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement avait discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9liminer le travail de nuit dans le cas du plaignant advenant son embauche, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter qu\u2019il ait \u00e0 effectuer toutes les fonctions d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Or, selon le comit\u00e9, les r\u00e8gles de la convention collective, ne permettaient pas de faire passer le plaignant avant les autres travailleurs. De plus, elle ajoute que la raison de l\u2019embauche des employ\u00e9s temporaires, tel le plaignant, est pour faire du remplacement surtout la nuit.\n[34] Le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement en est donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019aucun accommodement ne pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 en regard des limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant.\n[35] Le 27 juillet 2004, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avise le plaignant, par lettre, que sa candidature ne pouvait \u00eatre retenue. Lucie Plouffe et Jacynthe Poulin ont alors rencontr\u00e9 le plaignant pour lui remettre la lettre et lui expliquer la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elles ont alors expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait li\u00e9e par les limitations fonctionnelles inscrites au dossier de la CSST et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas le retenir pour le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\n[36] Suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant a contact\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le Dr Carter qui avait produit le rapport de 1998. Le 6 octobre 2004, le Dr Carter a fait subir un autre examen m\u00e9dical au plaignant. Selon le nouveau rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Dr Carter, l\u2019objet de cette \u00e9valuation \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu am\u00e9lioration dans l\u2019\u00e9tat de la main du plaignant depuis la premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation en 1998 laquelle avait fix\u00e9e des limitations fonctionnelles permanentes. Le 10 octobre 2004, le plaignant a transmis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le nouveau rapport du Dr Carter qui indiquait que le plaignant n\u2019avait plus aucune limitation fonctionnelle. Selon le Dr Carter, le plaignant n\u2019a plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 saisir des petits objets et la sensation du bout de son majeur est redevenue normale. Il ajoute que le plaignant utilise son majeur droit comme s\u2019il utilisait l\u2019index qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 amput\u00e9. Le Dr Carter pr\u00e9cise que la force de pr\u00e9hension est maintenant approximativement normale et que le plaignant ne souffre plus d\u2019intol\u00e9rance au froid.\n[37] Suite \u00e0 l\u2019obtention du deuxi\u00e8me rapport m\u00e9dical, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de la CSST afin de voir si cette derni\u00e8re consentirait \u00e0 lever les limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises en 1998 par le Dr Carter. La CSST a refus\u00e9 de modifier sa d\u00e9cision de 1998 et de lever les limitations fonctionnelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime donc qu\u2019elle est toujours li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de 1998 rendue par la CSST. Par lettre du 2 d\u00e9cembre 2004, l\u2019intim\u00e9e informe le plaignant qu\u2019elle ne modifie pas sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas retenir sa candidature. Dans cette lettre, elle pr\u00e9cise que comme tout autre employeur, [elle] a l\u2019obligation de prendre toutes les mesures pour assurer la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de ses travailleurs. Or, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en application de la Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles qui est une loi d\u2019ordre public, que vous \u00e9tiez porteur de limitations fonctionnelles permanentes, la STO se sent li\u00e9e par cette d\u00e9cision. Par ailleurs, comme notre m\u00e9decin d\u2019entreprise a confirm\u00e9 que vos limitations sont incompatibles avec les fonctions de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de retenir votre candidature.\n[38] Dans une note produite le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2004, une certaine Louise Audet, agente de la CSST, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec Jacynthe Poulin, \u00e9crit : Nous confirmons \u00e0 Mme Poulin qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun changement l\u00e9gal au dossier. La CSST ne peut se prononcer \u00e0 nouveau sur la capacit\u00e9 de travail \u00e0 moins d\u2019une RRA. Or le nouveau REM produit par le Dr Carter \u00e0 la demande du [travailleur] ne donne pas ouverture \u00e0 une RRA. Par ailleurs, la STO, sans \u00eatre li\u00e9e par les d\u00e9cisions l\u00e9gales rendues dans ce dossier, est justifi\u00e9e de vouloir s\u2019assurer de la capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle du [travailleur] \u00e0 effectuer ce travail. Si la STO consid\u00e8re que le dernier rapport du Dr Carter n\u2019est pas suffisamment concluant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la STO peut exiger que le [travailleur] fournisse une \u00e9valuation de capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle ou lui faire subir un test pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. Nous demandons \u00e0 la STO d\u2019agir envers ce [travailleur] comme elle agirait envers un [travailleur] qui aurait subi le m\u00eame accident en dehors du travail. La responsabilit\u00e9 de respecter [les limitations fonctionnelles] revient au [travailleur] alors que l\u2019[employeur] doit s\u2019assurer que le [travailleur] est pleinement en mesure d\u2019accomplir la t\u00e2che. [C\u2019est moi qui souligne.]\n[39] Suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant dit avoir retenu les services d\u2019un avocat afin d\u2019entreprendre des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de la CSST. Dans une lettre du 14 d\u00e9cembre 2004, qu\u2019il a fait parvenir \u00e0 la CSST, Me R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer, l\u2019avocat du plaignant, demande \u00e0 la CSST, non pas de modifier le rapport m\u00e9dical de 1998, mais que le rapport m\u00e9dical du docteur Carter, produite en 2004, fasse partie du dossier m\u00e9dical du plaignant. Le 10 janvier 2005, la CSST informe le plaignant que le rapport m\u00e9dical de 2004, a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier.\n[40] Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement mis en preuve la description d\u2019emploi pour plusieurs t\u00e2ches \u00e0 la direction de l\u2019entretien. Ainsi, le concierge (int\u00e9rieur et ext\u00e9rieur) bureaux voit notamment \u00e0 la propret\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019entretien et au nettoyage des locaux de la Direction de l\u2019entretien. Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service assure le service sur les v\u00e9hicules, par l\u2019entretien p\u00e9riodique des autobus. Il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification avant le d\u00e9part, effectue le plein de carburant et des lubrifiants et de l\u2019air dans les pneus. Il nettoie tous les v\u00e9hicules et ex\u00e9cute toutes autres t\u00e2ches connexes. Le man\u0153uvre (lavage de pi\u00e8ces) effectue le lavage de toutes les pi\u00e8ces m\u00e9caniques et le nettoyage du garage. Finalement, le man\u0153uvre (int\u00e9rieur et ext\u00e9rieur)-garage assure la propret\u00e9 compl\u00e8te dans les b\u00e2timents, les vitres ainsi que la propret\u00e9 des planchers. Il r\u00e9pond aux besoins de d\u00e9placements internes et externes se rapportant aux marchandises.\n[41] Dans le compte-rendu de la rencontre du comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dont nous avons fait mention plus haut, le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service est d\u00e9crit comme se divisant en trois grandes familles de fonctions:\nStationnement des autobus \u00e0 l\u2019endroit assign\u00e9 et responsable du vidange de la bo\u00eete de perception. ( Ce que M. Langlois a d\u00e9crit comme le gareur.) V\u00e9rification et ajustement des niveaux d\u2019huile et inspection des pneus \u00e0 droite. Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au carburant, inspection des pneus \u00e0 gauche et entr\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectroniques. ( Ce que M. Langlois a d\u00e9crit comme le pompiste.).\nSelon le compte-rendu, la fonction 1 demande la vidange de la bo\u00eete de perception, donc une manipulation de la sonde sur laquelle une grande pression doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e avec les deux mains d\u2019une fa\u00e7on uniforme. La fonction 2 demande de lever la porte-moteur qui p\u00e8se 75 lbs \u00e0 90 reprises dans une journ\u00e9e. L\u2019inspection des pneus demande de donner un grand coup avec un marteau de 5 lbs.\n[42] Les trois fonctions sont effectu\u00e9es en rotation par les employ\u00e9s de soir. Les employ\u00e9s de jour, pour leur part, se sont distribu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on non-formelle les trois fonctions et la direction de l\u2019entretien tol\u00e8re cette pratique puisqu\u2019elle convient aux employ\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle ne souhaite pas cr\u00e9er d\u2019animosit\u00e9 au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. Les deux employ\u00e9s de nuit font chacune des trois fonctions.\n[43] L\u2019hiver, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service ont \u00e9galement comme t\u00e2che de nettoyer les portes de garage aux entr\u00e9es. M. Langlois pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019une fois que les autobus sont sur la route, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s doivent s\u2019assurer que le niveau d\u2019antigel et d\u2019huile au garage est ad\u00e9quat. Ils ont alors \u00e0 d\u00e9placer ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9crit comme des barils de 45 gallons en ajoutant toutefois qu\u2019ils ont des chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs pour les assister dans cette t\u00e2che.\n[44] Le jour, il y a trois pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service qui travaillent : trois gareurs, un pompiste et un v\u00e9rificateur d\u2019huile. Pour le quart du soir, il y a \u00e9galement cinq pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service : deux rentrent de 15 h 00 \u00e0 18 h 00 et les trois autres de 18 h 00 \u00e0 2 h 00. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s qui travaillent le soir effectuent les m\u00eames t\u00e2ches que ceux qui travaillent le matin. Toutefois, ceux qui travaillent sur le quart de nuit effectuent toutes les t\u00e2ches. Le jour ces t\u00e2ches sont r\u00e9parties entre trois pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s.\n[45] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Langlois, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service qui travaillent le jour ont \u00e0 s\u2019occuper d\u2019environ 90 autobus, alors que ceux qui travaillent la nuit peuvent avoir entre 25 \u00e0 45 autobus.\n[46] Le t\u00e9moin a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 le travail du man\u0153uvre (int\u00e9rieur et ext\u00e9rieur)-garage. Cet employ\u00e9 assure la propret\u00e9 des lieux. L\u2019hiver il est responsable de s\u2019assurer que les sorties soient bien nettoy\u00e9es. Cet employ\u00e9 doit \u00e9galement s\u2019assurer des besoins du service d\u2019entretien; il sera responsable de d\u00e9placer, avec le chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur, les barils de 45 gallons. Cet employ\u00e9 travaille sur un quart de jour.\n[47] Le man\u0153uvre \u2013 lavage des pi\u00e8ces travaille \u00e0 ce que M. Langlois a d\u00e9crit comme lereconditionnage de pi\u00e8ce. Il est responsable de nettoyer les pi\u00e8ces avant qu\u2019elles soient remises aux m\u00e9caniciens pour le reconditionnement. Il a \u00e0 soulever et placer les pi\u00e8ces m\u00e9caniques dans une grosse laveuse. Il pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il y a un palan qui sert \u00e0 soulever les plus grosses pi\u00e8ces mais que des pi\u00e8ces de 30 \u00e0 75 livres doivent \u00eatre manipul\u00e9es manuellement par l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[48] La Convention collective de travail pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e se r\u00e9serve le droit d\u2019embaucher neuf (9) employ\u00e9s temporaires et que ces employ\u00e9s temporaires n\u2019accompliront que les fonctions de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, de man\u0153uvre et de concierge. Les employ\u00e9s temporaires n\u2019ont aucune garantie d\u2019heure.\n[49] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Lucie Plouffe a d\u00e9crit comment un employ\u00e9 temporaire pouvait changer de statut chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans un premier temps, l\u2019employ\u00e9 temporaire accumule des heures de travail. Apr\u00e8s 1 040 heures de travail accumul\u00e9es, il acc\u00e8de \u00e0 une liste de priorit\u00e9 d\u2019embauche pour le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Lorsqu\u2019un poste permanent devient disponible, suite \u00e0 un d\u00e9part ou \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un nouveau poste, alors l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui se trouve au haut de la liste de priorit\u00e9 obtient le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Un fois qu\u2019il obtient un poste r\u00e9gulier, l\u2019employ\u00e9 est garanti 40 heures de travail par semaine.\n[50] Madame Plouffe a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une \u00e9valuation du rendement des employ\u00e9s temporaires est \u00e9galement faite et que si celle-ci s\u2019av\u00e8re insatisfaisante l\u2019employeur peut mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. De plus, selon la convention collective, l\u2019employ\u00e9 temporaire qui est choisi pour devenir un employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier est assujetti \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation dont la dur\u00e9e est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Selon les param\u00e8tres de la convention collective, si l\u2019employ\u00e9 a accumul\u00e9 5 200 heures travaill\u00e9es ou s\u2019il a accumul\u00e9 2 080 heures travaill\u00e9es dans un p\u00e9riode de quinze mois, il ne sera pas soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation. L\u2019employ\u00e9 qui aura accumul\u00e9 2 080 heures travaill\u00e9es dans une p\u00e9riode de dix-huit mois, sera soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation de trois mois, tandis que les autres employ\u00e9s seront soumis \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation de six mois.\nB. Questions en litige [51] Les questions en litige se r\u00e9sument ainsi :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant sont-ils li\u00e9s par la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec d\u2019\u00e9mettre des limitations fonctionnelles permanentes? L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience en refusant d\u2019embaucher le plaignant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience? Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question b) est positive, alors l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est impossible de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Knight sans que cela ne constitue une contrainte excessive pour elle? Si la plainte est accueillie, quelles sont les compensations qui doivent \u00eatre octroy\u00e9es au plaignant?\nC. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail [52] Le 5 mai 1998, alors qu\u2019il occupait un poste de boucher, le plaignant a subi un accident de travail qui eut comme cons\u00e9quence l\u2019amputation de l\u2019index de sa main droite. Suite aux recommandations \u00e9mises le 4 ao\u00fbt 1998 par le m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant, la Commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du travail (la CSST), de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9mis les limitations fonctionnelles auxquelles nous avons fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence plus t\u00f4t dans cette d\u00e9cision.\n[53] Le 10 octobre 2004, le plaignant a obtenu un nouveau rapport de son m\u00e9decin traitant lequel \u00e9tablissait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait plus de limitations fonctionnelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a soumis ce nouveau rapport \u00e0 la CSST. La CSST a n\u00e9anmoins confirm\u00e9 que les limitations fonctionnelles permanentes \u00e9taient maintenues et n\u2019a pas r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de 1998.\n[54] Lors de l\u2019audience, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal l\u00e8ve les limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises par la CSST ou, tout au moins, que le Tribunal conclut sur la base du nouveau rapport du m\u00e9decin traitant et sur un rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation en ergoth\u00e9rapie, que le plaignant n\u2019a plus de limitations fonctionnelles.\n[55] Le Tribunal ne croit pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire de traiter de cette question. D\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lecture de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne que le Tribunal poss\u00e9derait cette comp\u00e9tence. L\u2019objet de la Loi n\u2019est pas de d\u00e9terminer si une commission de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de travail provinciale a ou non raison de maintenir les limitations fonctionnelles qu\u2019elle a \u00e9mises. Son objet est de donner effet au droit des individus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur leur d\u00e9ficience.\n[56] La question de savoir si les limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises en 1998 par la CSST sur recommandation du m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant devraient \u00eatre lev\u00e9es devra trouver une r\u00e9ponse dans la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles (L.R.Q. chapitre A- 3.001). Afin de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne LCDP et de d\u00e9terminer si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, il n\u2019y pas lieu, pour le Tribunal de se prononcer sur cette premi\u00e8re question car, comme l\u2019a admis l\u2019intim\u00e9e, une personne atteinte de limitations fonctionnelles est une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la LCPD et la question est donc de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a rencontr\u00e9 son obligation d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9vue dans la LCPD envers cette personne.\n[57] D\u2019ailleurs sur ce point, je reprend \u00e0 mon compte les commentaires de l\u2019arbitre Dissanayake, dans la sentence arbitrale Re Air Canada and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (1998), 74 L.A.C. (4th) 233, o\u00f9 il d\u00e9clare :\nLa CAT a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention de l\u2019employeur sur son obligation en vertu de la Loi sur les accidents du travail, L.R.O. 1990, ch. W.11, de tenter de fournir un travail convenable au plaignant. L\u2019employeur est \u00e9galement tenu d\u2019accommoder le plaignant en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 ainsi qu\u2019en vertu de la convention collective. [\u2026] [L\u2019employeur] a agi en croyant que tant qu\u2019il suivrait les conseils de la CAT et respecterait les lois susmentionn\u00e9es, il agirait l\u00e9gitimement. J\u2019estime que cela est une grave erreur, bien que je ne doute aucunement que la direction agissait de bonne foi. Le probl\u00e8me est que la CAT n\u2019est pas responsable pour le respect de la Loi sur les droits de la personne. Par contre, l\u2019employeur est tenu en permanence en vertu de la Loi et de la convention de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement quant \u00e0 l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du plaignant dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne lui occasionne aucune contrainte excessive et ce devoir est ind\u00e9pendant des obligations pr\u00e9vues dans les lois sur les accidents du travail. [Traduction [C\u2019est moi qui souligne.]\nD. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience en refusant d\u2019embaucher le plaignant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience? [58] Les dispositions pertinentes de la Loi sont les suivantes :\n3(1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n(\u2026)\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(\u2026)\n15(1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement\n(\u2026)\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(\u2026)\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu\n(\u2026)\n15(1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es\n(\u2026)\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[59] Ainsi, selon la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de refuser d\u2019employer un individu du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. Une d\u00e9ficience est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 de la Loi comme une d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e.\n[60] Le comportement de l\u2019employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme discriminatoire s\u2019il peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que son refus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tout emploi d\u00e9coule d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (le paragraphe 15(1) de la Loi). Il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli, pour qu\u2019un acte soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une EPJ, que le fait de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituerait pour l\u2019employeur une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[61] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), la m\u00e9thode devant \u00eatre suivie pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existe une EPJ.\n[62] Il incombe, dans un premier temps, \u00e0 la partie plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, par. 28 (O\u2019Malley)). Dans ce contexte, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Une fois que l\u2019existence de la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant ce qui suit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; L\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; La norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec le plaignant sans que l\u2019intim\u00e9 subisse une contrainte excessive. Il appartiendra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d\u2019accommodement\n(Voir, Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, au para. 20. (Grismer)).\n(i) La preuve prima facie [63] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019admission de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la question de savoir si le plaignant souffre d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. D\u2019ailleurs, m\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne l\u2019avait pas admis, j\u2019aurais n\u00e9anmoins conclu que l\u2019handicap physique du plaignant \u2013 soit l\u2019absence de l\u2019index de la main droite et des limitations fonctionnelles qui en d\u00e9coulent \u2013 constituait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi. La question qui se pose donc est de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est justifi\u00e9e de refuser d\u2019employer le plaignant en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) L\u2019application du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meoirin et de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP (a) Les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meoirin [64] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la norme adopt\u00e9e et le comportement qui s\u2019en est suivi \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s. Elle soutient que compte tenu des limitations fonctionnelles impos\u00e9es au plaignant, elle est incapable de lui fournir un accommodement individuel sans que cela constitue une contrainte excessive.\n[65] Lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve et dans leurs arguments finaux, les parties n\u2019ont pas jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019aborder les deux premiers crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meoirin. Nous pouvons en d\u00e9duire qu\u2019elles reconnaissent que la norme adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u2013 soit d\u2019assurer que le travail de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service puisse s\u2019effectuer de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9curitaire et sans risque \u2013 avait un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019y a aucune raison de mettre en doute cette conclusion.\n[66] De plus, je suis convaincu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 cette norme de bonne foi, en croyant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer l\u2019exploitation s\u00e9curitaire de son entreprise. Le deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re de Meiorin a donc \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9.\n(b) L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est impossible de fournir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Knight sans que cela constitue une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e? [67] Pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire (la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9e au paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP), un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de fournir un accommodement au plaignant et aux autres employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par la norme sans s\u2019imposer une contrainte excessive.\n[68] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meoirin, au paragraphe 64, conseille aux cours de justice et aux tribunaux administratifs de tenir compte des diverses mani\u00e8res dont il est possible de composer avec les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019un individu. Un employeur devrait se renseigner sur la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le travail de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res tout en r\u00e9alisant l\u2019objet l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi que vise l\u2019employeur. Les aptitudes, les capacit\u00e9s et l\u2019apport potentiel du plaignant et de ceux qui sont dans la m\u00eame situation que lui doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9s autant qu\u2019il est possible de le faire.\n[69] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la norme d\u2019embauche mettait l\u2019accent sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. Le fait que cette norme exclue certaines cat\u00e9gories de personnes ne constitue pas de la discrimination si l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif appropri\u00e9 et si l\u2019accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 dans la norme. L\u2019exclusion n\u2019est justifiable que si l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a pris toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles tant qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour elle une contrainte excessive. (Voir Colombie-Britannique (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, au para. 21).\n[70] Une forme d\u2019accommodement pourrait par exemple consister \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation individuelle du plaignant en vue de d\u00e9cider de son aptitude \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Rien ne d\u00e9montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 de faire une telle \u00e9valuation du plaignant. D\u2019ailleurs, le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Matte, le m\u00e9decin conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, fut tr\u00e8s clair sur cette question : il n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 le plaignant personnellement et on ne lui a pas, non plus, demand\u00e9 de le faire. La preuve montre que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est bas\u00e9e uniquement sur les conclusions \u00e9mises par le Dr Carter, en 1998, quant aux limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e et le Dr Matte semblent \u00eatre d\u2019avis, de bonne foi j\u2019en conviens, que la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher le plaignant serait l\u00e9gitime si l\u2019intim\u00e9e suivait les conclusions de la CSST quant aux limitations fonctionnelles. Un probl\u00e8me avec cette approche est qu\u2019elle omet de tenir compte du fait que la CSST n\u2019est aucunement tenue de se conformer \u00e0 la Loi. Or, l\u2019intim\u00e9e elle, n\u2019\u00e9chappe pas aux obligations de la Loi du simple fait de l\u2019existence de la Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles, L.R.Q., chapitre A-3.001 (la LATMP). D\u2019ailleurs, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019en ce qui concerne la CSST, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 pourquoi ou comment elle \u00e9tait li\u00e9e par les conclusions de celle-ci au stade de l\u2019embauche surtout lorsque ces conclusions sont bas\u00e9es sur les informations m\u00e9dicales qui ne sont plus courantes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer comment le non respect de ces conclusions constituerait une contrainte excessive.\n[71] Je ne suis pas convaincu, selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait fait quelque effort pour \u00e9valuer individuellement le plaignant en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir si son \u00e9tat l\u2019emp\u00eachait d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, ni comment l\u2019\u00e9valuation individuelle du plaignant lui causerai une contrainte excessive. Sur ce point, l\u2019intim\u00e9e semble avoir apport\u00e9 toute son attention sur les obligations que lui impose la LATMP, et avoir omis de porter une attention suffisante \u00e0 celles de la Loi.\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019aptitude individuelle du plaignant. Elle est convaincue que les limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises par la CSST le rendait inapte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9curitaire les t\u00e2ches de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Cet argument ne me convainc pas. Le fait de permettre \u00e0 un employeur d\u2019invoquer des opinions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9ficiences de ses employ\u00e9s qu\u2019il per\u00e7oit comme \u00e9videntes sans qu\u2019il n\u2019ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation individuelle de ses aptitudes \u00e0 accomplir le travail de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9curitaire aurait pour effet de lui donner une justification trop facile \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un comportement qui pourrait autrement \u00eatre discriminatoire. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer, supra, au paragraphe 19, la raison pour laquelle l\u2019accommodement doit \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9 dans une norme vise \u00e0 assurer que chacun est \u00e9valu\u00e9 selon ses propres capacit\u00e9s personnelles plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en fonction des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un groupe qui sont souvent fond\u00e9es sur un parti pris et des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s de longue date. Une \u00e9valuation individuelle de l\u2019employ\u00e9 est par cons\u00e9quent une \u00e9tape essentielle, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne constitue elle-m\u00eame une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans le processus d\u2019accommodement (Voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer, aux paragraphes 22, 30, 32 et 38; l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, au paragraphe 65; et Audet c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 61.)\n[73] Toutefois, m\u00eame si je devais conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 effectuer une \u00e9valuation individuelle du plaignant parce qu\u2019elle poserait une contrainte excessive, il resterait toujours la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli que le plaignant \u00e9tait inapte \u00e0 occuper le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement tous les autres moyens possibles d\u2019accommodement qu\u2019elle pouvait lui offrir sans qu\u2019elle n\u2019en subisse une contrainte excessive (Voir Meiorin, supra, au para. 65). \u00c0 mon avis, elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle a satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence.\n[74] La preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est qu\u2019elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9 toutes les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019accommodement raisonnable en tenant compte de la d\u00e9ficience et des limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant. Avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision finale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du dossier du plaignant, elle a constitu\u00e9 son comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement, compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants de la direction des ressources humaines et de la direction de l\u2019entretien. Ce comit\u00e9 s\u2019est r\u00e9uni afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accommoder le plaignant sans subir de contrainte excessive.\n[75] Selon la preuve, le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement a, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de l\u2019analyse du Dr Matte, conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019accommoder le plaignant pour lui permettre d\u2019occuper la fonction de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 tout en respectant ses limitations fonctionnelles. Selon l\u2019analyse que le comit\u00e9 dit avoir fait des diff\u00e9rentes fonctions assign\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s au service, celles-ci ne respectaient pas les limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant.\n[76] Le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement se serait pench\u00e9 sommairement sur les postes de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service \u2013 lavage int\u00e9rieur et concierge pour voir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019y accommoder le plaignant. Il en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9taient pas compatibles avec ces postes. Le comit\u00e9 dit s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9galement pench\u00e9 sur la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9server la fonction de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au carburant, dans le poste pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, au plaignant puisque celle-ci pourrait r\u00e9pondre aux limitations de ce dernier. Or, le comit\u00e9 conclut comme il n\u2019est pas envisageable d\u2019\u00e9liminer la possibilit\u00e9 du travail de nuit et l\u2019aspect de rotation entre les fonctions (quart de travail moins populaire et habituellement effectu\u00e9 par les moins anciens cette possibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e. Le comit\u00e9 est \u00e9galement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne pouvait r\u00e9server [cette] fonction [au plaignant] sans affecter le moral des \u00e9quipes et m\u00eame [leur] stabilit\u00e9.\n[77] Le comit\u00e9 conclut \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucun autre poste n\u2019est disponible pour lequel le plaignant pourrait se qualifier. Il n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un nouveau poste car, selon le comit\u00e9, celui-ci aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019affichage de la convention collective, en plus de cr\u00e9er une contrainte financi\u00e8re pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Finalement, un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 car, selon le comit\u00e9, les t\u00e2ches auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 similaires \u00e0 celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9valu\u00e9es.\n[78] Lors de son interrogatoire Mme Plouffe mentionnera qu\u2019il y aurait peut-\u00eatre eu un poste de chauffeur d\u2019autobus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu offrir au plaignant. Or, elle ajoute que sans avoir fait une analyse exhaustive de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant d\u2019occuper ce poste, elle l\u2019avait d\u2019embl\u00e9e \u00e9limin\u00e9e car elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait faire un rapport ergonomique pour un autre chauffeur qui s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9 \u00e0 un pouce et le rapport soulignait des charges importantes au niveau de la conduite du v\u00e9hicule. Elle admettra en contre-interrogatoire, que le rapport d\u2019orientation de carri\u00e8re pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la CSST sugg\u00e9rait comme travail possible pour le plaignant celui de chauffeur d\u2019autobus.\n[79] Elle mentionnera \u00e9galement que le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement avait discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9liminer le travail de nuit dans le cas du plaignant advenant son embauche, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter qu\u2019il ait \u00e0 effectuer toutes les fonctions d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. Or, selon le comit\u00e9, les r\u00e8gles de la convention collective ne permettaient pas de faire passer le plaignant avant les autres travailleurs. Le comit\u00e9 en est donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019aucun accommodement ne pouvait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 en regard des limitations fonctionnelles du plaignant.\n[80] Abordons en premier lieu l\u2019argument mis de l\u2019avant par le comit\u00e9 d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019effet que composer avec le plaignant minerait le moral des \u00e9quipes. Premi\u00e8rement, je constate que cette proposition n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9e par la preuve. De plus, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e ainsi sur une question similaire, au paragraphe 80 : M\u00eame s\u2019il va sans dire qu\u2019il faut examiner s\u00e9rieusement l\u2019opposition des employ\u00e9s qui r\u00e9sulte de craintes l\u00e9gitimes que leurs droits soient l\u00e9s\u00e9s, on ne peut justifier la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif prohib\u00e9 par l\u2019argument que l\u2019abandon de cette pratique minerait le moral des employ\u00e9s.\n[81] Pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une contrainte excessive, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur plusieurs sentences arbitrales dont, entre autres, celle dans l\u2019affaire Syndicat des technologues en radiologie du Qu\u00e9bec et Centre hospitalier des Vall\u00e9es de l\u2019Outaouais (Pavillon de Hull), T.A. 199-08-12, DTE 99T -1044 (Me Denis Nadeau), sentence rendue quelques mois avant les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer. Dans cette sentence, l\u2019arbitre \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de droits qui peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par l\u2019implantation d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement. Il parle, entre autres, de l\u2019alourdissement de la t\u00e2che des autres employ\u00e9es appel\u00e9s \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter une partie des fonctions de la personne accommod\u00e9e, de l\u2019exposition \u00e0 un risque plus grand pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en raison de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour un employ\u00e9 de travailler avec un coll\u00e8gue qui sollicite un accommodement particulier, l\u2019acceptation d\u2019un horaire de travail moins avantageux, la renonciation \u00e0 une promotion attendue ou la mutation \u00e0 un autre poste. Sans me prononcer sur le bien fond\u00e9 de ces pr\u00e9occupations en ce qui concerne l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la Loi, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que l\u00e0 encore aucune preuve n\u2019est venue \u00e9tablir que tel \u00e9tait le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que cela imposait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[82] Bien que, dans certaines circonstances ces consid\u00e9rations puissent, peut-\u00eatre, justifier le refus de composer avec les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficiences, il faut se garder de ne pas accorder suffisamment d\u2019importance \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement de la personne handicap\u00e9e. Il m\u2019appara\u00eet beaucoup trop facile d\u2019invoquer ces consid\u00e9rations pour justifier un refus d\u2019accorder un traitement \u00e9gal aux personnes handicap\u00e9es. Je n\u2019affirme pas que celles-ci ne puissent jamais \u00eatre pertinentes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement; j\u2019affirme cependant que la preuve, constitu\u00e9e d\u2019impressions, ne suffit pas.\n[83] Selon les crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait tenue de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle avait envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d\u2019accommodement. Il lui incombait de prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019incorporer des aspects d\u2019accommodement individuel sans qu\u2019il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer, la Cour supr\u00eame exprime ainsi, au paragraphe 43, le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 dans un cas comme le pr\u00e9sent : Le bon sens et le raisonnement logique ne sont pas exclus mais, dans un cas o\u00f9 on refuse carr\u00e9ment l\u2019accommodement, il doit y avoir certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui lient le refus d\u2019accorder m\u00eame la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accommoder \u00e0 un risque excessif en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[84] Je retiens \u00e9galement que le plaignant a le droit \u00e0 un accommodement pour autant que cela ne constitue pas une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019adjectif excessif d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une certaine contrainte est acceptable, seule la contrainte qui est excessive peut excuser l\u2019employeur de son obligation. La preuve ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que l\u2019accommodement du plaignant n\u00e9cessitait un r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement substantiel de l\u2019ensemble des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 cela aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue, sans pour autant en faire la preuve de mani\u00e8re convaincante, que l\u2019accommodement \u2013 sans pr\u00e9ciser en quoi consisterait cet accommodement \u2013 entra\u00eenerait des risques pour la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du plaignant et des autres salari\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0, selon elle, d\u2019une contrainte excessive. Toutefois, rien dans la preuve soumise \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019est venu appuyer ces pr\u00e9tentions.\n[85] Tout en acceptant que l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommoder ne va pas n\u00e9cessairement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un poste de travail sur mesure pour le plaignant, nous tenons \u00e0 faire remarquer que l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas ce que le plaignant r\u00e9clame. Le plaignant demande que l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 lui soit donn\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il peut, avec accommodement, ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches du poste pour lequel il a postul\u00e9.\n[86] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que le fait de fournir un accommodement au plaignant constituerait pour elle une contrainte excessive. Il y avait des options d\u2019accommodement possible mais l\u2019employeur les a rejet\u00e9es pour des raisons qui, si elles peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de contraintes, sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre excessives, du moins avec la preuve soumise \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[87] Je constate \u00e9galement que dans son argumentaire, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e note au paragraphe 66 : Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception du [deuxi\u00e8me] rapport du m\u00e9decin traitant du plaignant, la STO a m\u00eame fait des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de la CSST afin de voir si celle-ci accepterait de modifier les limitations fonctionnelles \u00e9mises, mais en vain. J\u2019en d\u00e9duis que si la CSST avait lev\u00e9 ces limitations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pris le plaignant \u00e0 son service. Ainsi, on peut se poser la question \u00e0 savoir si la contrainte que semblait percevoir l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne venait pas de sa perception que ses obligations sous la Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles l\u2019emp\u00eachaient d\u2019employer le plaignant. Toutefois, comme nous avons conclu que les obligations de cette loi n\u2019enl\u00e8vent pas l\u2019obligation pour l\u2019employeur de se conformer la Loi, il serait difficile d\u2019y voir une contrainte excessive d\u2019autant plus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019en a pas fait la preuve.\nE. La conclusion sur la discrimination [88] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9nonc\u00e9s, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas retenir le plaignant pour le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service d\u00e9coule d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es, suivant l\u2019article 15 de la Loi.\n[89] La plainte de M. Knight est par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9e.\nF. Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s par M. Knight [90] Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s par le plaignant sont les suivants :\nune ordonnance enjoignant l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grer dans le milieu du travail \u00e0 un poste permanent de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service; une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi; une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi; et le remboursement de certaines d\u00e9penses\n(i) L\u2019int\u00e9gration dans le milieu du travail [91] Le plaignant sollicite une ordonnance, suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, pr\u00e9voyant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019int\u00e8gre dans un poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service comme employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) \u00e9nonce que le Tribunal, lorsqu\u2019il juge qu\u2019une plainte est fond\u00e9e, peut ordonner que l\u2019intim\u00e9e accorde au plaignant, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances et avantages dont l\u2019acte discriminatoire l\u2019a priv\u00e9s.\n[92] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a droit \u00e0 ce redressement puisque la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui eut refus\u00e9 le poste, sont pr\u00e9sentement des employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers. Il demande donc que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de l\u2019int\u00e9grer dans un poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 permanent, r\u00e9troactif au 1er juin 2004. Je constate toutefois que la preuve n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que tous les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 1er juin 2004 occupent aujourd\u2019hui un poste r\u00e9gulier. Certains n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi la p\u00e9riode de probation et ne sont plus \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 que le plaignant aurait pu subir le m\u00eame sort n\u2019est pas \u00e0 \u00e9carter. En ce qui concerne l\u2019int\u00e9gration du plaignant \u00e0 un poste sup\u00e9rieur, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de suffisance de preuve. Le plaignant a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que ce qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible. Il n\u2019a pas rencontr\u00e9 ce fardeau en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e indique qu\u2019il existe une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que le plaignant aurait atteint un poste permanent au moment de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. (Voir Canada (P.G.) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569.)\n[93] Le Tribunal ne peut dans les circonstances acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant et ordonner que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019int\u00e8gre dans un poste r\u00e9gulier de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service. L\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas priv\u00e9 le plaignant d\u2019un tel poste, mais plut\u00f4t de l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir droit \u00e0 une poste sur appel et l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode de probation de postuler pour un poste r\u00e9gulier, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Convention collective de travail.\n[94] Dans la sentence arbitrale Air Canada and I.A.M. (Petelka) (Re), supra, l\u2019arbitre Dissanayake \u00e9tait confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une situation factuelle sur plusieurs points similaires \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente. Voici ce qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 dire relativement \u00e0 une requ\u00eate pour un redressement semblable \u00e0 celui sollicit\u00e9 par le plaignant :\nOutre la question des qualifications et des comp\u00e9tences, avant d\u2019ordonner que l\u2019on attribue un poste particulier au plaignant, je dois \u00eatre convaincu que celui\u2011ci est m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches du poste. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve dont je dispose, je suis incapable de me convaincre un tant soi peu que le plaignant est oui ou non capable de les accomplir. Il serait irresponsable de ma part d\u2019ordonner que l\u2019on attribue un poste particulier au plaignant en l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que celui\u2011ci est capable d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches du poste sans se mettre ind\u00fbment en danger ou sans mettre ind\u00fbment en danger ses coll\u00e8gues de travail. Je ne peux pas non plus d\u00e9cider quels sont les accommodements, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, dont il a besoin pour \u00eatre capable d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre poste. Le personnel de la CAT qui a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le plaignant n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant moi, ni d\u2019ailleurs le m\u00e9decin d\u2019Air Canada. Le Dr Bhatia, le m\u00e9decin personnel du plaignant est le seul expert m\u00e9dical qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Son t\u00e9moignage ne m\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s utile car il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sans jamais examiner les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019escale \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport d\u2019Ottawa. Il n\u2019a m\u00eame pas vu la description du poste. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de circonscrire les t\u00e2ches essentielles de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre poste. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a fait passer aucun examen m\u00e9dical au plaignant pour savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait capable d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle il pourrait accommoder le plaignant si celui\u2011ci devait accomplir des t\u00e2ches qui ne sont pas permises en vertu de ses restrictions. On ne peut pas non plus se fier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation faite par le plaignant quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches. [Traduction]\n[95] Je suis, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, confront\u00e9 \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me similaire. Mis \u00e0 part les comp\u00e9tences professionnelles du plaignant, aucune preuve convaincante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise concernant ses capacit\u00e9s physiques d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches requises pour le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service sans qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait besoin d\u2019un accommodement. En toute conscience, je ne peux \u00e9mettre une ordonnance enjoignant l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019attribuer un poste r\u00e9gulier au plaignant sans \u00eatre convaincu qu\u2019il puisse ex\u00e9cuter ces fonctions. Il m\u2019est \u00e9galement impossible de d\u00e9terminer sur la base de la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise quels accommodements seraient, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, appropri\u00e9s pour le plaignant. La seule preuve m\u00e9dicale que j\u2019ai des capacit\u00e9s du plaignant est celle du Dr Carter, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 les limitations fonctionnelles de celui-ci en consid\u00e9rant les t\u00e2ches du poste convoit\u00e9 et celles du Dr Matte, qui lui a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le plaignant ne pouvait accomplir ces t\u00e2ches sans pour autant avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du plaignant.\n[96] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019intim\u00e9e int\u00e8gre le plaignant dans un poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service, sur appel. Avant toutefois que le plaignant ne d\u00e9bute son travail, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourra proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une expertise ind\u00e9pendante de celui-ci afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer ses capacit\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches requises d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au service et pour \u00e9valuer, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les accommodements qui pourraient \u00eatre requis. Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 cette expertise \u00e9tablit que le plaignant peut accomplir les t\u00e2ches avec ou sans accommodement, le plaignant devra alors se soumettre \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de probation pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la convention collective.\n[97] J\u2019ordonne \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant coop\u00e8rent de bonne foi dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance.\n(ii) L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi [98] Comme deuxi\u00e8me redressement, le plaignant sollicite, en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Selon l\u2019\u00e9valuation faite par le plaignant, il aurait subi, entre juin 2004 et d\u00e9cembre 2006, une perte de salaire de l\u2019ordre de 75 352,84$, en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il r\u00e9clame donc ce montant \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire. Sans pour autant accepter les chiffres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le plaignant, ni le droit de celui-ci de recouvrer ce montant ou tout autre montant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a refait les calculs, en tenant compte de la convention collective, et est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 un montant de 73 019,40$.\n[99] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient premi\u00e8rement et, de bon droit, que le plaignant avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ses pertes. Cette obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les pertes, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9coule du Code civile qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ou de la common law, vise, dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas, le m\u00eame objectif \u00e0 savoir de pallier l\u2019aggravation des dommages en prenant les mesures qu\u2019aurait prises dans les m\u00eames circonstances une personne raisonnablement prudente et diligente. Le d\u00e9faut d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les dommages peut amener \u00e0 une r\u00e9duction substantielle de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et voir m\u00eame au rejet de la r\u00e9clamation du plaignant. La question se pose donc \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable \u00e0 cette obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuation de son pr\u00e9judice. (Voir Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan (C.A.), [1992] 2 C.F. 410, au para. 24.).\n[100] Apr\u00e8s le 27 juillet 2004, date \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant apprenait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne retiendrait pas sa candidature pour le poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, il affirme avoir travaill\u00e9 comme travailleur autonome dans son entreprise de paysagement. Il dit avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 cette entreprise pendant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2003. L\u2019entreprise fonctionnait essentiellement, la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, d\u2019avril \u00e0 ao\u00fbt.\n[101] De septembre 2003 \u00e0 juin 2004, le plaignant dit ne pas avoir travaill\u00e9 car, pendant cette p\u00e9riode il suivait sa formation pour devenir m\u00e9canicien de v\u00e9hicules lourds routiers. \u00c0 partir de juin 2004, il dit avoir repris son entreprise de paysagement. Durant 2004, il dit avoir continu\u00e9 son entreprise au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019hiver o\u00f9 il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire du d\u00e9neigement \u00e0 la souffleuse.\n[102] Le plaignant affirme avoir d\u00e9but\u00e9 une recherche active d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019hiver 2005 en envoyant son curriculum vitae un peu partout. Il ajoute avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses demandes d\u2019emploi essentiellement au Qu\u00e9bec car il consid\u00e9rait sa connaissance de la langue anglaise insuffisante pour postuler pour un poste en Ontario. Il affirme n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u que tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019accus\u00e9s de r\u00e9ception et n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue.\n[103] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve ses D\u00e9clarations de revenus pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 et 2005. Dans ces deux d\u00e9clarations, il d\u00e9clare \u00eatre un travailleur autonome dans le domaine de l\u2019am\u00e9nagement paysager. Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004, son revenu total, selon sa d\u00e9claration de revenus, serait n\u00e9gatif, soit une perte de 3 947,66$. Ce montant comprend 5 464$ en revenu provenant de ses prestations d\u2019assurance ch\u00f4mage et d\u2019un emploi qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9 pendant cette ann\u00e9e et une perte de 9 511,66$, pour le travail effectu\u00e9 dans son entreprise d\u2019am\u00e9nagement. Dans l\u2019\u00e9tat des r\u00e9sultats des activit\u00e9s d\u2019une entreprise pour cette ann\u00e9e, il d\u00e9clare 23 839,34$ en revenu et des d\u00e9penses de 33 251,66$. Entre autres, il d\u00e9clare des d\u00e9penses de 4 448,53$ en publicit\u00e9, des d\u00e9penses de 11 215,97$, relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur et des d\u00e9penses de 14 537,19$ pour des fournitures.\n[104] Dans sa D\u00e9claration d\u2019imp\u00f4t 2005, le plaignant affirme encore une fois avoir eu un revenu n\u00e9gatif de (4 993,31) $. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, son \u00c9tat des r\u00e9sultats des activit\u00e9s d\u2019une entreprise montre des ventes pour un montant de 22 177,34$ et des d\u00e9penses pour un montant de 27 170,65$. Les d\u00e9penses relatives \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent pour cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 14 149,14$ et celles pour la fourniture \u00e0 9 569,59$.\n[105] Il explique les d\u00e9penses en fourniture par l\u2019achat d\u2019\u00e9quipement pour son entreprise, soit une remorque, des tondeuses, des tracteurs, des trimets et des scies. Il ajoute \u00e9galement \u00e0 ces d\u00e9penses en fourniture, l\u2019achat de c\u00e8dres qu\u2019il devait planter pendant ces ann\u00e9es. Il a inscrit dans ses d\u00e9penses une r\u00e9clamation pour les paiements fait sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat hypoth\u00e9caire de sa maison. En contre-interrogatoire, il pr\u00e9cisera que cette d\u00e9pense n\u2019a aucun rapport avec son entreprise et qu\u2019il n\u2019en voit pas la pertinence.\n[106] Pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 et 2005, il d\u00e9clare n\u2019avoir occup\u00e9 aucun autre emploi.\n[107] Je dois admettre que j\u2019ai \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter les chiffres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le plaignant concernant ses revenus pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 et 2005. Bien que je puisse admettre qu\u2019une entreprise puisse fonctionner \u00e0 perte, j\u2019ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que le plaignant ait pu travailler pendant deux ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives sans r\u00e9aliser de revenus. Aucune personne raisonnable n\u2019accepterait de faire fonctionner une entreprise dans ces conditions.\n[108] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004, je constate que les revenus bruts tir\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise du plaignant s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent, selon son rapport d\u2019imp\u00f4t \u00e0 23 839,34$. Si j\u2019accepte comme raisonnable au moins la moiti\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses d\u00e9clar\u00e9es par le plaignant dans sa d\u00e9claration, son revenu net pour cette ann\u00e9e serait alors d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 12 000$. J\u2019accepte ce montant comme repr\u00e9sentant plus raisonnablement le revenu du plaignant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004.\n[109] Dans ses calculs pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004, le plaignant r\u00e9clame un montant de 10 925,00$ comme perte de salaire. Il affirme que s\u2019il avait travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e en 2004, il aurait travaill\u00e9 pendant 25 semaines, soit l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de 575 heures, \u00e0 un taux horaire de 19,00$. Selon la preuve de Madame Plouffe, le taux horaire de la convention aurait plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 de 17,07$ l\u2019heure, pour un salaire de 9 815,25$. J\u2019accepte comme plus fiable les calculs de Madame Plouffe. Prenant en consid\u00e9ration la preuve, je conclus que pour les mois de juin, juillet et ao\u00fbt 2004, le plaignant n\u2019a subi aucune perte de salaire car il travaillait alors \u00e0 son entreprise d\u2019am\u00e9nagement paysager. Toutefois, pour les mois de septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2004, j\u2019\u00e9value sa perte \u00e0 4 000$, soit un peu moins de la moiti\u00e9 du montant calcul\u00e9 par Madame Plouffe.\n[110] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, il d\u00e9clare un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice brut r\u00e9sultant des activit\u00e9s de son entreprise, au montant de 22 177,34$. Encore une fois, je dois conclure que les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame pour cette ann\u00e9e m\u2019apparaissent excessives. En effet, il dit avoir des d\u00e9penses d\u2019entreprise de l\u2019ordre de 27 170,65$, ce qui voudrait dire que pour une deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e de suite il aurait subi une perte nette dans l\u2019exercice de son entreprise. Je consid\u00e8re excessives les r\u00e9clamations pour les d\u00e9penses d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur (14 149,14$ - soit 100% de l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019auto) et celle pour la fourniture (9 569,59$). \u00c0 elles seules, ces deux chefs de d\u00e9penses accapareraient la totalit\u00e9 des revenus de l\u2019entreprise. Il r\u00e9clame encore des frais hypoth\u00e9caires qu\u2019il a reconnu, lors de son contre-interrogatoire, ne pas avoir affaire avec son entreprise.\n[111] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, il serait plus r\u00e9aliste de consid\u00e9rer un montant moindre pour les d\u00e9penses du plaignant. Comme le sugg\u00e8re l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je crois que ce montant pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit de moiti\u00e9, ce qui voudrait dire que pour cette ann\u00e9e les revenus du plaignant serait de l\u2019ordre de 11 000$. Selon les chiffres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Madame Plouffe, le plaignant aurait tir\u00e9 un revenu de 28 736,43$, s\u2019il avait travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e pendant cette ann\u00e9e. Ainsi, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, en tenant compte des revenus de 11 000$, sa perte de salaire se situerait \u00e0 17 000$. Je conclus que la perte de salaire du plaignant pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 est de 17 000$.\n[112] Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, le plaignant n\u2019a soumis aucun bilan en ce qui concerne ses revenus et devant l\u2019absence de preuve, je me vois dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder un montant pour la perte de salaire.\n[113] En conclusion, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 le montant auquel le plaignant a droit au titre de perte de salaire est de 4 000$. Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005, ce montant est de 17 000$. Aucun montant n\u2019est accord\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006, en raison de l\u2019absence de preuve.\n[114] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, le plaignant a donc droit \u00e0 21 000$ au titre de perte de salaire suite \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Ce montant m\u2019appara\u00eet raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve et \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a le plaignant d\u2019att\u00e9nuer sa perte.\n(iii) L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral \u2013 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi [115] Le plaignant r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) un montant de 20 000$ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Je dois admettre que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour soutenir cette r\u00e9clamation m\u2019appara\u00eet pour le moins mince et certainement insuffisante pour justifier le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par le plaignant qui est le maximum pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Quoique le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi accorde une discr\u00e9tion au Tribunal quant \u00e0 l\u2019octroi de divers rem\u00e8des lorsqu\u2019une plainte s\u2019av\u00e8re fond\u00e9e une telle discr\u00e9tion doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es judiciairement et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve devant le Tribunal. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la plainte est accueillie et rien dans le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant ne laisse pr\u00e9sager quelque motif pour lui refuser l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. (Voir Dumont c. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2002 CFPI 1280.)\n[116] Je conviens que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral au plaignant, si ce n\u2019est en terme d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. J\u2019accorde donc une indemnit\u00e9 de 2 000$ au titre de pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(iv) D\u00e9penses encourues \u2013 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c). [117] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) un plaignant peut r\u00e9clamer les frais suppl\u00e9mentaires et des d\u00e9penses occasionn\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant r\u00e9clame le remboursement :\nd\u2019une facture pour repr\u00e9sentation juridique aupr\u00e8s de la CSST, de l\u2019ordre de 312,01$ une facture pour un rapport d\u2019ergoth\u00e9rapie de l\u2019ordre de 55$; et une facture pour un rapport m\u00e9dical de 315,65$.\n[118] Pour la facture de repr\u00e9sentation juridique aupr\u00e8s de la CSST, je ne peux voir comment les d\u00e9marches du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de la CSST peuvent \u00eatre imput\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Cette r\u00e9clamation est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[119] En ce qui concerne la facture pour un rapport d\u2019ergoth\u00e9rapie, on se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un rapport pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par une firme CRD Physioth\u00e9rapie et R\u00e9adaptation. Ce rapport n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. La r\u00e9clamation pour le remboursement de ces frais est donc \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\n[120] La facture pour le remboursement du deuxi\u00e8me rapport m\u00e9dical du Dr Carter est cependant accept\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9e par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation individuelle du plaignant ce deuxi\u00e8me rapport n\u2019aurait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire. J\u2019ordonne donc le remboursement de la facture de 315,65$\n(v) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [121] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat est payable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi). L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat devra \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 selon la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits la personne (03-01-04) soit au taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat courra \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 2 mai 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1116\/9705\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Michel Knight c.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance portant que des mesures sp\u00e9ciales soient adopt\u00e9es quant aux t\u00e9moignages prochains des trois personnes suivantes : Hannya Rizk, Harvey Goldberg et Dean Steacy.\n[2] Ces personnes sont des employ\u00e9s de la Commission. Les circonstances ayant donn\u00e9 lieu au fait que M. Goldberg et M. Steacy soient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ont trait aux affidavits qu'ils ont tous les deux sign\u00e9s peu de temps avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience. Ces affidavits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits par la Commission \u00e0 l'appui de son argument qu'elle s'est conform\u00e9e \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation, une position contest\u00e9e par M. Lemire. L'avocate de M. Lemire, Mme Barbara Kulaszka, a donc demand\u00e9 l'autorisation au Tribunal de contre-interroger ces personnes au sujet de leurs affidavits. Compte tenu que les affidavits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s 17 jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, j'ai ordonn\u00e9 que si Mme Kulaszka voulait contre-interroger les auteurs des affidavits, elle n'avait tout simplement qu'\u00e0 les appeler \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience.\n[3] Mme Rizk, pour sa part, est apparemment l'employ\u00e9 de la Commission qui a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur la plainte de M. Warman. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que, durant son enqu\u00eate, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver un certain nombre des documents contest\u00e9s que M. Warman pr\u00e9tend avoir visionn\u00e9s sur Internet. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que Mme Rizk enqu\u00eatait sur ses activit\u00e9s sur Internet bien avant que M. Warman ne d\u00e9pose la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[4] La question du t\u00e9moignage des trois personnes susmentionn\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience, le 29 janvier 2007, \u00e0 Toronto. Mme Kulaszka a confirm\u00e9 son intention de faire t\u00e9moigner les trois personnes susmentionn\u00e9es, lesquelles r\u00e9sident apparemment toutes dans la r\u00e9gion de la Capitale nationale. Afin de faciliter les choses, Mme Kulaszka a propos\u00e9 que celles-ci rendent leurs t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 Ottawa. Les parties n'ont soulev\u00e9 aucune objection quant \u00e0 ce choix du lieu des t\u00e9moignages et j'ai accept\u00e9 la proposition de Mme Kulaszka. Les t\u00e9moins \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s rendre leurs t\u00e9moignages apr\u00e8s la fin des quatre semaines d'audience \u00e0 Toronto, c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s le 2 mars 2007. Les dates de leurs t\u00e9moignages ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es au 9, 10 et 11 mai 2007, dans les bureaux du Tribunal, au centre-ville d'Ottawa.\n[5] La Commission demande maintenant l'adoption de mesures sp\u00e9ciales concernant le t\u00e9moignage des personnes susmentionn\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir qu'il leur soit permis de t\u00e9moigner par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence \u00e0 partir d'un autre endroit que la salle d'audience du Tribunal. Elles pourront \u00eatre vues par le Tribunal et par les avocats sur un \u00e9cran, alors que les autres personnes, notamment M. Lemire, seront assises dans une autre salle d'o\u00f9 ils ne pourront entendre que la partie sonore des t\u00e9moignages.\n[6] Au cours des quatre semaines d'audience \u00e0 Toronto, la Commission n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune demande quant aux mesures sp\u00e9ciales qu'elle d\u00e9sire maintenant obtenir. Toutefois, le 2 mars 2007, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en annulation des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. J'ai rejet\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate le 14 mars 2007.\n[7] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des copies de nombreux messages affich\u00e9s sur Internet qui, selon elle, montre qu'elle a [traduction] des motifs raisonnables de craindre pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s. Certains de ces messages sont r\u00e9pugnants et tr\u00e8s troublants. Ils comprennent notamment un r\u00e9cit fictif d'une fusillade \u00e0 l'audience du Tribunal, des appels au meurtre \u00e0 l'endroit de M. Warman, des juges ainsi que des membres du Tribunal et des d\u00e9tails concernant l'adresse domiciliaire de M. Warman. Tous ces messages ne portent, \u00e9videmment, aucune signature ou portent la signature d'une personne utilisant un pseudonyme. Je crois comprendre qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur des sites Web bas\u00e9s au \u00c9tats-Unis. Je ne suis saisi d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui permet d'\u00e9tablir un lien entre ces documents et M. Lemire.\n[8] Des photos de M. Warman ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9es sur le Web, ainsi que des photos d'une personne qui appartiendrait \u00e0 un groupe appel\u00e9 Anti-Racist Action. En 2006, avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, des photos de tous les futurs t\u00e9moins experts en l'esp\u00e8ce (les t\u00e9moins de M. Lemire, ceux de la Commission ainsi que ceux du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) ont vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9es par M. Lemire sur une page Web traitant principalement de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Cette page Web figure dans le site Web freedomsite.org. La photo de Madame Karen Mock, l'experte de la Commission, a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re qui, selon elle, est inacceptable. La Commission a fait part de ses objections et, si je comprends bien, au moment o\u00f9 l'audience a commenc\u00e9, la photo de Madame Karen Mock avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e.\n[9] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que la preuve qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e fournit un motif raisonnable de crainte quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 personnelle et professionnelle des t\u00e9moins de la Commission. Cependant, les mesures sp\u00e9ciales que la Commission demande au Tribunal d'adopter n'ont pas trait \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l'audience. Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure, j'ai clairement indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les parties qu'aucune perturbation et aucune intimidation, \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d'audience, ne seraient tol\u00e9r\u00e9es et que je prendrais les mesures appropri\u00e9es pour qu'il n'y en ait aucune. En effet, comme le Tribunal l'a toujours fait dans les cas de plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13, des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en l'esp\u00e8ce. De plus, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident \u00e0 l'audience que la Commission avait mis en place ses propres mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnelles en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 son avocat et \u00e0 ses t\u00e9moins.\n[10] Le probl\u00e8me pour la Commission ne semble donc pas \u00eatre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience mais plut\u00f4t la question de l'identit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la saisie et la publication d'images visuelles des trois t\u00e9moins. La Commission explique la principale raison de sa demande de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[traduction]\nL'apparence physique et l'identit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s assign\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par l'intim\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es et ne doivent pas \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es afin que ceux-ci ne puissent pas \u00eatre reconnus dans leurs vies de tous les jours et qu'ils ne soient pas vuln\u00e9rables lorsqu'ils sont en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et (ou) afin que leurs photos ne soient pas affich\u00e9es sur Internet comme, selon la preuve fournie dans les pi\u00e8ces produites, ce fut le cas pour les experts et pour M. Warman.\n[11] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner qu'aucune demande similaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite lorsque M. Warman et les t\u00e9moins experts ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, il semble cependant que leurs photos figuraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur Internet.\n[12] La Commission m'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions dans lesquelles les tribunaux ont ordonn\u00e9 que des mesures sp\u00e9ciales soient prises concernant les t\u00e9moins. Je souligne toutefois que les mesures sp\u00e9ciales prises dans ces causes ont trait \u00e0 la non-divulgation des noms des t\u00e9moins. En l'esp\u00e8ce, non seulement nous connaissons les noms des t\u00e9moins, mais nous savons que ce sont des employ\u00e9s de la Commission.\n[13] Le choix propos\u00e9 par la Commission aurait pour effet que M. Lemire se verrait priver de la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent dans la salle d'audience pendant que les t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posent. Le paragraphe 52(1) mentionne que l'instruction du Tribunal est publique. Le Tribunal peut, sur demande, prendre toute mesure pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction si le Tribunal est convaincu que certaines conditions sont pr\u00e9sentes :\n52. (1) L'instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction s'il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\n52. (1) An inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\na) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique;\n(a) there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed;\nb) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d'atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique;\n(b) there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public l'emporte sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'instruction soit publique;\n(c) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n(d) there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n(2) Le membre instructeur peut, s'il l'estime indiqu\u00e9, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu'il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la demande vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1).\n(2) If the member or panel considers it appropriate, the member or panel may take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a hearing held in respect of an application under subsection (1).\n[14] Il est important de souligner que les mesures pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 52 visent \u00e0 assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l'instruction. Ce qui est limit\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 52, c'est l'acc\u00e8s du public \u00e0 l'instance et non pas l'acc\u00e8s d'une partie \u00e0 l'instance. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les mesures adopt\u00e9es par le Tribunal afin d'assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 lorsque cela est justifi\u00e9 sont des mesures qui ont pour effet que l'audience est tenue \u00e0 huis clos.\n[15] Ce n'est pas ce que la Commission demande en l'esp\u00e8ce. Sa demande va bien au-del\u00e0 de \u00e7a. Si elle est accueillie, M. Lemire sera exclu de l'audience dans laquelle on examine sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite. Il n'aura pas la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner la preuve. Il sera limit\u00e9 dans l'aide qu'il pourra apporter \u00e0 son avocate et dans les directives qu'il pourra lui donner. Le paragraphe 50(1) pr\u00e9voit que toutes les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. Comme le juge Mackay l'a soulign\u00e9 dans Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications canadiennes c. Canada (Tribunal des droits de la personne) (1re inst.) (Deegan), [1991] 1 C.F. 141, page 153, (C.F. 1re inst.) :\n\u00c0 mon avis, la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations sous-entend la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les observations des autres pour y r\u00e9pondre de fa\u00e7on pertinente dans le contexte de l'enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par le tribunal.\n[16] L'emploi du mot avocat \u00e0 l'article 50 vise \u00e0 garantir \u00e0 une partie son droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. La pr\u00e9sence d'un avocat n'annule pas le droit d'une partie d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente. Chaque partie a le droit d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'instruction, peu importe qu'elle soit ou non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. Ce droit d\u00e9coule non seulement du paragraphe 50(1) mais \u00e9galement de la justice naturelle.\n[17] Je souligne que M. Lemire n'est pas demeur\u00e9 passif au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance m\u00eame s'il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par une avocate. J'ai constat\u00e9 cela tout au long des quatre semaines d'audience. Il a aid\u00e9 Mme Kulaszka de toutes sortes de mani\u00e8re; il a class\u00e9 pour elle les nombreux documents et les nombreuses pi\u00e8ces, il a pris des notes, il lui a propos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 poser, il a m\u00eame, \u00e0 l'occasion, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations au Tribunal. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j'estime que les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Cour dans Deegan, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux pages 153 et 154, sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices :\n[L]es parties \u00e0 une plainte devraient pouvoir assister \u00e0 l'audience et entendre la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et ne devraient pas \u00eatre exclues sans leur consentement en vertu d'une ordonnance d'exclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des t\u00e9moins, qu'elles se repr\u00e9sentent elles-m\u00eames ou qu'elles soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par un avocat, et que l'efficacit\u00e9 de celui-ci ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par l'exclusion comme t\u00e9moin possible d'une partie qui seule peut donner des directives \u00e0 l'avocat.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[18] \u00c0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'audience, M. Lemire a parfois communiqu\u00e9 directement avec le greffe du Tribunal, notamment en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 l'organisation et au format des pi\u00e8ces.\n[19] Dans les observations qu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, Mme Kulaszka conclut que, dans les circonstances, M. Lemire devrait avoir le droit de voir les t\u00e9moins, de voir leurs r\u00e9actions aux questions et de donner des directives \u00e0 son avocate concernant les questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es durant leurs t\u00e9moignages. Je souscris \u00e0 cette opinion. J'ajouterais que je ne vois par cons\u00e9quent aucune raison pour laquelle les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins ne pourraient pas \u00eatre faites en pr\u00e9sence de toutes les parties, dans les bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa.\n[20] Cela dit, les inqui\u00e9tudes de la Commission ne sont pas sans un certain fondement. La preuve indique que des photos du repr\u00e9sentant de Anti Racist Action ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pendant qu'il assistait \u00e0 une autre audience du Tribunal portant sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13. Ces photos ont apparemment \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9es plus tard sur le Web. Selon la Commission, les trois t\u00e9moins craignent que, si leurs photos sont affich\u00e9es, leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 enqu\u00eater sur la diffusion de propagandes haineuses sur Internet puisse \u00eatre compromise. Mme Kulaszka souligne que la photo d'au moins un des trois t\u00e9moins est d\u00e9j\u00e0 affich\u00e9e sur Internet. N\u00e9anmoins, j'estime que cet aspect de la demande de la Commission n'est pas d\u00e9raisonnable. Je soulignerais toutefois qu'on ne m'a soumis aucune preuve selon laquelle des photos qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises au cours des quatre semaines d'audience de la pr\u00e9sente plainte auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9es sur Internet. Il existe cependant une exception. La page Web traitant de la pr\u00e9sente affaire qui figure sur le site Web freedomsite.org comprend des photos prises dans la salle d'audience, au cours d'une pause durant l'instance, de personnes identifi\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant l'\u00e9quipe de la d\u00e9fense, notamment Mme Kulaszka, Paul Fromm (repr\u00e9sentant la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, CAFE) et M. Lemire.\n[21] Dans les circonstances, j'ordonne donc qu'on ne permette \u00e0 personne d'apporter, dans la salle d'audience, des cam\u00e9ras, peu importe la sorte, y compris des cam\u00e9ras d'ordinateur, des cam\u00e9ras vid\u00e9os et des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones munis de cam\u00e9ra. La saisie de toute image visuelle sera interdite. J'ordonne au greffe du Tribunal de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[22] La Commission, \u00e0 titre accessoire, demande que l'on ordonne que toutes les questions pos\u00e9es aux t\u00e9moins [traduction] rel\u00e8vent des param\u00e8tres stricts de la question constitutionnelle en litige, sauf dans le cas de Mme Hannya Rizk qui se fera poser des questions concernant son enqu\u00eate sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[23] La demande est rejet\u00e9e. Les objections que pourraient soulever les parties concernant la port\u00e9e des d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins seront trait\u00e9es par le Tribunal au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'elles seront soulev\u00e9es.\n[24] La requ\u00eate de la Commission, telle que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Par sa requ\u00eate, la Commission requiert de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les Forces canadiennes, la divulgation ou production des notes, des documents et des \u00e9bauches reli\u00e9s \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019expert pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Dr. Pierre Assalian dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, la Commission d\u00e9sire obtenir la divulgation ou la production d\u2019un rapport pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019aurait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le Dr. Assalian et qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006.\n[2] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019objecte \u00e0 la divulgation de ces documents au motif qu\u2019ils sont couverts par le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel et celui reli\u00e9 au litige.\n[3] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage sur sa qualification comme expert, le Dr. Assalian a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur la confection des rapports qu\u2019il fut appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[4] Le Dr. Assalian a expliqu\u00e9 que, lors d\u2019une rencontre survenue \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2005, mandat lui fut confi\u00e9 par Me Morissette, procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u2019\u00e9valuer sur documents si les Forces canadiennes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9es d\u2019imposer une limitation d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Madame Montreuil en raison d\u2019une dysphorie du genre.\n[5] Le Dr. Assalian a, par la suite, expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u les documents dont il devait faire l\u2019\u00e9valuation au d\u00e9but de 2006 et qu\u2019il avait produit, par la suite, une \u00e9bauche de rapport ou rapport pr\u00e9liminaire en conformit\u00e9 avec le mandat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9.\n[6] Selon le Dr. Assalian, l\u2019\u00e9bauche aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en mars ou avril 2006 et transmise, par courriel, au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Me Lamb. Le Dr. Assalian affirme qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir fait parvenir son \u00e9bauche de rapport ou rapport pr\u00e9liminaire au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il a demand\u00e9 de rencontrer ce dernier afin de discuter du document.\n[7] Le Dr. Assalian affirme que, lors de sa rencontre avec le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il a exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de faire une \u00e9valuation clinique de la plaignante, ce qui fut accept\u00e9 par le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[8] Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer les raisons de sa demande, le Dr. Assalian a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait pu se satisfaire d\u2019une \u00e9valuation sur documents, mais qu\u2019il jugeait important de faire une \u00e9valuation clinique afin de confirmer son \u00e9valuation, \u00e9tant d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019un cas high profile, suivant son expression, et envisageant qu\u2019il y aurait contestation s\u2019il y avait analyse documentaire sans examen clinique.\n[9] Le Dr. Assalian, en compagnie de deux coll\u00e8gues, a donc, le 18 mai 2006, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation clinique de la plaignante. Le 21 juin 2006, le Dr. Assalian remettait au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e un rapport sign\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame. Ce rapport para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de la documentation fournie par Madame Montreuil, de l\u2019entrevue r\u00e9alis\u00e9e le 18 mai 2006, ainsi que du test MMPI-2 auquel Madame Montreuil avait d\u00fb se soumettre.\n[10] Il appert donc, du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Assalian, que celui-ci aurait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un premier rapport qu\u2019il aurait transmis au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avant le 24 avril 2006 et qu\u2019il aurait, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019\u00e9valuation clinique de Madame Montreuil, produit un deuxi\u00e8me rapport, le 21 juin 2006.\n[11] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr. Assalian a affirm\u00e9 ne plus avoir en sa possession les notes manuscrites prises en rapport avec l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la plaignante, celles-ci ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truites \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9daction du rapport d\u2019expertise. Il a, de plus, affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas conserv\u00e9 ses documents de travail et qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9tenait aucun dossier m\u00e9dical sur Madame Montreuil.\n[12] Sur la base du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Assalian, il appert donc que le seul document en litige est l\u2019\u00e9bauche de rapport ou le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par celui-ci et remis avant le 24 avril 2006 au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nII. La position des parties A. La Commission [13] La Commission soutient, premi\u00e8rement, que l\u2019\u00e9bauche de rapport ou le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le Dr. Assalian avant le 24 avril 2006 devrait lui \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 ou divulgu\u00e9. Selon la Commission, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un document potentiellement pertinent aux questions en litige et, sur cette base, un document qui devrait lui \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9. Elle s\u2019appuie, en cela, sur les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur l\u2019article 6(1)(d).\n[14] Deuxi\u00e8mement, s\u2019appuyant sur une d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique dans l\u2019affaire Vancouver Community College v. Phillips, Barratt [1987]B.C.J. No 3149, la Commission fait valoir que, tant et aussi longtemps qu\u2019un expert se limite \u00e0 son r\u00f4le de conseiller d\u2019une partie, tous les documents en sa possession demeurent privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et leur communication ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9e de la partie adverse. Toutefois, d\u00e8s que l\u2019expert est appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, son r\u00f4le change et ses opinions ainsi que leurs fondements ne peuvent plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s. La Commission s\u2019appuie \u00e9galement sur un certain nombre d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions qui seraient au m\u00eame effet.\n[15] La Commission soutient, par ailleurs, que le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que les r\u00e8gles applicables sont celles du privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige et qu\u2019en vertu de ces r\u00e8gles, les \u00e9bauches de rapport ou les rapports pr\u00e9liminaires produits par un expert ne sont pas confidentiels dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019expert est appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e [16] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019objecte \u00e0 la divulgation ou \u00e0 la production du rapport pr\u00e9liminaire qu\u2019aurait produit le Dr. Assalian ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006 au motif que celui-ci est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (privil\u00e8ge avocat-client), ce que conteste la Commission.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appuie notamment sur le quatri\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985) ch. H-6 qui se lit comme suit :\nIl (le Tribunal) ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\nElle s\u2019appuie \u00e9galement sur l\u2019article 40 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, L.R. (1985) ch. C-5 qui se lit comme suit :\nDans toutes les proc\u00e9dures qui rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada, les lois sur la preuve qui sont en vigueur dans la province o\u00f9 ces proc\u00e9dures sont exerc\u00e9es, y compris les lois relatives \u00e0 la preuve de la signification d\u2019un mandat, d\u2019une sommation, d\u2019une assignation ou d\u2019une autre pi\u00e8ce s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures, sauf la pr\u00e9sent loi et les autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. (Emphase mise)\n[18] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e plaide qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la preuve doit recevoir application m\u00eame si le litige en est un qui s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre de l\u2019application d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, soit la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e et m\u00eame s\u2019il devait s\u2019en suivre des diff\u00e9rences au niveau provincial quant aux r\u00e8gles de preuve applicables.\n[19] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, les \u00e9bauches, notes, rapports pr\u00e9liminaires d\u2019un expert sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat. En cela, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie principalement sur l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec dans Poulin c. Prat, [1994] A.Q. no 142. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a clairement \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une partie ne peut exiger la production des rapports pr\u00e9paratoires d\u2019un expert, ses notes, ses \u00e9bauches pr\u00e9alables et que ces documents sont couverts par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat.\nC. La plaignante [20] Pour l\u2019essentiel, la plaignante abonde dans le sens de la Commission.\nIII. Analyse [21] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il convient de souligner qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019une question de divulgation de documents en la possession d\u2019une partie, documents que celle-ci serait tenue de d\u00e9voiler en vertu de l\u2019article 6(1)(d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. D\u00e8s lors, la d\u00e9cision rendue par ma coll\u00e8gue Jensen sur une requ\u00eate en divulgation de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission ne saurait recevoir application \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la question en litige, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, n\u2019en est pas une de divulgation mais de production de documents.\n[22] Les rapports d\u2019expertise et les documents qui les accompagnent ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des documents qu\u2019une partie a en sa possession au sens de l\u2019article 6(1)(d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, documents qu\u2019une partie serait tenue de divulguer.\n[23] En tout \u00e9tat de cause, il y a lieu d\u2019op\u00e9rer une distinction entre les documents qui sont en la possession d\u2019une partie au moment o\u00f9 survient un litige et les documents qui sont cr\u00e9\u00e9s dans le cadre d\u2019un litige pour les fins du litige. Les rapports d\u2019expertise et toutes les versions pr\u00e9paratoires, s\u2019il en est, qui s\u2019y rapportent doivent, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des documents cr\u00e9\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiquement pour les fins d\u2019un litige et non comme des documents en la possession d\u2019une partie au moment o\u00f9 survient un litige et qui s\u2019y rapportent.\n[24] Consid\u00e9rer les rapports d\u2019experts comme des documents en la possession d\u2019une partie signifierait que, dans les cas o\u00f9 une partie a obtenu un rapport d\u2019expert pour sa propre gouverne sans intention de le produire ou de faire entendre l\u2019expert, celle-ci serait tenue de le divulguer \u00e0 la partie adverse. Tel ne peut \u00eatre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 6(1)(d) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[25] Les prescriptions de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure couvrent les documents en la possession d\u2019une partie au moment o\u00f9 survient un litige et qui pourraient \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents aux questions en litige.\n[26] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer si une partie peut exiger la production d\u2019un document r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par un expert, que ce soit une \u00e9bauche de rapport ou encore un rapport pr\u00e9liminaire, dans le cours de la r\u00e9daction d\u2019un rapport d\u2019expertise.\n[27] Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, la question qui se pose, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, est celle de savoir si le document r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le Dr. Assalian ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006 en accomplissement du mandat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[28] Si le document fait partie du privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019avocat, il est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et la Commission ne peut y avoir acc\u00e8s. Si le document fait partie du privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige, il pourrait \u00eatre accessible \u00e0 la Commission. Il importe donc d\u2019examiner le sens et la port\u00e9e de ces deux concepts que sont le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\nA. Les privil\u00e8ges [29] La Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il importe d\u2019op\u00e9rer une distinction entre le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige. Elle a raison. En droit canadien, les tribunaux op\u00e8rent une distinction aujourd\u2019hui entre le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et ce, tant en droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois qu\u2019en common law, ces privil\u00e8ges \u00e9tant assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles d\u2019application diff\u00e9rentes.\n(i) Le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou le privil\u00e8ge de la consultation juridique [30] Au Qu\u00e9bec, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie Foster Wheeler lt\u00e9e c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intermunicipale de gestion et d\u2019\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., [2004], 1 R.C.S. 456, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 que, dans le cadre l\u00e9gislatif qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, l\u2019expression secret professionnel vise tant le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat que le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[31] Selon la Cour, le secret professionnel vise tant l\u2019obligation de confidentialit\u00e9 qui impose \u00e0 l\u2019avocat un devoir de discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de son client et, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers, l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de divulgation qui prot\u00e8ge le contenu de l\u2019information contre sa communication forc\u00e9e (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie Foster Wheeler lt\u00e9e c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intermunicipale de gestion et d\u2019\u00e9limination des d\u00e9chets (SIGED) Inc., para. 29).\n[32] Ainsi, le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou, de fa\u00e7on plus restreinte, en droit civil, l\u2019obligation de confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019avocat vis-\u00e0-vis son client, couvre essentiellement les communications verbales et \u00e9crites \u00e9chang\u00e9es entre un avocat et son client. Ces communications sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es et une partie ne peut en exiger la production ni m\u00eame la divulgation (Voir, au m\u00eame effet, Poulin c. Prat, [1994], A.Q. no 142).\n[33] Cela dit, si, en droit qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, les deux privil\u00e8ges se trouvent englob\u00e9s dans le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel, il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que les deux volets doivent, selon la Cour supr\u00eame, \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9s l\u2019un de l\u2019autre (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie Foster Wheeler Lt\u00e9e, C.S.C., 2004, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[34] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la common law, la Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), [2006], A.C.S. no 39, para. 7) qu\u2019il importe, au niveau de l\u2019analyse juridique, de consid\u00e9rer le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige comme des concepts distincts et non comme deux composantes d\u2019un m\u00eame concept. Ces deux privil\u00e8ges sont assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e9gimes juridiques diff\u00e9rents.\n(ii) Le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige ou l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de divulgation [35] En droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, l\u2019immunit\u00e9 de divulgation, \u00e9quivalent du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige de la common law, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une composante du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (voir \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard l\u2019arr\u00eat Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie Foster Wheeler Lt\u00e9e, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 1 et 15). Les deux volets, tels qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, sont toutefois distincts et assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles d\u2019application diff\u00e9rentes.\n[36] \u00c0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, en common law, la Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blank c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 7) que le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige est distinct du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat en raison de leur port\u00e9e, de leur objet et de leurs fondements diff\u00e9rents. Il importe de noter ici que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blank, la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a nullement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu dans Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie Foster Wheeler Lt\u00e9e.\n[37] Suivant l\u2019arr\u00eat Blank, le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige s\u2019applique aux communications \u00e0 caract\u00e8re non confidentiel entre l\u2019avocat et des tiers et englobe m\u00eame des documents qui ne sont pas de la nature d\u2019une communication (Sharpe, cit\u00e9 dans Blank, par. 28: voir \u00e9galement Vancouver Community College c. Phillips, Barratt, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, Jesionowski c. Gorecki, [1992] A.C.F., no 816 Il existe ind\u00e9pendamment du privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat.\n[38] [38] Ayant \u00e9tabli les diff\u00e9rences qui existent entre le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige, il importe maintenant de d\u00e9terminer si le document remis par le Dr. Assalian au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006 en rapport avec le mandat qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tombe sous le privil\u00e8ge du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat ou s\u2019il est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ou non par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Il importe d\u2019examiner cette question \u00e0 lumi\u00e8re des r\u00e8gles de preuve qui r\u00e9gissent la production de rapports d\u2019expertise, tant en droit civil qu\u2019en common law.\nB. Les rapports d\u2019expert [39] En mati\u00e8re de rapport d\u2019expertise, il y a lieu de distinguer, d\u2019une part, les documents utilis\u00e9s par un expert dans le cadre de la r\u00e9daction de son rapport, qui sont des documents pertinents au contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019expert et, d\u2019autre part, les \u00e9bauches de rapport ou rapports pr\u00e9liminaires pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par un expert dans l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019un mandat qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par une partie.\n[40] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, il importe de pr\u00e9ciser que la Commission cherche \u00e0 obtenir, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce ne sont pas les fondements ayant servi \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction du rapport produit par le Dr. Assalian et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel il sera interrog\u00e9, mais le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire ou l\u2019\u00e9bauche de rapport qu\u2019il aurait communiqu\u00e9 au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006.\n(i) Les documents utilis\u00e9s par un expert dans la r\u00e9daction de son rapport [41] D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin est appel\u00e9 comme expert et que son rapport est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve, une partie est en droit d\u2019obtenir copie de tous les documents ayant servi \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport \u2013 les bases documentaires de son rapport. Ceci est n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019avocat qui contre-interroge l\u2019expert puisse, en rapport avec le rapport produit, \u00e9valuer pleinement les tenants et aboutissants de la r\u00e9flexion de l\u2019expert quant au rapport produit, de m\u00eame que son cheminement intellectuel.\n[42] D\u00e8s lors qu\u2019une partie produit en preuve un rapport d\u2019expert, cette partie ne peut garder secr\u00e8te quelque partie que ce soit du rapport. C\u2019est ce qui ressort notamment de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans R. c. Stone, [1999] 2 R.C.S. 290, para. 98.\n[43] En outre, un expert sera tenu de rendre disponible \u00e0 la partie adverse tous les documents en sa possession sur lesquels il s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour r\u00e9diger son rapport. C\u2019est ce qui ressort notamment de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique dans Vancouver Community College c. Phillips, Barratt, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 34. Il importe de noter que cette d\u00e9cision ne concerne pas sp\u00e9cifiquement les \u00e9bauches de rapport ou les rapports pr\u00e9liminaires d\u2019un expert, mais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, dans un sens plus large, aux documents en la possession d\u2019un expert.\n[44] Comme le souligne la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans Vancouver Community College et la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans R. c. Stone, en faisant t\u00e9moigner un expert, une partie renonce \u00e0 tout privil\u00e8ge rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 son rapport. Selon la Cour, d\u00e8s qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la barre, on ne peut plus consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il donne des conseils confidentiels \u00e0 une partie. Il donne une opinion pour assister le Tribunal. Pour cette raison, la partie adverse doit avoir acc\u00e8s aux fondements de telles opinions pour en v\u00e9rifier ad\u00e9quatement l\u2019exactitude (para. 99). (Nous soulignons)\n[45] Plus r\u00e9cemment, l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Stone a re\u00e7u application dans l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans Horodynsky Farms Inc. c. Zeneca Corp. (c.o.b. Zeneca Agro), [2006] O.J. No 3012. Dans cet arr\u00eat, un juge de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario qui \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle 31.06(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile de l\u2019Ontario, a statu\u00e9 qu\u2019une note de service (memorandum) pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par un avocat \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une conversation avec un expert qui avait produit par la suite un rapport devait \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie adverse et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige.\n[46] Selon la Cour, cette note de service pouvait faire partie des constatations, opinions et conclusions auxquelles la r\u00e8gle 31.06(3)des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. En obiter, le juge Gillese de la Cour d\u2019appel devait \u00e9mettre l\u2019opinion que les projets de rapport (draft reports) d\u2019un expert tombaient sous la gouverne de l\u2019article 31.06(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile de l\u2019Ontario.\n[47] Cela dit, il nous appara\u00eet que cette d\u00e9cision a une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e et ne saurait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u2019un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle porte sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du sens des termes findings, conclusions or opinions qui se trouvent \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 31.06(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile de l\u2019Ontario et que le document en litige \u00e9tait une note de service.\n[48] Au Qu\u00e9bec, la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec devait statuer dans Poulin c. Prat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, qu\u2019une partie a le droit de conna\u00eetre les faits sur lesquels l\u2019expert fonde son opinion. Selon la Cour, une partie a le droit de conna\u00eetre les faits sur lesquels l\u2019expert fonde son opinion. Dans cet esprit, elle a s\u00fbrement le droit de conna\u00eetre les sources, documentaires ou autres, o\u00f9 l\u2019expert a puis\u00e9 cette information. Toutefois, ( ) elle n\u2019a pas, pour autant, le droit d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019expert qu\u2019il produise les notes, brouillons, projets de rapport qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport d\u2019expertise final (para. 34).\n[49] Il ressort donc de ces diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9cisions que, d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019un expert est appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, il peut \u00eatre tenu de produire tout document qui a pu servir \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport et \u00eatre interrog\u00e9 sur ces documents. La partie adverse est, en effet, en droit de conna\u00eetre les bases documentaires de son rapport et d\u2019exiger que l\u2019expert produise toute la documentation ayant servi \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport d\u2019expert. La partie qui produit l\u2019expert renonce alors au privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige, que celui-ci soit incorpor\u00e9 ou non au secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat, comme c\u2019est le cas au Qu\u00e9bec.\n[50] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il sera donc loisible pour la plaignante et la Commission, lors de leur contre-interrogatoire du Dr. Assalian, de demander \u00e0 ce dernier de produire tous les documents dont il se serait servi dans l\u2019accomplissement du mandat que lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que ces documents ne soient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en leur possession.\n(ii) Les rapports pr\u00e9liminaires ou les \u00e9bauches de rapport [51] Il appert, qu\u2019en common law, certaines d\u00e9cisions ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que les projets de rapport (drafts) pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par un expert appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans une instance ne sont pas couverts par le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige et qu\u2019un partie peut en exiger la production. C\u2019est ce qui ressort notamment d\u2019un obiter de M. le juge Gillese de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Horodynsky Farms Inc. c. Zeneca Corp. (c.o.b Zeneca Agro), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 38.\n[52] De m\u00eame, dans Chapman Management & Consulting Services Ltd v. Kernic Equipment Sales Ltd, [2004] A.J. No 756, M. le juge McIntyre de la Cour du banc de la reine de l\u2019Alberta conclut, s\u2019appuyant notamment sur la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Vancouver Community College, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, que le d\u00e9fendeur devait produire les projets de rapports (draft versions) de son expert ainsi que tout document en la possession de l\u2019expert ayant servi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de l\u2019opinion de ce dernier (para. 2).\n[53] Cela dit, il ne semble pas, toutefois, y avoir unanimit\u00e9 en common law quant \u00e0 la production de projets de rapport, d\u2019\u00e9bauches de rapport ou de rapports pr\u00e9liminaires en relation avec le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un expert dans une instance donn\u00e9e. Il existe, en effet, en common law, des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires o\u00f9 les tribunaux ont refus\u00e9 de suivre l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e dans Vancouver Community College, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge reli\u00e9 au litige les \u00e9bauches de rapport et les rapports pr\u00e9liminaires d\u2019un expert (voir, par exemple, Kelly c. Kelly, [1990] O.J. No 603), Bell Canada v. Olympia & York Developments Ltd et al., 68 O.R. (2d) 103, Highland Fisheries Ltd v. Lynk Electric Ltd, 63 D.L.R. (4th) 493).\n[54] Dans ce contexte, on ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019en common law, l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit en mati\u00e8re de production de projet de rapport, d\u2019\u00e9bauche de rapport ou de rapport pr\u00e9liminaire d\u2019expert est clair et limpide et ne donne lieu \u00e0 aucune divergence de point de vue. La d\u00e9cision rendue dans Vancouver Community College, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, ne semble pas avoir toute l\u2019autorit\u00e9 que semble lui accorder la Commission. Du reste, la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Vancouver Community College, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, ne portait pas sp\u00e9cifiquement sur la production d\u2019\u00e9bauches de rapport ou de rapports pr\u00e9liminaires mais de documents en la possession d\u2019un expert et qui avaient servi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de son rapport.\n[55] En droit civil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, la Cour d\u2019appel a, pour sa part, \u00e0 quelques reprises, statu\u00e9 que les notes et brouillons, \u00e9bauches et rapports pr\u00e9liminaires produits par un expert font partie du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et qu\u2019ils ne peuvent \u00eatre produits en preuve \u00e0 la demande de la partie adverse (Poulin c. Prat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, Laviolette c. Bouchard, [2001] J.Q. no 3642).\n[56] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Poulin c. Prat, la Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que lorsqu\u2019un avocat, pour pr\u00e9parer la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats de son client, engage un expert, il n\u2019agit que comme mandataire de son client (para. 22). Pour la Cour, autant les communications \u00e9crites qu\u2019orales entre l\u2019avocat et l\u2019expert, sauf circonstances particuli\u00e8res, demeurent confidentielles et sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par le secret professionnel (para. 22 et 26).\n[57] En outre, pour la Cour d\u2019appel, le fait de produire un expert comme t\u00e9moin ne doit pas permettre \u00e0 la partie adverse d\u2019exiger de ce t\u00e9moin qu\u2019il produise tout ce qu\u2019il a en sa possession, telles que notes, brouillons et projets de rapport qu\u2019il pourrait avoir collig\u00e9s et \u00e9crits alors qu\u2019il poursuivait l\u2019\u00e9tude du dossier et la r\u00e9flexion qui devait le mener \u00e0 la formulation de l\u2019opinion d\u00e9finitive qu\u2019il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 partager avec le tribunal. (Poulin c. Prat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 27)\n[58] Dans l\u2019affaire Poulin c. Prat, la Cour devait conclure que les documents recherch\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9chang\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat et l\u2019expert, \u00e9taient confidentiels et soumis au secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (para. 31).\n[59] Il appert donc qu\u2019au Qu\u00e9bec, les r\u00e8gles de droit qui s\u2019appliquent quant \u00e0 la production d\u2019\u00e9bauches de rapport, de projets de rapport ou de rapports pr\u00e9liminaires d\u2019un expert soient beaucoup plus claires si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re les arr\u00eats de la Cour d\u2019appel dans les affaires Poulin c. Prat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et Laviolette c. Bouchard, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. La jurisprudence de la Cour d\u2019appel doit, dans les circonstances, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme d\u00e9terminante en ce qui concerne la production des \u00e9bauches de rapport, des projets de rapport ou des rapports pr\u00e9liminaires d\u2019un expert.\n[60] En terminant, il importe de souligner que, si la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre au c\u0153ur de toute contestation judiciaire, il faut, par ailleurs, accepter que l\u2019expert dont les services sont retenus par une partie puisse, en toute libert\u00e9, s\u2019acquitter du mandat qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par cette partie. L\u2019expert doit pouvoir \u00e9laborer ses opinions et formuler ses conclusions sans craindre que des tiers viennent, \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, saisir des id\u00e9es, des propos qu\u2019il aurait mis sur papier \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait encore en processus d\u2019analyse et de r\u00e9flexion et ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas form\u00e9 une opinion d\u00e9finitive sur une question.\n[61] Il importe que les experts aient l\u2019assurance que leur travail intellectuel ne sera pas \u00e9pi\u00e9 par des tiers. D\u00e9j\u00e0, on peut penser que bon nombre d\u2019experts d\u2019exp\u00e9rience ne conservent pas d\u2019\u00e9bauche de leur rapport ou de notes manuscrites par crainte que ces documents trouvent leur chemin devant le tribunal, exposant alors au grand jour leur d\u00e9marche intellectuelle, susceptible d\u2019\u00e9voluer au gr\u00e9 des informations obtenues et des p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9flexion consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019un dossier.\n[62] Cela dit, il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que l\u2019expert qui est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans une instance donn\u00e9e et qui produit un rapport devra \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie produire tous les documents ayant servi \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport. Cette partie est en droit de l\u2019interroger sur tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ont servi \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de son rapport. Il appartiendra alors au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019expertise produite. En outre, une partie pourra toujours contester le bien-fond\u00e9 des opinions et conclusions d\u2019un expert dans le cadre de son contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019expert ou en appelant son propre expert qui pourrait avoir des points de vue diff\u00e9rents de ceux exprim\u00e9s par l\u2019expert. La m\u00e9decine est \u00e0 la fois une science et un art.\n[63] Certes, il existe toujours un risque qu\u2019un expert se m\u00e9prenne sur son r\u00f4le d\u2019expert et pense qu\u2019il est l\u00e0 pour servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la partie qui le produit comme t\u00e9moin. Il existe \u00e9galement un risque que l\u2019expert se soit laiss\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par les propos tenus par l\u2019avocat qui a retenu ses services ou encore qu\u2019il ait accept\u00e9 de modifier ses conclusions ou ses appr\u00e9ciations \u00e0 la demande d\u2019un procureur. Un contre-interrogatoire habile permettra souvent de mettre \u00e0 jour les carences d\u2019une expertise qui ne soit pas objective.\nIV. Conclusion [64] Le Tribunal en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que le rapport transmis par le Dr. Assalian au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006 est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et doit donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme confidentiel. Il ne peut donc, en vertu de l\u2019article 50(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00eatre admis en preuve.\nV. D\u00e9cision [65] Pour les raisons ci-dessus \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 obtenir la production ou la communication de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de rapport ou le rapport pr\u00e9liminaire soumis au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e par le Dr. Assalian ant\u00e9rieurement au 24 avril 2006 est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 8 mai 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1047\/2805\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Hadjis\n[1] L'intim\u00e9e, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des Postes (SCP), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant au Tribunal d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'entendre la pr\u00e9sente plainte au motif que le d\u00e9lai excessif \u00e0 d\u00e9poser la plainte constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nLe contexte factuel [2] Le plaignant, Raymond Gagn\u00e9, a travaill\u00e9 en tant que commis des postes pour la SCP, \u00e0 Toronto, de novembre 1974 \u00e0 octobre 1988, date \u00e0 laquelle il a obtenu un poste de commis principal des postes au bureau de poste de Ladysmith, en Colombie-Britannique. Il pr\u00e9tend dans sa plainte que, peu apr\u00e8s \u00eatre entr\u00e9 en fonction dans son nouveau poste, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9 en raison de son origine ethnique (canadienne fran\u00e7aise) et de son lieu d'origine (lequel n'est pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la plainte). Il mentionne un certain nombre d'incidents pr\u00e9cis, entre octobre 1988 et avril 1989, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maltrait\u00e9 verbalement et physiquement.\n[3] Les autres incidents de discrimination mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte concernent des actes pr\u00e9cis de harc\u00e8lement qui se seraient produits en septembre 1995. Le plaignant d\u00e9clare que, en d\u00e9cembre 1995, on a diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez lui une maladie mentale, caus\u00e9e dans une certaine mesure, selon lui, par le harc\u00e8lement. M. Gagn\u00e9 soutient que, lorsque sa maladie a empir\u00e9 et a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il prenne un cong\u00e9 de maladie, de janvier \u00e0 mai 1996, la SCP ne pas l'aid\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 obtenir des indemnit\u00e9s d'accident du travail. \u00c0 son retour au travail, l'administration de la SCP l'aurait harcel\u00e9 en le surveillant trop \u00e9troitement en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que ses coll\u00e8gues de travail ont eu la permission de le harceler en faisant circuler de fausses rumeurs sur sa maladie et en s'effor\u00e7ant de faire empirer son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. M. Gagn\u00e9 soutient que l'intensit\u00e9 du harc\u00e8lement a affect\u00e9 sa sant\u00e9 mentale au point o\u00f9 il a d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9. Sa maladie l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail, en cons\u00e9quence de quoi la SCP l'a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2000.\n[5] Cependant, M. Gagn\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne avant le 5 mai 2004. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal le 27 novembre 2006.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, la SCP soutient que le laps de temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les incidents de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9s (de 1988 \u00e0 2000) et aujourd'hui (2007) est excessivement long et constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure justifiant que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de refuser d'entendre la plainte.\nL'analyse [7] La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de traiter la plainte de M. Gagn\u00e9 bien que les derniers incidents de discrimination en cause se soient produits plus d'un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte (en fait, environ 45 mois avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t). Le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser cette d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Ce pouvoir appartient \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir I.L.W.U. (Section maritime) section locale 400 c. Oster, [2002] 2 C.F. 430 (1re inst.), aux paragraphes 25 \u00e0 31).\n[8] Toutefois, si tout le processus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l'audience, du premier acte de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 l'audience, a dur\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point longtemps que le droit de l'intim\u00e9e d'obtenir une audience \u00e9quitable est compromis, le Tribunal a l'autorit\u00e9 de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation (voir Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\u00e9gionale d'Ottawa-Carleton (19 juillet 2002) T701\/0602 (T.C.D.P.) au paragraphe 13; Cremasco c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (30 septembre 2002) T702\/0702 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 71, conf. pour d'autres motifs par Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, [2004] 2 R.C.F. 581 (C.F.)). Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal dans Cremasco, au paragraphe 74, ce n'est qu'une question de bon sens : une commission ou un tribunal doit avoir la capacit\u00e9, dans une certaine mesure, de se prot\u00e9ger contre les parties qui ont recours de fa\u00e7on indue \u00e0 sa proc\u00e9dure.\n[9] L'arr\u00eat-cl\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame en mati\u00e8re de retard dans le contexte d'affaires portant sur les droits de la personne est Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), [2000] 2 R.C.S. 307, 2000 CSC 44. La Cour supr\u00eame a soulign\u00e9, au paragraphe 101, que le d\u00e9lai ne justifie pas, \u00e0 lui seul, un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures comme l'abus de proc\u00e9dure en common law et a ajout\u00e9 que en droit administratif, il faut prouver qu'un d\u00e9lai inacceptable a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice important. La Cour a ensuite affirm\u00e9, au paragraphe 102, que lorsqu'un d\u00e9lai compromet la capacit\u00e9 d'une partie de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte port\u00e9e contre elle, notamment parce que ses souvenirs se sont estomp\u00e9s, parce que des t\u00e9moins essentiels sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s ou ne sont pas disponibles ou parce que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus, le d\u00e9lai dans les proc\u00e9dures administratives peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour contester la validit\u00e9 de ces proc\u00e9dures et pour justifier r\u00e9paration.\n[10] En l'esp\u00e8ce, seule une partie relativement petite de la p\u00e9riode en cause est attribuable \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai administratif de la part de la Commission dans le traitement de la plainte. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en mai 2004 et l'affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal en novembre 2006, soit apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode de 30 mois. Dans ses observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate, la SCP n'a pas [traduction] contest\u00e9 la question du temps qui s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La SCP conteste la question du temps qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris pour d\u00e9poser la plainte. Cela dit, les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada que j'ai cit\u00e9s ci-dessus, \u00e0 mon avis, demeurent applicables. Pour justifier une intervention du Tribunal, l'intim\u00e9e doit prouver que le d\u00e9lai inacceptable lui cause un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable, compromettant ainsi sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte.\n[11] M. Gagn\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 avec un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s de la SCP qui pourraient t\u00e9moigner au sujet de ses all\u00e9gations. La SCP n'affirme pas dans ses observations que certains de ces employ\u00e9s sont morts depuis les faits en cause. Au moins sept d'entre eux ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 ou ont pris leur retraite de la SCP. Fait int\u00e9ressant, M. Gagn\u00e9 souligne que de ces sept employ\u00e9s, cinq avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 quitt\u00e9 la SCP quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame s'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la question de la capacit\u00e9 d'une partie \u00e0 retracer ces individus aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire se serait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9e dans une certaine mesure. De toute fa\u00e7on, je ne suis pas d'avis que, simplement parce que des t\u00e9moins potentiels ont pris leur retraite et ont peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 de leur lieu d'emploi original, il sera in\u00e9vitablement impossible de les retrouver et qu'ils ne pourront alors pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience. Bien qu'il puisse \u00eatre difficile de retrouver ces t\u00e9moins, il ne s'agit pas n\u00e9cessairement d'une t\u00e2che insurmontable et, \u00e0 mon avis, cette difficult\u00e9 ne me permet pas de conclure \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape peu avanc\u00e9e de la proc\u00e9dure que la capacit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte est compromise au point de justifier le refus par le Tribunal de tenir une audience sur la plainte.\n[12] Au stade actuel, rien en l'esp\u00e8ce n'indique non plus que les souvenirs des t\u00e9moins se sont n\u00e9cessairement estomp\u00e9s. Il faut souligner que la majeure partie des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte se sont produits entre 1996 et 2000, c'est-\u00e0-dire il y a de sept \u00e0 onze ans. Il ne s'agirait pas de la premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d'une affaire o\u00f9 des incidents s'\u00e9tant produit depuis environ le m\u00eame nombre d'ann\u00e9es ont fait l'objet d'un t\u00e9moignage (voir par exemple Uzoaba c. Canada (Service correctionnel) (1994), 26 C.H.R.R. D\/361 (T.C.D.P.); Sugimoto c. Banque royale du Canada, 2007 TCDP 5). Je ne peux donc pas pr\u00e9sumer a priori, comme le propose la SCP, que la capacit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 produire une preuve en r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 compromise. Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal dans Bozek c. M.C.L. Ryder Transport Inc., 2002 CanLII 45937 (T.C.D.P.), aux paragraphes 21 et 22, le pr\u00e9judice relatif \u00e0 la preuve doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9.\n[13] En soulignant certaines des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles elle doit faire face pour pr\u00e9parer sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte, la SPC souligne que la plainte manque de pr\u00e9cisions, ce qui emp\u00eache ses t\u00e9moins et elle-m\u00eame de se souvenir des incidents discriminatoires qui se seraient produits il y a entre sept et 18 ans et demi. Cette question me para\u00eet pouvoir \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la proc\u00e9dure de divulgation du Tribunal. Si la SCP croit que l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, lequel comprend les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s des t\u00e9moins, est insuffisant et que les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal exigent la divulgation de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires, la SCP peut d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cette fin. Il ne s'agit pas d'un motif justifiant un refus par le Tribunal d'entendre la plainte.\n[14] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme l'a fait la Cour surp\u00eame dans Blencoe, au paragraphe 104, en adoptant la conclusion du tribunal de juridiction inf\u00e9rieure, je conclus en l'esp\u00e8ce que le d\u00e9lai ne conduit pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une audience d\u00e9pourvue des \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis pour \u00eatre \u00e9quitable. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le pr\u00e9judice sur le plan de la preuve est suffisamment important pour avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'audience.\n[15] Cependant, dans Blencoe, la Cour supr\u00eame a convenu qu'il peut y avoir des circonstances o\u00f9 le d\u00e9lai peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure pour des raisons qui n'ont pas trait \u00e0 la preuve (au paragraphe 115). Le d\u00e9lai doit \u00eatre clairement inacceptable et avoir caus\u00e9 directement un pr\u00e9judice important constituant de l'abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il doit s'agir d'un d\u00e9lai qui, dans les circonstances de l'affaire, d\u00e9consid\u00e9rerait le r\u00e9gime de protection des droits de la personne.\n[16] En l'esp\u00e8ce, bien que le d\u00e9lai soit tr\u00e8s long, particuli\u00e8rement si l'on prend en compte la date du premier acte de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9, soit octobre 1988, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il soit inacceptable au point d'\u00eatre oppressif et de vicier les proc\u00e9dures en cause (Blencoe, au paragraphe 121). La Cour supr\u00eame souligne au paragraphe 122 de Blencoe que la question de savoir si un d\u00e9lai est devenu excessif d\u00e9pend de la nature de l'affaire et de sa complexit\u00e9, des faits et des questions en litige, de l'objet et de la nature des proc\u00e9dures, de la question de savoir si la personne vis\u00e9e par les proc\u00e9dures a contribu\u00e9 ou renonc\u00e9 au d\u00e9lai, et d'autres circonstances de l'affaire.\n[17] D'apr\u00e8s les all\u00e9gations inscrites dans le formulaire de plainte, M. Gagn\u00e9 semble pr\u00e9tendre qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9 au travail, ce qui a contribu\u00e9 au d\u00e9veloppement de sa d\u00e9fience, lequel a \u00e0 son tour constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de le cong\u00e9dier. Les affaires de discrimination diff\u00e8rent des affaires civiles, comme celles portant sur le droit des contrats auxquelles la SCP a fait allusion dans ses observations (Woodheath Developments Ltd. c. Goldman (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 668 (C.S.J.)). Dans les affaires de discrimination, il n'est pas rare que l'acte discriminatoire, de par sa nature, s'\u00e9tende sur une longue p\u00e9riode, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'il est question de harc\u00e8lement. Les tribunaux ont reconnu que les victimes de discrimination ne consid\u00e9reront pas toujours imm\u00e9diatement les actes de l'intim\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires.\n[18] En outre, selon les circonstances, des actes isol\u00e9s ne constitueront pas n\u00e9cessairement du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent dans le temps (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) (Franke), [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (1re inst.)). Dans les affaires de harc\u00e8lement, la nature des efforts que l'employeur a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour emp\u00eacher le harc\u00e8lement ou la fa\u00e7on dont il a r\u00e9agi aux actes de harc\u00e8lement sera souvent en litige (voir le paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi). Pour d\u00e9terminer si un employeur a agi rapidement et de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e dans toutes les circonstances d'un cas donn\u00e9, il faudra bien souvent tenir compte de la connaissance qu'avait l'employeur quant \u00e0 la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 d'un employ\u00e9 donn\u00e9 (Uzoaba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 17). Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve portant sur une p\u00e9riode de temps assez longue peut \u00eatre pertinente.\n[19] Une partie du d\u00e9lai en l'esp\u00e8ce est attribuable aux quarante-cinq mois qu'a pris M. Gagn\u00e9 avant de d\u00e9poser sa plainte. Celui-ci pr\u00e9tend que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur qui l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa plainte plus t\u00f4t et qu'il a produit une lettre d'un m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention. La SCP consteste cette pr\u00e9tention et a soumis une lettre d'un psychiatre contredisant certaines des conclusions du m\u00e9decin de M. Gagn\u00e9. La SCP soutient que la sant\u00e9 de M. Gagn\u00e9 ne l'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa plainte dans le d\u00e9lai d'un an pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi.\n[20] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9, le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9viser une d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de traiter une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode d'un an. Si une partie n'accepte pas la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en l'esp\u00e8ce et veut qu'elle soit r\u00e9vis\u00e9e, elle doit s'adresser \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Qui plus est, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cette affaire est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant le Tribunal en tant que question d'abus de proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 mon avis, il ne convient pas que le Tribunal tire des conclusions relativement \u00e0 une preuve d'expert ou \u00e0 toute autre question de fait en litige sans disposer d'un dossier de preuve complet. Le Tribunal ne doit donc pas tirer de conclusions qui pourraient entra\u00eener un rejet de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne fond\u00e9 sur deux lettres de professionnels de la sant\u00e9 dont l'expertise n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par le Tribunal et qui n'ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9.\n[21] En outre, il semblerait, selon certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, que M. Gagn\u00e9 a bel et bien pris action contre son employeur \u00e0 la suite de son cong\u00e9diement. Le 10 octobre 2002, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son syndicat, invoquant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans motif valable, raisonnable ou suffisant. Il a demand\u00e9 d'\u00eatre r\u00e9tabli dans son poste. Apparemment, le syndicat n'a pas trait\u00e9 l'affaire \u00e0 la satisfaction de M. Gagn\u00e9 et, le 28 mai 2003, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles, pr\u00e9tendant que son syndicat avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de repr\u00e9sentation \u00e9quitable pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 37 du Code canadien du travail. En cons\u00e9quence, il ne s'agit pas d'un cas o\u00f9 un plaignant n'a tout simplement pas r\u00e9agi au dernier incident de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (le cong\u00e9diement) avant de d\u00e9poser sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[22] En conclusion, compte tenu du contexte et des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, je ne suis pas convaincu que le d\u00e9lai soit excessif. Cela ne signifie pas que le Tribunal doit n\u00e9cessairement prendre en compte toute la preuve produite concernant les incidents de 1988 et 1989 ou tout autre incident subs\u00e9quent quand il tranchera la plainte sur le fond. Il peut appara\u00eetre clairement \u00e0 l'audience que les souvenirs des t\u00e9moins sont vagues ou non existants, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le passage du temps et la nature des incidents dont il est question dans le t\u00e9moignage. Il se peut que des documents importants ne soient plus disponibles. La SCP pourrait alors soutenir que le Tribunal ne devrait pas tenir compte de la preuve portant sur ces incidents dans le cadre de sa d\u00e9cision. C'est en fait ce que le Tribunal, dans Uzoaba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 368 et 369, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la preuve soumise concernant des faits qui s'\u00e9taient produits jusqu'\u00e0 19 ans avant l'audience.\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de la SCP est rejet\u00e9e, sans qu'il soit port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit de pr\u00e9tendre ult\u00e9rieurement que le Tribunal ne devrait pas prendre en compte la preuve portant sur un ou plusieurs des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte.\nAthanasios D.

LE REDRESSEMENT\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 20 juin 2003, M. Jim St. John a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Postes Canada ou la SCP) all\u00e9guant que celle-ci avait commis un acte discriminatoire en le d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). En particulier, M. St. John s'est plaint que Postes Canada l'avait envoy\u00e9 chez lui le 27 mai 2003 parce qu'elle ne pouvait plus lui offrir un travail qui cadrait avec ses limites. Postes Canada a ensuite utilis\u00e9 les cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie de M. St. John afin de l'indemniser pour la perte de salaire subie.\n[2] M. St. John soutient de plus que, en mai 2003, Postes Canada a appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite discrimitatoires, aux termes de l'article 10 de la Loi, quand, le 27 mai 2003, elle a envoy\u00e9 chez eux M. St. John ainsi que trois autres employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s du centre de traitement du courrier d'Edmonton (CTCE) plus t\u00f4t que d'habitude et les a pay\u00e9s en utilisant leurs cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie. Ce jour-l\u00e0, Postes Canada avait un faible volume de courrier \u00e0 traiter. M. St. John s'est plaint que c'\u00e9tait la seconde fois qu'il \u00e9tait envoy\u00e9 chez lui en raison du faible volume de courrier. La premi\u00e8re fois s'\u00e9tait produite en 2001.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Commission a cit\u00e9 un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, dont le plaignant, M. St. John, et plusieurs repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat. L'intim\u00e9e, Postes Canada, a cit\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre : Mme Darlene Swabb, la gestionnaire de la section du CTCE, o\u00f9 M. St. John travaillait en mai 2003.\n[4] Lors de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les parties en sont venues \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l'amiable sur la partie de la plainte concernant l'article 7. Cependant, les parties ont fait savoir qu'elles d\u00e9siraient que le Tribunal entende et tranche la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 10. La question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est donc assez simple : en mai 2003, Postes Canada a-t-elle appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de M. St. John et d'autres employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s?\nII. LES FAITS [5] M. St. John est un commis des postes (PO-3) travaillant \u00e0 temps plein au centre de traitement du courrier d'Edmonton (CTCE) de Postes Canada. Il est de quart le jour au CTCE. Bien qu'il y ait une certaine confusion au sujet des heures exactes de son quart de travail, il semble que, en 2003, le quart de jour au CTCE commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 7 h et se terminait \u00e0 15 h. M. St. John est membre d'une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP).\n[6] M. St. John est handicap\u00e9 : il souffre de trouble bipolaire ainsi que de probl\u00e8mes de douleur au bas du dos et aux genoux. La SCP a class\u00e9 M. St. John dans la cat\u00e9gorie des employ\u00e9s ayant une incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente (I.P.P.).\n[7] Du fait de son statut d'employ\u00e9 ayant une I.P.P., \u00e0 partir de 1995, M. St. John a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la section des lettres d'acheminement du flot de valeur des communications (Communication Value Stream) du CTCE. La section des lettres d'acheminement est l'endroit o\u00f9 les enveloppes de grand format et de format normal sont tri\u00e9es et pr\u00e9par\u00e9es afin d'\u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9es au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. Le flot de valeur des communications (les communications) est une section de Postes Canada.\n[8] Dans le but d'accommoder M. St. John, Postes Canada n'a pas oblig\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 travailler dans des sections autres que la sienne, elle lui a permis de ne travailler que durant les quarts de jour et elle n'a pas exig\u00e9 qu'il accomplisse des t\u00e2ches o\u00f9 il devait se pencher, se contortionner ou se tourner en soulevant un poids. Ces modifications \u00e0 sa t\u00e2che de travail ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9es pour permettre \u00e0 M. St. John de travailler dans d'autres sections du CTCE, \u00e0 condition que ses autres limites soient respect\u00e9es.\n[9] Le 27 mai 2003, le CTCE n'avait qu'un faible volume de courrier \u00e0 traiter. En cons\u00e9quence, il n'y avait pas de travail pour M. St. John et les autres employ\u00e9s de sa section. Il y avait toutefois du travail \u00e0 faire ailleurs dans le centre. On a tent\u00e9 de trouver du travail au CTCE qu'aurait pu effectuer M. St. John dans le cadre de ses limites. On n'a rien trouv\u00e9.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, vers 13 h 15, M. St. John et quatre autres personnes, toutes handicap\u00e9es, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s chez eux. Postes Canada a inform\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s qu'ils \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s chez eux parce que, bien qu'il y ait eu du travail \u00e0 faire au centre, il n'y avait aucun travail qu'ils pouvaient accomplir dans le cadre de leurs limites. Afin de prot\u00e9ger les employ\u00e9s d'une perte de salaire du fait de leur renvoi \u00e0 la maison, Postes Canada a utilis\u00e9 leurs cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie.\n[11] Le 13 juin 2003, le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief relativement \u00e0 cette question. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par la suite. Les cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9s.\n[12] M. St. John a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne le 20 juin 2003, parce que, selon lui, la proc\u00e9dure de grief n'avait pas r\u00e9solu toutes les questions. Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il croyait que Postes Canada n'avait pas chang\u00e9 sa ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle on envoie chez eux les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s quand il n'y a aucun travail que ceux-ci peuvent effectuer dans le cadre de leurs limites en p\u00e9riode de faible volume de courrier au CTCE. M. St. John est d'avis que cette ligne de conduite est discriminatoire et il demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 Postes Canada de changer cette ligne de conduite.\nA. Le faible volume de courrier au CTCE [13] Mme Darlene Swabb, la gestionnaire des Communications au moment o\u00f9 les incidents \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte se sont produits, a affirm\u00e9 qu'il arrive parfois, principalement en \u00e9t\u00e9, que le volume de courrier diminue consid\u00e9rablement dans certaines sections du CTCE.\n[14] Mme Swabb a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsque le volume de courrier est faible au CTCE, Postes Canada offre des mesures incitatives \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s afin de r\u00e9duire l'effectif lors de ces journ\u00e9es. Postes Canada offre des vacances pour cause d'employ\u00e9s en surnombre ou des cong\u00e9s sans solde. Quand le nombre d'employ\u00e9s souhaitant prendre cong\u00e9 et le nombre d'employ\u00e9s souhaitant rester est \u00e9tabli, Postes Canada \u00e9value la situation et d\u00e9termine comment r\u00e9partir le personnel dans le centre pour que tous les employ\u00e9s qui restent soient occup\u00e9s \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches productives.\n[15] C'est \u00e0 ce moment que Postes Canada peut d\u00e9cider de pr\u00eater ou de r\u00e9affecter des employ\u00e9s d'une section du centre o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 une autre section du centre et m\u00eame aux d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de courrier de la r\u00e9gion d'Edmonton s'il y a l\u00e0 plus de travail \u00e0 faire \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[16] L'article 14.19 de la convention collective conclue entre le STTP et Postes Canada permet \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de r\u00e9affecter des travailleurs \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches dans d'autres sections du centre quand il n'y a pas suffisamment de travail dans leur section. Selon Mme Swabb, r\u00e9affecter ou pr\u00eater des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres sections constitue un moyen de voir \u00e0 ce que les employ\u00e9s de Postes Canada travaillent \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches productives m\u00eame lorsque le volume de courrier est faible.\n[17] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 que si le volume de courrier devient faible \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 du quart de travail, Postes Canada transf\u00e9rera parfois les employ\u00e9s vers d'autres installations. Mais s'il ne reste qu'une heure ou deux au quart des employ\u00e9s, il ne vaut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas la peine de les envoyer ailleurs, compte tenu du co\u00fbt de transport et du temps n\u00e9cessaire pour expliquer les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 faire. Selon Mme Swabb, il est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des dirigeants de d\u00e9cider s'il vaut la peine d'envoyer des travailleurs vers d'autres installations.\n[18] La possibilit\u00e9 qu'a Postes Canada de transf\u00e9rer des employ\u00e9s d'une partie du centre \u00e0 une autre est assujettie \u00e0 l'interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale visant le recours au [traduction] remplacement. Il y a remplacement quand un employ\u00e9 est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches autres que ses t\u00e2ches habituelles et qu'il est remplac\u00e9 par un autre employ\u00e9. Par exemple, si l'employ\u00e9 A, qui est affect\u00e9 au tri du courrier, est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 dans une autre section pour faire fonctionner la machine de codage et que l'emloy\u00e9 B est affect\u00e9 aux fonctions de tri de l'employ\u00e9 A, il y a alors remplacement. Le pr\u00eat ou la r\u00e9affectation d'employ\u00e9s en vertu de l'article 14.19 diff\u00e8re du remplacement, car aucun employ\u00e9 n'est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 faire le travail de l'employ\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9. En effet, il n'y a pas de raison de le remplacer parce que l'employ\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres sections que s'il n'y a plus de travail \u00e0 faire dans sa propre section, c'est-\u00e0-dire lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait aux exigences op\u00e9rationnelles de sa section.\n[19] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la SCP ne peut recourir au remplacement, car cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der contrevient aux dispositions sur l'anciennet\u00e9 figurant dans la convention collective. Les employ\u00e9s se servent de leur droits d'anciennent\u00e9 pour demander d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 une certaine section ou de travailler selon un certain horaire. Selon Mme Swabb, les d\u00e9cisions arbitrales ant\u00e9rieures ont \u00e9tabli que Postes Canada ne peut modifier unilat\u00e9ralement la demande d'un employ\u00e9 pour affecter un autre employ\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste.\nB. La ligne de conduite de la SCP quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9affectation des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres t\u00e2ches lorsque le volume du courrier est faible [20] Lorsqu'elle r\u00e9affecte les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres t\u00e2ches quand le volume de courrier est faible, Postes Canada doit respecter les limites qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies relativement aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s. Elle ne peut pas demander aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s d'accomplir une t\u00e2che qui ne cadre pas avec leurs limites. Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada a adopt\u00e9 une ligne de conduite concernant les mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 prendre quant aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s lorsque le volume de courrier est faible.\n[21] Mme Swabb a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la ligne de conduite suivie en mai 2003 au CTCE. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, bien que la pratique ne f\u00fbt mentionn\u00e9e nulle part par \u00e9crit, elle a eu l'occasion de donner des renseignements sur celle-ci par \u00e9crit dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique qu'elle a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. John Cherry, un agent de ressources humaines chez Postes Canada. Dans ce courrier \u00e9lectronique dat\u00e9 du 29 juin 2005, Mme Swabb a fait savoir que le processus qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi en mai 2003 \u00e9tait une combinaison des obligations contractuelles en vigueur, des exigences op\u00e9rationnelles et de son interpr\u00e9tation de l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement. Dans ce courrier \u00e9lectronique, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Le cas de tous les employ\u00e9s qui sont vis\u00e9s par l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement fait l'objet d'une discussion avec le syndicat local. Le but de cette d\u00e9marche est de faire en sorte que les employ\u00e9s s'affairent \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches productives tout au long de la journ\u00e9e. Voici les \u00e9tapes que nous suivons lorsque le volume de courrier est faible :\na) La section A a un faible volume de courrier \u00e0 traiter ou n'a pas de courrier \u00e0 traiter.\nb) Le superviseur examine l'\u00e9tat de la situation dans les autres sections pour voir s'il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires pour effectuer le travail dans ces sections.\nc) Les employ\u00e9s sont pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres sections dans la mesure o\u00f9 il y a du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 effectuer et que les exigences de la t\u00e2che cadrent avec les limites physiques des employ\u00e9s.\nd) Nous ne pouvons pas envoyer un employ\u00e9 de la section B vers la section C et le remplacer par un autre employ\u00e9 dans la section B, car ce processus contrevient aux obligations contractuelles.\ne) S'il y a du travail \u00e0 faire dans les autres sections et que ce travail cadre avec les limites physiques de l'employ\u00e9, mais qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires pour terminer le travail avant la fin du quart, alors des vacances pour cause d'employ\u00e9s en surnombre et des cong\u00e9s sans solde sont offerts aux employ\u00e9s de l'ensemble du centre, y compris les employ\u00e9s de la section A, et ce, afin de fournir du travail aux employ\u00e9s de la section A.\nf) Quand des employ\u00e9s acceptent de prendre les vacances ou les cong\u00e9s sans solde suppl\u00e9mentaires, ils sont alors pr\u00eat\u00e9s aux sections o\u00f9 il y a du travail, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce travail cadre avec les limites des employ\u00e9s.\ng) Je ne me suis jamais trouv\u00e9e dans la situation o\u00f9 aucun travail n'a pu \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s n'ayant aucune limite physique. Le travail effectu\u00e9 au centre est vari\u00e9 quant au degr\u00e9 d'effort physique \u00e0 faire, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il y a du travail qui demande beaucoup d'effort physique, du travail qui demande un effort physique moyen et du travail qui demande un effort physique l\u00e9ger.\nh) Si le travail disponible ne cadre pas avec les limites physiques d'un employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es ou ayant une I.P.P., alors il n'est plus possible de satisfaire \u00e0 l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement. L'employ\u00e9 est alors envoy\u00e9 chez lui et doit utiliser ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie. Cette situation ne diff\u00e8re pas de celle o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 se blesse pour la premi\u00e8re fois : s'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il doit rester chez lui et utiliser ses cong\u00e9s de maladie ou son assurance-invalidit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la SCP lui offre du travail qu'il est capable d'effectuer.\n[22] Il \u00e9tait aussi mentionn\u00e9 dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique que le syndicat est inform\u00e9 avant qu'un employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es ou ayant une I.P.P. soit envoy\u00e9 chez lui, faute de travail cadrant avec ses limites. Parfois, le syndicat examinera l'\u00e9tat de la situation dans le centre et proposera des solutions de rechange, s'il y a lieu.\n[23] Mme Swabb a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que Medisys, l'expert-conseil en sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail de Postes Canada, pr\u00e9pare un rapport d\u00e9crivant les limites de chaque employ\u00e9 dont les t\u00e2ches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es ou qui a une I.P.P. Le dossier personnel de l'employ\u00e9, que tous les superviseurs peuvent consulter, comprend une copie de ce rapport.\n[24] \u00c0 l'audience, Mme Swabb a confirm\u00e9 que la ligne de conduite d\u00e9crite ci-dessus est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie en mai 2003. Cependant, Mme Swabb a soulign\u00e9 que la politique officielle de Postes Canada quant aux mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 prendre pour les employ\u00e9s ayant une incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente, laquelle politique figure dans le Guide de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'emporte sur le point d figurant dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique susmentionn\u00e9. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, selon cette politique, la SCP peut au besoin passer outre les dispositions de la convention collective afin de trouver du travail qui peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 par un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9. Cela signifie que le remplacement est permis dans les cas o\u00f9 il s'av\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire si l'on veut trouver du travail \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 lorsque le volume de courrier est faible.\n[25] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Swabb a clairement fait savoir que la ligne de conduite appliqu\u00e9e en mai 2003 n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la politique officielle quant aux mesures d'accommodement. Mme Swabb a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation, la ligne de conduite actuelle appliqu\u00e9e par Postes Canada consiste \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au besoin \u00e0 du remplacement afin de pouvoir trouver du travail \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9.\n[26] Cependant, en mai 2003, M. Ken Sagan, le superviseur de M. St. John \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, a suivi la ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle le remplacement \u00e9tait interdit. En cons\u00e9quence, M. Sagan n'a pas relev\u00e9 certaines t\u00e2ches que M. St. John aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'effectuer le 27 mai 2003. Si M. Sagan avait su qu'il pouvait remplacer certains employ\u00e9s si cela s'av\u00e9rait n\u00e9cessaire afin qu'il puisse trouver du travail \u00e0 M. St. John ainsi qu'\u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, il aurait pu affecter M. St. John \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches dans la section m\u00e9canis\u00e9e des communications au CTCE. Dans la section m\u00e9canis\u00e9e, il y avait du travail cadrant avec les limites de M. St. John et ce travail \u00e9tait effectu\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s. Ce travail aurait pu \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. St. John et les autres employ\u00e9s aurait pu \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres t\u00e2ches dans le centre. M. St. John n'aurait alors pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 chez lui et ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s.\nC. La r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied [27] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 qu'il arrive assez souvent que le volume de courrier \u00e0 traiter au CTCE soit faible. Par contre, il est rare qu'il n'y ait aucun travail pour les employ\u00e9s au CTCE. Quand ces derniers n'ont aucun travail \u00e0 faire au CTCE ou dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, ou s'il n'est pas rentable de les envoyer dans une installation o\u00f9 il y a du travail, la r\u00e8gle veut que Postes Canada n'ait pas le droit de mettre \u00e0 pied des employ\u00e9s; elle doit les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer m\u00eame s'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire.\n[28] Les t\u00e9moins en l'esp\u00e8ce ne s'entendaient pas quant \u00e0 savoir si c'est l'article 53 ou l'article 14.02 de la convention collective, ou une combinaison de ces deux articles, qui interdit \u00e0 Postes Canada de mettre \u00e0 pied des employ\u00e9s quand elle n'a pas de travail \u00e0 leur offrir au CTCE. Fait int\u00e9ressant, il semble qu'aucune disposition de la convention collective ne pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que Postes Canada s'engage \u00e0 ne mettre \u00e0 pied aucun employ\u00e9 quand il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire.\n[29] L'article 53.01 de la convention collective conclue entre le STTP et Postes Canada pr\u00e9voit que les employ\u00e9s permanents ne peuvent \u00eatre mis \u00e0 pied si ceux-ci acceptent d'occuper un autre poste conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie par l'article 53. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont affirm\u00e9 que cette disposition de la convention collective ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 le manque de travail est temporaire. Elle s'applique plut\u00f4t lorsque le manque de travail est permanent et qu'un ou plusieurs postes doivent \u00eatre supprim\u00e9s.\n[30] L'article 14.02 de la convention collective pr\u00e9voit que la semaine normale de travail des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein compte quarante heures, soit huit heures par jour, cinq jours par semaine. Cependant, cet article ne garantit pas que l'employ\u00e9 travaillera quarante heures par semaine ou qu'il sera pay\u00e9 pour quarante heures de travail par semaine, cinquante-deux semaines par ann\u00e9e. M. Darren Steinhoff, un repr\u00e9sentant syndical du STTP pour la r\u00e9gion des Prairies, a affirm\u00e9 que si, par exemple, un employ\u00e9 prenait un cong\u00e9 sans solde, il n'aurait pas le droit d'exiger, en vertu de l'article 14.02, que Postes Canada lui verse son salaire r\u00e9gulier.\n[31] Bien que les parties ne se soient pas entendues sur la source dans la convention collective de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied, tous les t\u00e9moins, tant ceux de la Commission que ceux de l'intim\u00e9e, ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il n'y a absolument aucun travail \u00e0 faire au CTCE ou dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de la r\u00e9gion d'Edmonton, la r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9voit clairement que Postes Canada n'a pas le droit de mettre \u00e0 pied des employ\u00e9s. Ceux-ci doivent recevoir leur salaire r\u00e9gulier jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le volume de courrier augmente, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on leur trouve du travail ou jusqu'\u00e0 ce que leur quart de travail prenne fin.\n[32] Selon la preuve soumise, il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement claire que, lorsqu'il n'y a pas de travail, les employ\u00e9s, qu'ils soient handicap\u00e9s ou non, ne sont pas oblig\u00e9s de prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie, des vacances ou un cong\u00e9 sans solde. Ils re\u00e7oivent tous leur salaire r\u00e9gulier.\n[33] M. Gord Fisher, l'agent des griefs r\u00e9gional du STTP pour les Prairies, a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9, en tant que t\u00e9moin de la Commission, que, en \u00e9change de l'engagement de Postes Canada de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer les employ\u00e9s m\u00eame lorsqu'il n'y a pas de travail pour eux, ceux-ci doivent demeurer sur les lieux si Postes Canada l'exige. M. Fisher a affirm\u00e9 que, lorsque des employ\u00e9s lui demandent pourquoi ils ne peuvent pas rentrer chez eux quand il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire, il leur r\u00e9pond qu'ils sont r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pour travailler huit heures par jour. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils doivent rester sur les lieux de travail et \u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 travailler au cas o\u00f9 il y aurait du travail \u00e0 faire.\nD. La ligne de conduite relative \u00e0 l'application des dispositions sur les cong\u00e9s figurant dans la convention collective [34] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 le volume de courrier est faible, comme ce fut le cas le 27 mai 2003, les employ\u00e9s qui sont malades ou incapables de travailler pour une autre raison ont toujours le choix d'utiliser un cong\u00e9 sans solde, des cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie, des vacances ou tout autre cong\u00e9 applicable pr\u00e9vu par la convention collective.\n[35] Le paragraphe h) de la ligne de conduite dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question ci-dessus ne pr\u00e9voit pas un tel choix pour les employ\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux lorsque le volume de courrier est faible. Il mentionne tout simplement que les employ\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux doivent utiliser leurs cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie ou demander des prestations d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9.\n[36] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 ne pas savoir si M. St. John s'\u00e9tait vu offrir un choix quant au cong\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre avant d'\u00eatre envoy\u00e9 chez lui, mais que, selon elle, il n'avait probablement pas eu ce choix. Toutefois, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si M. St. John avait demand\u00e9 la permission d'utiliser ses vacances ou un cong\u00e9 sans solde, elle le lui aurait permis, comme elle le fait pour d'autres employ\u00e9s qui sont incapables de travailler.\nIII. ANALYSE [37] L'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que le fait de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus.\n[38] L'alin\u00e9a 10b) diff\u00e8re de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) en ce qu'il pr\u00e9voit que le fait de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite ou s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus.\n[39] Rien ne prouve que Postes Canada a conclu une entente avec le syndicat ou toute autre personne relativement \u00e0 la ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle on envoie chez eux les employ\u00e9s ayant une I.P.P. quand il n'y a aucun travail qu'ils peuvent effectuer dans le cadre de leur limites. Par cons\u00e9quent, la disposition applicable en l'esp\u00e8ce est l'alin\u00e9a 10a).\n[40] Dans les affaires en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soumises au Tribunal, il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (l'arr\u00eat O'Malley), \u00e9nonce les lignes directrices permettant de juger s'il existe une preuve prima facie. La Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9 (Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1997), 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6).\n[41] Le fardeau est donc d\u00e9plac\u00e9 vers l'intim\u00e9, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable d\u00e9montrant soit que l'acte discriminatoire en question ne s'est pas produit tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l'acte, d'une fa\u00e7on ou d'une autre, n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire (Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 26). Si l'intim\u00e9 fournit une explication raisonnable, il revient au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que l'explication n'est qu'un simple pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 la discrimination (Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[42] On peut conclure qu'une ligne de conduite ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire s'il est \u00e9tabli qu'elle d\u00e9coule d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi. Selon le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9, pour que la ligne de conduite soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne constituent une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nA. En quoi consistait la ligne de conduite qui aurait contrevenu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi? [43] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, lorsque le volume de courrier \u00e9tait faible au CTCE, en mai 2003, Postes Canada a suivi la ligne de conduite d\u00e9crite par Mme Swabb dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique qu'elle a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. John Cherry. S'il n'y avait pas de travail pour les employ\u00e9s dans une section particuli\u00e8re du centre, une enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait entreprise pour d\u00e9terminer si d'autres sections du centre avaient besoin d'employ\u00e9s pour terminer le travail. Dans le cadre de cette enqu\u00eate, il fallait \u00e9galement examiner s'il y avait du travail que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s pouvaient effectuer dans le cadre de leurs limites. Si d'autres sections avaient besoin d'employ\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires, les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient alors pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 ces sections. Si les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir cadraient avec les limites des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, ces derniers \u00e9taient \u00e9galement pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres sections. Si les autres sections avaient du travail qui cadrait avec les limites des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, mais n'avaient pas besoin d'employ\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires, alors des vacances pour cause d'employ\u00e9s en surnombre ou des cong\u00e9s sans solde \u00e9taient offerts \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du centre afin de lib\u00e9rer du travail.\n[44] Toutefois, Postes Canada ne remplacerait pas un employ\u00e9 pour trouver du travail \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 au CTCE. En d'autres termes, Postes Canada n'affecterait pas un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres t\u00e2ches dans une section du centre o\u00f9 il y a du travail dans le but de premettre que son poste soit occup\u00e9 par un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9.\n[45] Si, apr\u00e8s une enqu\u00eate par ailleurs compl\u00e8te de toutes les possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9affectation d'employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'il n'y avait aucun travail productif cadrant avec les limites des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s, ces derniers \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s chez eux en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations [46] La Commission et le plaignant pr\u00e9tendent que la ligne de conduite \u00e9nonc\u00e9e ci-dessus est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi suivantes de M. St. John et d'autres employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s :\nla chance d'accomplir des t\u00e2ches cadrant avec leurs limites et la chance de recevoir leur salaire r\u00e9gulier pour ce travail; l'occasion de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied qui pr\u00e9voit que, m\u00eame quand il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire, les employ\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent leur salaire r\u00e9gulier; le choix du type de cong\u00e9 qu'ils souhaitent utiliser quand ils sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux.\n[47] Avant de me pencher sur chacune des all\u00e9gations susmentionn\u00e9es, je souligne que les parties n'ont pas d\u00e9battu la question de la signification de l'expression chances d'emploi. Dans l'arr\u00eat Mossop c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1991] 1 C.F. 18, conf. pour d'autres motifs par [1993] 1 R.C.S. 554, le juge Marceau de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, en obiter dictum, que le Tribunal ne devait pas n\u00e9gliger d'analyser si un avantage d'emploi particulier qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 annihil\u00e9 constitue une chance d'emploi aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi. Ni l'une ni l'autre des parties n'a abord\u00e9 la question de savoir si les all\u00e9gations expos\u00e9es ci-dessus constituaient des chances d'emploi selon l'alin\u00e9a 10a).\n[48] \u00c0 mon sens, la port\u00e9e de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'article 10 peut faire l'objet d'une question l\u00e9gitime (voir Mossop, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9; Hay c. Cameco, [1991] D.C.D.P. no 5, no D.T. 5\/91; Cramm c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1998), D.T. 5\/98, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 35, conf. pour d'autres motifs par (2000), 192 F.T.R. 83 (1re inst.); Stevenson c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1984] 2 C.F. 691, aux pages 721 et 722). Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les parties n'ont pas abord\u00e9 cette question, il ne serait pas indiqu\u00e9 que j'examine les questions de savoir si les all\u00e9gations expos\u00e9es ci-dessus constituaient des chances d'emploi au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 10a). Le Tribunal ne peut pas se pencher sur des questions qui ne lui ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises et que les parties n'ont pas abord\u00e9es (voir les d\u00e9cisions Bergeron c. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e., 2005 CF 879, au paragraphe 63, et Beauregard c. Postes Canada, 2005 CF 1384, aux paragraphes 26 et 27). Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je pr\u00e9sumerai que les chances que le plaignant pr\u00e9tend s'\u00eatre vu refuser constituaient des chances d'emploi selon l'alin\u00e9a 10a).\n(i) La chance de travailler et de recevoir le salaire r\u00e9gulier [49] La preuve a \u00e9tabli que, le 27 mai 2003, du travail productif qu'aurait pu faire M. St. John a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s. M. St. John n'a pas pu faire ce travail en raison de l'interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait soumise Postes Canada quant au remplacement. La r\u00e8gle interdisant le remplacement a emp\u00each\u00e9 Postes Canada de relever le travail qui pouvait \u00eatre fait et de l'attribuer \u00e0 M. St. John. En cons\u00e9quence, M. St. John s'est vu refuser la chance de terminer son quart de travail et de recevoir son salaire r\u00e9gulier normal. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas accord\u00e9 cette chance \u00e0 M. St. John pour le motif qu'il \u00e9tait handicap\u00e9.\n[50] Je conclus donc que la Commission et le plaignant ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que, lorsque Postes Canada a envoy\u00e9 M. St. John et quatre autres employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s chez eux avant la fin de leur quart de travail le 27 mai 2003, en application de la ligne de conduite interdisant le remplacement, Postes Canada a commis un acte qui annihilait les chances d'emploi d'employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[51] Postes Canada n'a fourni aucune explication raisonnable justifiant sa ligne de conduite discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. En outre, Postes Canada n'a pas tent\u00e9 de soutenir que sa ligne de conduite d\u00e9coulait d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a). Au contraire, l'avocat de Postes Canada a reconnu que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la ligne de conduite suivie en mai 2003 comportait une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement, elle a omis de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de ses employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne lui causait aucune contrainte excessive. Puisque la ligne de conduite suivie par Postes Canada en mai 2003 \u00e9liminait toute possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement quand les circonstances le permettaient, Postes Canada a bel et bien \u00e9limin\u00e9 un moyen pratique de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. St. John. L'avocat de Postes Canada a affirm\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie que, dans cette mesure, la ligne de conduite applicable \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[52] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e n'a donn\u00e9 aucune explication raisonnable et n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9fense justifiant ses actions en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, je conclus que la Commission et M. St. John ont \u00e9tabli que la ligne de conduite consistant \u00e0 ne pas envisager la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement afin de fournir du travail convenant \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s annihilait les chances d'emploi de M. St. John pour un motif de distinction illicite.\n(ii) La non-application de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied [53] M. St. John et la Commission ont soutenu que la ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle on envoie chez eux les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s lorsqu'il n'y aucun travail que ceux-ci peuvent effectuer dans le cadre de leurs limites constitue un acte discriminatoire non seulement parce qu'elle ne permettait pas aux travailleurs handicap\u00e9s d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches cadrant avec leurs limites, mais \u00e9galement parce qu'il en r\u00e9sultait que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s de Postes Canada ne pouvaient pas se pr\u00e9valoir de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied.\n[54] Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission est d'avis que la simple abolition de l'interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement ne mettrait pas fin \u00e0 la ligne de conduite reproch\u00e9e. Il faudrait plut\u00f4t que la ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle on envoie les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison quand il n'y a aucun travail que ceux-ci peuvent effectuer dans le cadre de leurs limites cesse tout simplement d'\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied, il doit \u00eatre permis aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s de demeurer au travail et de recevoir leur salaire r\u00e9gulier lorsqu'aucune mesure d'accommodement ne peut \u00eatre prise.\n[55] Tel que je l'ai soulign\u00e9 ci-dessus, la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied s'applique quand il n'y a aucun travail \u00e0 faire dans le centre ou dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de courrier, ou lorsqu'il y a du travail \u00e0 faire dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts mais qu'il n'est pas rentable d'envoyer les travailleurs du centre dans une autre installation. Dans ces cas, Postes Canada verse aux employ\u00e9s leur salaire r\u00e9gulier, m\u00eame s'ils n'effectuent aucun travail.\n[56] Selon la Commission et M. St. John, les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s pour lesquels il n'y a pas de travail devraient pouvoir, tout comme les employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s pour lesquels il n'y a pas de travail dans le centre, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied. Essentiellement, l'argument veut que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s pour lesquels il n'y a pas de travail se trouvent dans une situation comparable \u00e0 celle de tous les employ\u00e9s quand il n'y aucun travail \u00e0 faire dans le centre. Pourtant, en raison de la ligne de conduite en vertu de laquelle on envoie chez eux les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s quand il n'y aucun travail qui cadre avec leurs limites, les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s comme M. St. John ne peuvent pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied. Cela constituerait une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[57] Postes Canada a soutenu que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux apr\u00e8s que l'on ait en vain tent\u00e9 de trouver d'autres t\u00e2ches cadrant avec leurs limites ne sont pas mis \u00e0 pied et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne se voient pas refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied. Au contraire, dans des situations comme celle du 27 mai 2003, lorsque le volume de courrier est faible, il y a encore du travail \u00e0 faire dans le centre. On tente alors de trouver du travail productif \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui se trouvent toujours au centre. Si des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux, ce n'est pas parce qu'il n'y pas de travail pour eux, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas en mesure de faire le travail qu'il y a \u00e0 faire. Puisque la ligne de conduite exige que l'on fasse tous les efforts raisonnables possibles pour tenter de trouver d'autre travail aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s avant de les envoyer chez eux, selon Postes Canada, il n'y a pas de discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue.\n[58] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e pour affirmer que le plaignant et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y avait discrimination \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[59] La preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tablissait clairement que la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied ne s'appliquait que lorsqu'il n'y avait absolument aucun travail \u00e0 faire dans le centre ou qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas rentable de transf\u00e9rer les employ\u00e9s dans une autre installation pour qu'ils y effectuent le travail \u00e0 faire. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, lorsqu'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire chez Postes Canada, tant les employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent le salaire auquel ils ont droit pour le quart de travail en entier. Personne parmi ces groupes n'est oblig\u00e9 de prendre des vacances, un cong\u00e9 de maladie, un cong\u00e9 sans solde ou tout autre sorte de cong\u00e9 ou d'indemnit\u00e9 afin de prot\u00e9ger son revenu. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans les situations o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire, tous les employ\u00e9s, qu'ils soient handicap\u00e9s ou non, sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\n[60] Cependant, dans les cas o\u00f9 le volume de courrier est faible, des r\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes s'appliquent. L'article 14.19 s'applique. Les employ\u00e9s sont pr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres sections en fonction de leurs capacit\u00e9s. Le but vis\u00e9 par le pr\u00eat d'employ\u00e9s lorsque le volume de courrier est faible est de faire en sorte que tous les employ\u00e9s qui ont choisi de demeurer au travail effectuent du travail productif. Ce faisant, Postes Canada doit respecter les limites des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s. Elle ne peut pas demander \u00e0 ces derniers d'accomplir des t\u00e2ches qui ne cadre pas avec ces limites. C'est alors que la ligne de conduite d\u00e9crite pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment entre en jeu.\n[61] Si, apr\u00e8s une recherche minutieuse quant au travail \u00e0 faire dans le centre et dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, il est \u00e9tabli qu'il n'y a aucune t\u00e2che que les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s peuvent accomplir, ceux-ci sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux. Il y a du travail \u00e0 faire, mais celui-ci ne cadre pas avec les limites des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s. Ces derniers (y compris le plaignant) ne sont pas priv\u00e9s de l'avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied; quand il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire au CTCE ou dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, tout le monde (y compris le plaignant) jouit de l'application de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans les cas o\u00f9 le volume de courrier est faible, les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s ne sont pas priv\u00e9s de l'application de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pieds en raison de leur d\u00e9ficience, mais plut\u00f4t en raison du fait que le CTCE se trouve dans une situation o\u00f9 il n'y a aucun travail.\n[62] La Commission et le plaignant ont n\u00e9anmoins soutenu que la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied devrait s'appliquer aux travailleurs handicap\u00e9s lorsque le volume de courrier est faible puisque, dans les faits, leur d\u00e9ficience les a mis dans une situation o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de travail. C'est uniquement parce qu'ils sont handicap\u00e9s que les employ\u00e9s sont incapables d'effectuer le travail \u00e0 faire. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce refus d'appliquer la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s lorsque le volume de courrier est faible constitue un acte discriminatoire puisqu'il les prive d'un moyen qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu dans la convention collective en vue de voir \u00e0 ce que les employ\u00e9s soient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s m\u00eame lorsqu'il n'y a pas de travail.\n[63] Cependant, lorsque cet argument est examin\u00e9 de plus pr\u00e8s, il devient clair que la plainte n'est pas r\u00e9ellement fond\u00e9e sur le refus d'appliquer la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied. La v\u00e9ritable source de la plainte serait plut\u00f4t le fait que, lorsque le volume de courrier est faible, la capacit\u00e9 de gagner des revenus du plaignant est in\u00e9gale par rapport \u00e0 celle des autres employ\u00e9s. L'argument devient donc que l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s et les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s quant \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 de gagner des revenus lorsque le volume de courrier est faible est en soi discriminatoire.\n[64] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, cet argument n'est pas fond\u00e9 sur une interpr\u00e9tation exacte des droits et obligations d\u00e9coulant de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L'alin\u00e9a 10a), qui rend discriminatoire une ligne de conduite fond\u00e9e sur un motif de discrimination illicite susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi d'une personne, doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Loi. L'article 2 \u00e9nonce que la loi a pour objet de donner effet au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins.\n[65] Par cons\u00e9quent, la loi ne vise pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une \u00e9galit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats, ou une \u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique, pas plus qu'elle n'accorde aux individus le droit de recevoir un salaire. Elle garantit plut\u00f4t que tous les individus se voient accorder une chance \u00e9gale de participer au milieu de travail, sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec les autres travailleurs.\n[66] En cons\u00e9quence, les employeurs n'ont aucune obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'indemniser les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s qui ne fournissent aucun service (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Tribunal des droits de la personne) (Dumont-Ferlatte) (1997), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/100 (C.F. 1re inst.); Cramm c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (1998), D.T. 5\/98, conf. par (2000), 192 F.T.R. 83 (C.F. 1re inst.), Orillia Nurses' Association c. Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 692 (C.A.), au paragraphe 27). Dans Cramm, le tribunal d'appel a fait remarquer que, si ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas, les employ\u00e9s s'absentant du travail pour cause de maladie ou de blessure auraient le droit d'\u00eatre pleinement indemnis\u00e9s par leur employeur pendant toute leur absence, peu importe sa dur\u00e9e, afin de voir \u00e0 ce qu'ils ne soient pas trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s. Le tribunal d'appel a affirm\u00e9 que ce r\u00e9sultat serait, de toute \u00e9vidence, insoutenable.\n[67] Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'on pr\u00e9sume que Postes Canada a agi avec diligence en cherchant du travail \u00e0 faire, l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans la capacit\u00e9 de gagner des revenus qui pourrait exister entre les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s et les employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s lorsque le volume de courrier est faible n'est pas discriminatoire. Les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s ont eu droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein du milieu de travail. Si l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de gagner des revenus lorsque le volume de courrier est faible n'est pas discriminatoire en soi, alors le refus par Postes Canada de compl\u00e9ter le salaire des employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s au moyen de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied afin d'\u00e9liminer cette in\u00e9galit\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre discriminatoire.\n[68] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus que M. St. John et la Commission n'ont pas \u00e9tabli prima facie que la ligne de conduite emp\u00eachant les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les mises \u00e0 pied apr\u00e8s une recherche exhaustive r\u00e9v\u00e9lant qu'il n'y a pas de travail pour eux est discrimatoire.\n(iii) Le choix du type de cong\u00e9 [69] La Commission et M. St. John pr\u00e9tendent que, en vertu de la ligne de conduite contest\u00e9e, les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas du m\u00eame choix que celui dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les autres employ\u00e9s incapables de travailler en raison d'une incapacit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire que ceux-ci peuvent choisir le type de cong\u00e9 qui est pr\u00e9vu dans la convention collective.\n[70] M. Darren Steinhoff a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage pour la Commission que les employ\u00e9s qui sont incapables de travailler peuvent normalement choisir entre prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie pay\u00e9, un cong\u00e9 de maladie non pay\u00e9, un cong\u00e9 sans solde ou des vacances. M. St. John a affirm\u00e9 qu'on ne lui a pas offert ce choix quand on l'a envoy\u00e9 chez lui le 27 mai 2003.\n[71] La ligne de conduite, telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique que Mme Swabb a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Cherrey, pr\u00e9voyait ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Si le travail disponible ne cadre pas avec les limites physiques d'un employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant du r\u00e9gime des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es ou ayant une I.P.P., alors il n'est plus possible de satisfaire \u00e0 l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement. L'employ\u00e9 est alors envoy\u00e9 chez lui et doit utiliser ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie. Cette situation ne diff\u00e8re pas de celle o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 se blesse pour la premi\u00e8re fois : s'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il doit rester chez lui et utiliser ses cong\u00e9s de maladie ou son assurance-invalidit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la SCP lui offre du travail qu'il est capable d'effectuer. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[72] La ligne de conduite d\u00e9crite ci-dessus ne pr\u00e9voit pas que les employ\u00e9s ont le choix entre diff\u00e9rents cong\u00e9s.\n[73] M. St. John a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 27 mai 2003, on lui a demand\u00e9 de remplir un formulaire de demande de cong\u00e9 de maladie, mais qu'il a refus\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 son refus, Postes Canada a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa banque de cong\u00e9s de maladie et en a d\u00e9duit directement le nombre de cr\u00e9dits appropri\u00e9s.\n[74] M. St. John a de plus affirm\u00e9 que, avant qu'on lui annonce qu'il allait \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 chez lui, tous les employ\u00e9s du centre se sont vu offrir le choix entre prendre un cong\u00e9 sans solde ou prendre des vacances, comme le pr\u00e9voit la ligne de conduite applicable lorsque le volume de courrier est faible. M. St. John a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsque ces possibilit\u00e9s lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, il les a refus\u00e9s, car il est un p\u00e8re monoparental et qu'il a plus besoin d'argent que de cong\u00e9s. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne prendrait pas de vacances, car il utilise ce genre de cong\u00e9 pour g\u00e9rer son niveau de stress afin d'\u00e9viter une pouss\u00e9e active de son trouble bipolaire.\n[75] Toutefois, M. St. John a soutenu que, lorsque Postes Canada lui a annonc\u00e9 qu'il allait \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 chez lui, elle aurait d\u00fb lui offrir une autre occasion de choisir quel type de cong\u00e9 il souhaitait utiliser, puisque, \u00e0 ce moment, il savait qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas possible de recevoir son salaire r\u00e9gulier.\n[76] M. St. John a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement important pour lui de pouvoir g\u00e9rer ses cong\u00e9s de maladie et d\u00e9cider quand il les utiliserait. La nature de son handicap a pour cons\u00e9quence qu'il a parfois besoin d'\u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9 pour des s\u00e9jours pouvant durer jusqu'\u00e0 un mois. En cons\u00e9quence, il doit \u00e9pargner ses cong\u00e9s de maladie afin de pouvoir s'en servir lors de ces p\u00e9riodes d'hospitalisation. Il craint que, si Postes Canada utilise ses cr\u00e9dits pour les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de travail qu'il peut effectuer au CTCE, il ne lui en restera pas suffisamment pour couvrir ses s\u00e9jours \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital.\n[77] La ligne de conduite applicable en mai 2003, en vertu de laquelle on d\u00e9duit automatiquement des cong\u00e9s de maladie quand un employ\u00e9 est envoy\u00e9 chez lui, a priv\u00e9 M. St. John du choix de cong\u00e9 offert aux autres employ\u00e9s incapables de travailler pour quelque motif que ce soit. Cette ligne de conduite a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur la capacit\u00e9 de M. St. John de traiter son handicap. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que M. St. John et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli prima facie que la ligne de conduite concernant le choix du type de cong\u00e9 \u00e9tait susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi de M. St. John.\nL'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[78] Encore une fois, et c'est tout \u00e0 son honneur, l'avocat de Postes Canada a convenu qu'il n'y avait aucune explication raisonnable justifiant de ne pas offrir le choix du type de cong\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux. Il a affirm\u00e9 que ces travailleurs doivent probablement se voir offrir le m\u00eame choix qui est offert \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui, en raison d'une incapacit\u00e9, sont incapables d'effectuer un travail productif.\n[79] Mme Swabb a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la ligne de conduite suivie en mai 2003 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le principe que, si l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait incapable de travailler, il devrait prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que cette situation \u00e9tait due au fait qu'on estimait que l'utilisation de cong\u00e9s de maladie \u00e9tait la fa\u00e7on la plus rapide de prot\u00e9ger le revenu des employ\u00e9s comme M. St. John.\n[80] Mme Swabb a affirm\u00e9 que Postes Canada ne se demandait pas si l'utilisation des cong\u00e9s de maladie d'un employ\u00e9 en son nom pouvait avoir des r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9favorables sur la capacit\u00e9 de ce dernier \u00e0 traiter un handicap, comme dans le cas de M. St. John.\n[81] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Postes Canada n'a fourni aucune explication, ni aucune justification raisonnable quant au refus d'offrir un choix quant au type de cong\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux, je conclus que le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9tabli que la ligne de conduite, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle ne permettait pas \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de choisir le type de cong\u00e9, annihilait les chances d'emploi de M. St. John en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nIV. LE REDRESSEMENT [82] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e la partie de la plainte concernant l'article 7, M. St. John a retir\u00e9 sa demande d'indemnit\u00e9 individuelle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3). Cependant, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) enjoignant \u00e0 Postes Canada de cesser d'appliquer la ligne de conduite, d\u00e9crite par Mme Swabb \u00e0 l'audience et dans le courrier \u00e9lectronique qu'elle a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Cherry, en vertu de laquelle on envoie les travailleurs handicap\u00e9s chez eux.\n[83] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus qu'il ne convient pas de rendre l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e par la Commission. J'estime que la ligne de conduite n'\u00e9tait discriminatoire que dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle contenait une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement et n'offrait pas aux employ\u00e9s envoy\u00e9s chez eux un choix quant au type de cong\u00e9.\n[84] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, l'ordonnance suivante est celle qui convient le mieux dans les circonstances :\nIl est enjoint \u00e0 Postes Canada de cesser d'appliquer l'interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 du remplacement qui formait une partie de la ligne de conduite suivie en mai 2003; Il est \u00e9galement enjoint \u00e0 Postes Canada d'offrir le m\u00eame choix aux employ\u00e9s pour qui aucun autre travail ne peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 que celui qui est offert aux autres employ\u00e9s qui sont envoy\u00e9s chez eux en raison d'une incapacit\u00e9.\nKaren A.

ORDONNANCE\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 13 octobre 2004, Richard Warman (le plaignant) d\u00e9posait, en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), une plainte contre Terry Tremaine (l'intim\u00e9). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9 s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la religion, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la race et la couleur, en recourant aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication.\n[2] La Commission a pleinement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'instruction de la plainte et elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. L'intim\u00e9 a lui aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'instruction.\nII. QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES A. Requ\u00eate de la Commission en exclusion du repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 [3] Le premier jour de l'audience, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d'obtenir une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 M. Paul Fromm, pour une p\u00e9riode d'au moins trois ans, de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal en tant que mandataire ou, subsidiairement, une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre dans la pr\u00e9sente instance en tant que mandataire de l'intim\u00e9.\n[4] La Commission a fait valoir que l'ordonnance devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en raison d'observations faites par M. Fromm \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du syst\u00e8me judiciaire canadien. Selon la Commission, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'observations m\u00e9prisantes. La Commission a \u00e9galement fait valoir que la pr\u00e9sence de M. Fromm devant le Tribunal allait compromettre l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9, l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et le d\u00e9roulement de l'audience. La Commission a ajout\u00e9 que la participation de M. Fromm entraverait la proc\u00e9dure plus qu'elle ne la faciliterait.\n(i) Faits entourant la requ\u00eate [5] Lors d'une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas, tenue le 10 mars 2006, l'intim\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il se repr\u00e9senterait lui-m\u00eame durant l'instance. Puis, le 16 mai 2006, dans ses pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9crites, il a demand\u00e9 l'autorisation de se faire repr\u00e9senter par Paul Fromm. Il a aussi demand\u00e9 qu'ils soient tous deux autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 contre-interroger le plaignant ainsi que les t\u00e9moins de la Commission et du plaignant.\n[6] La Commission s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, en all\u00e9guant divers motifs. Elle a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 le fait que le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9 sont actuellement parties \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s civil. Elle a aussi \u00e9voqu\u00e9 divers articles affich\u00e9s sur Internet par M. Fromm, dans lesquels il critiquait s\u00e9v\u00e8rement le Tribunal, ses membres, les membres de la magistrature et la Commission.\n[7] Selon la preuve produite par la Commission, laquelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e, M. Fromm a tenu des propos m\u00e9prisants \u00e0 l'endroit du syst\u00e8me judiciaire canadien, du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, des membres du Tribunal, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'endroit de la Commission. Il a d\u00e9crit le Tribunal comme \u00e9tant [traduction] un tribunal bidon \u00e0 la sovi\u00e9tique et que ses d\u00e9cisions relevaient de la [traduction] d\u00e9mence stalinienne. Il a dit aussi que les d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal dans les affaires de propagande haineuse mettaient le Canada sur le chemin d'une r\u00e9publique banani\u00e8re du tiers monde.\n[8] M. Fromm a d\u00e9j\u00e0 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autres intim\u00e9s dans d'autres affaires devant le Tribunal.\n(ii) Les points soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire [9] Les points soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire sont les suivants :\nLe Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour interdire \u00e0 une personne de compara\u00eetre devant lui en tant que repr\u00e9sentant d'une partie?\nLe Tribunal devrait-il exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et interdire \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre devant lui?\nLe Tribunal devrait-il exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et rendre une ordonnance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale interdisant \u00e0 M. Fromm, pour une p\u00e9riode de trois ans, de compara\u00eetre comme mandataire dans toutes les audiences du Tribunal?\n(iii) Analyse a) Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour interdire \u00e0 une personne de compara\u00eetre devant lui en tant que repr\u00e9sentant d'une partie? [10] \u00c0 l'appui de sa position, la Commission s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, d'abord un arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick, Thomas c. Association des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers auxiliaires immatricul\u00e9s du Nouveau-Brunswick, (2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 337, puis la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l'affaire Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., [2005] C.H.R.D. n\u00b0 31 (QL).\n[11] Dans l'arr\u00eat Thomas, la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick \u00e9crivait ce qui suit, au paragraphe 10 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nComme je l'ai dit au d\u00e9part, la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale veut que les parties qui comparaissent devant des tribunaux d'arbitrage aient le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des mandataires de leur choix. Toutefois, les tribunaux gardent le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ce droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, pourvu qu'ils exercent ce pouvoir \u00e0 bon droit. C'est parce que les tribunaux sont les ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure qu'ils gardent le droit de veto sur le choix d'un conseiller par une partie. C'est pourquoi une partie \u00e0 une instance d'un tribunal administratif n'a pas le droit absolu d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une personne de son choix, \u00e0 moins que la loi habilitante ne pr\u00e9voie le contraire.\n[12] Dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira, le Tribunal a suivi l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel du Nouveau-Brunswick, ajoutant que, dans les cas o\u00f9 des questions juridiques complexes sont soulev\u00e9es, la participation d'un profane comme repr\u00e9sentant ne peut qu'embrouiller davantage les choses.\n[13] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n50. (1) Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l'interm\u00e9diaire d'un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.)\n50. (1) After due notice to the Commission, the Complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n(The emphasis is mine.)\n[14] L'article 48.9 de la Loi est lui aussi utile. Il pr\u00e9voit notamment que l'instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la repr\u00e9sentation par des non-juristes s'accorde avec cet objet, qui est de faciliter l'acc\u00e8s au Tribunal et de limiter le formalisme. Cette disposition doit cependant \u00eatre lue en m\u00eame temps que l'article 50, si l'on veut savoir qui peut agir pour une partie dans une instance introduite devant le Tribunal.\n[15] L'article 50, qui reconna\u00eet le droit d'une partie d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, \u00e9limine tout doute sur la question de savoir si une partie \u00e0 une instance introduite devant le Tribunal a le droit d'avoir recours \u00e0 l'assistance d'un avocat. Ce que la disposition ne nous dit pas, c'est si le droit \u00e0 l'assistance d'un avocat exclut le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un non-juriste. La version fran\u00e7aise emploie, pour counsel, le mot avocat qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re sans \u00e9quivoque \u00e0 un juriste. Le mot avocat renforce et m\u00eame restreint le sens ordinaire du mot anglais counsel, employ\u00e9 dans la version anglaise. Si l'on consid\u00e8re le mot employ\u00e9 dans la version fran\u00e7aise, on peut conclure que le mot counsel, dans la version anglaise, signifie en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 lawyer.\n[16] Cette conclusion ne signifie pas qu'un non-juriste n'est pas apte \u00e0 compara\u00eetre comme repr\u00e9sentant devant le Tribunal. Dans le jugement ontarien Re Men's Clothing Manufacturer's Association et al and Arthurs et al (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 20 (H.C.J.), et encore une fois dans l'arr\u00eat Thomas c. Association des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers auxiliaires immatricul\u00e9s du Nouveau Brunswick, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, les cours de justice ont reconnu qu'il existe en common law un droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un mandataire, droit qui est tout \u00e0 fait distinct du droit statutaire \u00e0 l'assistance d'un avocat. Le fait que la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment la repr\u00e9sentation par un avocat ne permet pas d'affirmer que le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un non-juriste n'existe pas. L'article 50 de la Loi ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une disposition restreignant ou emp\u00eachant une partie de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience avec le repr\u00e9sentant de son choix. Pour que soit respect\u00e9 l'objet de l'article 48.9, les parties doivent \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 se faire repr\u00e9senter par un non-juriste, quand bien m\u00eame n'aurait il aucune formation ou qualification juridique. Je souscris aux propos tenus par le juge Robertson, de la Cour d'appel du Nouveau Brunswick, dans l'arr\u00eat Thomas, lorsqu'il \u00e9crit, au paragraphe 19 de sa d\u00e9cision : En cons\u00e9quence, les tribunaux h\u00e9sitent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des directives l\u00e9gales pr\u00e9voyant la repr\u00e9sentation par un conseiller comme excluant des personnes qui ne sont pas avocats.\n[17] Tout comme l'article 50 de la Loi n'abolit pas le droit d'une partie d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un non-avocat, aucune disposition de la Loi n'abolit non plus le droit du Tribunal d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et d'exclure les non-juristes. Suivant l'objet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'article 48.9, la participation d'un mandataire ou repr\u00e9sentant doit s'accorder avec le bon fonctionnement du Tribunal et non \u00eatre un obstacle. Il importe aussi de rappeler qu'un mandataire ne compara\u00eet qu'avec l'autorisation du Tribunal.\n[18] C'est l'approche qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Beaudet-Fortin c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 TCDP 23. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a permis au plaignant d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par une personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas avocat. Le Tribunal a dit qu'il r\u00e9pugnait \u00e0 refuser aux plaignants moins fortun\u00e9s la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un non-juriste, dont les services seront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus abordables. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu'aucun pr\u00e9judice ne serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e s'il autorisait un non-juriste \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter le plaignant et que cela ne nuirait pas \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice.\n[19] Dans la d\u00e9cision Fry c. Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national, une d\u00e9cision int\u00e9rimaire, transcription, pages 23-25, en date du 9 mars 1993, le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 un avocat radi\u00e9 \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter un plaignant. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il limiterait la personne concern\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne pr\u00e9senterait pas, et au contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins. L'avocat radi\u00e9 ne fut pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des conclusions de fait ou de droit.\n[20] Encore une fois, dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc, [2005] C.H.R.D. n\u00b0 31, le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 que le plaignant soit repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un mandataire. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant avait l'obligation de convaincre le Tribunal, si celui-ci le jugeait n\u00e9cessaire, que le mandataire \u00e9tait en mesure de faciliter la proc\u00e9dure.\n[21] Il y a aussi d'autres exemples o\u00f9 le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 des non-juristes \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter des parties. Dans la r\u00e9cente affaire Warman c. Harrison 2006 TCDP 30, M. Harrison, l'intim\u00e9, fut autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par sa conjointe de fait, qui n'\u00e9tait pas avocate.\n[22] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, une personne qui compara\u00eet devant le Tribunal a le droit d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le mandataire de son choix. Mais ce droit n'est pas absolu. Le Tribunal conserve le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel de n'admettre comme repr\u00e9sentants que les personnes qui, selon lui, favoriseront le processus d\u00e9cisionnel et non pas le contraire. Dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, le Tribunal est tenu de justifier sa d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal devrait exclure les non-juristes lorsqu'il est convaincu que leur intervention risque de g\u00eaner plut\u00f4t que de faciliter le d\u00e9roulement de l'audience (voir l'arr\u00eat Thomas c. Association des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers auxiliaires immatricul\u00e9s du Nouveau-Brunswick, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 25).\n[23] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question est donc affirmative. Le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour permettre ou interdire \u00e0 une personne d'agir comme mandataire d'une partie.\nb) Le Tribunal devrait-il exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et interdire \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre devant lui? [24] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 trois raisons pour lesquelles le Tribunal devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et interdire \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre devant lui. D'abord, selon elle, M. Fromm avait manifestement fait preuve d'un manque flagrant de respect envers la loi. Deuxi\u00e8mement, sa participation entraverait le processus d\u00e9cisionnel au lieu de le faciliter. Finalement, la Commission a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la relation acrimonieuse existant entre M. Fromm et le plaignant, une relation qui cr\u00e9e un conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et qui nuirait \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[25] J'examinerai d'abord la seconde et la troisi\u00e8me raisons invoqu\u00e9es par la Commission. En ce qui concerne la troisi\u00e8me raison, m\u00eame si je reconnais que la relation existante entre M. Fromm et le plaignant est acrimonieuse, je ne vois pas en quoi ce fait pourrait justifier l'exclusion de M. Fromm en tant que mandataire de l'intim\u00e9. Le Tribunal est tout \u00e0 fait en mesure de composer avec les difficult\u00e9s pouvant r\u00e9sulter de l'hostilit\u00e9 qui r\u00e8gne entre les parties ou entre leurs mandataires. Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve aussi que ni la Commission, ni le plaignant, n'ont expliqu\u00e9 exactement quel conflit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats il en r\u00e9sulterait, et pour qui.\n[26] Quant au second point, celui de savoir si la participation de M. Fromm entraverait le d\u00e9roulement de l'audience au lieu de le faciliter, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'appui de cette affirmation. Le Tribunal ne peut pas rendre une d\u00e9cision en se fondant sur des allusions ou all\u00e9gations qui ne sont pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par des faits.\n[27] Finalement, le dernier moyen invoqu\u00e9 par la Commission \u00e0 l'appui de sa requ\u00eate en exclusion de M. Fromm est plus convaincant, encore qu'il ne suffise pas \u00e0 convaincre le Tribunal d'accorder l'ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e. Il ne fait aucun doute, apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve produite, que, dans bon nombre de ses \u00e9crits, M. Fromm a fait preuve d'un manque flagrant de respect pour le Tribunal et pour ses membres. Il a aussi, \u00e0 maintes occasions, exprim\u00e9 des opinions irrespectueuses envers la magistrature canadienne. Le Tribunal est d'avis que ce sont l\u00e0 des questions qu'une autre instance serait mieux \u00e0 m\u00eame d'\u00e9tudier et, tant que M. Fromm se soumet \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure et \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du Tribunal et qu'il agit d'une mani\u00e8re respectueuse envers lui, il n'y a aucune raison de l'emp\u00eacher d'agir comme repr\u00e9sentant dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[28] La requ\u00eate par laquelle la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et d'interdire \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre devant lui dans la pr\u00e9sente instance est rejet\u00e9e.\n[29] Il n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur le troisi\u00e8me point dans lequel la Commission demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 M. Fromm de compara\u00eetre devant lui en tant que repr\u00e9sentant pendant une p\u00e9riode de trois ans. Le Tribunal voudrait faire une observation sur la proc\u00e9dure employ\u00e9e par la Commission pour pr\u00e9senter la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Elle n'a pas inform\u00e9 M. Fromm personnellement de son intention, alors que l'ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e le toucherait directement. \u00c0 elle seule, cette omission aurait suffi \u00e0 entra\u00eener le rejet de la requ\u00eate ou l'ajournement de l'audience avec autorisation de faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la signification requise de la requ\u00eate.\nB. La preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi devant le Tribunal [30] Au cours de l'instance, l'intim\u00e9 a protest\u00e9 contre le fait que la preuve produite \u00e0 l'audience se r\u00e9f\u00e9rait \u00e0 des articles dont la plainte ne faisait pas express\u00e9ment \u00e9tat. Le m\u00eame point a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, l'intim\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la Commission produise durant l'audience une preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi de l'affaire devant le Tribunal, mais avait fait valoir dans ses conclusions finales que le Tribunal ne pouvait pas tenir compte de cette preuve car elle constituait pour l'essentiel le fondement d'une nouvelle plainte.\n[31] Dans l'affaire Winnicki, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 cet argument. D'abord, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'une requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 13(1) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sur la foi de la preuve produite apr\u00e8s le renvoi. En jugeant qu'une modification de la plainte initiale \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidait d'une mani\u00e8re concluante la question de savoir si les nouvelles all\u00e9gations constituaient le fondement d'une nouvelle plainte, et il \u00e9tait donc impossible de pr\u00e9tendre que la preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi et portant sur ces all\u00e9gations ne pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 l'appui d'une nouvelle plainte. En l'esp\u00e8ce, ni la Commission ni le plaignant n'ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte.\n[32] M\u00eame si aucune requ\u00eate n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e ou accord\u00e9e, le Tribunal est d'avis que la preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce pourrait \u00eatre prise en compte. Cette preuve int\u00e9resse directement la question qui est soumise au Tribunal, celle de savoir si l'intim\u00e9 s'adonnait \u00e0 une violation continue du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. M\u00eame si le formulaire de plainte ne renferme pas express\u00e9ment les mots et par la suite, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans l'affaire Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et dans l'affaire LeBlanc c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (1992), 18 CHRR D\/57, il envisageait la possibilit\u00e9 que des preuves additionnelles soient produites. Dans sa plainte, le plaignant pr\u00e9cise que les deux articles dont la plainte fait \u00e9tat constituaient des exemples de la preuve qui accompagnerait la plainte. Dans la d\u00e9cision Leblanc, le Tribunal avait \u00e0 juste titre estim\u00e9 que, dans un tel cas, la question essentielle \u00e9tait de savoir s'il serait juste d'admettre la preuve. Si la preuve produite n'est pas inopin\u00e9e et si l'intim\u00e9 sait que cette preuve se rapporte \u00e0 des faits tels que celui dont parle la plainte, alors il lui sera difficile de pr\u00e9tendre que l'admission de cette preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi lui causera un pr\u00e9judice.\n[33] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'est pas \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris par surprise en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la preuve. La preuve lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e avant l'audience, et il a reconnu \u00eatre l'auteur des articles. Les articles en question concordent suffisamment avec les all\u00e9gations figurant dans la plainte pour qu'il soit impossible de les consid\u00e9rer comme devant faire l'objet d'une plainte nouvelle ou distincte. Le Tribunal juge par cons\u00e9quent que la preuve post\u00e9rieure au renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 validement admise.\nIII. LES FAITS SE RAPPORTANT \u00c0 LA PLAINTE [34] Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, le plaignant surveille les activit\u00e9s de groupes pr\u00f4nant la supr\u00e9matie blanche et de groupes n\u00e9onazis, qui sont actifs au Canada et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Par l'expression groupes pr\u00f4nant la supr\u00e9matie blanche, il entend les gens ou groupes pour qui les races qui ne font pas partie des races traditionnelles appel\u00e9es race blanche et race aryenne sont inf\u00e9rieures. Lorsqu'il emploie l'expression groupes n\u00e9onazis, il veut dire les groupes ou les individus qui partagent des convictions semblables \u00e0 celles du r\u00e9gime national-socialiste qui fut au pouvoir en Allemagne durant la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale.\n[35] De 2002 \u00e0 2004, le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 pour la Commission comme agent des droits de la personne. Ses fonctions consistaient \u00e0 enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes de violation des droits de la personne. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que ses fonctions, \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e9taient explicitement s\u00e9par\u00e9es de l'enqu\u00eate qu'il menait alors sur les fichiers Internet pr\u00f4nant la haine. Durant son contre-interrogatoire, il a admis que, puisqu'il avait travaill\u00e9 pour la Commission \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente de cette plainte, alors sans doute avait-il surveill\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, mais il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait fait cela en dehors du temps qu'il devait consacrer \u00e0 son travail \u00e0 la Commission.\n[36] Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 que, durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, il a surveill\u00e9 les articles canadiens apparaissant sur un site Web am\u00e9ricain appel\u00e9 stormfront.org, qui, pour lui, est un site pr\u00f4nant la supr\u00e9matie blanche. Ce site Web offre des tribunes o\u00f9 les internautes peuvent transmettre et \u00e9changer des id\u00e9es sur les questions se rapportant \u00e0 la supr\u00e9matie blanche et \u00e0 l'id\u00e9ologie n\u00e9onazie. Ce site Web est facilement accessible au public. Quiconque a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'Internet peut entrer dans ce site et lire les messages affich\u00e9s, encore que la possibilit\u00e9 d'afficher des messages soit r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux membres.\n[37] Le site Web Stormfront est organis\u00e9 sous la forme d'une pyramide. Il y a une tribune o\u00f9 l'usager peut acc\u00e9der \u00e0 diverses cat\u00e9gories de sujets. Quand l'usager clique sur l'un des sujets, un fil de discussion appara\u00eet, ce qui lui permet de lire les messages et permet aux membres de participer \u00e0 la discussion sur le sujet choisi. La nature des articles et leur contenu varient \u00e9norm\u00e9ment sur ces fils de discussion.\n[38] Au cours de sa surveillance de ce site Web, le plaignant a remarqu\u00e9 les \u00e9crits d'un individu utilisant le pseudonyme mathdoktor99, et il s'est mis \u00e0 s'en inqui\u00e9ter. Il a fait une recherche plus approfondie sur la nature des \u00e9crits de cette personne. Il a dit que, apr\u00e8s avoir visionn\u00e9 d'autres \u00e9crits de cette personne utilisant ce pseudonyme, il \u00e9tait persuad\u00e9 que ces \u00e9crits violaient probablement l'article 13 de la Loi. Il a entrepris de rassembler l'information qui pourrait lui permettre d'identifier l'auteur des articles, pour \u00e9ventuellement d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[39] Toute personne qui utilise un pseudonyme pour s'exprimer sur le site Stormfront doit remettre un profil \u00e0 l'administrateur du site Web. Le profil de l'individu se faisant appeler mathdoktor99 comprenait une adresse \u00e9lectronique. Le profil pr\u00e9cisait que cette personne vivait \u00e0 Saskatoon (Saskatchewan) et qu'il s'agissait d'un programmeur analyste travaillant \u00e0 son compte.\n[40] Le plaignant a cherch\u00e9 l'adresse \u00e9lectronique dans le moteur Google. Il a ainsi appris que l'adresse \u00e9lectronique de mathdoktor99 \u00e9tait celle d'un certain Terry Tremaine. L'intim\u00e9 ne nie pas avoir affich\u00e9 les articles en question sous le pseudonyme mathdoktor99.\n[41] Terry Tremaine d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en math\u00e9matiques et en philosophie ainsi qu'une ma\u00eetrise en sciences. Il est \u00e9galement titulaire d'un dipl\u00f4me de programmation et analyse des syst\u00e8mes informatiques. Il a occup\u00e9 pendant un certain temps un poste \u00e0 temps partiel de charg\u00e9 de cours au D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques de l'Universit\u00e9 de la Saskatchewan et, d'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, il a poursuivi une carri\u00e8re en technologie de l'information comme programmeur.\n[42] L'intim\u00e9 a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'est lorsqu'il \u00e9tudiait en vue d'obtenir son dipl\u00f4me de ma\u00eetrise, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, en 1982, que lui sont venues les id\u00e9es expos\u00e9es dans ses articles. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu sa ma\u00eetrise, il a accept\u00e9 un poste d'enseignant \u00e0 Red Deer (Alberta). Comme par hasard, le proc\u00e8s de James Keegstra se d\u00e9roulait alors \u00e0 Red Deer. M. Keegstra avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 en vertu des lois sur les crimes haineux, qui \u00e9taient en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. M. Tremaine a dit qu'il avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience et avait vu M. Keegstra t\u00e9moigner. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s impressionn\u00e9 par ce qu'il avait entendu. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que cela l'avait fait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 ce que l'on pourrait appeler le probl\u00e8me juif.\n[43] Apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience en Alberta, il a entrepris des \u00e9tudes de doctorat dans une universit\u00e9 canadienne, \u00e9tudes qu'il n'a pas termin\u00e9es puisqu'il avait accept\u00e9 un poste d'enseignement aux Bahamas. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, aux Bahamas, il avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 des attitudes plut\u00f4t n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l'endroit des Noirs et de la culture noire. Il est rest\u00e9 aux Bahamas pendant deux ans, puis il est retourn\u00e9 au Canada. Il a produit le t\u00e9moignage suivant : [traduction] J'\u00e9tais alors devenu \"raciste. Il a aussi dit que ses convictions politiques \u00e9taient celles du national-socialisme.\n[44] \u00c0 son retour au Canada, M. Tremaine a travaill\u00e9 dans les technologies de l'information et a obtenu un dipl\u00f4me en informatique. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu ce dipl\u00f4me, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de programmation \u00e0 Saskatoon (Saskatchewan).\n[45] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, vers 2001, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 le nationalisme blanc. C'est \u00e9galement durant cette p\u00e9riode qu'il a d\u00e9couvert le site Web Stormfront. Durant quelque temps, il ne fut qu'un lecteur de ce site, mais, au bout de deux ou trois mois, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'en devenir membre et s'est mis \u00e0 y afficher ses articles. Au cours de l'audience, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait affich\u00e9 au moins 1 900 messages sur ce site.\n[46] C'est le 8 avril 2005 que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Le 11 avril 2005, puis de nouveau le 23 juillet 2005, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident de l'Universit\u00e9 de la Saskatchewan, l'employeur de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, pour le renseigner sur les activit\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9. Le 4 ao\u00fbt 2005, le vice-recteur de l'Universit\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu au plaignant pour l'informer que la Direction des ressources humaines de l'Universit\u00e9 avait enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur l'affaire et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin, le 30 avril 2005, aux fonctions exerc\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9.\n[47] Apr\u00e8s son renvoi de l'Universit\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 est all\u00e9 vivre sur la c\u00f4te Ouest (en Colombie-Britannique). Selon lui, il avait peur et se sentait d\u00e9prim\u00e9. En septembre 2005, il est retourn\u00e9 en Saskatchewan et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre admis \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement psychiatrique Qu'Appelle de Regina, pour traiter sa d\u00e9pression. Durant son s\u00e9jour dans cet \u00e9tablissement, il a \u00e9crit, le 30 septembre 2005, une lettre de quatre pages \u00e0 la Commission. Dans cette lettre, il \u00e9crivait que les articles qu'il avait affich\u00e9s sur le site Stormfront \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 ses ennuis de sant\u00e9 mentale. La lettre pr\u00e9cisait qu'il [traduction] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en proie \u00e0 un d\u00e9lire et s'\u00e9tait mis \u00e0 imaginer des complots d'envergure qui se tramaient derri\u00e8re les \u00e9v\u00e9nements mondiaux. Mes pens\u00e9es d\u00e9lirantes comportaient notamment l'id\u00e9e d'une conspiration mondiale juive. Puis il ajoute : [traduction] Je souligne qu'il s'agissait de pens\u00e9es d\u00e9lirantes qui me rendent profond\u00e9ment honteux et dont je me sens coupable. Les mots ne sauraient d\u00e9crire la profondeur de ma honte. J'en suis tourment\u00e9 chaque jour. Je m\u00e9prise et d\u00e9teste tout ce que j'ai \u00e9crit sur Stormfront et j'aimerais n'avoir jamais entendu parler de ce site. La Commission n'a nullement \u00e0 craindre d'autres activit\u00e9s semblables de ma part sur le site Stormfront ou n'importe o\u00f9 ailleurs.\n[48] Il poursuit ainsi : [traduction] Avant mars 2001, j'\u00e9tais un homme d\u00e9cent et normal, sans aucun penchant au racisme ou \u00e0 l'intol\u00e9rance. En 2001, j'ai subi un changement destructif de personnalit\u00e9 qui a fait de moi quelqu'un dont les seuls mots qui pouvaient me qualifier \u00e9taient malade et d\u00e9rang\u00e9. Cela m'a finalement conduit \u00e0 afficher des articles sur Stormfront. Il ajoute aussi : [traduction] Au cours des mois qui ont suivi le d\u00e9p\u00f4t contre moi de la plainte de violation des droits de la personne, la honte et le remords se sont empar\u00e9s de moi au point que cela m'est devenu insupportable, et je suis retomb\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9pression nerveuse.\n[49] Il exprime ensuite son remords et l'espoir qu'il recouvrera son [TRADUCTION] v\u00e9ritable sens de la morale et de la d\u00e9cence, et il conclut par ces mots : [TRADUCTION] j'exprime mon regret le plus profond, ma honte et mon remords \u00e0 tous les membres de la communaut\u00e9 juive contre lesquels \u00e9taient dirig\u00e9s bon nombre de mes articles. Je regrette vraiment au plus profond de moi m\u00eame tout ce que j'ai \u00e9crit sur Stormfront, en particulier \u00e0 propos de la communaut\u00e9 juive.\n[50] La Commission n'a jamais r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette lettre et elle n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle ne l'a pas fait. Le plaignant, pour sa part, a expliqu\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire qu'il ne se rappelait pas s'il avait effectivement vu la lettre ou si la Commission lui avait remis un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son contenu. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait dit \u00e0 la Commission que, si la lettre de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait sinc\u00e8re, alors elle \u00e9tait pour lui d'un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il a dit qu'il souhaitait essentiellement n\u00e9gocier un r\u00e8glement concernant la plainte, sous r\u00e9serve que soit rendue au pr\u00e9alable une ordonnance permanente de cesser et de s'abstenir et que soient prononc\u00e9s les autres recours qui s'imposent. Il n'en a rien r\u00e9sult\u00e9 et il semble que personne n'a approch\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 pour \u00e9tudier davantage les points soulev\u00e9s dans la lettre.\n[51] Durant son interrogatoire, l'intim\u00e9 a cat\u00e9goriquement d\u00e9savou\u00e9 le contenu de la lettre susmentionn\u00e9e et n'a jamais contest\u00e9 sa recevabilit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 une r\u00e9tractation qu'il a affich\u00e9e sur Stormfront le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2006. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que, sauf quelques modifications mineures, il r\u00e9it\u00e8re aujourd'hui tout ce qu'il a \u00e9crit sur Stormfront. Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, l'intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 son \u00e9tat d'esprit \u00e0 propos de ses articles affich\u00e9s sur Stormfront, ainsi que son point de vue sur les Juifs et les Noirs. Il n'\u00e9prouvait certainement aucun remords pour les d\u00e9clarations qu'il avait faites, et il a dit que, si l'occasion lui en \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e, il les r\u00e9p\u00e9terait sans h\u00e9siter.\n[52] L'identit\u00e9 de l'auteur des articles \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, ainsi que des articles post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la plainte, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute; l'intim\u00e9 admet que tous ces articles sont de lui. Il \u00e9tait un auteur tr\u00e8s prolifique et prolixe, qui, dans la plupart de ses \u00e9crits, camouflait ses id\u00e9es sous l'habit du d\u00e9bat acad\u00e9mique, en recourant tr\u00e8s souvent \u00e0 ce qu'il pr\u00e9tendait \u00eatre des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et des faits historiques pour appuyer ses affirmations. Ses articles entraient pour l'essentiel dans l'une de deux cat\u00e9gories : ceux qui passent pour des articles de nature sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, et ceux qui constituent des communications directes avec d'autres participants. Le ton de certains de ces articles, m\u00eame s'ils n'observaient en aucune fa\u00e7on les normes rigoureuses des \u00e9crits sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, pouvait donner un air de l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u00e0 leur contenu aux yeux d'un lecteur cr\u00e9dule.\n[53] Le premier document produit comme preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2004 sur le site Web Stormfront. L'intim\u00e9 participait \u00e0 une discussion sur un fil intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Un v\u00e9ritable holocauste est-il en vue? Il a ensuite affich\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Le Juif ne peut s'emp\u00eacher d'\u00eatre un Juif, tout comme un rat ne peut s'emp\u00eacher d'\u00eatre un rat. Il qualifiait ensuite les Juifs de [traduction] race parasite. Il ajoutait que [traduction] nulle population h\u00f4te le moindrement saine ne peut tol\u00e9rer qu'un parasite se nourrisse d'elle sans \u00e9ventuellement le rejeter. Finalement, il concluait qu'[traduction] aucune conf\u00e9rence sur l'antis\u00e9mitisme n'aidera le Juif \u00e0 se soustraire au destin qui est le sien depuis longtemps.\n[54] \u00c0 nouveau, le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2004, il affichait sur un fil de discussion un autre article intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Objet : Une vue de l'int\u00e9rieur (pour tous les antis). Dans cet \u00e9crit, l'intim\u00e9 parle encore des Juifs comme d'une race parasite qui se repa\u00eet [traduction] de paroles cauteleuses, d'op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res astucieuses et d'un manque total d'\u00e9thique envers les non-Juifs.\n[55] Dans un article du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2004, sur un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Votre r\u00e9veil?, l'intim\u00e9 explique comment il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 adopter les id\u00e9es de la [traduction] communaut\u00e9 nationaliste blanche. Il raconte que, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es quatre-vingt-dix, il avait accept\u00e9 un poste d'enseignant dans un pays des Cara\u00efbes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe n'\u00e9tais pas raciste quand je suis arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0, mais le suis devenu durant mon s\u00e9jour. D'abord, j'ai d\u00e9couvert que les Noirs sont intellectuellement inf\u00e9rieurs aux Blancs. Ce constat \u00e9tait \u00e9vident partout et dans toutes les couches sociales. Je ne veux pas dire qu'ils \u00e9taient moins instruits (et ils l'\u00e9taient), je veux dire que, \u00e0 un niveau plus fondamental, ils \u00e9taient intellectuellement inf\u00e9rieurs. Dans mon travail, j'ai rencontr\u00e9 des Noirs qui \u00e9taient instruits en principe, mais qui semblaient manquer d'une certaine \u00e9tincelle intellectuelle que poss\u00e8dent la plupart des Blancs, m\u00eame ceux qui sont assez peu instruits. J'en suis \u00e9galement arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 voir la culture noire comme une culture fonci\u00e8rement d\u00e9prav\u00e9e et choquante. Elle n'est bonne que pour les Noirs et ne ressemble en rien \u00e0 ce qu'un Blanc qui se respecte devrait c\u00f4toyer ou tenter d'imiter.\n[56] Plus loin, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9crit, parlant d'un auteur juif qu'il ne nomme pas, il appelle celui-ci [traduction] ce sournois d'auteur juif. Dans sa conclusion, il affirme qu'[traduction] Hitler avait raison \u00e0 propos des Juifs.\n[57] Le 23 mars 2004, sur un fil de discussion cens\u00e9 afficher le testament politique d'Adolf Hitler, l'intim\u00e9, parlant encore des Juifs, \u00e9crivait : [traduction] La haine envers cette race de vermine parasite grandit partout.\n[58] Dans un autre \u00e9crit intitul\u00e9 [traduction] La grandeur d'Adolf Hitler, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait, le 9 avril 2004 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nHitler a r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 la juiverie internationale et au marxisme. Il voyait le marxisme comme le moyen tout r\u00e9cent d'atteindre le but \u00e0 long terme de la juiverie internationale - \u00e0 savoir la destruction des \u00c9tats-nations ind\u00e9pendants. Le marxisme repr\u00e9sentait la disparition de toutes les distinctions nationales et ethniques et la mise en place d'un prol\u00e9tariat mondial ab\u00e2tardi, sans aucune identit\u00e9 ou loyaut\u00e9 ethnique.\n[...]\nL'intention initiale d'Hitler \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Juifs \u00e9tait qu'ils soient expuls\u00e9s d'Europe, de gr\u00e9 ou de force. La destination initiale mentionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait Madagascar. [...] Une fois la guerre commenc\u00e9e, cela devint peu r\u00e9aliste. Les seules solutions \u00e9taient soit de les confiner, soit de les laisser aller librement. Cette derni\u00e8re solution fut jug\u00e9e inad\u00e9quate puisqu'ils \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des ennemis potentiels, tout comme les Japonais en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, qui furent eux aussi intern\u00e9s. On ne saurait nier que quelques Juifs, et peut \u00eatre beaucoup, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e9limin\u00e9s. Le nombre exact ne sera sans doute jamais \u00e9tabli, mais il est presque certain qu'il n'atteint pas le chiffre des six millions que tente de nous faire croire depuis plus de soixante ans la propagande anti allemande d'apr\u00e8s guerre.\n[59] Concernant les camps de concentration mis sur pied durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale par les Nazis et, en particulier, de l'inf\u00e2me camp d'Auschwitz, il le d\u00e9crit comme [traduction] un camp de travail, et non pas un camp de la mort, et il ajoute que [traduction] les chambres \u00e0 gaz servaient \u00e0 \u00e9pouiller les v\u00eatements afin d'emp\u00eacher la propagation du typhus - et non pas \u00e0 exterminer des \u00eatres humains. Il conteste les chiffres indiquant le nombre de gens qui p\u00e9rirent dans ces camps : [traduction] Nous n'avons pas encore la preuve objective que six millions de Juifs ont p\u00e9ri. La meilleure preuve existante vient de la Croix-Rouge, pour qui un peu plus de 400 000 Juifs sont morts, pour toutes sortes de raisons, dans les camps d'internement (sic) et de travail (sic) [...]\n[60] Sur un autre sujet, dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Le VIH\/sida et les Indiens de Saskatchewan que l'intim\u00e9 avait amorc\u00e9, il \u00e9crivait, le 2 mai 2004, \u00e0 propos de la propagation du sida parmi les Premi\u00e8res nations de cette province : [traduction] Il ne m'importe pas vraiment aujourd'hui que le sida les an\u00e9antisse tous. Notre travail en serait facilit\u00e9.\n[61] Le 5 juillet 2004, sur un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Questions d'un homme noir, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait :\n[TRADUCTION]\nParlant en mon propre nom uniquement, je voudrais que cette nation blanche comprenne la plus grande partie de ce qui est aujourd'hui le Canada et la plus grande partie de ce qui est aujourd'hui les \u00c9tats Unis. L'immigration non blanche serait bannie. Les non-Blancs vivant \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de nos fronti\u00e8res seraient encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 partir ou \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une st\u00e9rilisation volontaire. Avec un tel plan, notre nation serait blanche \u00e0 100 p. 100 en une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration. Cela pourrait se faire sans r\u00e9elle effusion de sang si les non-Blancs acceptaient de coop\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'entreprise. Les Noirs pourraient \u00eatre rapatri\u00e9s en Afrique. L'aide \u00e9trang\u00e8re aujourd'hui vers\u00e9e \u00e0 Isra\u00ebl servirait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ce plan de rapatriement. Les Noirs instruits d'Am\u00e9rique pourraient aider l'Afrique \u00e0 se remettre sur pied (si cela est possible). Les Asiatiques seraient renvoy\u00e9s dans leur pays d'origine. Si cela se r\u00e9v\u00e9lait impossible, alors le plan de st\u00e9rilisation serait mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution. En aucun cas un Juif ne serait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 rester sur notre territoire. On les laisserait partir paisiblement, avec tout ce qu'ils pourraient mettre dans une valise.\n[62] R\u00e9pondant \u00e0 un article intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Mes impressions sur les Juifs, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait, le 11 septembre 2004 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nVous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 leur [se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux Juifs] duplicit\u00e9 compulsive. Hitler les appelait les ma\u00eetres du mensonge, et il avait parfaitement raison. Vous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 leur nature parasite. Ils m\u00e9prisent le vrai travail et ne vivent que pour l'argent, sans se soucier de la mani\u00e8re de l'obtenir. Vous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'ils sont attir\u00e9s par tout ce qui est d\u00e9go\u00fbtant et d\u00e9prav\u00e9. On peut le voir \u00e0 leur art. Vous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 leur r\u00f4le dans le crime organis\u00e9, le trafic de drogue et l'esclavage blanc. Vous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'ils corrompent toutes nos institutions (les m\u00e9dias, les universit\u00e9s, la finance, la politique, la justice, l'application de la loi) pour les rediriger ensuite vers des objectifs juifs. Vous n'avez pas mentionn\u00e9 le cancer du Sionisme.\nEtc.\n[63] Sur un fil de discussion de Stormfront intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Saviez-vous qu'un million d'Allemands ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assassin\u00e9s... apr\u00e8s la guerre?, l'intim\u00e9 a affich\u00e9 l'\u00e9crit suivant, le 12 septembre 2004 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nPlus on explore les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale (avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s), plus on est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 constater que le v\u00e9ritable holocauste fut un holocauste commis \u00e0 l'encontre du peuple allemand, et ce, \u00e0 l'instigation des Juifs. Ce canular de l'holocauste juif cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9former la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 et \u00e0 faire passer les Juifs pour les victimes des m\u00e9chants Nazis. \u00c0 mesure que le temps passe, nous en apprenons davantage sur ce qui s'est v\u00e9ritablement pass\u00e9.\n[64] Le 18 septembre 2004, dans un fil qu'il avait amorc\u00e9, intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Le parasite sacr\u00e9, il qualifiait encore une fois le Juif de parasite. Ce m\u00eame jour, il engageait aussi un autre fil intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Hanadi Jaradat. Selon l'article de l'intim\u00e9, Hanadi Jaradat \u00e9tait une Palestinienne qui s'\u00e9tait fait exploser dans un restaurant de Ha\u00effa, en Isra\u00ebl, tuant ou blessant plusieurs personnes. L'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait \u00e0 ce propos :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] Son pays est occup\u00e9 par la m\u00eame race parasite qui contr\u00f4le aujourd'hui nos pays auparavant blancs. Comme le Dr Pierce le disait : ELLE EN AVAIT PLUS QU'ASSEZ!!. Elle a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'agir.\nIl s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d'un an depuis que Hanadi Jaradat a port\u00e9 un coup au ZOG (gouvernement sioniste d'occupation). Je sais qu'il y a des nationalistes blancs qui me bl\u00e2meront d'honorer de cette fa\u00e7on une musulmane, mais je ne lui rends pas hommage en sa qualit\u00e9 de musulmane ou d'arabe, mais en sa qualit\u00e9 de soldate d\u00e9vou\u00e9e luttant contre le ZOG. Je ne sugg\u00e8re pas non plus que nous nous attachions tous des bombes \u00e0 la ceinture et que nous commencions \u00e0 faire sauter des Juifs. Je voudrais simplement attirer l'attention sur son courage et sur son sacrifice (litt\u00e9ralement) et j'esp\u00e8re qu'un jour nous aurons un millier de nationalistes blancs tout aussi r\u00e9solus \u00e0 d\u00e9truire notre ennemi.\n[65] Le 19 septembre 2004, il \u00e9crivait ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nPlus les Juifs tenteront d'\u00e9radiquer l'antis\u00e9mitisme, plus il progressera. C'est garanti. Il progressera jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les Juifs eux-m\u00eames se rendent compte qu'ils sont la cause de l'antis\u00e9mitisme (ce qui n'arrivera jamais). Tout comme un corps sain tente de reconna\u00eetre et de repousser les organismes destructeurs \u00e9trangers, ainsi toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 saine r\u00e9agira aux Juifs avec r\u00e9pulsion et d\u00e9go\u00fbt et souhaitera leur expulsion. Les Juifs tentent d'emp\u00eacher cette r\u00e9action saine de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le virus du sida emp\u00eache le corps de rejeter les organismes \u00e9trangers. Mais pour les Juifs cela ne fonctionnera pas. Trop de gens sont conscients de leur nocivit\u00e9. Nous sommes comme les cellules sanguines blanches de certaines personnes qui sont immunis\u00e9es contre les effets du virus du sida.\n[66] Ce m\u00eame jour, mais sur un autre fil de discussion, l'intim\u00e9 affichait ce qui suit : [traduction] Comme quelqu'un l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit (je ne me souviens plus qui), quand leur fin arrivera, les Juifs regretteront que les SS ne soient pas l\u00e0 pour les prot\u00e9ger.\n[67] L'intim\u00e9 a aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un fil intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Objet : Faut-il un \u00c9tat policier?, qui pr\u00e9tendait discuter les avantages de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une nation blanche. Dans l'un de ses nombreux et longs \u00e9crits affich\u00e9s sur ce fil, le 20 septembre 2004, il s'exprimait ainsi : [traduction] La politique nationale-socialiste envers les Juifs \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s mesur\u00e9e. Hitler \u00e9tait beaucoup plus gentil envers les Juifs qu'ils le m\u00e9ritaient. Son intention initiale \u00e9tait tout simplement de les expulser tous. Cependant, personne n'en voulait (ce n'est pas surprenant). Plus loin, dans un autre article, il \u00e9crivait notamment, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question dont l'auteur lui demandait s'il serait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 payer le prix d'un \u00c9tat policier totalitaire pour une nation enti\u00e8rement blanche : [traduction] En fait, je ne serais pas en faveur d'un tel \u00c9tat \u00e0 moins qu'il ne s'emploie r\u00e9solument \u00e0 expulser tous les Juifs de notre territoire. Dans un autre article portant sur le m\u00eame sujet, dans lequel il parlait de la [traduction] fracture de [traduction] nos pays multiraciaux, il \u00e9crivait que les nationalistes blancs devraient se pr\u00e9parer [traduction] \u00e0 saisir le pouvoir par tous les moyens possibles. Puis il ajoutait : [traduction] Notre peuple dirigera alors l'appareil d'\u00c9tat policier existant et entreprendra les travaux de nettoyage (expulsion des Juifs, rapatriement des autres non-Blancs, etc.)\n[68] Le 17 janvier 2005, l'intim\u00e9 affichait l'\u00e9crit suivant : [traduction] Les Arabes NE sont PAS les nouveaux Juifs. Les Juifs sont les Juifs!! Comme le disait le Dr Pierce, quand nous aurons dispos\u00e9 des Juifs, tout le reste se r\u00e9glera automatiquement. Le dernier \u00e9crit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve par le plaignant et remontant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au 8 avril 2005, date \u00e0 laquelle la plainte fut signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 23 mars 2005. L'objet de cet \u00e9crit est contenu dans un fil de discussion intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Jeux de hasard \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que publique. Dans cet \u00e9crit, l'intim\u00e9 fait des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes \u00e0 propos des Autochtones.\n[69] L'article suivant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve fut affich\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de f\u00e9vrier 2006, dix mois apr\u00e8s la signification de la plainte \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et environ cinq mois apr\u00e8s la lettre d'excuses \u00e9voqu\u00e9e plus haut dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Cet article fut affich\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal le 30 janvier 2006 dans l'affaire Warman c. Kulbashian et autres, 2006 TCDP 11. Dans cet \u00e9crit, l'intim\u00e9, parlant du membre du Tribunal qui avait rendu la d\u00e9cision, s'exprimait ainsi : [traduction] Remarquez que nous n'avons m\u00eame pas de d\u00e9cideurs blancs au tribunal, mais quelqu'un sorti de je ne sais quel trou du tiers-monde.\n[70] Dans l'article suivant, dat\u00e9 du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2006, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crit : [traduction] Nous ne devons jamais oublier que le communisme \u00e9tait, est et sera toujours juif. C'est le meilleur exemple de ce qui arriverait \u00e0 notre peuple si les Juifs venaient \u00e0 s'emparer du contr\u00f4le absolu de nos pays, ce contr\u00f4le auquel ils aspirent tant. Dans un autre article, dat\u00e9 du 3 mars 2006, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes Juifs comptent, pour ex\u00e9cuter leurs plans, sur leurs aides goyim adeptes du sabbat. Les Juifs suivent simplement leur instinct de race parasite, mais leurs aides blancs font le choix de trahir leur race. Les Juifs \u00e9tablissent d'innombrables organisations de fa\u00e7ade pour recruter leurs aides goyim adeptes du sabbat, lesquels, au mieux, croient qu'ils travaillent pour quelque noble cause afin de venir en aide \u00e0 ceci ou \u00e0 cela. Au pire, ils savent qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9s pour la cause juda\u00efque, mais ils s'imaginent que c'est le chemin qu'ils doivent parcourir pour arriver \u00e0 la richesse et\/ou au pouvoir.\n[71] Le 8 mai 2006, les attaques de l'intim\u00e9 deviennent plus malveillantes. Parlant d'un complot mondial ourdi par les Juifs, il \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes Juifs sont les empoisonneurs de toutes les nations. L'une des raisons pour lesquelles ils encouragent le multiculturalisme (qui est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le multiracialisme) est leur volont\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir un pays peupl\u00e9 de mul\u00e2tres, que les Juifs jugent faciles \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser et qu'ils consid\u00e8rent comme un ensemble de groupes ethniques querelleurs qu'il leur sera possible de diviser et de conqu\u00e9rir. Dans un pays multiracial, le groupe racial qui pr\u00e9sente la solidarit\u00e9 ethnique la plus forte dominera. Les Juifs croient, et ils sont m\u00eame convaincus, qu'ils pr\u00e9sentent entre eux une coh\u00e9sion interne suffisante pour assurer leur supr\u00e9matie, compte tenu, notamment, de leur mainmise actuelle sur les institutions financi\u00e8res, politiques, \u00e9ducatives et culturelles (les m\u00e9dias).\nChaque groupe ethnique doit reconna\u00eetre pour vrai ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. Nous, les nationalistes blancs, pouvons former des alliances strat\u00e9giques avec d'autres groupes nationaux, mais nous devons nous garder de chercher \u00e0 convaincre les autres de mener nos combats \u00e0 notre place. Dans un tel cas, ces autres groupes d\u00e9termineront la configuration d'une victoire finale. Nous devons d\u00e9terminer nous-m\u00eames cette configuration. En pratique, la configuration finale ne doit pas entra\u00eener la rupture de l'un de nos pays auparavant blancs. Au lieu d'essayer d'\u00e9tablir un petit territoire national uniquement blanc, nous devrions viser un objectif plus large. Flanquons les Juifs dehors et n'ayons plus rien \u00e0 faire avec eux, o\u00f9 qu'ils aboutissent. Aidons ensuite au rapatriement des autres groupes ethniques. [...] Ils ne partagent pas nos valeurs, ce qui est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par leurs tendances claniques et leurs activit\u00e9s criminelles en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Et, m\u00eame s'ils partageaient effectivement nos valeurs, nous ne voulons pas d'eux ici parce que nous voulons notre territoire pour faire progresser notre propre race et assurer sa destin\u00e9e.\nNous pouvons nous entendre avec les autres groupes nationaux pour faire en sorte que les Juifs ne disposent d'aucun abri s\u00fbr o\u00f9 ils puissent \u00e9tablir \u00e0 nouveau une autre base op\u00e9rationnelle, par exemple en Am\u00e9rique ou en Grande-Bretagne. [...]\nFondamentalement, nous (ainsi que tous les groupes ethniques et les races) devons consid\u00e9rer les Juifs comme des empoisonneurs \u00e9trangers qui voudraient toujours que les autres fassent leur sale travail. De cette fa\u00e7on, ils pourront toujours clamer leur innocence et \u00e9viteront de se salir les mains. Ils s'\u00e9vitent \u00e9galement de d\u00e9penser leur or si pr\u00e9cieux. Ils ont ouvertement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils pr\u00e9f\u00e9reraient d\u00e9truire le monde que de voir leur propre existence nationale menac\u00e9e (l'option Samson). Nous devons admettre qu'ils parlent s\u00e9rieusement. Nous devons changer cela et nous dire qu'il vaut mieux que ce soit les Juifs et Isra\u00ebl qui soient d\u00e9truits plut\u00f4t que le monde.\n[72] Puis, le 27 juin 2006, l'intim\u00e9 propose une constitution nationale-socialiste pour le Canada. Cette constitution serait fond\u00e9e sur ce qu'il appelle les sept principes du national-socialisme. Le septi\u00e8me principe d\u00e9clare qu'Adolf Hitler fut un cadeau pour le monde, lequel \u00e9tait au bord d'une catastrophe juive bolchevique. Ce document propose que, dans cet \u00c9tat national-socialiste imaginaire que serait le Canada, les citoyens soient d'extraction europ\u00e9enne blanche pour au moins 75 p. 100. Les Juifs et ceux qui professent la foi juive se verraient refuser la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne.\n[73] Dans un autre article dat\u00e9 du 8 juillet 2006, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait ce qui suit \u00e0 propos du plaignant : [traduction] Je crois que Warman est un Juif du seul fait de son aptitude illimit\u00e9e \u00e0 la malveillance. Il ne semble pas avoir une conscience d'homme blanc. Dans un article \u00e9voquant son cas devant le Tribunal, l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] Hitler a dit que les Juifs sont le bacille de la d\u00e9sint\u00e9gration sociale. Aujourd'hui, nous pourrions les consid\u00e9rer comme le virus du sida, et l'afflux d'autres populations non blanches dans notre pays comme une infection opportuniste. La maladie est le multiculturalisme, et les Juifs en sont la cause.\n[74] Sur le site Internet, http\/\/mathdoktor99.htmlplanet.com, l'intim\u00e9 parle de ce qu'il appelle le complot mondial juif. Il se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un article cens\u00e9ment \u00e9crit par Winston Churchill, qui, affirme-t-il, fut publi\u00e9 dans le London Sunday Herald du 8 f\u00e9vrier 1920, et dont le contenu serait manifestement antis\u00e9mite. Il parle aussi d'un document, pr\u00e9tendument r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par la Croix-Rouge Internationale en 1947, qui chiffre \u00e0 271 000 morts le nombre de Juifs ayant p\u00e9ri dans les divers camps tenus par les Allemands durant la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre mondiale. Il cite ici aussi le gros titre d'un article cens\u00e9ment publi\u00e9 dans le Daily Express de Londres, le 24 mars 1933, et il conclut que ce sont les Juifs qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la guerre au Troisi\u00e8me Reich. Il fait aussi r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'auteur russe Alexandre Solzhenitsyn, qui aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] les Bolcheviques juifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les \u00e9trangleurs de la Russie et [que] le g\u00e9nocide commis contre des millions de Russes a \u00e9t\u00e9 planifi\u00e9 par les Juifs en 1919.\n[75] Les attaques de l'intim\u00e9 ne se limitent pas \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 juive; il \u00e9crit aussi des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes contre la communaut\u00e9 noire. Dans l'un de ses articles, affich\u00e9 sur Stormfront en date du 2 ao\u00fbt 2006, et intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Mon histoire, il relate son s\u00e9jour aux Bahamas, o\u00f9 il a occup\u00e9 un poste d'enseignant en 1993 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEnviron 98 p. 100 des habitants de ce pays sont des N\u00e8gres. C'\u00e9tait le m\u00eame pourcentage parmi mes \u00e9tudiants, dont certains avaient un certain talent naturel pour les math\u00e9matiques. Lorsque je suis arriv\u00e9 dans ce pays, je N'\u00e9tais PAS raciste. En fait, il y a eu des moments o\u00f9 j'oubliais que j'\u00e9tais Blanc. On pourrait dire que, dans une certaine mesure, j'\u00e9tais devenu un Autochtone. Je suis m\u00eame devenu assez basan\u00e9 au point m\u00eame d'avoir la peau sombre. Cependant, au bout d'un an pass\u00e9 dans ce pays, je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la plupart des N\u00e8gres des Bahamas \u00e9taient naturellement stupides. Tous \u00e9videmment ne l'\u00e9taient pas. Je me souviens de quelques conversations intelligentes parmi les hommes n\u00e8gres au magasin des alcools, des conversations plus intelligentes que la plupart des propos tenus entre N\u00e8gres instruits au coll\u00e8ge. Mais, je me suis fait \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que le quotient intellectuel moyen se situait quelque part entre 75 et 85 et, apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9cu six mois dans ce pays, cette opinion s'est raffermie. Au cours des trois ans et demi qui ont suivi, mon estimation pouvait augmenter ou diminuer de quelques points, mais finalement la moyenne se situait \u00e0 environ 80. Je continuais de croire que le camionneur moyen au Canada a davantage de cervelle que 99 p. 100 des N\u00e8gres de ce pays. Mon opinion sur les races a donc commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 changer. Je ne croyais pas qu'un quotient intellectuel de 80 pouvait s'expliquer par des raisons culturelles, m\u00eame si d'aucuns seraient sans nul doute pr\u00eats \u00e0 l'affirmer. Les Bahamiens ne peuvent pas excuser leur stupidit\u00e9 comme pourraient le faire les N\u00e8gres am\u00e9ricains. Ils repr\u00e9sentent une majorit\u00e9 \u00e9crasante dans ce pays et s'occupent de leurs propres affaires depuis 1973. L'esclavage a \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli aux Bahamas en 1837, mais ils sont encore stupides. Pas tous, mais la plupart.\n[76] Puis il ajoute ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nSi les N\u00e8gres n'\u00e9taient que stupides, collectivement parlant, mais par ailleurs innocents, nous pourrions les consid\u00e9rer comme des enfants. Malheureusement, tel n'est pas le cas. J'ai constat\u00e9 qu'ils ont une tendance naturelle \u00e0 recourir tout de suite \u00e0 la violence et qu'ils sont des voleurs n\u00e9s. Durant les quatre ann\u00e9es que j'ai pass\u00e9es aux Bahamas, j'ai peut-\u00eatre eu une demi-douzaine de diff\u00e9rends avec des hommes n\u00e8gres sur des questions qui normalement auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es de peu d'importance. Dans chaque cas, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 menac\u00e9 de violence physique. Ils sont poltrons \u00e9galement, braves uniquement en meutes, comme des hy\u00e8nes, puisque, \u00e0 chaque fois, je ne me d\u00e9robais pas et c'est l'autre qui d\u00e9campait. J'ai trouv\u00e9 que m\u00eame ceux qui sont instruits parmi eux sont des voleurs n\u00e9s. [...] La r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre quand on se trouve parmi les N\u00e8gres : si ce n'est pas coul\u00e9, coll\u00e9 ou soud\u00e9 au plancher, cela dispara\u00eetra.\n[77] L'un des sujets du document \u00e9voque l'id\u00e9e selon laquelle les Juifs tentent de s'emparer de chacun des aspects de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de dominer le monde. Citant Adolf Hitler, l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9partit les races en trois cat\u00e9gories : [traduction] Celles qui peuvent cr\u00e9er et maintenir la civilisation; celles qui peuvent maintenir la civilisation, mais non la cr\u00e9er; et celles qui ne peuvent faire ni l'un ni l'autre, mais qui sont des destructrices de civilisation. Les Aryens (= les Blancs) ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 la civilisation. Les Asiatiques et certains S\u00e9mites sont capables de maintenir une civilisation. Les Juifs et les N\u00e8gres sont des destructeurs de civilisation. Les Juifs sont particuli\u00e8rement dangereux parce que non seulement sont-ils des destructeurs, mais \u00e9galement des destructeurs de la pire esp\u00e8ce, des parasites.\n[78] Puis il conclut ainsi : [traduction] Est-ce que je veux vivre dans un monde dont les Juifs sont les propri\u00e9taires et les gestionnaires pour leur propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice? Est-ce que je veux vivre dans un monde tenu par des parasites r\u00e9solus \u00e0 le d\u00e9truire, ou est-ce que je veux agir? Vais-je simplement m'asseoir et assister \u00e0 la destruction des Blancs comme peuple, sans autre possibilit\u00e9 pour eux que de se fondre - pour \u00e9ventuellement dispara\u00eetre - dans le grand mar\u00e9cage naus\u00e9abond de la biomasse du tiers-monde? J'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9agir.\n[79] Finalement, le 27 juillet 2006, l'intim\u00e9 affichait le message suivant sur Stormfront : [traduction] Warman [c'est-\u00e0-dire le plaignant] n'est que l'homme de fa\u00e7ade, le singe de service, agissant pour le B'nai Brith et le Congr\u00e8s juif canadien. Ces gens-l\u00e0 m\u00e8nent ce pays, lequel sombre dans le trou sans fond de l'enfer juif.\n[80] En 2006, l'intim\u00e9 a aussi cr\u00e9\u00e9 et g\u00e9r\u00e9 un site Web appel\u00e9 nspcanada, o\u00f9 il a affich\u00e9 ce qu'il disait \u00eatre le programme politique du Parti national-socialiste du Canada (le NSPC). N'importe qui peut acc\u00e9der \u00e0 ce site Web.\n[81] La page d'accueil de ce site Web pr\u00e9cise que le NSPC est r\u00e9solu, entre autres choses, \u00e0 [traduction] stopper et inverser les effets du multiculturalisme, \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0 l'emprise juive\/sioniste sur les plus importantes institutions sociales du Canada, \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir la souverainet\u00e9 blanche au Canada, \u00e0 doter le Canada d'une nouvelle constitution [et] \u00e0 augmenter le taux de natalit\u00e9 des Blancs pour qu'il atteigne des niveaux de remplacement et pour que les immigrants non blancs ne soient plus n\u00e9cessaires parmi notre main-d'uvre.\n[82] Il \u00e9crit que le NSPC est [traduction] r\u00e9solu \u00e0 \u00e9tablir au Canada un \u00c9tat raciste blanc, lequel [traduction] r\u00e9tablirait la souverainet\u00e9 blanche au sein du Canada, une souverainet\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue \u00e0 cause du multiculturalisme et de la rectitude politique marxiste. Pour atteindre cet objectif, il recommande diverses mesures, notamment [traduction] la contestation, par tous les moyens l\u00e9gaux possibles, de l'influence juive sur nos m\u00e9dias d'information et de divertissement, et cela par le d\u00e9veloppement de nos propres m\u00e9dias et l'utilisation des m\u00e9dias d'organisations blanches coop\u00e9rantes. Il appelait aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de [traduction] sections locales partout au Canada qui puissent rapidement se transformer en cellules de r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 mesure que le besoin s'en fera sentir.\n[83] L'intim\u00e9 s'attarde ensuite sur les sept points du national-socialisme qui constitueraient le fondement de la [traduction] constitution d'un Canada national-socialiste. Le septi\u00e8me principe est le suivant : [traduction] Adolf Hitler fut le cadeau d'une providence insondable \u00e0 un monde au bord de la catastrophe juive-bolchevique, et seul l'esprit flamboyant de cet homme h\u00e9ro\u00efque pourra nous donner la force et l'inspiration n\u00e9cessaires pour donner au monde une nouvelle naissance marqu\u00e9e par un id\u00e9alisme rayonnant, une paix v\u00e9ritable, un ordre international et une justice sociale pour tous les hommes.\n[84] Pour ce qui est de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'armes \u00e0 feu, il \u00e9crit que cela sera un droit fondamental des citoyens respectueux de la loi, mais il ajoute : [traduction] plus jamais les Juifs ne commanderont ce pays! Nous DEVONS disposer d'une milice de citoyens bien arm\u00e9s afin qu'on ne nous rebatte plus jamais les oreilles avec le multiculturalisme. Les non-citoyens (c'est-\u00e0-dire les non-Blancs) ne seront pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9tenir ou \u00e0 poss\u00e9der des armes \u00e0 feu. L'unique exception \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle concernera les Indiens autochtones vivant dans leurs propres r\u00e9serves. Ils seront autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 poss\u00e9der des armes \u00e0 feu, mais uniquement pour chasser. L'intim\u00e9 parle aussi du multiculturalisme comme d'un [traduction] poison et il se propose de [traduction] nettoyer le g\u00e2chis multiculturel.\n[85] Dans un Canada national-socialiste, pouvons-nous lire, cette loyaut\u00e9 [traduction] au sionisme et \u00e0 l'entit\u00e9 sioniste pr\u00e9sente en Palestine (l'\u00c9tat terroriste d'Isra\u00ebl) sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une [traduction] trahison envers le Canada et [traduction] sera trait\u00e9e comme telle.\n[86] Selon l'intim\u00e9, l'homosexualit\u00e9 [traduction] est peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement. Puis il ajoute que, [traduction] selon les donn\u00e9es scientifiques les plus fiables sur le sujet, quelque chose d\u00e9rape dans la formation du cerveau au cours du d\u00e9veloppement ftal. Il \u00e9crit que l'homosexualit\u00e9 [traduction] est manifestement une pathologie, qu'elle soit ou non reconnue par l'Association psychiatrique. [...] Selon le NSPC, les homosexuels ne doivent pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler dans un environnement o\u00f9 seront pr\u00e9sents des enfants ou de jeunes adolescents. Ils ne seront pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 adopter des enfants ni \u00e0 s'occuper d'enfants plac\u00e9s dans des familles. Ils ne seront pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 servir dans l'arm\u00e9e et, \u00e9videmment, ils ne seront pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 se marier car, selon l'intim\u00e9, le mariage se fait [traduction] entre un homme et une femme.\n[87] Dans un Canada gouvern\u00e9 par le NSPC, l'arm\u00e9e servirait [traduction] \u00e0 aider d'autres nations blanches \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre contre toute agression non blanche. \u00c0 la fin de leur service militaire obligatoire, les citoyens de sexe masculin [traduction] conserveraient la possession de leurs armes d'assaut pour maintenir l'existence d'une milice citoyenne convenablement arm\u00e9e.\n[88] La citoyennet\u00e9, selon le NSPC, serait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux gens qui sont [traduction] d'extraction europ\u00e9enne blanche pour au moins 75 p. 100. Ils ne pourront pas \u00eatre juifs, ni de religion juive. Seuls les citoyens auront le droit de vote, le droit de briguer un poste \u00e9lectif ou le droit de devenir juge. Les r\u00e9sidents du Canada qui ne r\u00e9pondront pas aux conditions de citoyennet\u00e9 seront renvoy\u00e9s dans leur pays, de gr\u00e9 ou de force. Les Autochtones ne seront pas des citoyens, et ils n'auront pas non plus le droit de vote, mais ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront de l'autonomie gouvernementale sur leurs propres territoires.\n[89] On peut \u00e9galement lire ce qui suit dans le document :\n[TRADUCTION]\nNous sommes r\u00e9solus \u00e0 mener un combat r\u00e9volutionnaire pacifique pour le national-socialisme et pour la souverainet\u00e9 blanche \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du Canada.\nCependant, il faut se rappeler que le Canada n'est pas actuellement un pays libre, mais qu'il est aux mains des Juifs et des Sionistes. Nous sommes des victimes du jud\u00e9o lib\u00e9ralisme et nous nous dirigeons vers la tyrannie jud\u00e9o-fasciste.\nNous sommes en faveur du droit \u00e0 la dissidence politique pour tous les Blancs de tout le pays. Cela suppose une r\u00e9sistance au pr\u00e9sent statu quo. Nous devons \u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s, autant que cela est humainement possible. Nous proposons que nos sections locales se structurent en cellules de r\u00e9sistance model\u00e9es sur les comit\u00e9s de correspondance qui existaient avant et durant la R\u00e9volution am\u00e9ricaine.\n[90] Puis le site Web donne une liste d'autres groupes pro-blancs, avec leurs adresses \u00e9lectroniques. Il \u00e9num\u00e8re aussi les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et entreprises qui devraient \u00eatre boycott\u00e9es en raison de ce que l'intim\u00e9 appelle les accointances sionistes.\n[91] Plusieurs pages du site Web reprennent aussi certaines citations, par exemple les suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nRenvoi des N\u00e8gres en Afrique? Oui!!!;\n[TRADUCTION]\nNul programme ou stimulant sp\u00e9cial, quel qu'il soit, ne pourra modifier le caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9tique fondamental d'une race. L'unique solution \u00e0 la plaie que repr\u00e9sentent les N\u00e8gres est leur rapatriement en Afrique;\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa juiverie internationale est l'ennemie de toute l'humanit\u00e9 et l'empoisonneuse de toutes les nations;\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe multiculturalisme revient \u00e0 d\u00e9placer, \u00e0 marginaliser et finalement \u00e0 d\u00e9truire la population h\u00f4te - c'est-\u00e0-dire la race blanche!!!\n[92] Il y a aussi une s\u00e9rie de ce que l'on pourrait d\u00e9crire comme de brefs commentaires, intitul\u00e9s, par exemple, [traduction] Le sionisme est une trahison, [traduction] Renvoyer les N\u00e8gres en Afrique? Oui!!!, Jew Tube, [traduction] Crime noir. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend aussi y reproduire une s\u00e9rie de documents qu'il dit \u00eatre historiquement exacts.\n[93] Il est clair que l'intim\u00e9 ne veut rien de moins qu'un Canada totalement blanc. Il fait valoir que les Blancs et les non-Blancs, dont les Juifs, ne pourront jamais vivre ensemble en harmonie dans le m\u00eame pays. Il consid\u00e8re les Noirs m\u00e9prisables, mais trop faibles d'esprit pour constituer une menace envers les Blancs. Les Juifs, quant \u00e0 eux, sont jug\u00e9s plus malins, mais ils sont dangereux, amoraux, nuisibles, et ils complotent pour avoir la mainmise sur le monde. Les th\u00e8mes les plus importants qui sont r\u00e9currents dans la plupart de ses \u00e9crits sont la supr\u00e9matie de la race blanche et l'antis\u00e9mitisme.\nIV. LA PLAINTE D\u00c9POS\u00c9E EN VERTU DE L'ARTICLE 13 A. INTRODUCTION : Propagande haineuse et libert\u00e9 d'expression [94] La libert\u00e9 d'expression est jug\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement pr\u00e9cieuse dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique telle que la n\u00f4tre. La Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s en fait l'un des droits fondamentaux garantis \u00e0 tous les Canadiens. C'est le fondement sur lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9difi\u00e9 notre processus d\u00e9mocratique et politique. La libert\u00e9 d'expression permet \u00e0 toute personne de fa\u00e7onner son d\u00e9veloppement personnel et elle garantit ainsi le d\u00e9veloppement d'une d\u00e9mocratie pleine de vitalit\u00e9, o\u00f9 la participation de tous, quelle que puisse \u00eatre son origine ethnique ou sa foi religieuse, est non seulement bienvenue, mais accept\u00e9e et encourag\u00e9e. (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, paragraphe 47.)\n[95] C'est en raison de notre attachement \u00e0 cette valeur fondamentale que des points comme ceux qui sont soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente instance pr\u00e9sentent des difficult\u00e9s. En rendant sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal devra prendre en compte deux valeurs fondamentales qui, dans certains cas, sont difficiles \u00e0 concilier. D'une part, il y a l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique \u00e0 encourager la libert\u00e9 d'expression et, de l'autre, il y a l'importance pour cette m\u00eame soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de promouvoir les droits de tous ses citoyens \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, ainsi que la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 tout \u00eatre humain.\n[96] Certaines des id\u00e9es exprim\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 dans ses articles peuvent \u00eatre vues comme des id\u00e9es faisant partie int\u00e9grante d'un discours politique l\u00e9gitime, bien qu'elles semblent totalement contraires aux valeurs de la majorit\u00e9 des Canadiens. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous devons, dans l'examen de questions comme celles-ci, faire en sorte que notre jugement ne soit pas obscurci par la r\u00e9probation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et le caract\u00e8re offensant des id\u00e9es politiques pr\u00f4n\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9. Sans doute n'aimons-nous pas ce qu'il dit et pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerions-nous ne pas l'entendre, mais, dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique, chacun est libre d'exprimer ses opinions, si d\u00e9testables soient-elles, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n'en r\u00e9sulte pas pour autrui avilissement et humiliation.\n[97] La libert\u00e9 d'expression est une valeur fondamentale importante, mais nous, au Canada, ch\u00e9rissons tout autant les droits de tous \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. L'\u00e9galit\u00e9 signifie le respect de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 tout \u00eatre humain, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa couleur, \u00e0 sa race, \u00e0 sa langue, \u00e0 son sexe ou \u00e0 sa religion. La libert\u00e9 d'exprimer ses id\u00e9es cesse d'\u00eatre la libert\u00e9 d'expression ou d'opinion quand elle est utilis\u00e9e pour faire obstacle \u00e0 la promotion de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. La libert\u00e9 d'expression cesse d'\u00eatre une caract\u00e9ristique fondamentale des valeurs d\u00e9mocratiques quand elle devient un v\u00e9hicule de promotion de la haine. (Voir le jugement Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canadian Liberty Net, [1992] 3 C.F. 155, paragraphe 60)\n[98] Dans la d\u00e9cision Citron et autres c. Z\u00fcndel, T.D. 1\/02, 18 janvier 2002, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait, aux paragraphes 153 et 154 :\nQuoi qu'il en soit, m\u00eame si nous admettons que cette question puisse donner lieu \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat l\u00e9gitime, nous nous sommes arr\u00eat\u00e9s \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont l'intim\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 ses vues, et non au simple fait qu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 ce d\u00e9bat. Notre conclusion est fond\u00e9e sur la fa\u00e7on dont ces doutes sont exprim\u00e9s, plut\u00f4t que sur le fait qu'il y ait des remises en question de l'exactitude historique de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Bien qu'il soit peut-\u00eatre toujours difficile de soulever ces questions, nous reconnaissons que la norme pour d\u00e9terminer si on a foment\u00e9 la haine ou le m\u00e9pris doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e avec circonspection afin de ne pas perdre de vue le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de parole.\nSi nous nous trouvions en l'occurrence devant un d\u00e9bat th\u00e9orique o\u00f9 l'on s'exprime de fa\u00e7on neutre, notre analyse pourrait \u00eatre fort diff\u00e9rente. Toutefois, ces documents se distinguent, en raison du ton utilis\u00e9 et de l'extr\u00eame d\u00e9nigration des Juifs, de ce qui pourrait \u00eatre permissible. \u00c0 notre avis, c'est le lien entre la fa\u00e7on dont l'auteur per\u00e7oit les \u00e9v\u00e9nements et l'extr\u00eame diffamation des Juifs qui en d\u00e9coule - leur d\u00e9nonciation en tant que menteurs, escrocs, extorqueurs et fraudeurs - qui est susceptible de les exposer \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris.\n[99] Dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada d\u00e9finissait, au paragraphe 2, l'expression propagande haineuse comme une expression destin\u00e9e \u00e0 diss\u00e9miner des sentiments extr\u00eames d'opprobre et d'inimiti\u00e9 contre un groupe racial ou religieux. La propagande haineuse ou les messages haineux r\u00e9sident aux marges ext\u00e9rieures des valeurs qui forment le cur de la libert\u00e9 d'expression. La propagande haineuse est fonci\u00e8rement hostile \u00e0 la raison d'\u00eatre de la libert\u00e9 d'expression. C'est la raison pour laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Lorsqu'il a adopt\u00e9 cette disposition, il a clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il consid\u00e9rait les activit\u00e9s qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es comme des activit\u00e9s contraires \u00e0 la cause de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. L'objet du paragraphe 13(1) est \u00e9videmment un objet d'une importance consid\u00e9rable au point de justifier une limite \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression (arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 43).\n[100] Dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que, bien que l'article 13 empi\u00e8te sur la libert\u00e9 d'expression, cet empi\u00e9tement est justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des engagements internationaux visant \u00e0 \u00e9radiquer la propagande haineuse, et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'engagement du Canada envers les valeurs que sont l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et le multiculturalisme.\n[101] Dans ses observations finales, le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 a fond\u00e9 une partie de son argumentation sur la notion de commentaire loyal et celle de libert\u00e9 d'expression. Je reconnais que toute personne, y compris l'intim\u00e9, a le droit d'exprimer par le moyen de son choix ses id\u00e9es politiques, mais elle doit le faire d'une mani\u00e8re qui ne contrevienne pas au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi. Comme le Tribunal l'\u00e9crivait dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 54 : Bien qu'il constitue l'une des pierres angulaires d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression n'est pas un droit illimit\u00e9. Dans certains cas, la protection de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 restreint ce que peuvent dire les individus. La libert\u00e9 d'expression ou le droit de faire un commentaire loyal ne saurait autoriser la calomnie contre des citoyens canadiens au motif de leur couleur ou de leur religion, ni autoriser un appel \u00e0 leur expulsion.\n[102] M. Fromm a aussi pri\u00e9 le Tribunal de ne pas tenir compte de l'information apparaissant sur le site Web du Parti national-socialiste du Canada. Il a fait valoir que cette plate-forme politique devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e dans une ar\u00e8ne politique. Je ne partage pas son avis. L'importance, dans notre d\u00e9mocratie, de pr\u00e9server la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression ne donne pas naissance \u00e0 un droit absolu. Les tribunaux reconnaissent que ces valeurs sont soumises \u00e0 des limites juridiques, qu'il s'agisse des dispositions du Code criminel, de la common law, de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s ou de la Loi. Le l\u00e9gislateur et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'imposer des limites juridiques \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'opinion et d'expression. Ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'on ne pouvait pas encourager la haine et le m\u00e9pris m\u00eame si l'on pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'agit d'un discours politique.\nB. L'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi [103] Selon la plainte, l'intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 contre des personnes ou un groupe de personnes une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la religion, la race, la couleur et l'origine nationale ou ethnique, en communiquant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages sur Internet, messages qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les Noirs, les Asiatiques, les Autochtones, les autres non-Blancs et les Juifs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, contrevenant ainsi au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi.\n[104] Le paragraphe 13(1) est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9\n13. (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n13. (1) It is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of Parliament, any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n:\n[105] Le paragraphe 13(2) \u00e9tend cette disposition aux communications \u00e9chang\u00e9es sur Internet :\n(2) Il demeure entendu que le paragraphe (1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'un ordinateur, d'un ensemble d'ordinateurs connect\u00e9s ou reli\u00e9s les uns aux autres, notamment d'Internet, ou de tout autre moyen de communication semblable mais qu'il ne s'applique pas dans les cas o\u00f9 les services d'une entreprise de radiodiffusion sont utilis\u00e9s.\n(2) For greater certainty, subsection (1) applies in respect of a matter that is communicated by means of a computer or a group of interconnected or related computers, including the Internet, or any similar means of communication, but does not apply in respect of a matter that is communicated in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a broadcasting undertaking.\n[106] L'article 13 de la Loi est express\u00e9ment con\u00e7u pour pr\u00e9venir la propagation des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et pour encourager la tol\u00e9rance et l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. En qualifiant d'acte discriminatoire l'activit\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans cette disposition, le l\u00e9gislateur indique qu'il consid\u00e8re la propagande haineuse ou les messages haineux comme contraires au principe de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. En 1966, le Comit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial sur la propagande haineuse au Canada, commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 le Comit\u00e9 Cohen, avait identifi\u00e9 le grave pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par les messages haineux. Il a soulign\u00e9 que les personnes victimes de haine raciale ou religieuse risquent d'en subir une profonde d\u00e9tresse psychologique, les cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables pouvant comprendre la perte de l'estime de soi, des sentiments de col\u00e8re et d'indignation et une forte incitation \u00e0 renoncer aux caract\u00e9ristiques culturelles qui les distinguent des autres (arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 40.)\n[107] L'objet de l'article 13 est de supprimer les messages haineux du discours public et d'encourager l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la tol\u00e9rance et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne. Les opinions exprim\u00e9es dans de tels messages conduisent in\u00e9vitablement aux pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et \u00e0 la discrimination et peuvent aussi entra\u00eener des violences physiques contre les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s.\n[108] Les messages haineux peuvent aussi avoir pour effet de convaincre ceux qui les entendent ou qui les lisent que les membres de certains groupes raciaux ou religieux sont inf\u00e9rieurs. Il peut en r\u00e9sulter un accroissement des actes de discrimination, voire un accroissement des violences commises contre ces groupes. Les messages haineux portent atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi des membres du groupe cible, et ils contribuent \u00e0 semer la discorde entre diff\u00e9rents groupes raciaux, culturels et religieux, minant ainsi la tol\u00e9rance et l'ouverture d'esprit qui doivent fleurir dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 multiculturelle vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 (arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 41).\n[109] Selon le paragraphe 13(1), l'intention d'exercer une discrimination n'est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 un constat de discrimination (Commission des droits de la personne de l'Ontario et Theresa O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, aux pages 549 550; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux pages 931 \u00e0 934). Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kulbashian et autres, 2006 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 59, le Tribunal \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[...] le langage utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 13 est clair; ce sont les effets de la propagande qui ont retenu l'attention du l\u00e9gislateur. La question \u00e0 poser n'est pas celle de savoir si celui qui transmet le message a l'intention de communiquer de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris, mais celle de savoir si le message lui-m\u00eame est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable. Si effectivement le contenu du bulletin d'information \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer une pr\u00e9tendue opinion politique, le message aurait pu \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 sans recourir au langage extr\u00e9miste et d\u00e9nigrant qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9pandu dans les diverses publications du bulletin d'information [...]\n[110] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, au paragraphe 45697, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que l'emploi du mot susceptibles, au paragraphe 13(1), signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire une preuve montrant qu'un individu ou groupe donn\u00e9 a pris les messages au s\u00e9rieux et a fait montre de haine ou de m\u00e9pris envers les autres. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire non plus de prouver que quiconque a \u00e9t\u00e9 victimis\u00e9. Contrairement aux autres dispositions de la Loi qui traitent de discrimination, le paragraphe 13(1) pr\u00e9voit une responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00eame s'il n'y a aucun effet discriminatoire r\u00e9el non prouv\u00e9 ou non prouvable. Comme l'\u00e9crit le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20, aux paragraphes 46 et 49 :\nLe Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il n'existe aucun moyen facile d'acc\u00e8s pour \u00e9valuer le nombre de personnes expos\u00e9es aux messages ainsi que les r\u00e9percussions que ces derniers peuvent avoir eues sur ces personnes. Selon le Tribunal, ces consid\u00e9rations justifient l'extension de la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 13(1) aux cas o\u00f9 il n'y a aucun effet discriminatoire r\u00e9el non prouv\u00e9 ou non prouvable. [...] Selon le paragraphe 13(1), constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable. La disposition ne mentionne pas que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de diffuser des messages qui ont pour effet de susciter chez les autres de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du groupe cible.\n[111] Encore une fois, dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ajoutait, au paragraphe 74, que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration attaqu\u00e9e ne constituait pas une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'acte discriminatoire proscrit par le paragraphe 13(1) : Il faut se rappeler que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 peut servir aux fins les plus diverses, et j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter qu'il existe des circonstances dans lesquelles des d\u00e9clarations conformes aux faits puissent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 la seule fin de fomenter la haine contre un groupe racial ou religieux.\n[112] La propagande haineuse porte atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'estime de soi des membres du groupe cible et elle mine la tol\u00e9rance et l'ouverture d'esprit qui doivent fleurir dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 multiculturelle vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 (d\u00e9cision Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 50). La preuve d'un pr\u00e9judice n'est donc pas requise. Le point essentiel est qu'il faut s'assurer que seuls sont vis\u00e9s par le paragraphe 13(1) les messages qui sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres du groupe cible \u00e0 des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation, se traduisant par des calomnies et de la diffamation (d\u00e9cision Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 51)\n[113] Comme l'\u00e9crivait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le jugement Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Winnicki, 2005 CF 1493, au paragraphe 30 :\nLe pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux groupes cibl\u00e9s par les messages haineux est tr\u00e8s souvent difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9parer. Il renforce de mani\u00e8re insidieuse les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qu'ont certains envers les minorit\u00e9s identifi\u00e9es par la race, la couleur et la religion, incitant et justifiant par le fait m\u00eame le recours aux pratiques discriminatoires, voire \u00e0 la violence, contre ces groupes. En m\u00eame temps, ces messages sont tr\u00e8s susceptibles d'influencer la perception et l'estime de soi de tous les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s, les emp\u00eachant ainsi de participer pleinement \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne et de r\u00e9aliser leur plein potentiel comme \u00eatres humains.\n[114] Comment \u00e9tablir la probabilit\u00e9 d'une exposition \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice? Dans la d\u00e9cision Citron c. Zundel (n\u00b0 4) (2002), 41 C.H.R.R. D\/274, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que la preuve la plus convaincante \u00e9tait le langage employ\u00e9 dans les messages eux-m\u00eames. Il n'est nul besoin d'une preuve d'expert dans cette mati\u00e8re, encore qu'elle puisse \u00eatre utile dans certains cas.\n[115] Il convient d'examiner trois questions pour savoir si la plainte est fond\u00e9e :\nL'intim\u00e9 a-t-il, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, communiqu\u00e9 ou fait communiquer les messages qui sont l'objet de la plainte? Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie par l'entremise d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? Le sujet des messages est-il susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite?\nC. M. Tremaine a-t-il, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, communiqu\u00e9 ou fait communiquer les messages trouv\u00e9s sur les divers sites Web en cause? [116] L'intim\u00e9 ne nie pas qu'il a communiqu\u00e9 les messages qui sont l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, y compris les messages post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la plainte. Il a aussi admis que la totalit\u00e9 des messages \u00e9taient de lui et qu'il les avait sign\u00e9s sous son nom v\u00e9ritable ou sous son pseudonyme, mathdoktor99.\n[117] Son repr\u00e9sentant a refus\u00e9 d'admettre que les messages en cause avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e. Il s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Taylor de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, affirmant que la raison pour laquelle la Cour avait jug\u00e9 dans cette affaire que les communications \u00e9taient r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es avait trait \u00e0 l'effort d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour attirer l'attention du public sur eux. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9 avait tent\u00e9 d'attirer l'attention sur ses articles ou avait annonc\u00e9 leur pr\u00e9sence sur Internet et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait juger qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[118] La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des communications est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment constitutif du paragraphe 13(1), et le Tribunal constate qu'il y a eu, en l'esp\u00e8ce, communication r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des articles affich\u00e9s. Dans la d\u00e9cision Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc. (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/453, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que l'emploi des mots de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, au paragraphe 13(1), signifie que cette disposition vise non pas les communications priv\u00e9es \u00e9chang\u00e9es avec des amis, mais plut\u00f4t une s\u00e9rie de messages constituant un dispositif public et \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle pour la diffusion de certaines id\u00e9es ou opinions, en vue de gagner des adeptes dans le public.\n[119] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur Internet, lequel est con\u00e7u pour faciliter les transmissions r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es d'\u00e9crits affich\u00e9s sur un site donn\u00e9. Internet offre un moyen peu co\u00fbteux de distribution massive. L'un des objets vis\u00e9s par l'insertion de messages sur un site Web est de rendre accessible le message pour transmission et affichage par un utilisateur qui le demande. Cette caract\u00e9ristique d'Internet remplit la condition de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dont parle le paragraphe 13(1). Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour l'intim\u00e9 d'appeler l'attention du public sur ses articles, le simple fait de les afficher sur Internet, lequel est accessible \u00e0 presque tout le monde, suffisait pour que cet objectif soit atteint.\nD. Ces messages ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie, par l'entremise d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement? [120] La preuve tangible produite contre l'intim\u00e9 consiste principalement en copies d'articles affich\u00e9s sur Internet.\n[121] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, dans sa version originale, ne traitait pas express\u00e9ment des communications faites au moyen d'Internet. \u00c0 la suite des modifications apport\u00e9es au droit canadien par l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi antiterroriste, L.C. 2001, ch. 41, article 88, le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2001, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne fut modifi\u00e9e par l'ajout du paragraphe 13(2), qui traite express\u00e9ment des communications r\u00e9alis\u00e9es au moyen d'Internet.\n[122] Puisque tous les messages qui constituent le fondement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du paragraphe 13(2), il ne fait aucun doute qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie, gr\u00e2ce aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement.\n[123] Dans sa plaidoirie, M. Fromm a affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal devrait assimiler \u00e0 une communication priv\u00e9e les articles affich\u00e9s sur un site Internet qui sont destin\u00e9s aux personnes partageant la m\u00eame id\u00e9ologie de base. Selon lui, les articles affich\u00e9s sur le site Stormfront constituaient une conversation interne. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cet argument. Dans un article r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par L. B. Lidsky, Silencing John Doe: Defamation and Discourse in Cyberspace (2000), 49 Duke L. J. 855, cit\u00e9 avec approbation au paragraphe 31 d'un arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario, Barrick Gold Corporation v. Lopehandia, [2004] O.J. N\u00b0 2329, l'auteur \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLes communications par Internet pr\u00e9sentent sans doute les qualit\u00e9s \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res d'un bavardage pour ce qui concerne l'exactitude, mais elles sont transmises au moyen d'un support plus envahissant que les imprim\u00e9s, et pour cette raison elles pr\u00e9sentent un pouvoir consid\u00e9rable de destruction des r\u00e9putations. D\u00e8s qu'un message p\u00e9n\u00e8tre dans le cyberespace, des millions de gens de par le monde peuvent en prendre connaissance. M\u00eame si le message est affich\u00e9 dans un forum de discussion fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 par une poign\u00e9e seulement de personnes, n'importe laquelle d'entre elles peut republier le message en l'imprimant ou, ce qui est plus probable, en le transmettant instantan\u00e9ment \u00e0 un autre forum de discussion. Et, si le message est suffisamment apte \u00e0 provoquer des r\u00e9actions, il peut \u00eatre republi\u00e9 encore et encore. La capacit\u00e9 extraordinaire d'Internet de reproduire presque ind\u00e9finiment tout message diffamatoire donne cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e selon laquelle la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 rattrape rarement un mensonge.\n[124] Internet a eu de profondes r\u00e9percussions sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 moderne. Il a rendu accessible \u00e0 tous l'information qui nagu\u00e8re ne l'\u00e9tait qu'\u00e0 quelques-uns. Il a aussi permis aux individus d'\u00e9changer des id\u00e9es et de d\u00e9battre des questions importantes, mais il a aussi suscit\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieuses inqui\u00e9tudes sur le contenu de nombreux sites. Des questions se posent concernant d'une part la pr\u00e9servation de la libert\u00e9 l\u00e9gitime d'expression, et d'autre part la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'enrayer la prolif\u00e9ration des sites haineux. Le cyberespace ne peut pas, et ne doit pas, \u00eatre vu comme une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 hors limite o\u00f9 tout est permis et o\u00f9 les contraintes qui restreignent le discours dans le monde r\u00e9el n'auraient pas leur place. Le fait que l'utilisateur emploie un pseudonyme ne signifie pas que tout est permis. Le fait aussi qu'il imprime ses messages sur un site qui est pour l'essentiel utilis\u00e9 par des personnes ayant les m\u00eames id\u00e9es que lui ne fait pas du message une communication priv\u00e9e. D\u00e8s lors que le message est entr\u00e9 dans le cyberespace, il peut \u00eatre lu par des millions de gens, et il fait partie du domaine public.\n[125] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve montre clairement que le site Web utilis\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait facilement accessible au public. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pour avoir acc\u00e8s aux messages affich\u00e9s sur ces sites, une personne n'avait pas \u00e0 en \u00eatre membre - encore que, sur le site Stormfront, il \u00e9tait impossible d'afficher un message sans \u00eatre membre du site. N'importe qui pouvait facilement acc\u00e9der aux sites Web Stormfront et nspcanada, aucun mot de passe n'\u00e9tait requis.\n[126] Le Tribunal ne voit donc nul bien-fond\u00e9 dans l'argument de l'intim\u00e9 sur ce point.\n[127] Le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 a aussi exprim\u00e9 l'avis que le bon sens donnerait \u00e0 penser que, puisque les articles \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s sur un site Web o\u00f9 des gens aux id\u00e9es semblables communiquaient entre eux, alors les articles en question n'exposaient pas \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les groupes vis\u00e9s. Il a aussi fait valoir que les messages n'\u00e9taient pas susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s puisque quiconque naviguant sur Internet aura \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eatement averti du contenu des messages en voyant la nature des banni\u00e8res de la page d'accueil des sites. Par cons\u00e9quent, les gens avaient le choix de lire ou non les messages.\n[128] Encore une fois, le Tribunal ne saurait accepter cet argument. Sans doute pourrait-on admettre que celui qui affiche l'article sur un tel site, ou qui lit l'article, soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un d\u00e9fenseur de l'opinion qu'ils soutiennent, et par cons\u00e9quent \u00e9prouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 des sentiments de haine et de m\u00e9pris pour tel ou tel groupe minoritaire, mais il est concevable que de tels sentiments puissent \u00eatre attis\u00e9s encore davantage par lesdits messages. Quoi qu'il en soit, il faut se rappeler que les sentiments pr\u00e9con\u00e7us de celui qui affiche ou lit un tel article ne sont pas en cause dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 13. La question est de savoir si ce qui est communiqu\u00e9 est susceptible d'exposer une personne ou un groupe de personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. Le fait que les banni\u00e8res aient donn\u00e9 une vague indication du contenu des sites Web ne met pas les messages hors de l'atteinte du paragraphe 13(1).\nE. Le sujet des messages est-il susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite? [129] Il s'agit ici de savoir si les messages sont effectivement susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, ou s'ils sont simplement, comme les a qualifi\u00e9s M. Fromm, de [TRADUCTION] fermes convictions exprim\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9.\n[130] Pour d\u00e9finir les mots haine ou m\u00e9pris, le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.D. n\u00b0 10, au paragraphe 45653, la d\u00e9finition que donne le Oxford English Dictionary (\u00e9dition 1971). Le mot haine est d\u00e9fini ainsi : aversion active, d\u00e9testation, inimiti\u00e9, malice, malveillance. Le mot m\u00e9pris est d\u00e9fini ainsi : le fait d'\u00eatre m\u00e9pris\u00e9 ou d\u00e9daign\u00e9, d\u00e9shonneur, disgr\u00e2ce.\n[131] Dans cette m\u00eame d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal ajoutait ce qui suit, au paragraphe 45654 :\nComme la [Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne] ne contient aucune d\u00e9finition des termes hatred ou contempt, il faut s'appuyer sur leur sens ordinaire. De toute \u00e9vidence, ils peuvent \u00eatre charg\u00e9s \u00e9motivement, et la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont utilis\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 des situations de fait particuli\u00e8res par diff\u00e9rents individus ne sera pas toujours la m\u00eame. N\u00e9anmoins, il existe un tronc commun important aux deux que les d\u00e9finitions du dictionnaire refl\u00e8tent. Le terme hatred connote un ensemble d'\u00e9motions et de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Toutefois, il s'agit d'un terme qui ne fait pas appel n\u00e9cessairement au processus mental de regarder quelqu'un de haut. Il est fort possible de ha\u00efr quelqu'un que l'on estime sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 soi en intelligence, en richesse ou en pouvoir. Aucun des synonymes utilis\u00e9s dans le dictionnaire pour le terme hatred ne donne d'indice sur les motifs de la malice. Par contraste, contempt est un terme qui sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur. La d\u00e9finition du dictionnaire invoqu\u00e9e dans l'affaire Taylor rend bien cette id\u00e9e, car on y trouve les mots despised (d\u00e9daign\u00e9), dishonour (d\u00e9shonneur) ou disgrace (disgr\u00e2ce). M\u00eame si la personne peut \u00eatre ha\u00efe (c'est-\u00e0-dire faire l'objet d'une aversion active) et trait\u00e9e avec m\u00e9pris (c'est-\u00e0-dire regard\u00e9e de haut), les termes ne se chevauchent pas compl\u00e8tement, car la haine est, en certains cas, le r\u00e9sultat de l'envie de qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures, ce que le m\u00e9pris ne peut \u00eatre par d\u00e9finition [arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 60]\n[132] Le mot haine s'entend donc d'une malice extr\u00eame et d'un sentiment qui n'admet, chez la personne qui en est l'objet, aucune qualit\u00e9 susceptible de racheter ses d\u00e9fauts. Le m\u00e9pris, quant \u00e0 lui, s'entend du processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu'un de haut.\n[133] Comment d\u00e9termine-t-on si un sujet est susceptible d'exposer quelqu'un \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris? Suffit-il au Tribunal de consid\u00e9rer les seuls messages, puis de tirer une conclusion, en se fondant sur le contenu, le ton et la pr\u00e9sentation des messages pour savoir s'ils sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s? Ou doit-il exister d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments propres \u00e0 aider le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les messages sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s? Dans sa plaidoirie, le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9tabli devant le Tribunal que les messages \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les groupes vis\u00e9s, puisque le plaignant n'avait produit aucune preuve d'expert pouvant aider le Tribunal \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions.\n[134] Dans la d\u00e9cision Citron c. Zundel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 141, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que, bien qu'une preuve d'expert puisse \u00eatre utile, ce sont les mots employ\u00e9s dans les messages eux-m\u00eames qui lui permettront de dire si le texte est contraire ou non au paragraphe 13(1). Pareillement, dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, 2003 TCDP 18, le Tribunal, tout en prenant note de la preuve d'expert, a estim\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lecture des messages eux-m\u00eames, qu'ils \u00e9taient contraires au paragraphe 13(1). Le fait qu'une preuve d'expert n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite ne rend pas de ce fait irrecevable l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant.\n[135] Les messages produits comme preuve visent principalement deux groupes, les Noirs et les Juifs. Les membres de la communaut\u00e9 noire sont d\u00e9crits comme intellectuellement inf\u00e9rieurs, violents, criminels et stupides - en bref, ils sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme des personnes d\u00e9pourvues de toute qualit\u00e9 pouvant racheter leurs d\u00e9fauts.\n[136] Les messages dirig\u00e9s contre les Juifs disent qu'ils sont les ennemis de l'humanit\u00e9, une race parasite, un mal \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat pur, des parasites hideux, une maladie, une vermine, des fourbes, des menteurs, des d\u00e9prav\u00e9s, des criminels impliqu\u00e9s dans le crime organis\u00e9, la drogue et l'esclavage blanc. L'intim\u00e9 dit que l'holocauste est un canular, qu'il d\u00e9crit comme une tentative de faire passer les Juifs pour les victimes des Nazis, ce qui selon lui est un travestissement de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il recommande que les Juifs soient priv\u00e9s de leur citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, voire expuls\u00e9s de ce pays. Le sujet fondamental des \u00e9crits est l'id\u00e9e que les Juifs n'ont aucune qualit\u00e9 pouvant racheter leurs d\u00e9fauts et qu'ils d\u00e9truisent la race blanche. Les messages renforcent les mythes antis\u00e9mites classiques selon lesquels les Juifs disposent d'un pouvoir disproportionn\u00e9 et qu'ils constituent une menace pour le monde civilis\u00e9. Ils ont impos\u00e9 le multiculturalisme \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 blanche et sont responsables des dommages qui en ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9. En outre, ils sont de dangereux marxistes communistes. Le ton et l'extr\u00eame d\u00e9nigrement des Juifs, dans ces messages, ne font pas partie int\u00e9grante d'un d\u00e9bat politique l\u00e9gitime, parce que cela les rend incompatibles avec les principes fondamentaux de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, qui sont inscrits dans la Loi.\n[137] Les messages donnent m\u00eame \u00e0 penser que la violence contre les minorit\u00e9s canadiennes et en particulier contre les Juifs est acceptable. On y d\u00e9c\u00e8le tr\u00e8s souvent un accent d'agressivit\u00e9.\n[138] Dans le site Web du NSPC, l'intim\u00e9 affirme clairement que les Juifs, les Noirs et autres non-Blancs d\u00e9truisent le pays, qu'on devrait leur refuser la citoyennet\u00e9, qu'ils devraient \u00eatre st\u00e9rilis\u00e9s, et m\u00eame expuls\u00e9s. Ces messages soulignent que les non-Blancs introduisent la pauvret\u00e9, la criminalit\u00e9 et la corruption dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils offrent aussi aux lecteurs des raisons de les ha\u00efr et de s'en m\u00e9fier.\n[139] Les messages exposent manifestement les Juifs, les Noirs et autres minorit\u00e9s non blanches \u00e0 la haine et au m\u00e9pris, en violation de l'article 13 de la Loi.\nF. Conclusion sur la plainte se rapportant au paragraphe 13(1) [140] Apr\u00e8s examen de ces messages dans leur contexte, je ne doute aucunement qu'ils sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les gens qui professent la foi juive, les Noirs et autres minorit\u00e9s non blanches. Le th\u00e8me sous-jacent des messages de l'intim\u00e9 est que les Juifs, les Noirs et autres non-Blancs d\u00e9truisent le pays et qu'ils devraient \u00eatre soit expuls\u00e9s, soit isol\u00e9s. Les messages \u00e9voquent aussi la menace qu'ils repr\u00e9sentent pour la civilisation blanche. Les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s sont qualifi\u00e9s de vermine, de maladie, de parasites, de criminels, de fripouilles, d'escrocs et de menteurs. Ils sont d\u00e9crits comme dangereux et, dans certains cas, comme des \u00eatres d'intelligence inf\u00e9rieure.\n[141] Ces messages traduisent une malice extr\u00eame qui va jusqu'\u00e0 la violence envers les groupes vis\u00e9s. Ils ne reconnaissent aux membres de ces groupes aucune qualit\u00e9 pouvant les racheter. Les membres des groupes en question sont totalement d\u00e9shumanis\u00e9s. Ils sont donc susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[142] Le Tribunal arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que ces messages sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable en raison de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur couleur ou de leur religion, selon ce que pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, et il est d'avis que l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nG. Redressements [143] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman en vertu de l'article 13 \u00e9tant jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le redressement qui s'impose. Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s par le plaignant sont les suivants :\nla d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser l'acte discriminatoire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi; la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer une indemnit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi; la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance condamnant l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) de la Loi.\n(i) Ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir [144] Lorsqu'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13 est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi habilite le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de cesser l'acte discriminatoire. La proc\u00e9dure consistant \u00e0 instruire une plainte et, si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir a pour objet de rappeler aux Canadiens notre engagement fondamental envers l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances et l'\u00e9radication de l'intol\u00e9rance raciale et religieuse. (Voir l'arr\u00eat Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 53, et la d\u00e9cision Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 192.)\n[145] Une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir porte \u00e0 l'attention d'un intim\u00e9 le fait que ses messages sont susceptibles d'avoir des cons\u00e9quences nuisibles. L'incertitude ou l'erreur sur l'effet probable de tels messages est ainsi dissip\u00e9e, et, si l'intim\u00e9 continue de diss\u00e9miner les messages, ce sera en sachant que les personnes appartenant \u00e0 tel ou tel groupe sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9es \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris en raison de leur race ou de leur religion.\n[146] Les messages affich\u00e9s sur Internet rendent particuli\u00e8rement difficile pour le Tribunal la t\u00e2che de prononcer un redressement tangible. Comme l'\u00e9crivait le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kyburz, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 81 : La nature unique de la technologie Internet, y compris les difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'existence de multiples juridictions du fait que le cyberespace n'a pas de fronti\u00e8res, ainsi que la mobilit\u00e9 des cibles en raison du recours \u00e0 des sites miroirs, soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes quant \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 des ordonnances de cesser et de s'abstenir de diffuser des messages haineux par Internet. Nonobstant cette observation, le Tribunal a n\u00e9anmoins rendu, dans cette affaire, une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir. La difficult\u00e9 de concevoir un redressement tangible ne devrait nullement emp\u00eacher le Tribunal de rendre une telle ordonnance s'il le juge \u00e0 propos.\n[147] Dans la d\u00e9cision Z\u00fcndel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait ce qui suit, au paragraphe 300 :\nToute mesure de redressement prise par ce Tribunal ou tout autre tribunal servira immanquablement plusieurs buts; la pr\u00e9vention et l'\u00e9limination d'actes discriminatoires ne sont qu'un des r\u00e9sultats qui d\u00e9couleront d'une ordonnance rendue par suite de cette instance. La d\u00e9nonciation publique des actes reproch\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce rev\u00eat par ailleurs une importante valeur symbolique. De plus, il y a un avantage possible sur le plan \u00e9ducatif et, en fin de compte, du point de vue de l'effet pr\u00e9ventif qui peut d\u00e9couler d'un d\u00e9bat ouvert sur les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans cette d\u00e9cision et toute autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[148] Une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir peut avoir un effet \u00e0 la fois pratique et symbolique. Sur le plan pratique, elle emp\u00eachera l'intim\u00e9 de continuer de communiquer, sur Internet, des messages de la nature d\u00e9crite dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Sur le plan symbolique, il y a certainement avantage \u00e0 d\u00e9noncer publiquement les actes \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, et une telle ordonnance comporte \u00e9galement une importante valeur \u00e9ducative.\n[149] Eu \u00e9gard aux articles affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9, le Tribunal est d'avis que la d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance de cesser et de s'abstenir est tout \u00e0 fait l\u00e9gitime. Il est donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, Terry Tremaine, de cesser l'acte discriminatoire consistant \u00e0 communiquer ou \u00e0 faire communiquer, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite dans l'article 13 de la Loi, \u00e0 savoir Internet, des articles du genre de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s contraires au paragraphe 13(1) dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ou tout autre document au contenu sensiblement analogue qui est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\n(ii) Indemnit\u00e9 selon l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi [150] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner le paiement \u00e0 la victime d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale ne d\u00e9passant pas 20 000 $ si la victime est express\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9e dans la communication qui a constitu\u00e9 l'acte discriminatoire, et si le Tribunal est d'avis que l'intim\u00e9 s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Le plaignant veut obtenir de l'intim\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 10 000 $.\n[151] Le plaignant fait valoir que, pour que le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 soit ordonn\u00e9 en vertu de cet article, il suffit que le Tribunal soit convaincu que la victime est express\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9e dans les messages discriminatoires et que l'intim\u00e9 a commis l'acte discriminatoire d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il fait valoir qu'aucun autre facteur ne doit \u00eatre pris en compte.\n[152] Le paragraphe 54(1) donne au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'ordonner un ou plusieurs des redressements qu'il \u00e9num\u00e8re. Il dispose que le membre instructeur... peut rendre\/ The member or panel may make only one or more of the following orders. (L'italique est de moi.) Le paragraphe 53(3), auquel se r\u00e9f\u00e8re l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b), emploie lui aussi le mot peut\/may.\n[153] Lorsque le mot peut est employ\u00e9 dans une loi, un doute subsiste rarement sur le sens de ce mot (voir la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I-21, article 11). Ce mot signifie que le l\u00e9gislateur autorise une personne \u00e0 faire quelque chose qu'elle n'aurait pas autrement le pouvoir de faire, ou \u00e0 faire quelque chose qui serait autrement sans effet juridique. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Parlement a habilit\u00e9 le membre instructeur \u00e0 ordonner certains redressements, y compris le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la victime. Lorsqu'un pouvoir est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une loi avec le mot peut, il s'ensuit que le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 est discr\u00e9tionnaire et que la personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 l'exercer est libre l\u00e9galement de l'exercer ou de ne pas l'exercer. Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit toutefois \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec discernement et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve produite devant le Tribunal (voir le jugement Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Dumont, 2002 CFPI 1280, aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 15).\n[154] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) pr\u00e9voit que le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 lorsque :\nune victime; est express\u00e9ment identifi\u00e9e dans la communication qui constituait l'acte discriminatoire; et l'intim\u00e9 s'est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[155] La premi\u00e8re condition est que c'est \u00e0 une victime que l'indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e. Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si le plaignant, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, est une victime de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[156] Dans sa plaidoirie, l'avocate de la Commission a examin\u00e9 cet aspect. Elle s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi, ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9\n40. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (5) et (7), un individu ou un groupe d'individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission en la forme acceptable pour cette derni\u00e8re.\n40. (1) Subject to subsections (5) and (7), any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint in a form acceptable to the Commission.\n:\n[157] Point int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 noter, l'alin\u00e9a 40(5)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment un cas tel que celui en l'esp\u00e8ce :\n40(5) - Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, la Commission n'est validement saisie d'une plainte que si l'acte discriminatoire:\nb) a eu lieu au Canada sans qu'il soit possible d'en identifier la victime, mais tombe sous le coup des articles 5, 8, 10, 12, ou 13.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'originale.)\n40(5) - No complaint in relation to a discriminatory practice may be dealt with by the Commission under this Part unless the act or omission that constitutes the practice\n(b) occurred in Canada and was a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5, 8, 10, 12 or 13 in respect of which no particular individual is identifiable as the victim.\n(The emphasis is mine.)\n[158] Dans sa plaidoirie, la Commission a ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce paragraphe, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il y ait une victime pour qu'une plainte puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi. Elle s'est aussi r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, dans laquelle, au paragraphe 46, le Tribunal \u00e9crivait que, selon l'article 13, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver qu'une personne avait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la haine ou du m\u00e9pris dirig\u00e9 vers le groupe cible. La Commission a conclu en affirmant que la jurisprudence, et en particulier la Loi, autorise manifestement une personne ou un groupe de personne \u00e0 d\u00e9poser, en vertu de cet article, une plainte de violation des droits de la personne, qu'elles soient ou non les victimes de l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s la Commission, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander en l'esp\u00e8ce si le plaignant \u00e9tait ou non une victime.\n[159] Pour sa part, le plaignant n'a produit durant l'audience aucune preuve susceptible d'\u00e9tablir qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de l'acte discriminatoire commis par l'intim\u00e9. Il n'avait pas \u00e0 le prouver pour d\u00e9poser sa plainte. Dans sa plainte initiale, le plaignant avait sollicit\u00e9 un redressement au titre de l'article 14.1 de la Loi, pour repr\u00e9sailles. Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se d\u00e9sister de cette pr\u00e9tention. Il ne peut pas maintenant faire volte-face en demandant le versement d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale au titre de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b). Le Tribunal arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion, pour le motif susmentionn\u00e9, que le plaignant n'a pas produit la preuve requise par cet alin\u00e9a.\n[160] Le Tribunal arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que la demande d'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\n(iii) Ordonnance imposant une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire selon l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) [161] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut rendre une ordonnance imposant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $. Lorsqu'il d\u00e9cide s'il convient ou non de rendre une telle ordonnance, le Tribunal doit, selon le paragraphe 54(1.1), prendre en compte :\nla nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire, ainsi que les circonstances qui l'entouraient; la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte; les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur; la capacit\u00e9 de payer de son auteur.\n[162] Les nombreux messages haineux affich\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s m\u00e9prisants et tr\u00e8s blessants. Ils qualifiaient de mauvais et de criminels les membres des groupes vis\u00e9s. Ils qualifiaient les Juifs de parasites et de vermines. Ils pr\u00e9tendaient que les Noirs avaient une intelligence inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des Blancs. Ils appelaient \u00e0 l'expulsion des Juifs, des Noirs et des autres non-Blancs du Canada. Ces messages sont malicieux, malveillants et extr\u00eames dans le caract\u00e8re violent de leur r\u00e9sonance.\n[163] La promotion active, par l'intim\u00e9, de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'endroit des membres des groupes vis\u00e9s va fonci\u00e8rement \u00e0 contre-courant de l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui est de favoriser une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont tous les membres sont \u00e0 l'abri de la discrimination et dont tous peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leurs caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles, telles que la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur ou l'orientation sexuelle.\n[164] Il faut dire, au cr\u00e9dit de l'intim\u00e9, que rien ne donnait \u00e0 penser qu'il s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires avant de commencer \u00e0 afficher des articles sur le site Web Stormfront en 2004. Dans l'\u00e9tablissement de la sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 imposer, il convient aussi de prendre en compte le fait que, durant une p\u00e9riode d'environ dix mois, apr\u00e8s que la plainte lui fut signifi\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 s'est abstenu d'afficher des messages et il a m\u00eame, \u00e0 un certain moment, d\u00e9savou\u00e9 et r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 tous ses messages.\n[165] Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue des messages haineux, la preuve montre que l'intim\u00e9 avait, au 28 juillet 2006, affich\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de 1 900 messages sur le site Stormfront. Comme le Tribunal n'a pas vu ni lu tous ces messages, il ne saurait, en toute justice pour l'intim\u00e9, conclure que tous renferment des messages haineux de la nature de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits comme preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne saurait arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le nombre de messages affich\u00e9s milite en faveur d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e du registre.\n[166] La volont\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9 de commettre les actes discriminatoires est \u00e9vidente, vu le ton malveillant des messages eux-m\u00eames. Il a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'il s'en tenait \u00e0 tout ce qu'il avait \u00e9crit dans ses articles, il a refus\u00e9 d'exprimer le moindre remords et il n'a montr\u00e9 aucun signe d'une quelconque intention de mettre fin \u00e0 ses activit\u00e9s.\n[167] L'intim\u00e9 a expos\u00e9 sa situation financi\u00e8re. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait ni voiture ni maison. Il a perdu son emploi \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de la Saskatchewan. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il travaille actuellement 20 heures par semaine au salaire minimum, pour un revenu net d'environ 600 $ par mois. Cette preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e, et l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur cet aspect, ni par la Commission, ni par le plaignant.\n[168] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature, aux circonstances, \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 et au caract\u00e8re intentionnel des communications, et compte tenu de tous les autres facteurs, je suis d'avis qu'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 4 000 $ serait raisonnable dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances.\nV. ORDONNANCE [169] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, le Tribunal affirme que la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre Terry Tremaine est fond\u00e9e et il ordonne ce qui suit :\nque Terry Tremaine, et les autres personnes qui agissent en concertation avec lui, mettent fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire consistant \u00e0 utiliser ou \u00e0 faire utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement, pour communiquer des messages du genre de ceux qui ont ici \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s contraires au paragraphe 13(1), ou tout autre message pr\u00e9sentant un contenu sensiblement analogue, qui sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable en raison d'un motif de distinction illicite, contrevenant ainsi au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; que Terry Tremaine soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 4 000 $. Cette somme sera pay\u00e9e par ch\u00e8que vis\u00e9 ou mandat, \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et devra \u00eatre re\u00e7ue par le Tribunal dans les 120 jours qui suivront la notification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 23 mars 2004, le Centre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales (CRARR) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre www.bcwhitepride.com invoquant les paragraphes 13(1) et 13(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP). La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal le 24 janvier 2006.\n[2] Le 11 mai 2006, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire modifier l'intitul\u00e9 de la cause et \u00e0 ajouter une partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait atteindre trois objectifs :\nchanger le nom actuel de l'intim\u00e9, soit www.bcwhitepride.com, pour le BC White Pride Group associ\u00e9 au site Web www.bcwhitepride.com afin de clarifier toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 au cas o\u00f9 la plainte serait accueillie et qu'un jugement aurait \u00e0 \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9; ajouter le White Renegade Group associ\u00e9 au site Web www.whiterenegade.com; ajouter le nom de John Beck en tant qu'intim\u00e9 associ\u00e9 au dit site Web.\n[3] Cette requ\u00eate a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par ma coll\u00e8gue, Mme Karen Jensen, qui, dans une d\u00e9cision rendue le 26 juin 2006, a ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate soit tranch\u00e9e par le m\u00eame membre du Tribunal charg\u00e9 d'entendre la plainte sur le fond.\n[4] Il faut noter ici que Mme Jensen a par la suite autoris\u00e9 que soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9 un subpoena duces tecum, \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, afin d'assurer la pr\u00e9sence de M. Beck \u00e0 l'audience. M. Beck a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent tout au long de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, ainsi que M. Paul Fromm.\n[5] Au d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente audience, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Fromm s'il repr\u00e9sentait l'intim\u00e9 actuel, le site www.bcwhitepride.com, ou M. Beck. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 M. Beck, M. Fromm a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'il repr\u00e9sentait M. Beck et non www.bcwhitepride.com. Le Tribunal conclut donc que, dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, l'intim\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.com n'est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\n[6] En outre, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de pr\u00e9ciser quelles parties elle souhaitait ajouter en tant qu'intim\u00e9es. Il semble maintenant que la Commission souhaite ajouter quatre nouveaux intim\u00e9s en plus de l'intim\u00e9 actuel, www.bcwhitepride.com., soit M. John Beck, le White Renegade Group, le BC White Pride Group et www.bcwhitepride.org.\n[7] Dans ses premiers arguments devant le Tribunal, l'avocat de la Commission a soutenu que la preuve produite dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pourrait \u00e9galement servir dans le cadre de l'audience sur le fond.\n[8] Le Tribunal est d'avis que cela constituerait un manquement grave \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale si la preuve produite dans le cadre d'une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire ajouter des intim\u00e9s faisait partie de la preuve pour l'audience sur le fond. Cela signifierait que le Tribunal ajouterait un autre intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intitul\u00e9 et que celui-ci serait li\u00e9 par la preuve d\u00e9j\u00e0 produite, contre laquelle il n'aurait pas eu l'opportunit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre pleinement en tant qu'intim\u00e9.\nII. LES ARGUMENTS DES PARTIES [9] La Commission et le plaignant soutiennent que www.bcwhitepride.org, le BC White Pride Group, le White Renegade Group ainsi que M. John Beck devraient \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s en tant que parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et soutiennent que leur pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[10] M. Fromm, en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant de M. Beck et non de www.bcwhitepride.com, soutient que M. Beck ne devrait pas \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 en tant que partie et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, www.bcwhitepride.com n'est pas une personne morale, mais une adresse Internet sans capacit\u00e9 juridique.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [11] Le Tribunal doit juger dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, d'une part, si M. John Beck est ou non la personne qui se nomme John dans les courriers \u00e9lectroniques envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 Rachel et les s\u00e9ances de clavardage avec cette personne et qui utilise les pseudonymes David Drolet ou Renegade1488ca.\n[12] D'autre part, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si le BC White Pride Group, le White Renegade Group et www.bcwhitepride.org existent et sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 www.bcwhitepride.com, l'intim\u00e9 actuel, ainsi qu'\u00e0 M. Beck.\n[13] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal doit juger s'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'ajouter M. John Beck, le BC White Pride Group, le White Renegade Group et www.bcwhitepride.org \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure pour que la plainte soit examin\u00e9e en bonne et due forme.\n[14] Au stade actuel de la proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 trancher le litige sur le fond ni \u00e0 se prononcer sur le contenu du site Web bcwhitepride.\nIV. LA PREUVE [15] La Commission a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre un t\u00e9moin, M. Shane Martinez. Bien que la Commission l'ait cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, M. Beck n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement entendu M. Bernard Klatt, appel\u00e9 par M. Fromm en qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert.\n[16] M. Martinez a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, au printemps 2004, pendant qu'il se trouvait en R\u00e9publique dominicaine, il a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate sur deux sites Web, soit www.bcwhitepride.com et www.whiterenegade.com. M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour ces sites avait \u00e9t\u00e9 piqu\u00e9 par une recherche effectu\u00e9e sur le site Web Stormfront, un site n\u00e9o-nazi et faisant la promotion de la supr\u00e9matie blanche selon M. Martinez. Sur ce dernier site, M. Martinez a vu des messages affich\u00e9s par un utilisateur ayant adopt\u00e9 le surnom Renegade, messages portant sur des questions relatives \u00e0 la Colombie-Britannique et au Canada en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[17] M. Martinez a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, au moment o\u00f9 il a recueilli les renseignements, il n'avait pas l'intention de d\u00e9poser une plainte concernant les droits de la personne. Il recueillait des renseignements dans le but d'identifier la personne derri\u00e8re les deux sites Web afin que celle-ci, au moyen d'une certaine forme d'\u00e9ducation sociale et de sensibilisation, soit connue du public pour le genre d'activit\u00e9s auxquelles elle participait.\n[18] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu'aucun renseignement personnel n'\u00e9tait inscrit sur les sites bcwhitepride et whiterenegade, M. Martinez n'a pu identifier la ou les personnes ayant cr\u00e9\u00e9 ces sites. Cependant, afin de d\u00e9couvrir leur identit\u00e9, M. Martinez a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'entrer en contact avec la personne utilisant le surnom Renegade, dont l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique apparaissait sur le site whiterenegade.com. M. Martinez esp\u00e9rait que, en \u00e9tablissant une telle relation, il pourrait en apprendre plus sur la ou les personnes exploitant le site Web.\n[19] Afin d'inciter les cr\u00e9ateurs des sites Web en question \u00e0 lui fournir les renseignements qu'il d\u00e9sirait obtenir, M. Martinez a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'employer un stratag\u00e8me, une ruse, une strat\u00e9gie qui, selon ses dires, est assez commune dans le type d'enqu\u00eate qu'il menait.\n[20] Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Martinez n'a pas utilis\u00e9 sa propre identit\u00e9 quand il a tent\u00e9 d'obtenir l'identit\u00e9 des cr\u00e9ateurs des sites Web, mais celle d'un personnage fictif s'int\u00e9ressant aux sujets abord\u00e9s sur le site Web whiterenegade et partageant des opinions semblables \u00e0 celles exprim\u00e9es sur le site, de fa\u00e7on a cr\u00e9er un lien de communication entre lui et la ou les personnes responsables du site Web whiterenegade.\n[21] M. Martinez a utilis\u00e9 le pseudonyme Rachel et le surnom Swedish Pride 1488 dans ses coordonn\u00e9es. M. Martinez voulait que la personne avec qui il correspondait croit qu'il \u00e9tait une femme qui s'int\u00e9ressait aux questions relatives au maintien du statut des blancs dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[22] M. Martinez a \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9 les photographies d'une jeune femme pour donner plus de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son personnage. Les photos qu'il a utilis\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises sur un site Web et sont celles d'une femme qui, selon M. Martinez, est impliqu\u00e9e dans le type d'activit\u00e9s et de causes dont il est question sur les sites whiterenegade.com et bcwhitepride.com.\n[23] M. Martinez a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le profil de Rachel dans Yahoo, il a attribu\u00e9 au personnage de Rachel d'autres caract\u00e9ristiques, comme les go\u00fbts musicaux, qui correspondaient \u00e0 certaines convictions des personnes s'int\u00e9ressant aux questions politiques abord\u00e9es par les sites Web faisant l'objet de son enqu\u00eate. Il a aussi inscrit son \u00e9tat civil, c\u00e9libataire, pour inciter les gens \u00e0 communiquer avec elle, ses loisirs et son lieu de r\u00e9sidence, l'Ontario.\n[24] M. Martinez, avec le surnom Rachel, a utilis\u00e9 l'adresse swedish4life@cyber-rights.net pour entrer en contact avec Renegade par l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique de ce dernier affich\u00e9e sur le site Web whiterenegade.com, soit whiterenegade@whiterenegade.com. Selon M. Martinez, quand il a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'adresse whiterenegade@whiterenegade.com, celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9achemin\u00e9 automatiquement \u00e0 une autre adresse, soit renegade1488ca@yahoo.com.\n[25] Par l'adresse renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, M. Martinez, en employant le pseudonyme Rachel et l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique swedish4life@cyber-rights.net, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'entrer en communication avec un individu qui s'est d'abord identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant John. M. Martinez a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de communiquer avec John non seulement par courriers \u00e9lectroniques, mais \u00e9galement par clavardage. M. Martinez a de plus r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir des photographies de John. En outre, M. Martinez a effectu\u00e9 certaines recherches sur le Web afin d'obtenir plus de renseignements sur l'identit\u00e9 de John.\n[26] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Martinez a expliqu\u00e9 quels renseignements il tentait d'obtenir au cours de son enqu\u00eate. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il tentait d'obtenir, en plus du contenu des discussions par courrier \u00e9lectronique et par clavardage, le nom de l'auteur, le nom du destinataire, la date \u00e0 laquelle le courrier \u00e9lectronique a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9, ainsi que le sujet du courrier \u00e9lectronique, l'adresse du fournisseur d'acc\u00e8s Internet des serveurs par lesquels passaient les courriers \u00e9lectroniques afin d'arriver \u00e0 destination, de m\u00eame que l'endroit d'o\u00f9 les courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s.\n[27] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Martinez a expliqu\u00e9 comment il sauvegardait les courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec Renegade ainsi que les messages \u00e9chang\u00e9s lors des clavardages. Entre autres, il copiait puis collait les courriers \u00e9lectroniques dans un logiciel de traitement de texte et il y transcrivait aussi les clavardages. M. Martinez a affirm\u00e9 que, pendant qu'il \u00e9tait en R\u00e9publique dominicaine, il sauvegardait les documents sur un disque dur externe lorsque c'\u00e9tait possible. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ainsi pour \u00e9viter la d\u00e9gradation des dossiers \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la nature rudimentaire des syst\u00e8mes qu'il utilisait et les pannes d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 fr\u00e9quentes en mars 2004, pendant qu'il menait son enqu\u00eate.\n[28] Pendant sa correspondance avec la personne de l'adresse renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, M. Martinez n'a pu sauvegarder tous les documents relatifs aux \u00e9changes de courriers \u00e9lectroniques et aux clavardages. En raison des pannes d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, certains clavardages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus. M. Martinez a de plus t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pendant qu'il effectuait son travail d'enqu\u00eate, il prenait aussi des notes \u00e0 la main, lesquelles il a utilis\u00e9es plus tard pour brosser le tableau g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'enqu\u00eate qu'il menait.\nA. La correspondance par courrier \u00e9lectronique [29] Deux courriers \u00e9lectroniques entre John, alias David Drolet, \u00e0 l'adresse renegade1488ca@yahoo.com, et Rachel, \u00e0 l'adresse swedish4life@cyber-rights.net, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en tant que pi\u00e8ces. Selon les documents produits en preuve, ces deux courriers \u00e9lectroniques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s le 8 mars 2004.\n[30] Les renseignements pertinents que M. Martinez a pu tirer de ces deux courriers \u00e9lectroniques envoy\u00e9s par John, alias Renegade, sont les suivants :\nJohn affirme qu'il ne boit pas, qu'il s'entra\u00eene en gymnase cinq jours par semaine, qu'il a 36 ans mais en para\u00eet 26, qu'il est un philosophe, un athl\u00e8te et un mentor, qu'il demeure dans le fuseau horaire du Pacifique, qu'il est n\u00e9 le 8 mars (1968), qu'il habite dans l'Okanagan, qu'il est originaire de Kelowna, que son surnom sur Stormfront est Renegade et que son avatar est le dessin d'un petit requin.\n[31] En outre, dans ses courriers \u00e9lectroniques, John affirme au sujet du site whiterenegade.com qu'il s'agit de son manifeste personnel en ligne, qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un groupe, mais il pr\u00e9tend par contre \u00eatre le cofondateur d'un groupe nomm\u00e9 BC White Pride et avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d'une bonne partie du contenu du site www.bcwhitepride.com.\nB. Les clavardages [32] Apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9change de courriers \u00e9lectroniques du 8 mars 2004, Rachel et John sont demeur\u00e9s en communication en clavardant sur Yahoo Messenger. Le clavardage s'est fait entre Swedishpride1488 - Rachel - et Renegade1488ca - John.\n[33] M. Martinez a soumis en preuve des transcriptions des clavardages. Les conversations en ligne, selon les transcriptions, ont eu lieu entre le 10 et le 29 mars 2004.\n[34] Les clavardages mentionnent des photographies envoy\u00e9es par Renegade1488ca \u00e0 Swedishpride1488. Elles r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que le deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9nom de Renegade1488ca est David. Les transcriptions montrent \u00e9galement que Renegade1488ca a, avec l'aide de son ami Craig, cofond\u00e9 le BC White Pride Group et qu'il aime les chiens. Les transcriptions montrent en outre que Renegade1488ca, alias John, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9 et qu'il mesure 5 pieds, 7 pouces.\n[35] M. Martinez a utilis\u00e9 tous les renseignements qu'il a pu recueillir dans l'\u00e9change de courriers \u00e9lectroniques et les s\u00e9ances de clavardage pour dresser un portrait qui, selon lui, correspond \u00e0 celui de M. Beck.\nC. Les photographies [36] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, au cours de ses \u00e9changes de courriers \u00e9lectroniques avec John, alias Renegade, ce dernier a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martinez des photographies de lui-m\u00eame. Ces photographies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en tant que pi\u00e8ce PH-4B (les photographies en noir et blanc) et pi\u00e8ce PH-4E (les photographies en couleur). Deux de ces photographies repr\u00e9sentent un homme dans une position athl\u00e9tique et deux sont celles d'un homme sortant de l'eau. La derni\u00e8re repr\u00e9sente un homme qui sourit.\n[37] Quand on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Martinez, pendant son t\u00e9moignage, s'il voyait dans la salle d'audience la personne repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sur les photographies, il a point\u00e9 M. Beck. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 s'il voyait une diff\u00e9rence avec les photographies, M. Martinez a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Beck s'\u00e9tait fait pousser la barbe.\nD. Les renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires [38] En plus des courriers \u00e9lectroniques, des transcriptions des clavardages et des photographies envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Martinez sous le pseudonyme Rachel, il existe d'autres renseignements qui sont utiles pour trancher les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[39] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de M. Beck pour les ann\u00e9es 2004 et 2005. Ces d\u00e9clarations montrent que M. Beck habite \u00e0 Kelowna et contiennent l'adresse de son domicile.\n[40] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Martinez a confirm\u00e9 que ces renseignements, soit l'adresse de M. Beck, lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par John quand il menait son enqu\u00eate en R\u00e9publique dominicaine, mais qu'il n'avait malheureusement pas pu sauvegarder la transcription du clavardage contenant ce renseignement. M. Martinez a de plus affirm\u00e9 que John avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Rachel son adresse pour que celle-ci puisse lui envoyer une carte postale.\n[41] M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a obtenu l'adresse de John, il a effectu\u00e9 une v\u00e9rification invers\u00e9e sur le site 411.ca pour savoir si l'adresse existait vraiment. La v\u00e9rification a confirm\u00e9 l'existence de l'adresse. Les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de M. Beck qu'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es la Commission montrent que ce dernier habite \u00e0 l'adresse que M. Martinez pr\u00e9tend avoir obtenue de John au cours de son enqu\u00eate.\n[42] Finalement, il ressort des pages Web soumises en preuve par M. Martinez que le site www.bcwhitepride.org est maintenant situ\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis et que, tout comme www.whiterenegade.com, il appartient depuis le 24 novembre 2006, soit quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente audience, \u00e0 Hal Turner Radio Network. La preuve documentaire r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement que le groupe BC White Pride est associ\u00e9 au site Web www.bcwhitepride.org.\nV. ANALYSE [43] Dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, la Commission souhaite faire ajouter en tant qu'intim\u00e9s M. John Beck, le B.C. White Pride Group, le White Renegade Group et www.bcwhitepride.org. La Commission n'a signifi\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate \u00e0 aucune de ces quatre entit\u00e9s. M. Beck s'est toutefois vu signifier un subpoena duces tecum lui enjoignant de compara\u00eetre en tant que t\u00e9moin dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, M. Beck \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent pour la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et a soumis des observations par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Fromm.\n[44] M. Beck est un individu clairement identifi\u00e9. Pour ce qui est du B.C. White Pride Group et du White Renegade Group, ils constituent des groupes non d\u00e9finis. Www.bcwhitepride.org est un site Web.\n[45] Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9voient l'adjonction d'une partie \u00e0 une instruction \u00e0 la demande d'une autre partie. Le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles \u00e9nonce :\nLa Commission, l'intim\u00e9 ou le plaignant qui d\u00e9sire ajouter une partie \u00e0 l'instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet, qui doit \u00eatre signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle, laquelle a droit \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des arguments au sujet de la requ\u00eate.\n[46] Dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-T\u00e9l\u00e9phone c. Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 TCDP 31, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que l'adjonction forc\u00e9e d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 une fois que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d'instruire une plainte est appropri\u00e9e, en l'absence de r\u00e8gles formelles \u00e0 cet effet, s'il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte, au paragraphe 30. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par une autre d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Brown et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43.\n[47] La preuve produite relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission est constitu\u00e9e tant de t\u00e9moignages que de documents. Elle est compos\u00e9e du t\u00e9moignage de M. Shane Martinez, du dossier qu'il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 sur bcwhitepride et M. Beck ainsi que de pages Web. Elle comprend aussi le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bernard Klatt, appel\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre par M. Fromm, en qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert.\n[48] Lors du contre-interrogatoire de M. Martinez, M. Fromm a attaqu\u00e9 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Martinez ainsi que la fiabilit\u00e9 des documents qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en 2004 pendant qu'il \u00e9tait en R\u00e9publique dominicaine. M. Fromm a critiqu\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont M. Martinez a recueilli les renseignements sur bcwhitepride.com et whiterenegade.com, en usant de tromperie et en usurpant l'identit\u00e9 d'une autre personne. M. Fromm a soutenu que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l'id\u00e9ologie et les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de M. Martinez, celui-ci ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un t\u00e9moin fiable.\n[49] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Fromm et M. Martinez se connaissent depuis longtemps et que leur relation est marqu\u00e9e par de violentes confrontations. Des extraits d'un DVD qu'a visionn\u00e9 le Tribunal l'attestent. Leur relation n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pacifique, et c'est un euph\u00e9misme.\n[50] Le Tribunal doit dire que M. Martinez, parfois, s'est montr\u00e9 \u00e9vasif dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre et qu'il a eu des trous de m\u00e9moire quand il \u00e9tait question de ses opinions politiques et de messages qu'il aurait affich\u00e9s sur certains sites Web, comme Stormfront. Le calme et la politesse qu'affichait M. Martinez devant le Tribunal contrastent fortement avec son comportement lors de manifestations, de rassemblements et d'autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements s'\u00e9tant produits \u00e0 Toronto en 2004. Ses actions, de plus d'une mani\u00e8re, ne concordent pas avec ses affirmations.\n[51] M. Fromm a cit\u00e9 M. Bernard Klatt \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re M. Klatt comme \u00e9tant un expert en mati\u00e8re de services Internet. Pendant que la qualit\u00e9 d'expert de M. Klatt \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie, l'avocat de la Commission a mis en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et l'objectivit\u00e9 de M. Klatt, en laissant entendre que celui-ci \u00e9tait un ami proche de M. Beck et de M. Fromm et qu'il \u00e9tait l'ami d'Ernst Z\u00fcndel.\n[52] M. Klatt reconna\u00eet qu'il conna\u00eet M. Fromm depuis 1996, qu'il conna\u00eet M. Beck depuis 1998 et qu'il a connu celui-ci alors qu'il faisait l'objet d'attention m\u00e9diatique \u00e0 la suite de ce qu'il a nomm\u00e9 la controverse Oliver. La controverse Oliver faisait suite \u00e0 l'opposition d'un individu au fait que M. Klatt h\u00e9berge des sites Web consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant haineux.\n[53] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, M. Klatt s'est montr\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le moins \u00e9vasif dans ses r\u00e9ponses quant \u00e0 ses liens et \u00e0 son association avec le mouvement de supr\u00e9matie blanche, avec M. Beck et avec M. Z\u00fcndel. Pour ce qui est de ses liens avec M. Beck, M. Klatt a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se souvenir du type de conversations qu'il a eues avec lui au cours des huit derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Ce trou de m\u00e9moire est plut\u00f4t \u00e9tonnant puisqu'ils se connaissent depuis longtemps.\n[54] Quant \u00e0 sa preuve d'expert, M. Klatt \u00e9tait d'avis que les documents soumis par M. Martinez comportaient des lacunes importantes, que la valeur des documents \u00e9tait faible et qu'elle soulevait des doutes importants. Selon M. Klatt, M. Martinez aurait pu sauvegarder d'une meilleure fa\u00e7on les courriers \u00e9lectroniques et les transcriptions des clavardages produits en preuve et il aurait pu soumettre en preuve sous une forme plus fiable les courriers \u00e9lectroniques et les messages \u00e9chang\u00e9s.\n[55] Le Tribunal estime que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Klatt n'\u00e9tait pas assez convaincant pour qu'il conclue que le contenu des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des conversations entre Rachel et John, tels que M. Martinez les a sauvegard\u00e9s, a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre par M. Martinez.\n[56] Cela dit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve documentaire vient \u00e9tayer le t\u00e9moignage de M. Martinez. D'une part, le Tribunal n'a aucune raison de conclure que M. Martinez a modifi\u00e9 d'une quelconque fa\u00e7on le contenu des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des transcriptions de clavardage soumis en preuve. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Martinez a clairement expliqu\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode qu'il a suivie pour recueillir des renseignements sur www.bcwhitepride.com, BC White Pride et John, alias David Drolet, alias Renegade1488ca, qui serait, selon M. Martinez, M. John Beck.\n[57] Le Tribunal conclut donc que le contenu des courriers \u00e9lectroniques et des transcriptions de clavardage soumis en preuve est, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, authentique et fiable et peut servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'identit\u00e9 des personnes que la Commission souhaite faire ajouter en tant que parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\nA. M. John Beck [58] Bien qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent tout au long de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, M. Beck n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y a pas de preuve testimoniale directe \u00e9tablissant de mani\u00e8re conclusive que John Beck est bien le John, alias Renegade, alias David Drolet, avec qui Rachel communiquait par courrier \u00e9lectronique ou clavardage. Le lien entre John Beck et John, ainsi que ses divers alias, ne peut donc \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que par preuve circonstancielle.\n[59] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que Renegade1488ca, John ou David Drolet n'ont jamais affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre John Beck. Le dossier montre que John, David Drolet, etc. \u00e9taient les noms utilis\u00e9s par quelqu'un qui correspondait avec Rachel en mars 2004.\n[60] M. Martinez pr\u00e9sume et soutient avec vigueur que le John, David Drolet, Renegade avec qui il a correspondu en utilisant l'alias Rachel est en fait John Beck. Pour ce dire, il s'appuie sur un certain nombre de caract\u00e9ristiques physiques, comme la grandeur, la couleur des yeux, la couleur des cheveux, la largeur des \u00e9paules. Selon M. Martinez, le portrait qu'il a dress\u00e9 au moyen des renseignements qu'il a recueillis de diverses sources correspond \u00e0 la description g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de M. Beck.\n[61] M. Martinez n'est pas un expert en identification judiciaire, ni le Tribunal d'ailleurs. Cependant, le Tribunal a pu \u00e9tablir, par comparaison avec d'autres individus, que M. Beck mesure environ 5 pieds, 7 pouces, qu'il a les yeux bleus et qu'il semble avoir dans la fin trentaine. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement pu examiner les photographies soumises en preuve par M. Martinez, lesquelles lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par John, alias Renegade. Deux des photographies montrent un homme en maillot de bain blanc adoptant une pose athl\u00e9tique. Les traits du visage, lorsque compar\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux de M. Beck, ressemblent fortement \u00e0 ceux de M. Beck.\n[62] D'autres preuves, comme le fait que M. Beck, selon la recherche effectu\u00e9e par M. Martinez sur le site 411.ca, habite \u00e0 Kelowna, en Colombie-Britannique, viennent appuyer la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle M. John Beck est probablement la personne avec qui M. Martinez, sous le pseudonyme Rachel, correspondait en 2004. Ce renseignement, ainsi que l'adresse de M. Beck, est confirm\u00e9 par les d\u00e9clarations de revenus de 2004 et 2005 soumises en preuve par la Commission.\n[63] Le Tribunal conclut que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve circonstancielle est assez solide pour \u00e9tablir selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que M. John Beck est la personne avec qui M. Martinez a correspondu en 2004 et pour lier M. John Beck \u00e0 BC White Pride, que ce soit le groupe ou le site Web. Le Tribunal conclut que M. Beck devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 en tant que partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction, car sa pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire pour examiner la plainte en bonne et due forme.\n[64] Cela dit, il sera toujours possible pour M. Beck de montrer qu'il n'est pas le John avec qui Rachel a correspondu en 2004 et qu'il n'est d'aucune fa\u00e7on li\u00e9 \u00e0 BC White Pride, www.bcwhitepride.com ou www.bcwhitepride.org.\nB. Bcwhitepride.org [65] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Martinez a pu consulter un site Web appel\u00e9 www.bcwhitepride.org et a pu t\u00e9l\u00e9charger de nombreuses pages du site dont le contenu ressemble de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons aux pages qui se trouvaient sur le site Web bcwhitepride.com.\n[66] Une recherche sur BetterWhois.com ainsi que sur Whois.net montre que le nom de domaine bcwhitepride.org a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en juillet 2004. Selon M. Martinez, ce renseignement est fiable puisqu'il est le r\u00e9sultat d'une recherche automatique.\n[67] Dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, il appara\u00eet que le site bcwhitepride.org est en fait intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 bcwhitepride.com. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Martinez a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'est pas rare pour une personne qui cr\u00e9e un site Web d'utiliser diff\u00e9rents sous-domaines, comme .com, .net, .ca, etc.\n[68] Que l'un de ces sites ou que ces deux sites constituent des personnes morales ou non est une question qui reste \u00e0 trancher. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Fromm a affirm\u00e9 que cette question demeurait valide et pouvait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e plus tard.\n[69] Pour l'instant, sans trancher la question de savoir si un site Web constitue ou non une personne ayant une capacit\u00e9 juridique, le Tribunal conclut que www.bcwhitepride.org est un site Web qui existe et qui est probablement une branche de www.bcwhitepride.com. Le Tribunal estime que la pr\u00e9sence de www.bcwhitepride.org dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher la plainte en bonne et due forme.\nC. Le BC White Pride Group [70] La Commission soutient qu'il existe en Colombie-Britannique un groupe appel\u00e9 BC White Pride. De nombreuses pi\u00e8ces soumises en preuve mentionnent l'existence de ce groupe.\n[71] Par exemple, on peut trouver de nombreuses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au groupe BC White Pride sur le site bcwhitepride.org. Une page Web sur le site bcwhitepride.org contient le texte suivant :\n[traduction]\nBienvenue chez BC White Pride\nLa Colombie-Britannique est l'h\u00f4te d'un nouveau mouvement audacieux se consacrant principalement \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation des blancs sur des questions d'actualit\u00e9 comme l'immigration.\n[72] L'existence d'un groupe appel\u00e9 BC White Pride est de plus confirm\u00e9e par John, alias Renegade. Dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique dat\u00e9 du 8 mars 2004 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Rachel, John d\u00e9clare que whiterenegade.com est son propre manifeste personnel en ligne et non un groupe. Cependant, il reconna\u00eet avoir cofond\u00e9 un groupe appel\u00e9 BC White Pride. Dans une conversation en ligne avec Rachel, le 10 mars 2004, John mentionne encore une fois qu'il a cofond\u00e9 le BC White Pride avec un ami et un camarade nomm\u00e9 Craig.\n[73] Le Tribunal conclut que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve, il existe un groupe nomm\u00e9 BC White Pride et que sa pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher la plainte en bonne et due forme.\nD. Le White Renegade Group [74] La Commission soutient qu'il existe en Colombie-Britannique un groupe appel\u00e9 White Renegade. La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas l'existence de ce groupe. Toutefois, elle montre que le site Web www.whiterenegade.com existe et qu'il s'agit du manifeste en ligne de John, avec qui Rachel a correspondu.\n[75] Il faut noter que www.whiterenegade.com n'est pas une partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[76] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l'absence de preuve montrant que White Renegade est un groupe, le Tribunal ne peut conclure \u00e0 l'existence d'un groupe nomm\u00e9 White Renegade. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de la Commission visant \u00e0 faire ajouter ce groupe en tant que partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure est rejet\u00e9e.\nVI. D\u00c9CISION [77] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Beck a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et qu'il a soumis, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de M. Fromm, des observations expliquant pourquoi il ne devrait pas \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 en tant que partie et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve, le Tribunal ordonne que M. John Beck soit ajout\u00e9 en tant que partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[78] Puisque la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le BC White Pride Group et le site www.bcwhitepride.org sont des personnes qui existent, le Tribunal ordonne que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision leur soit signifi\u00e9e pour qu'elles puissent, en temps opportun, soumettre des observations dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 les ajouter en tant que parties.\n[79] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que rien ne prouve l'existence du White Renegade Group, la demande de la Commission visant \u00e0 faire ajouter le White Renegade Group en tant que partie est rejet\u00e9e.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 18 mai 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1120\/0206\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nCentre de recherche-action sur les relations raciales c. www.bcwhitepride.com\nDATE ET LIEU DE L'AUDIENCE :\nLes 28 au 30 novembre 2006 Les 10 au 13 avril 2007\nPenticton (Colombie-Britanique)\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION SUR REQU\u00caTE DU TRIBUNAL :\nLe 18 mai 2007\nONT COMPARU :\nFo Niemi\nPour le plaignant\nGiacomo Vigna\nPour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\nPaul Fromm\nPour l'intim\u00e9",

Hadjis\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Marc Lemire a demand\u00e9 que je d\u00e9livre un subpoena enjoignant \u00e0 Bell Canada de produire [traduction] tous les documents et renseignements concernant l'adresse IP 70.48.181.203.\n[2] Pendant l'interrogatoire d'un employ\u00e9 de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, Dean Stacey, le 10 mai 2007, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit concernant des messages affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique du site Stormfront.org par une personne utilisant le nom de Jadewarr. M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que cette personne est en fait un employ\u00e9 de la Commission. Il fonde sa conclusion sur le t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 par Richard Warman dans le cadre d'une autre audience devant le Tribunal, ainsi que sur un certain nombre de documents ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en l'esp\u00e8ce. Selon M. Lemire, cette preuve d\u00e9montre que la Commission a [traduction] particip\u00e9 activement sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques avec lui et d'autres personnes qui sont intim\u00e9es dans d'autres affaires portant sur les droits de la personne. Selon lui, cela donne \u00e0 penser que les activit\u00e9s de la Commission sont [traduction] beaucoup plus qu'une tentative d'enrayer la discrimination et ont des r\u00e9percussions sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de ses proc\u00e9dures, sur les droits tant des plaignants que des intim\u00e9s et sur les droits garantis par la Charte. En outre, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve viendrait contredire le t\u00e9moignage de M. Stacey selon lequel la Commission ne participe pas aux discussions sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques.\n[3] Apparemment, M. Lemire a en sa possession d'autres documents indiquant que l'adresse IP assign\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ordinateur \u00e0 partir duquel Jadewarr a affich\u00e9 ses messages \u00e9tait 70.48.181.203. Je d\u00e9duis que le fournisseur d'acc\u00e8s Internet ayant attribu\u00e9 cette adresse \u00e0 l'utilisateur final \u00e9tait Bell Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Lemire d\u00e9sire que le Tribunal enjoigne \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant de Bell Canada d'apporter \u00e0 l'audience tous les documents et les renseignements concernant l'adresse IP, afin de peut-\u00eatre \u00e9tablir d\u00e9finitivement si un employ\u00e9 de la Commission a affich\u00e9 des messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique sous le nom de Jadewarr.\n[4] La Commission s'est oppos\u00e9e formellement \u00e0 la divulgation de ces renseignements en vertu de l'article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, L.R.C. 1985, ch. C-5 (LPC). Dans une lettre de son avocat principal par int\u00e9rim, Philippe Dufresne, la Commission [traduction] certifie au Tribunal que ces renseignements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public, car leur divulgation porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission.\n[5] Les dispositions pertinentes de l'article 37 de la LPC sont ainsi libell\u00e9es\nRENSEIGNEMENTS D'INT\u00c9R\u00caT PUBLIC\n37. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des articles 38 \u00e0 38.16, tout ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou tout fonctionnaire peut s'opposer \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements aupr\u00e8s d'un tribunal, d'un organisme ou d'une personne ayant le pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements, en attestant verbalement ou par \u00e9crit devant eux que, pour des raisons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, ces renseignements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n(1.1) En cas d'opposition, le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne veille \u00e0 ce que les renseignements ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s, sauf en conformit\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n(2) Si l'opposition est port\u00e9e devant une cour sup\u00e9rieure, celle-ci peut d\u00e9cider la question.\n(3) Si l'opposition est port\u00e9e devant un tribunal, un organisme ou une personne qui ne constituent pas une cour sup\u00e9rieure, la question peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, sur demande, par :\nla Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans les cas o\u00f9 l'organisme ou la personne investis du pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements sous le r\u00e9gime d'une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne constituent pas un tribunal r\u00e9gi par le droit d'une province; la division ou le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance de la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province dans le ressort de laquelle le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne ont comp\u00e9tence, dans les autres cas.\n[...]\nSPECIFIED PUBLIC INTEREST\n37. (1) Subject to sections 38 to 38.16, a Minister of the Crown in right of Canada or other official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information by certifying orally or in writing to the court, person or body that the information should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest.\n(1.1) If an objection is made under subsection (1), the court, person or body shall ensure that the information is not disclosed other than in accordance with this Act.\n(2) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a superior court, that court may determine the objection.\n(3) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a court, person or body other than a superior court, the objection may be determined, on application, by\nthe Federal Court, in the case of a person or body vested with power to compel production by or under an Act of Parliament if the person or body is not a court established under a law of a province; or the trial division or trial court of the superior court of the province within which the court, person or body exercises its jurisdiction, in any other case.\n[...]\n[6] L'article 36.1 de la LPC \u00e9nonce que le terme fonctionnaire a le m\u00eame sens qu'\u00e0 l'article 118 du Code criminel, lequel pr\u00e9cise que le terme fonctionnaire d\u00e9signe toute personne qui d\u00e9tient une charge ou un emploi ou est nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique. Je suis convaincu que M. Dufresne, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'avocat principal par int\u00e9rim de la Commission, est une personne nomm\u00e9e pour remplir une fonction publique au sens de l'article 118. De plus, j'ajouterais que ce n'est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que les avocats de la Commission invoquent l'article 37 afin de pr\u00e9venir la divulgation d'information en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les parties n'ont jamais soutenu que l'avocat de la Commission n'est pas un fonctionnaire au sens de l'article 37.\n[7] D\u00e8s qu'un fonctionnaire fait part de son opposition en vertu du paragraphe 37(1) de la LPC, le tribunal, l'organisme ou la personne qui re\u00e7oit l'opposition veille \u00e0 ce que les renseignements ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s sauf en conformit\u00e9 avec la LPC (paragraphe 37(1.1)). Dans le cas d'audiences devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, la question de l'opposition ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, sur demande, que par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (alin\u00e9a 37(3)a)).\n[8] L'une des parties au pr\u00e9sent litige, la Canadian Association for Free Expression (CAFE), soutient que l'opposition de la Commission est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Elle soutient que le libell\u00e9 de l'article 37 n'interdit pas [traduction] l'obtention de renseignements, mais seulement leur production en preuve. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette opinion. Le paragraphe 37(1) pr\u00e9voit qu'un fonctionnaire peut s'opposer \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements aupr\u00e8s d'un tribunal, d'un organisme ou d'une personne. La restriction n'est pas limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la production en preuve. En outre, le Tribunal tient son pouvoir de d\u00e9livrer le subpoena que demande M. Lemire de l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, lequel \u00e9nonce que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit sous la foi du serment et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu'il juge indispensables \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, le subpoena que M. Lemire cherche \u00e0 obtenir obligerait le repr\u00e9sentant de Bell Canada \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e0 produire les documents portant sur l'adresse IP susmentionn\u00e9e, et ne ferait pas que permettre \u00e0 M. Lemire d'obtenir des renseignements.\n[9] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, M. Lemire pr\u00e9tend que, puisque le paragraphe 37(1) pr\u00e9voit qu'un fonctionnaire peut s'opposer \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements aupr\u00e8s d'un tribunal, d'un organisme ou d'une personne ayant le pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements, l'opposition ne peut \u00eatre exprim\u00e9e que lorsque le t\u00e9moin de Bell Canada compara\u00eetra, en personne, devant le Tribunal \u00e0 l'audience.\n[10] Je ne souscris pas non plus \u00e0 cette affirmation. Le paragraphe 37(1), \u00e0 mon avis, est explicite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'expression aupr\u00e8s d'un tribunal, d'un organisme ou d'une personne a trait \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements. C'est \u00e0 la divulgation des renseignements aupr\u00e8s du tribunal, de l'organisme ou de la personne que le fonctionnaire peut s'opposer. En outre, selon le paragraphe 37(1), un fonctionnaire peut s'opposer verbalement ou par \u00e9crit. Si l'opposition pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 37(1) ne pouvait \u00eatre exprim\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 l'audience publique, pourquoi le l\u00e9gislateur aurait-il permis aux fonctionnaires de s'opposer par \u00e9crit? En toute logique, cette disposition doit pr\u00e9voir la possibilit\u00e9 qu'un fonctionnaire puisse s'opposer avant le moment o\u00f9 les renseignements doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. L'opposition de M. Dufresne n'est donc pas pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e.\n[11] En outre, selon l'attestation \u00e9crite de l'opposition de M. Dufresne, les renseignements pr\u00e9cis dont il est question dans la demande de subpoena ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, et ce, pour des raisons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9cises. Dans ces circonstances, il serait absurde que le Tribunal cite un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et le contraigne \u00e0 produire des documents qui, comme nous le savons, font l'objet d'une opposition en vertu de l'article 37. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moin, selon la demande de subpoena, n'aurait aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, je ne crois pas que son t\u00e9moignage ou ses documents soient indispensables \u00e0 l'examen complet de la plainte au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Comme l'ont soulign\u00e9 Alan W. Mewett et Peter J. Sankoff dans Witnesses, (f. mobiles, Toronto, Carswell, 2004) \u00e0 la page 7-17, no 104, dans les cas o\u00f9 il est clair qu'un t\u00e9moin ne peut apporter aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve admissible parce que, par exemple, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve est confidentielle, le subpoena peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de subpoena de M. Lemire pour que Bell Canada produise [traduction] tous les documents et renseignements concernant l'adresse IP 70.48.181.203 est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement avait trait \u00e0 un \u00e9change qui aurait eu lieu entre Me Montreuil, la plaignante, et un des experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[2] Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement suffisamment s\u00e9rieux pour entendre l\u2019expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concern\u00e9e, soit le Dr. Marylin Wilchesky.\n[3] Il appert du t\u00e9moignage sous serment du Dr. Wilchesky que, lors de la pause de l\u2019avant-midi, alors que le Dr. Wilchesky \u00e9tait seule \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de la salle d\u2019audience, Me Montreuil se serait approch\u00e9e d\u2019elle \u00e0 un certain moment donn\u00e9 et lui aurait demand\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 endurer la m\u00eame torture (sous-entendue mentale) que le t\u00e9moin actuel (le Dr. Pierre Assalian), en plus d\u2019ajouter d\u2019autres commentaires sur son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9ventuel.\n[4] Le Dr. Wilchesky a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir compris des propos de Me Montreuil qu\u2019elle r\u00e9f\u00e9rait au fait d\u2019\u00e9plucher chaque document, chaque mot de chaque document mis en preuve.\n[5] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr. Wilchesky a affirm\u00e9 avoir senti alors une pression pour ne pas t\u00e9moigner comme t\u00e9moin expert dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Elle a, de plus, affirm\u00e9 avoir ressenti une peur angoiss\u00e9e (dread) et avoir per\u00e7u les propos tenus comme mena\u00e7ants, (the words were threatening), non pas physiquement mais mentalement. Elle a, par ailleurs, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsque Me Montreuil s\u2019est dirig\u00e9e vers elle, elle ne s\u2019est pas sentie menac\u00e9e physiquement.\n[6] Me Montreuil n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 l\u2019essentiel des faits rapport\u00e9s par le Dr. Wilchesky. Elle n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 avoir utilis\u00e9 le mot torture lorsqu\u2019elle a adress\u00e9 la parole au Dr. Wilchesky. Elle a soutenu qu\u2019en faisant ces remarques, elle voulait faire savoir au Dr. Wilchesky que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019apporterait rien au t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Assalian, consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle avait, de concert avec le Dr. Dufour et le Dr. Assalian, sign\u00e9 un rapport conjoint.\n[7] Le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les propos tenus par Me Montreuil, plus sp\u00e9cifiquement l\u2019utilisation du terme torture, constituent une forme d\u2019intimidation d\u2019une personne possiblement appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[8] Les t\u00e9moins experts dont les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus par une partie ont pour mission d\u2019\u00e9clairer le Tribunal sur des points techniques ou scientifiques qui ne sont pas de connaissance judiciaire. Le plus grand respect doit leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9, du reste comme \u00e0 tout autre t\u00e9moin.\n[9] Il ne saurait \u00eatre question pour quiconque, en cours d\u2019instance, de venir, par des propos inappropri\u00e9s, perturber la qui\u00e9tude de ces t\u00e9moins. Ceci ne peut servir en rien les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice. Au contraire, des propos inconvenants ne peuvent qu\u2019affecter la saine administration de la justice.\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, quelle que soit la formulation exacte des propos tenus par Me Montreuil \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du Dr. Wilchesky, le 17 mai dernier, il ressort du t\u00e9moignage non contredit de cette derni\u00e8re que Me Montreuil a utilis\u00e9 le mot torture en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au contre-interrogatoire \u00e9ventuel de celle-ci et que l\u2019ensemble des mots utilis\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us par le Dr. Wilchesky comme une menace et ont suscit\u00e9 chez elle une certaine crainte.\n[11] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la conduite qu\u2019a eue Me Montreuil vis-\u00e0-vis le Dr. Wilchesky, en salle d\u2019audience, lors de la pause du matin, le 17 mai dernier, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas appropri\u00e9e et encore moins les propos qui lui sont pr\u00eat\u00e9s d\u2019avoir tenus, notamment l\u2019utilisation du terme torture en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au contre-interrogatoire \u00e9ventuel du Dr. Wilchesky.\n[12] Il est malheureux que le contre-interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin soit per\u00e7u par un procureur comme une forme de torture mentale et qu\u2019il en fasse part \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin potentiel de la partie adverse. Encore plus malheureux est le fait que l\u2019on fasse sentir \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas le bienvenu.\n[13] L\u2019intention de Me Montreuil n\u2019\u00e9tait possiblement pas d\u2019intimider le Dr. Wilchesky. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que les propos qu\u2019elle a tenus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us comme intimidants par le Dr. Wilchesky. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement besoin pour Me Montreuil d\u2019aborder le contre-interrogatoire \u00e9ventuel du Dr. Wilchesky hors la pr\u00e9sence des procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Eurent-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents que Me Montreuil ne se serait pas permis de tenir de tels propos.\n[14] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal r\u00e9it\u00e8re l\u2019ordonnance prononc\u00e9e le 17 mai 2007, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il est interdit dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e0 Me Micheline Montreuil de s\u2019approcher des t\u00e9moins experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour leur adresser la parole hors la pr\u00e9sence des procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance vaut \u00e9galement pour les autres personnes que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait ult\u00e9rieurement appeler comme t\u00e9moin en rapport avec l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 23 mai 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1047\/2805\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Richard Warman en vertu de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne contre la Canadian Heritage Alliance et Mme Melissa Guille.\n[2] L'audition de cette plainte a commenc\u00e9 le 21 novembre 2006 \u00e0 Toronto. Le 25 novembre 2006, l'audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e, la date de reprise devant \u00eatre fix\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement.\n[3] Le 4 janvier 2007 s'est tenue une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique concernant la reprise de la pr\u00e9sente l'audience. Y ont particip\u00e9 : le pr\u00e9sident, le registraire, M. Warman, qui est le plaignant, Mme Snider, qui est l'avocate de la Commission, Mme Guille, qui est l'une des deux intim\u00e9es, M. Fromm, qui est le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9e Canadian Heritage Alliance, et enfin M. Kulbashian, qui est le repr\u00e9sentant de Mme Guille.\n[4] \u00c0 l'origine, le but de la conf\u00e9rence \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer combien de jours seraient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'audition de la plainte ainsi que le moment o\u00f9 l'audience pourrait reprendre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Guille avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pouvoir difficilement se lib\u00e9rer de son travail plus de deux jours cons\u00e9cutifs par mois et qu'elle ne pourrait pas le faire avant ao\u00fbt 2007, au plus t\u00f4t.\n[5] \u00c0 ce moment, M. Warman et Mme Snider ont exprim\u00e9 leur opposition \u00e0 la demande de Mme Guille qui voulait, en raison des contraintes dues \u00e0 son emploi, que l'audience ne reprenne qu'en automne et seulement pour quelques jours par-ci, par-l\u00e0.\n[6] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 4 janvier 2007, de nombreuses possibilit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 la reprise de l'audience. Il est alors apparu que M. Fromm, M. Warman et Mme Snider n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles en f\u00e9vrier en raison de la tenue d'une autre audience concernant une affaire portant sur les droits de la personne, que le membre du Tribunal pr\u00e9sidant l'audience n'\u00e9tait pas disponible en mars, avril, mai et juillet en raison d'audiences d\u00e9j\u00e0 fix\u00e9es ou \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9es et qu'il \u00e9tait peu disponible en juin. Quant \u00e0 Mme Snider, elle n'\u00e9tait pas disponible en ao\u00fbt.\n[7] Par cons\u00e9quent, en raison du manque de disponibilit\u00e9 du membre du Tribunal pr\u00e9sidant l'audience ainsi que du manque de disponibilit\u00e9 des parties entre les mois de f\u00e9vrier et ao\u00fbt, il est devenu \u00e9vident que l'audience ne pouvait malheureusement pas reprendre avant le mois de septembre 2007.\n[8] \u00c0 la fin de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, qui a dur\u00e9 une heure et demie, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les disponibilit\u00e9s des parties en automne et apr\u00e8s en avoir discut\u00e9, tout le monde, y compris Mme Guille et M. Kulbashian, a convenu que l'audience pouvait reprendre en septembre 2007. Quatre jours ont alors \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus pour terminer la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, soit du 4 au 7 septembre, et deux jours \u00e0 la fin de septembre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus pour la pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries, soit les 24 et 25 septembre. Toutes les personnes participant \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ont accept\u00e9 ces dates.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, M. Kulbashian et Mme Guille ont \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour faire savoir qu'ils s'\u00e9taient sentis press\u00e9s par le Tribunal d'accepter la reprise de l'audience en septembre et pour demander au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 4 janvier 2007, le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de nombreuses fois de fixer la tenue d'une deuxi\u00e8me conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour discuter de la question des dates et de la divulgation. Cependant, devant la quasi-impossibilit\u00e9 de trouver un moment o\u00f9 toutes les parties \u00e9taient disponibles, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que les parties lui soumettent leurs demandes par \u00e9crit.\n[11] Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 27 mars 2007, M. Kulbashian a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les dates en ao\u00fbt, septembre, octobre et novembre 2007 o\u00f9 Mme Guille serait disponible pour assister \u00e0 l'audience et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le nombre de jours cons\u00e9cutifs pendant lesquels elle pouvait se lib\u00e9rer. M. Kulbashian a \u00e9crit dans sa lettre que, en septembre, Mme Guille serait disponible du 5 au 7 septembre 2007 ou du 24 au 26 septembre 2007. M. Kulbashian a aussi propos\u00e9 que l'audience soit tenue \u00e0 Toronto ou \u00e0 Oakville.\n[12] Les audiences d'affaires portant sur les droits de la personne ne devraient pas s'\u00e9tendre sur de longues p\u00e9riodes. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal \u00e9noncent que les affaires doivent \u00eatre instruites le plus rapidement possible. Le calendrier des audiences doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9tabli de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que l'affaire soit entendue dans un temps relativement court.\n[13] Cela dit, il se peut que, dans certaines circonstances, en raison de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 du membre du Tribunal pr\u00e9sidant l'audience ainsi que de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 des parties et de leur avocat, les dates o\u00f9 se tiendra l'audience doivent \u00eatre \u00e9loign\u00e9es les unes des autres, ce qui est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Ce n'est pas une situation id\u00e9ale.\n[14] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal estime que Mme Guille a eu et a encore amplement le temps de prendre des dispositions avec son employeur pour lui permettre d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience aux dates d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues. Mme Guille ne peut pas repousser ind\u00e9finiment la pr\u00e9sente audience et faire en sorte que le calendrier des audiences soit fix\u00e9 en fonction de sa situation personnelle, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 d'autres facteurs.\n[15] M. Warman et la Commission ont fait savoir qu'ils pr\u00e9voient terminer la pr\u00e9sentation de leur preuve en deux jours. \u00c0 l'heure actuelle, le seul t\u00e9moin qui n'a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu est M. Warman. Cela dit, Mme Guille n'a toujours pas fait savoir si elle t\u00e9moignera ou non. N\u00e9anmoins, deux jours d'audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus, au cas o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9ciderait de le faire.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, quatre jours d'audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus pour permettre aux parties de terminer la pr\u00e9sentation de leur preuve. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les contraintes de temps de Mme Guille, le Tribunal n'exclut pas la possibilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la reprise de l'audience, de si\u00e9ger plus longtemps dans une journ\u00e9e afin de conclure l'audience en trois jours.\n[17] En outre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la disponibilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e de Mme Guille en septembre, c'est-\u00e0-dire une p\u00e9riode de trois jours, au d\u00e9but ou \u00e0 la fin du mois, le Tribunal estime que, dans les pr\u00e9sentes circonstances, il vaudrait mieux proc\u00e9der par plaidoiries \u00e9crites plut\u00f4t que par plaidoiries orales. En fait, cette mesure \u00e9vitera \u00e0 Mme Guille de devoir \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l'audience deux fois en septembre.\n[18] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, les dates fix\u00e9es pour la reprise de l'audience \u00e0 Toronto, c'est-\u00e0-dire du 4 au 7 septembre 2007, sont confirm\u00e9es. Les dates fix\u00e9es pour la pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries, c'est-\u00e0-dire les 24 et 25 septembre 2007, sont annul\u00e9es. Les parties devront soumettre des plaidoiries \u00e9crites.\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 29 mai 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1089\/7005 et T1090\/7105\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nRichard Warman c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 8 ao\u00fbt et le 25 octobre 2003, William Carl Witwicky (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes relatives aux articles 7, 10, 14 et 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) contre la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (l'intim\u00e9e). Selon les plaintes, l'intim\u00e9e aurait commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience et a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\nA. Les faits [2] Le plaignant a grandi dans la ville de Jasper, en Alberta, o\u00f9 il a habit\u00e9 pendant 35 ans. Il vient de ce qu'il appelle une famille du chemin de fer. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e le 2 juillet 1975, en tant qu'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein le 22 juillet 1977. Il a travaill\u00e9 pour l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de cette date, \u00e0 l'exception d'une p\u00e9riode de huit mois, en raison d'un cong\u00e9diement.\n[3] Le plaignant est chef de train. Les chefs de train font partie d'un groupe d'employ\u00e9s appel\u00e9s commun\u00e9ment le personnel itin\u00e9rant. Ces employ\u00e9s font fonctionner les trains. Le plaignant travaille \u00e0 partir de Kamloops, en Colombie-Britannique, o\u00f9 il r\u00e9side.\nII. LES INCIDENTS DU 31 D\u00c9CEMBRE 2001 [4] Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2001, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler sur un train allant de Kamloops \u00e0 Jasper, en Alberta. Le voyage vers Jasper a dur\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de douze heures. Le train est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 12 h 15 le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Puisque Jasper est la gare terminus, le plaignant avait inscrit une p\u00e9riode de repos de huit (8) heures. Cette p\u00e9riode de repos se serait termin\u00e9e \u00e0 22 h 15, heure \u00e0 laquelle il aurait pu \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler.\n[5] Le plaignant a re\u00e7u une [traduction] indemnit\u00e9 pour attente excessive1 pour la p\u00e9riode entre 23 h 15 le 31 d\u00e9cembre et 6 h 55 le 1er janvier 2002. Il a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de 126,90 $ pour cette p\u00e9riode. Pendant son contre-interrogatoire, il a affirm\u00e9 s'\u00eatre rendu compte pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 28 mars 2002 qu'il avait re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 pour attente excessive pour cette p\u00e9riode. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait offert de rembourser la somme, mais que l'intim\u00e9e avait refus\u00e9.\n[6] \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper, le plaignant a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 une chambre au centre d'h\u00e9bergement. Le centre d'h\u00e9bergement est le lieu o\u00f9 les employ\u00e9s peuvent r\u00e9server une chambre pour se reposer avant de retourner au travail. Pendant qu'il \u00e9tait l\u00e0, il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, dont il venait de se s\u00e9parer r\u00e9cemment. Selon ses propres mots, la conversation s'est [traduction] envenim\u00e9e et elle l'a inform\u00e9 qu'elle allait demander le divorce. Il a affirm\u00e9 que cette nouvelle l'avait [traduction] d\u00e9vast\u00e9.\n[7] La sur du plaignant habite \u00e0 Jasper. Apr\u00e8s sa conversation avec son \u00e9pouse, il s'est rendu chez sa sur pour parler de ses probl\u00e8mes conjugaux. Ils ont discut\u00e9 de son \u00e9tat \u00e9motif. Il s'est dit en plein d\u00e9sarroi et boulevers\u00e9. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas couch\u00e9 de la nuit et qu'il n'avait rien mang\u00e9. Dans ses propres mots, il \u00e9tait [traduction] compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9boussol\u00e9.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 sa sur, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'inscrire en repos en d\u00e9clarant qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rester \u00e0 Jasper quelques jours, puisqu'il s'agissait de son dernier voyage avant ses vacances.\n[9] Afin de pouvoir s'inscrire en repos, il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au Centre de gestion des employ\u00e9s (CGE) \u00e0 Edmonton, en Alberta. Le CGE supervise l'affectation quotidienne de la main-d'uvre pour les trains de l'intim\u00e9e. Le CGE travaille \u00e0 partir d'un syst\u00e8me informatique appel\u00e9 CATS, l'acronyme de Crew Accountability and Timekeeping System (syst\u00e8me de gestion du temps et de la responsabilit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s). Ce syst\u00e8me aide le personnel du CGE \u00e0 savoir quels employ\u00e9s sont disponibles pour travailler \u00e0 toute heure. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Richard Froment, le gestionnaire du CGE pour l'ouest du Canada, le syst\u00e8me informatique se raccorde \u00e0 une liste du mouvement des trains et affiche \u00e0 quelle heure les trains doivent partir. Le personnel du CGE peut alors savoir quels employ\u00e9s travailleront lors de ce voyage.\n[10] M. Froment a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure suivie par les employ\u00e9s pour [traduction] s'inscrire en service ou en repos. Pour s'inscrire en repos, l'employ\u00e9 doit appeler le CGE et demander que son statut disponible soit chang\u00e9 pour autre chose. L'intim\u00e9e est ainsi inform\u00e9e que l'employ\u00e9 n'est pas disponible pour travailler. Le r\u00e9partiteur entrera ce renseignement dans le syst\u00e8me. Lorsque cela est fait, un dossier permanent est cr\u00e9\u00e9 et il demeurera dans le syst\u00e8me pendant trois ans. Apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, les renseignements sont archiv\u00e9s \u00e9lectroniquement et peuvent \u00eatre consult\u00e9s sur demande.\n[11] Le CATS ne montre pas si un employ\u00e9 est inscrit en repos \u00e0 sa gare d'attache ou \u00e0 une gare de d\u00e9tachement. Selon M. Froment, si un employ\u00e9 s'inscrit en repos \u00e0 une gare de d\u00e9tachement, le syst\u00e8me changera automatiquement le [traduction] demi-tour de l'employ\u00e9 pour sa gare d'attache. En d'autres termes, M. Froment veut dire que le syst\u00e8me indiquera que l'employ\u00e9 se trouve \u00e0 sa gare d'attache. Le r\u00e9partiteur avisera aussi le contr\u00f4leur en chef de la circulation ferroviaire, lequel est responsable du rassemblement de la main-d'uvre \u00e0 la gare de d\u00e9tachement, pour qu'il puisse trouver un employ\u00e9 qui remplacera celui qui s'est inscrit en repos. M. Froment a fait savoir qu'il est tr\u00e8s rare que quelqu'un s'inscrive en repos dans une gare de d\u00e9tachement.\n[12] Un employ\u00e9 qui s'est inscrit en repos ne peut \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail. Afin d'\u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau inscrit en service, l'employ\u00e9 doit appeler le CGE et demander \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9inscrit comme \u00e9tant disponible. M. Froment a expliqu\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 qui demande \u00e0 \u00eatre inscrit en service \u00e0 partir d'une gare de d\u00e9tachement serait, en principe, r\u00e9inscrit en service \u00e0 partir de sa gare d'attache, bien qu'il ait reconnu qu'il soit possible de le faire \u00e0 partir de la gare de d\u00e9tachement. Le CGE peut modifier le lieu de l'employ\u00e9 et le changer pour la gare de d\u00e9tachement, mais M. Froment a ajout\u00e9 que, en douze ans au CGE, il n'a jamais vu un employ\u00e9 se r\u00e9inscrire en service \u00e0 partir d'une gare de d\u00e9tachement.\n[13] Quand un employ\u00e9 s'inscrit en service ou en repos, il doit communiquer avec le CGE par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, ces appels sont re\u00e7us par les r\u00e9partiteurs. Il y a huit r\u00e9partiteurs par quart de travail au CGE \u00e0 Edmonton. Chaque r\u00e9partiteur est assign\u00e9 \u00e0 un territoire particulier. L'employ\u00e9 compose le num\u00e9ro central et son appel sera r\u00e9achemin\u00e9 au r\u00e9partiteur assign\u00e9 \u00e0 sa r\u00e9gion. M. Froment a expliqu\u00e9 que deux m\u00e9thodes sont utilis\u00e9es pour enregistrer l'information quand un employ\u00e9 appelle : d'abord, le syst\u00e8me CATS [traduction] \u00e9tampe un dossier permanent dans le syst\u00e8me, ensuite, il y a enregistrement sonore de l'appel. M. Froment a ajout\u00e9 qu'il est demand\u00e9 aux r\u00e9partiteurs de garder l'employ\u00e9 en ligne jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'information soit not\u00e9e et enregistr\u00e9e dans le syst\u00e8me. Le CGE veut s'assurer que toutes les mesures pour inscrire en repos sont accomplies avant que le r\u00e9partiteur passe \u00e0 une autre t\u00e2che. Cette m\u00e9thode d'enregistrement des appels \u00e9tait en place le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. \u00c0 ce moment, le syst\u00e8me utilis\u00e9 pour enregistrer les appels a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par M. Froment comme \u00e9tant un [traduction] syst\u00e8me \u00e0 bobines. Chaque cassette contient environ une semaine de donn\u00e9es. Le syst\u00e8me enregistre les appels \u00e0 mesure qu'ils sont re\u00e7us, il peut donc \u00eatre difficile de retrouver un appel en particulier sur la cassette.\n[14] Il semble qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de retrouver l'enregistrement de la conversation qui aurait eu lieu entre le plaignant et le CGE le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, M. Froment a reconnu qu'il existait une cassette o\u00f9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s les appels re\u00e7us ce jour-l\u00e0. Il a \u00e9galement dit qu'il ne pouvait expliquer pourquoi le syndicat n'avait pas re\u00e7u de copie de cet enregistrement quand il en avait fait la demande. Finalement, il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9cout\u00e9 la cassette enregistr\u00e9e cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0 avant l'audience.\n[15] Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Froment a admis qu'il y avait eu des erreurs et que des employ\u00e9s n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits en repos ou en service quand ils auraient d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que cette situation \u00e9tait normale si l'on consid\u00e8re que le CGE re\u00e7oit plus d'un million d'appels par ann\u00e9e. Il a de plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il arrivait en moyenne six fois par mois qu'un employ\u00e9 soit inscrit en repos de fa\u00e7on erron\u00e9e.\n[16] Une copie imprim\u00e9e du dossier du plaignant pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et le 3 janvier 2002, tel qu'enregistr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me CATS, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve. Il n'\u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 nulle part dans le dossier que le plaignant s'\u00e9tait inscrit en repos \u00e0 l'une ou l'autre de ces dates parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler.\n[17] Revenons \u00e0 la soir\u00e9e du 31 d\u00e9cembre. Apr\u00e8s que sa sur fut partie avec des amis, le plaignant est all\u00e9 d\u00eener avec un ami. Le plaignant reconna\u00eet avoir bu de l'alcool au cours de cette soir\u00e9e. Il a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit dans son t\u00e9moignage : [traduction] Si je me souviens bien, j'ai bu peut-\u00eatre en tout six ou sept consommations.\n[18] Plus tard ce soir-l\u00e0, vers 22 h 30, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 par la GRC quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9 inconscient dans un v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9. Selon ce dont il se souvient, quand il a quitt\u00e9 le restaurant, il fallait attendre longtemps avant de pouvoir obtenir un taxi. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'un individu, qui, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il croyait, travaillait au restaurant, lui a offert de l'emmener. Apr\u00e8s quelques coins de rue, le conducteur a abandonn\u00e9 le v\u00e9hicule et c'est \u00e0 ce moment que les agents de la GRC l'ont trouv\u00e9.\n[19] Il a pass\u00e9 la nuit du 1er janvier 2002 en garde \u00e0 vue. Le lendemain matin, \u00e0 7 h 25, il a fait une d\u00e9position \u00e0 la police. Selon le document de la police, cette entrevue s'est termin\u00e9e \u00e0 7 h 52. Le plaignant a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 de possession d'un v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9. Cette accusation a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e.\n[20] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 le matin du 1er janvier 2002 un peu avant 8 h. Un agent de la GRC qui n'\u00e9tait pas en service l'a ramen\u00e9 au centre d'h\u00e9bergement pour qu'il puisse prendre ses affaires. Il est arriv\u00e9 au centre un peu apr\u00e8s 8 h. On lui a alors dit qu'un superviseur le cherchait pour qu'il accepte de travailler sur un train \u00e0 destination de Kamloops.\n[21] Selon David James, lequel \u00e9tait le superviseur en service \u00e0 Jasper, le plaignant avait re\u00e7u la directive de venir travailler \u00e0 bord du train de 7 h 10. \u00c0 la gare de d\u00e9tachement, l'employ\u00e9 doit fournir au CGE un num\u00e9ro de chambre o\u00f9 il peut \u00eatre joint. En l'esp\u00e8ce, quand il fut le temps d'appeler le plaignant, celui-ci \u00e9tait introuvable. Le CGE a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 et le GEC (gestionnaire de l'exploitation en corridors) a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. James, chez lui, pour l'informer de la situation. M. James a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage avoir fait un certain nombre d'appels : un appel \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, \u00e0 Jasper, et un autre \u00e0 la GRC, au cas o\u00f9 on aurait su o\u00f9 pouvait se trouver le plaignant, en vain. L'appel \u00e0 la GRC a automatiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9achemin\u00e9 au poste d'Edson, une ville \u00e9loign\u00e9e d'environ 160 km de Jasper, parce qu'il n'y avait pas d'agent de la GRC en service \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Ce renseignement est \u00e9tonnant, car M. James a affirm\u00e9 avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 entre 7 h et 7 h 30 et le plaignant \u00e9tait toujours, \u00e0 cette heure-l\u00e0, d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 Jasper. La r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e par le poste d'Edson, selon M. James, est \u00e9galement \u00e9tonnante puisqu'il semble que personne l\u00e0-bas n'ait pris la peine de s'enqu\u00e9rir du plaignant aupr\u00e8s du poste de Jasper, lequel aurait pu fournir une r\u00e9ponse.\n[22] M. James a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Larry Hindle, le m\u00e9canicien qui avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du train avec le plaignant la veille, pour lui demander s'il savait o\u00f9 se trouvait le plaignant. M. Hindle a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne savait pas o\u00f9 se trouvait le plaignant.\n[23] Vers 8 h 10, alors qu'il s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Jasper, M. James a re\u00e7u un appel du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du centre d'h\u00e9bergement pour lui annonc\u00e9 que le plaignant venait d'arriver. M. James a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler au plaignant. Il a dit qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 et que le plaignant avait r\u00e9pondu ceci : [traduction] J'ai pass\u00e9 la nuit chez un ami. M. James a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il lui avait demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait fait savoir \u00e0 personne o\u00f9 il pouvait \u00eatre joint. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] J'ai fait une gaffe et je le ferai \u00e0 l'avenir. Il a finalement demand\u00e9 au plaignant s'il \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat d'aller travailler, ce \u00e0 quoi le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative. Compte tenu de cette r\u00e9ponse et du fait que, si on se fiait \u00e0 sa voix, le plaignant semblait normal, M. James lui a dit de se rendre au train le plus t\u00f4t possible. Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a reconnu qu'il n'avait mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun moment lors de cette conversation qu'il s'\u00e9tait inscrit en repos la veille parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler, pas plus qu'il n'a ensuite communiqu\u00e9 avec le CGE pour se r\u00e9inscrire en service, comme le veut la proc\u00e9dure normale.\n[24] Plus tard le m\u00eame matin, M. James a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mitch McAmmond, le coordonateur de train en service \u00e0 Kamloops, pour lui dire que le plaignant s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en retard \u00e0 son poste \u00e0 Jasper. Il l'a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 que le d\u00e9part du train avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9 pour cette raison. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il conviendrait peut-\u00eatre que M. McAmmond ait une conversation avec le plaignant \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Kamloops.\n[25] Le train est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Kamloops vers 19 h le 1er janvier 2002. \u00c0 leur arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 destination, le m\u00e9canicien de locomotive, Larry Hindle, et le plaignant ont rempli leur fiche de temps dans la salle d'ordinateur. \u00c0 ce moment, selon le plaignant, le superviseur McAmmond est entr\u00e9 dans la pi\u00e8ce. Il leur a souhait\u00e9 \u00e0 tous deux une bonne ann\u00e9e et leur a demand\u00e9 comment s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 le voyage. Il n'a jamais interrog\u00e9 le plaignant. Larry Hindle a confirm\u00e9 cette version des faits.\n[26] La version de M. McAmmond est assez diff\u00e9rente. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a vu le train arriver, il s'est dirig\u00e9 vers celui-ci afin d'aller \u00e0 la rencontre de l'\u00e9quipage. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir vu M. Hindle descendre du train et avoir attendu que le plaignant descende, mais que celui-ci n'est jamais descendu. M. McAmmond est mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du train pour voir si le plaignant s'y trouvait encore, mais il ne l'a pas trouv\u00e9. Il est ensuite revenu dans l'\u00e9difice et il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hindle s'il savait o\u00f9 se trouvait le plaignant. M. Hindle a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne le savait pas. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver le plaignant le 1er janvier 2002. Si la version de M. McAmmond est exacte, alors le plaignant a forc\u00e9ment d\u00fb descendre du train avant qu'il n'entre en gare \u00e0 Kamloops. Il s'agirait sans aucun doute d'une situation tr\u00e8s inhabituelle et on s'attendrait \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9e fasse une enqu\u00eate sur un tel incident. Fait int\u00e9ressant, M. McAmmond n'a pas pouss\u00e9 l'affaire plus loin en interrogeant le plaignant sur l'endroit o\u00f9 il se trouvait quand le train est entr\u00e9 en gare cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Compte tenu de ce dont M. McAmmond se souvient quant aux faits de cette journ\u00e9e, je vais, au cas o\u00f9 cela serait pertinent dans le cadre de ma d\u00e9cision, accepter la version des faits du plaignant.\n[27] Le 7 janvier 2002, le plaignant a pris un mois et demi de vacances, pendant lesquelles il s'est rendu en Australie.\nIII. LE RAPPORT DE LA GRC [28] L'agent Benoit Lecuyer de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC) \u00e9tait un des agents en service le soir du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Vers 22 h, le poste a re\u00e7u une plainte au sujet d'une camionnette vol\u00e9e. La camionnette \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur d'un restaurant \u00e0 Jasper et, quand le livreur du restaurant est sorti pour l'utiliser, elle \u00e9tait disparue. Le v\u00e9hicule a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 dans un stationnement situ\u00e9 en avant d'une station-service. Un individu sans connaissance se trouvait sur le si\u00e8ge du passager et le moteur du v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait encore en marche.\n[29] Vers 22 h 48, l'agent Lecuyer est arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux o\u00f9 le v\u00e9hicule vol\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage avoir remarqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait dans le v\u00e9hicule un homme qui semblait dormir du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du passager. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il s'est approch\u00e9 de la camionnette, il a pu sentir une forte odeur d'alcool. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait tent\u00e9 pendant environ cinq minutes de r\u00e9veiller l'homme qui se trouvait dans le v\u00e9hicule, mais ce, sans succ\u00e8s. L'agent Lecuyer et un de ses coll\u00e8gues ont ensuite tir\u00e9 l'individu hors du v\u00e9hicule afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son arrestation. Selon l'agent Lecuyer, l'individu \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e.\n[30] L'agent Lecuyer a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'\u00e9tablir, au moyen du permis de conduire de la Colombie-Britannique de cette personne, qu'il s'agissait de William Witwicky, le plaignant. Au poste, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans une cellule. Pendant tout ce temps, il n'avait toujours pas repris conscience.\n[31] Vers 1 h 16, l'agent Lecuyer a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par le gardien du bloc cellulaire que le plaignant \u00e9tait maintenant \u00e9veill\u00e9 et qu'il \u00e9tait debout. L'agent Lecuyer a dit qu'il s'est approch\u00e9 de la cellule pour voir \u00e0 quel point le plaignant avait retrouv\u00e9 ses esprits. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait remarqu\u00e9 que le plaignant se servait des murs de sa cellule pour garder l'\u00e9quilibre, ce qui montrait qu'il \u00e9tait encore en \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a ensuite tent\u00e9 d'expliquer au plaignant o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait et pourquoi il y \u00e9tait. Le plaignant a seulement hoch\u00e9 la t\u00eate, mais il n'a rien r\u00e9pondu. Selon l'agent, le plaignant ne semblait pas comprendre ce qui se passait.\n[32] L'agent Lecuyer est retourn\u00e9 voir le plaignant vers 3 h 01 et l'a trouv\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait r\u00e9veill\u00e9, mais agit\u00e9. Il a dit avoir tent\u00e9 de le calmer. L'agent a encore une fois conclu que le plaignant \u00e9tait toujours trop ivre pour comprendre parfaitement ce qui se passait.\n[33] Il n'a pas revu le plaignant avant environ 7 h 25, le matin du 1er janvier 2002. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que, \u00e0 ce moment, le plaignant \u00e9tait calme et plus en mesure de comprendre pourquoi il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu. Il a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le laisser sortir de sa cellule et de l'emmener dans la salle d'interrogatoire o\u00f9 il lui a lu ses droits et la mise en garde de la police. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 l'agent qu'il ne souhaitait pas appeler d'avocat. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait rien fait de mal et qu'il voulait pr\u00e9senter ses excuses pour sa conduite. Il a ensuite fait une d\u00e9position enregistr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'agent.\n[34] Le plaignant a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9 de possession de biens vol\u00e9s puis rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 vers 8 h, sous caution personnelle. L'enqu\u00eate compl\u00e9mentaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e le 2 janvier 2002. Il s'agissait principalement de retourner au restaurant o\u00f9 la camionnette avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise. L'agent Lecuyer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de l'enqu\u00eate, il a parl\u00e9 avec le propri\u00e9taire du restaurant ainsi qu'avec deux autres employ\u00e9s. Selon leurs d\u00e9clarations, le plaignant est arriv\u00e9 au restaurant vers 20 h avec deux autres individus. Le propri\u00e9taire du restaurant a inform\u00e9 l'agent qu'il souhaitait qu'il ne soit pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l'affaire. Apr\u00e8s cela, l'agent a inform\u00e9 le plaignant que les accusations relatives aux biens vol\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9es.\n[35] Selon le Rapport de continuation r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par l'agent Lecuyer, le 9 janvier 2002, l'agent Benoit Tessier, un policier travaillant pour l'intim\u00e9e, avait communiqu\u00e9 avec le poste de la GRC \u00e0 Jasper et avait demand\u00e9 qu'on lui fournisse une copie de la d\u00e9claration du plaignant le plus t\u00f4t possible. Le 24 janvier 2002, une transcription de cette d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'agent Tessier.\nIV. LA SUITE DES INCIDENTS DU 31 D\u00c9CEMBRE 2001 [36] Le plaignant, \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 Kamloops apr\u00e8s ses vacances en Australie, \u00e0 la fin de f\u00e9vrier 2002, a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Gary George Kopp, le pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 local de rajustement des Travailleurs unis du transport, pour voir comment allaient les choses. M. Kopp lui a fait part d'une conversation qu'il avait eue avec M. Hans Nederpel, un superviseur chez l'intim\u00e9e. Il a dit que M. Nederpel l'avait abord\u00e9 et lui avait parl\u00e9 de la conduite du plaignant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Selon M. Kopp, M. Nederpel lui avait dit que le plaignant avait un probl\u00e8me d'alcool et qu'il souhaitait le voir s'engager dans un programme de traitement de l'alcoolisme.\n[37] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu de son travail le 22 mars 2002. L'intim\u00e9e a entrepris une enqu\u00eate formelle sur l'affaire. Deux [traduction] d\u00e9clarations de l'employ\u00e9, l'une par le plaignant et l'autre par M. Larry Hindle, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues. La premi\u00e8re, celle du plaignant, a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue \u00e0 la suite d'une rencontre qui a eu lieu le 28 mars 2002, tandis que la rencontre pour la seconde d\u00e9claration, celle de M. Hindle, a eu lieu le 17 avril 2002.\n(i) Les d\u00e9clarations des employ\u00e9s a) La d\u00e9claration du plaignant [38] La rencontre avec le plaignant, au cours de laquelle il a donn\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration, a eu lieu de 10 h \u00e0 18 h 30, avec une interruption pour le d\u00eener. La d\u00e9claration de l'employ\u00e9 n'est pas une transcription de tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit lors de l'enqu\u00eate. Il s'agit d'un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des questions pos\u00e9es et des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es. La d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par un enqu\u00eateur choisi par l'employeur. \u00c0 la fin de l'enqu\u00eate, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 et \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant de lire le document et de le signer.\n[39] M. Kopp \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant lorsque la d\u00e9claration de l'employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillie. Cette enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par M. John Gosse. Avant le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure, M. Kopp avait demand\u00e9 que certains documents puissent \u00eatre inspect\u00e9s, notamment [traduction] [t]outes les transcriptions ou tous les enregistrements de toutes les conversations entre M. Witwicky et le directeur des transports, le chef de gare ou tout autre employ\u00e9 du chemin de fer ayant travaill\u00e9 le soir et le jour o\u00f9 les incidents se sont produits. M. Kopp a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n'avoir jamais re\u00e7u les enregistrements demand\u00e9s. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait par ailleurs protest\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9lai excessif encouru pour la tenue de cette enqu\u00eate par l'intim\u00e9.\n[40] Selon la d\u00e9claration, le plaignant est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 12 h 15, le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2002. Il a inscrit huit (8) heures de repos, ce qui le rendait disponible pour travailler \u00e0 20 h 15. Il avait une chambre au centre d'h\u00e9bergement. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au centre, il est all\u00e9 chez sa sur et, \u00e0 partir de l\u00e0, il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, dont il \u00e9tait s\u00e9par\u00e9. Cette version des faits est diff\u00e9rente de celle que le plaignant a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Il a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'il avait appel\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 partir du centre d'h\u00e9bergement avant de se rendre chez sa sur.\n[41] Au cours de cette conversation, son ex-\u00e9pouse l'a inform\u00e9 qu'elle allait demander le divorce. Il a dit que cette annonce l'avait laiss\u00e9 en plein d\u00e9sarroi sur le plan \u00e9motif et qu'il ne se sentait pas [traduction] mentalement capable de faire son travail. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait alors t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur pour l'informer qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 avoir pass\u00e9 le reste de l'apr\u00e8s-midi chez sa sur.\n[42] Vers 18 h 30 ou 19 h, un ami est venu le chercher et ils sont all\u00e9s au restaurant. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir bu plusieurs verres d'alcool et qu'il avait [traduction] mang\u00e9 quelque chose, bien qu'il ait ajout\u00e9 plus tard qu'il avait [traduction] bu plusieurs verres d'alcool en ayant l'estomac vide.\n[43] Pendant la rencontre o\u00f9 la d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, M. Gosse a demand\u00e9 au plaignant d'expliquer, s'il avait bel et bien signal\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler, pourquoi il avait re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 pour attente excessive de 23 h 15 \u00e0 6 h 55 dans la nuit du 31 d\u00e9cembre au 1er janvier. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] Je ne m'en suis jamais rendu compte. Maintenant, avec le recul, je vois que j'aurais d\u00fb communiquer avec eux et la faire annuler.\n[44] Quand l'inspecteur lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il avait accept\u00e9 de travailler le 1er janvier, si la veille il s'\u00e9tait bel et bien d\u00e9clar\u00e9 incapable de travailler, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] Quand je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare, j'ai appris que j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour 7 h 10 et que le bureau d'\u00e9quipage avait accept\u00e9 le travail pour moi. Le train \u00e9tait l\u00e0. J'ai senti qu'il valait mieux pour moi que j'accepte le travail puisque j'\u00e9tais tout \u00e0 fait sobre et apte \u00e0 travailler, que j'avais la responsabilit\u00e9 de faire mon travail sans retarder le train ou sans me causer davantage de probl\u00e8mes. Je me suis rendu compte que je n'aurais jamais d\u00fb d\u00e9clarer que je n'\u00e9tais pas en \u00e9tat de travailler \u00e0 la gare de d\u00e9tachement, mais, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 mon \u00e9tat d'esprit, je croyais que c'est ce qu'il fallait faire \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0.\n[45] Le matin du 1er janvier 2002, vers 8 h 10, le plaignant a parl\u00e9 avec son superviseur Dave James, qui lui a demand\u00e9 s'il \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de travailler et le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] oui. Selon le dossier, le plaignant n'a pas inform\u00e9 son superviseur, M. James, qu'il avait signal\u00e9 la veille qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler, pas plus qu'il ne lui a dit qu'il avait pass\u00e9 la nuit au poste de police. Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait pas qu'il avait \u00e0 le faire, puisque M. James lui aurait dit qu'il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec la GRC et que le plaignant aurait \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Kamloops.\n[46] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 comment il a pu se d\u00e9clarer en \u00e9tat de travailler le matin du 1er janvier 2002 alors que les rapports de la GRC indiquent qu'il \u00e9tait encore en \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 3 h 01, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu que, au matin, il se sentait [traduction] tout \u00e0 fait sobre. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait eu plusieurs heures pour d\u00e9griser et qu'il s'\u00e9tait rendu compte qu'il n'aurait jamais d\u00fb faire inscrire qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de travailler. Selon lui, ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 au cours de cette soir\u00e9e \u00e9tait un incident isol\u00e9, une grosse erreur que pouvaient expliquer les graves difficult\u00e9s qu'il \u00e9prouvait dans sa vie personnelle. Il a dit qu'il ressentait beaucoup de remords et qu'il \u00e9tait g\u00ean\u00e9 par toute cette situation.\n[47] La d\u00e9claration de l'employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par le plaignant et par son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Kopp.\nb) La d\u00e9claration de Larry Hindle [48] Larry Hindle est m\u00e9canicien de locomotive. Le 17 avril 2002, il a fait une d\u00e9claration de l'employ\u00e9 au sujet du service qu'il a assur\u00e9 le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001 et le 1er janvier 2002 \u00e0 bord du train entre Jasper et Kamloops. L'entrevue tenue afin d'obtenir la d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par M. John Gosse en pr\u00e9sence de M. Kopp, qui agissait \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant, et de M. Jim Manson, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Hindle.\n[49] M. Hindle \u00e9tait le m\u00e9canicien de locomotive du train Q103, le 1er janvier 2002, lors du voyage de retour \u00e0 Kamloops. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, au cours de ce voyage, le plaignant avait conduit la locomotive entre Blue River et Kamloops. M. Hindle a ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant semblait [traduction] bien se porter quand il est arriv\u00e9 au travail. Il a \u00e9galement fait savoir que le plaignant lui avait dit qu'il s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 incapable de travailler la veille, sans en pr\u00e9ciser les raisons.\n[50] M. Hindle a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e du train \u00e0 Kamloops, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 par le superviseur Mitch McAmmond, avec qui il a \u00e9chang\u00e9 des vux de bonne ann\u00e9e. Il a aussi affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors de cette rencontre.\n[51] Finalement, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par M. Kopp, M. Hindle a mentionn\u00e9 que, le 28 janvier 2002, le superviseur Dave James l'avait [traduction] interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper au sujet des incidents du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que, \u00e0 ce moment, le superviseur avait en sa possession la transcription de la d\u00e9claration du plaignant \u00e0 la GRC.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s son enqu\u00eate, M. Gosse a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des deux d\u00e9clarations de l'employ\u00e9. Il a conclu : [traduction] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des renseignements et enqu\u00eates susmentionn\u00e9s, il est recommand\u00e9 [...] qu'il soit mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi [du plaignant] chez [l'intim\u00e9e] pour violation de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale G du REF et violation de l'article 8, partie 3.1 des IGE, y compris des violations \u00e0 la politique du CN sur la pr\u00e9vention des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l'alcool et les drogues en milieu de travail. Ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Eric Blokzyl, alors surintendant du district du sud de la Colombie-Britannique. M. Blokzyl a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en raison de la gravit\u00e9 des infractions, il a imm\u00e9diatement communiqu\u00e9 avec son sup\u00e9rieur, M. James Fitzgerald, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des op\u00e9rations pour la division du Pacifique, Colombie-Britannique, afin de discuter de l'affaire. Apr\u00e8s en avoir discut\u00e9 avec M. Fitzgerald, M. Blokzyl a dit \u00e0 M. Gosse de mettre sa recommandation \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution.\nV. LES INCIDENTS QUI ONT SUIVI LE CONG\u00c9DIEMENT DU PLAIGNANT [53] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le 19 avril 2002.\n[54] Le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief contestant le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant. Il \u00e9tait d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e avait impos\u00e9 une mesure disciplinaire au plaignant en se fiant \u00e0 des preuves obtenues de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a pr\u00e9tendu que l'enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d'erreurs et qu'il fallait annuler la mesure disciplinaire impos\u00e9e au plaignant.\n[55] Le 19 juillet 2002, on a diagnostiqu\u00e9 un carcinome \u00e9pidermo\u00efde chez le plaignant. Il souffrait d'une tumeur \u00e0 l'amygdale, laquelle s'\u00e9tait propag\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs ganglions lymphatiques dans le cou. La maladie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s grave et le m\u00e9decin du plaignant a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration visant \u00e0 retirer la tumeur. Le 24 juillet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9 au cou pour que lui soient retir\u00e9es les masses. Apr\u00e8s l'op\u00e9ration, le plaignant a subi 30 traitements de radiation. Ces traitements se sont poursuivis jusque vers la mi-octobre 2002.\n[56] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que son cong\u00e9diement l'avait an\u00e9anti et que, \u00e0 ce moment, il avait eu recours au Programme d'aide aux familles des employ\u00e9s (PAFE). Il a \u00e9galement cherch\u00e9 un autre emploi. Il a demand\u00e9 des prestations d'assurance-emploi et les a re\u00e7ues, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que son cancer soit diagnostiqu\u00e9. Les ressources humaines se sont alors mises \u00e0 lui envoyer des indemnit\u00e9s de cong\u00e9s de maladie.\nVI. LE CONTRAT DE R\u00c9INT\u00c9GRATION [57] En octobre 2002, le vice-pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Travailleurs unis des transports, M. Ron Hackle, a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant. M. Hackle lui a annonc\u00e9 que M. Robert Reny, du service des relations de travail de l'intim\u00e9e, lui avait fait savoir que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 reprendre le plaignant, \u00e0 condition que celui-ci accepte les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues dans un contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\n[58] Plusieurs jours plus tard, M. Hackle a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant et l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait entendu avec l'intim\u00e9e. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que le plaignant pouvait retourner imm\u00e9diatement au travail s'il satisfaisait aux exigences m\u00e9dicales de l'intim\u00e9e et s'il signait un contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait alors communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Kopp pour discuter du choix qui s'offrait \u00e0 lui. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien qu'il ait senti qu'il s'agissait [traduction] d'une violation de ses droits de la personne, il n'avait d'autre choix que de signer le document s'il voulait \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9.\n[59] Le plaignant a sign\u00e9 le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration le 2 novembre 2002. Le contrat a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Barry Henry, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Travailleurs unis des transports, le syndicat du plaignant, ainsi que par un agent repr\u00e9sentant l'intim\u00e9e.\n[60] Une semaine apr\u00e8s que le plaignant eut sign\u00e9 le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, une infirmi\u00e8re travaillant pour le fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, Medisys, a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant. Elle l'a inform\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e0 passer un examen m\u00e9dical avant de retourner au travail. Le 16 novembre 2002, le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin de l'intim\u00e9e, lequel a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical complet. Le m\u00e9decin n'a pas exig\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment que le plaignant subisse un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool ou de drogue. Il a autoris\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[61] Le 22 novembre 2002, le plaignant a rencontr\u00e9 Eric Blokzyl, superviseur des op\u00e9rations, lequel l'a accueilli \u00e0 son retour au travail. Vers treize heures, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9inscrit au [traduction] tableau de personnel en surplus2. Plus tard le m\u00eame jour, vers 17 h 30, le plaignant a re\u00e7u un appel du superviseur Mitch McAmmond l'informant qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus en service \u00e0 la suite de directives donn\u00e9es par le superviseur Gosse. Le superviseur McAmmond a dit au plaignant qu'il ne savait pas pourquoi son nom avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 et qu'il devait appeler le superviseur Gosse s'il voulait obtenir plus de renseignements.\n[62] Le plaignant a imm\u00e9diatement appel\u00e9 le superviseur Gosse, lequel, selon le plaignant, lui a dit : [traduction] M. Witwicky, j'ai entendu dire que vous \u00eates en train de nous jouer un mauvais tour en essayant de vous faire inscrire sur le tableau de service. Le plaignant lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait re\u00e7u du superviseur Blokzyl l'autorisation de retourner au travail, ce \u00e0 quoi M. Gosse lui a r\u00e9pondu que M. Blokzyl n'\u00e9tait pas son superviseur imm\u00e9diat, que c'\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait son superviseur imm\u00e9diat et que ce serait lui qui d\u00e9ciderait s'il pouvait ou non retourner au travail.\n[63] M. Kopp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le m\u00eame jour, il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. John Gosse. Il a affirm\u00e9 que ce dernier lui avait demand\u00e9 si le plaignant avait fourni un \u00e9chantillon de sang ou d'urine au fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e avant de recevoir l'autorisation de retourner au travail. M. Kopp a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative.\n[64] M. Gosse n'a pas ni\u00e9 qu'il avait retir\u00e9 le nom du plaignant du tableau de service cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration du plaignant stipulait que certaines choses devaient \u00eatre faites avant que le plaignant ne soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail. M. Gosse a dit qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le plaignant avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Blokzyl. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait retir\u00e9 le nom du plaignant du tableau de service pour une courte p\u00e9riode, pour s'assurer que le plaignant s'\u00e9tait bel et bien conform\u00e9 aux obligations pr\u00e9vues dans le contrat. Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 que la rencontre avec M. Blokzyl avait eu lieu, il a r\u00e9inscrit le nom du plaignant sur le tableau de service. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'au plus deux heures s'\u00e9taient \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre le moment o\u00f9 le nom du plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 du tableau et le moment o\u00f9 il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9inscrit. Rien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duit du salaire du plaignant pendant ce temps.\nVII. LES ALL\u00c9GATIONS DE HARC\u00c8LEMENT ET DE REPR\u00c9SAILLES [65] La plupart des faits relatifs aux all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement concernent la relation tendue entre le plaignant et son superviseur, M. Gosse. Cette tension s'est certainement manifest\u00e9e lorsque le plaignant a contre-interrog\u00e9 M. Gosse. Ce dernier s'est montr\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu coop\u00e9ratif et avait des trous de m\u00e9moire importants chaque fois que les questions du plaignant ne semblaient pas lui plaire. Il se plaisait \u00e0 argumenter et semblait, d'une certaine mani\u00e8re, chercher querelle dans sa fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux questions.\n[66] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Gosse travaillait comme surintendant adjoint, gestionnaire du service ferroviaire, chez l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Kamloops. Sa t\u00e2che consistait \u00e0 superviser l'ensemble des op\u00e9rations \u00e0 la gare. Il \u00e9tait responsable de tout le personnel itin\u00e9rant. Il a qualifi\u00e9 son poste de superviseur [traduction] de premi\u00e8re ligne. M. Gosse a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste chez l'intim\u00e9e le 30 juin 2006. Il travaille maintenant pour Via Rail.\n[67] Les faits relatifs \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement soulev\u00e9e par le plaignant se sont produits le 14 mars 2002. Le plaignant repr\u00e9sentait alors M. Plante, un coll\u00e8gue, lors d'une enqu\u00eate officielle. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que, au cours de cette proc\u00e9dure, M. Gosse est entr\u00e9 dans la pi\u00e8ce et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] J'ai lu des choses tr\u00e8s dr\u00f4le \u00e0 votre sujet sur les murs [des toilettes]. Aucun des individus pr\u00e9sents lors de cette proc\u00e9dure ne se rappelait ces paroles.\n[68] Selon le plaignant, M. Gosse faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Proc\u00e9dures et protocoles pour l'utilisation du camion de livraison de pizza \u00e0 Jasper, lequel est une parodie des incidents du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Le document ne faisait pas nomm\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au plaignant, mais les incidents relat\u00e9s pouvaient certainement faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 Jasper. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 ces documents affich\u00e9s sur les murs de plusieurs toilettes du lieu de travail de l'intim\u00e9e. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 divers employ\u00e9s s'ils savaient d'o\u00f9 provenait ce bulletin, mais sans succ\u00e8s. Le plaignant a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le nom d'un coll\u00e8gue de travail qu'il avait vu remettre des copies de ce document \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9. Pour des raisons inexpliqu\u00e9es, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas interrog\u00e9 cet employ\u00e9 quand elle a fait enqu\u00eate sur ces all\u00e9gations.\n[69] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner que, lors de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Gosse a admis qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par [traduction] un employ\u00e9 que ce document avait \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9, mais qu'il n'a jamais pouss\u00e9 plus loin l'enqu\u00eate sur la question.\n[70] Un autre incident s'est produit le 17 janvier 2003. Ce jour-l\u00e0, le plaignant avait rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin du CN pour subir un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogue et d'alcool. Il avait obtenu l'autorisation en bonne et due forme de se rendre \u00e0 ce rendez-vous de la part du superviseur J. Power. Le plaignant a pris cong\u00e9 et s'est rendu chez le m\u00e9decin. Lorsque le superviseur Gosse a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de cela, il a inflig\u00e9 au plaignant une sanction d'une journ\u00e9e de salaire. Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 la suite de cet incident.\n[71] M. Gosse a expliqu\u00e9 que M. Power \u00e9tait un superviseur qui avait [traduction] \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 Kamloops puisqu'il y manquait de superviseur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Il a ajout\u00e9 que M. Power venait de Vancouver, o\u00f9 il n'y avait pas de tableau de personnel en surplus, donc qu'il ne connaissait pas les politiques et proc\u00e9dures applicables aux employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que, pendant que le nom d'un employ\u00e9 figure sur le tableau de personnel en surplus, il est r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 selon un taux quotidien. Si l'employ\u00e9 obtient la permission de s'inscrire en repos pour aller chez le m\u00e9decin, comme le plaignant l'a demand\u00e9, il recevra, selon la convention collective, une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration fix\u00e9e selon un taux quotidien diff\u00e9rent, lequel sera plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui qu'il recevrait normalement en \u00e9tant inscrit au tableau de personnel en surplus. Selon M. Gosse, permettre au plaignant de s'inscrire en repos \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 ces politiques et \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures et c'est pourquoi il est intervenu pour changer la d\u00e9cision et reprendre la partie du paiement auquel le plaignant n'avait pas droit.\n[72] Un mois plus tard, le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2003, le plaignant a encore une fois \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 par Medisys afin de subir un autre test de d\u00e9pistage de drogue et d'alcool. \u00c0 cette date, le plaignant se trouvait sur ce qui est appel\u00e9 le tableau de personnel en surplus prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur M. Gosse pour obtenir l'autorisation de se rendre au rendez-vous. Il a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gosse qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de se rendre au rendez-vous, mais qu'il avait besoin de son autorisation pour prendre cong\u00e9 parce que son nom figurait sur le tableau de service. M. Gosse lui a demand\u00e9 quand avait lieu le rendez-vous, quelle en \u00e9tait la raison et combien de temps il durerait. Selon le plaignant, lorsqu'il l'a inform\u00e9 des raisons du rendez-vous, M. Gosse a \u00e9clat\u00e9 de rire [traduction] sans pouvoir s'arr\u00eater. Le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait senti avili par la conduite de son superviseur.\n[73] Selon l'intim\u00e9e, cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e parce que le nom du plaignant figurait sur le tableau de personnel en surplus \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis. M. Gosse a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait examin\u00e9 o\u00f9 se trouvait le nom du plaignant sur le tableau de personnel en surplus et que, puisqu'il n'\u00e9tait pas susceptible d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9 au travail, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas accueillir la demande. L'intim\u00e9e ajoute de plus que, selon sa politique, les employ\u00e9s doivent fixer leurs rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin pendant leurs heures de repos.\n[74] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 d'aller \u00e0 ce rendez-vous puisqu'il s'agissait d'une des conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que, s'il ne s'y pr\u00e9sentait pas, il pouvait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour ne pas avoir respect\u00e9 les modalit\u00e9s du contrat. Selon le plaignant, M. Gosse lui a dit : [traduction] Vous pouvez prendre une chance, M. Witwicky, et voir ce qui arrivera. Finalement, il n'a pas donn\u00e9 au plaignant l'autorisation de prendre cong\u00e9 pour se rendre \u00e0 ce rendez-vous.\n[75] En f\u00e9vrier 2003, le plaignant occupait le poste de vice-pr\u00e9sident local de la section locale 691 des Travailleurs unis des transports, \u00e0 Kamloops. \u00c0 un moment au cours de ce mois, le superviseur D. Savage a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui pour lui demander d'assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union organis\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande de l'entreprise. Le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le superviseur Savage qu'il se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 la r\u00e9union si le superviseur Gosse l'autorisait \u00e0 s'absenter pour ce motif. M. Gosse n'y a pas consenti et le plaignant n'a pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. \u00c0 la suite du refus du plaignant d'assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 d'une journ\u00e9e de salaire.\n[76] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait mention d'un programme de mentorat mis en place par l'intim\u00e9e. Selon ce programme, chaque employ\u00e9 du personnel itin\u00e9rant se voit assigner un mentor. Le mentor est quelqu'un \u00e0 qui l'employ\u00e9 peut s'adresser s'il \u00e9prouve des difficult\u00e9s. Avant d'\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9, le plaignant avait comme mentor un individu du nom d'Elio Marrelli. \u00c0 son retour au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, le plaignant a appris que son mentor serait M. Gosse.\n[77] Le 17 mars 2003, le plaignant a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Blokzyl dans laquelle il demandait qu'on lui assigne un nouveau mentor. Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au plaignant, dat\u00e9e du 10 juin 2003, M. Blokzyl a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la demande du plaignant visant \u00e0 faire changer son mentor avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] accord\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses souhaits. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'a jamais chang\u00e9 de mentor et que M. Gosse a continu\u00e9 d'agir \u00e0 ce titre jusqu'en juillet 2006.\n[78] Le 18 mars 2003, le plaignant a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Gosse, dans laquelle il lui demandait d'[traduction] arr\u00eat[er] de [le] harceler. Une copie de cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Blokzyl. Ce dernier a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre le 8 avril en demandant plus de d\u00e9tails au sujet des all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la lettre.\n[79] Le 29 avril 2003, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne pour un lieu de travail sans harc\u00e8lement de l'intim\u00e9e, M. Roger Worsfold, un agent des transports pour l'intim\u00e9e, a re\u00e7u le mandat de mener une enqu\u00eate concernant les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement du plaignant. Pour ce faire, M. Worsfold a interrog\u00e9 M. Gosse ainsi que des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par le plaignant, soit Hans Nederpel, Jerry Plante, Jim Manson et Mike Robinson. Apr\u00e8s ces entrevues, il a ensuite interrog\u00e9 le plaignant. \u00c0 partir de ces entrevues et de divers documents en sa possession, il a conclu que les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement \u00e9taient sans fondement.\n[80] L'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles concerne une situation relative \u00e0 une occasion d'emploi chez Union Pacific Railway, une entreprise dont le si\u00e8ge social se trouve aux \u00c9tats-Unis, laquelle avait fait des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'automne 2003. Union Pacific manquait d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, alors que l'intim\u00e9e avait un surplus d'employ\u00e9s dans l'ouest du Canada. Union Pacific s'est inform\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9e pour savoir s'il \u00e9tait possible d'offrir \u00e0 certains de ces employ\u00e9s de travailler pour Union Pacific aux \u00c9tats-Unis. M. Kopp a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que tous les employ\u00e9s de Kamloops avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d'emploi, sauf un contrema\u00eetre de chantier dont l'intim\u00e9e avait besoin, donc qu'elle ne voulait pas laisser partir. Le plaignant, qui avait manifest\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, s'est vu refuser la chance de d\u00e9poser une demande. L'explication donn\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait qu'elle ne pourrait veiller \u00e0 ce que le plaignant respecte son contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration s'il lui \u00e9tait permis de travailler aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\nVIII. ANALYSE [81] Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une proc\u00e9dure d'arbitrage o\u00f9 l'arbitre doit d\u00e9cider si l'employeur a contrevenu ou non \u00e0 la convention collective. Il ne s'agit pas non plus d'une action pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ai pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l'intim\u00e9e a prouv\u00e9 qu'elle avait des raisons valables de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant apr\u00e8s les incidents du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001. La proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue par la Loi pour le traitement d'une plainte ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une solution de rechange \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de grief pr\u00e9vue par la convention collective.\n[82] Afin de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection pr\u00e9vue par la Loi, le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer l'existence de l'un ou plusieurs des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi. En cons\u00e9quence, l'analyse qui suit ne portera que sur des questions se rapportant \u00e0 la Loi.\nA. Les plaintes relatives aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi [83] M. Witwicky a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes relatives aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. L'article 10 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait pour l'employeur de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite. Contrairement aux plaintes relatives \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi, lequel porte sur des actes de l'employeur visant des individus en particulier, l'article 10 de la Loi porte sur les effets discriminatoires que peuvent avoir les lignes de conduite d'un employeur sur un individu ou une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus.\n[84] De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'article 3 de la Loi mentionne la d\u00e9ficience comme \u00e9tant un des motifs de distinction illicite. L'article 25 de la Loi \u00e9nonce clairement que le terme d\u00e9ficience comprend la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l'alcool ou la drogue. En outre, il est bien \u00e9tabli que la protection pr\u00e9vue par la Loi s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 ceux qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 tort comme ayant une d\u00e9ficience (voir l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, au paragraphe 49).\n[85] \u00c0 la suite des arr\u00eats rendus par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), et dans Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer), la distinction historique entre discrimination directe et discrimination indirecte a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par une approche unie en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9cisions tranchant des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Selon cette approche, il incombe toujours au demandeur d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9. (Voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Limited, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558.)\nB. Y a-t-il preuve prima facie? [86] Le plaignant soutient qu'il a fait l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, c'est-\u00e0-dire la toxicomanie et l'alcoolisme. Il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve que l'intim\u00e9e estimait qu'il souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience.\n[87] La preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise n'\u00e9tablit pas que l'intim\u00e9e estimait que le plaignant souffrait de toxicomanie ou d'alcoolisme. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la raison pour laquelle le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 est que l'intim\u00e9e a jug\u00e9 qu'il avait contrevenu \u00e0 [traduction] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale G du REF et \u00e0 [traduction] la partie 8, article 3.1 des IGE, notamment \u00e0 la politique du CN sur la pr\u00e9vention des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l'alcool et les drogues en milieu de travail. L'alin\u00e9a a) de l'article G du R\u00e8glement d'exploitation ferroviaire du Canada (le R\u00e8glement ou le REF) pr\u00e9voit que [l]a consommation de boissons alcooliques ou autres substances enivrantes et l'usage de stup\u00e9fiants sont interdits aux employ\u00e9s appel\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre leur service; la consommation, l'usage et la possession de telles substances sont \u00e9galement interdits pendant le service. L'alin\u00e9a 3.1a), sous le titre [traduction] Responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e9nonce que [traduction] toute personne (gestionnaires, employ\u00e9s, sous-traitants, visiteurs, etc.) doit : a) d\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, \u00eatre en \u00e9tat de travailler, \u00eatre alerte et \u00eatre capable de travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Si vous d\u00e9sirez conna\u00eetre les r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises en mati\u00e8re d'alcool, de drogue, de m\u00e9dicaments d'ordonnance et autres m\u00e9dicaments, veuillez consulter le feuillet du CN intitul\u00e9 \"Politique sur la pr\u00e9vention des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l'alcool et les drogues en milieu de travail. Ces r\u00e8gles \u00e9taient en vigueur le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[88] Selon Robert Reny, gestionnaire principal des ressources humaines chez l'intim\u00e9e, ces r\u00e8gles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9es pour assurer la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s, ainsi que pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. Selon ce qu'il a affirm\u00e9, ces r\u00e8gles ont pour but d'\u00e9tablir [traduction] tr\u00e8s clairement les obligations auxquelles sont tenues les employ\u00e9s. L'objectif est de pr\u00e9venir la consommation de drogues et d'alcool ainsi que de sanctionner certains comportements pendant les heures de travail. Je n'ai pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l'intim\u00e9e a eu raison ou a eu tort de conclure que le plaignant avait contrevenu \u00e0 cette politique. Il s'agit d'une question qui doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par un arbitre dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure de grief pr\u00e9vue par la convention collective.\n[89] Le plaignant pourrait l\u00e9gitimement s'\u00e9lever contre le temps qu'a pris l'intim\u00e9e pour faire enqu\u00eate. Il pourrait \u00e9galement contester la proc\u00e9dure utilis\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate sur les incidents. Mais cela n'a aucun lien avec une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e violation de la Loi. Afin de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection pr\u00e9vue par la Loi, le plaignant doit prouver l'existence de l'un ou de plusieurs des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi.\n[90] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l'ensemble de la preuve, je conclus que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9e l'a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu'elle croyait ou estimait qu'il \u00e9tait alcoolique. J'estime que la raison pour laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignait \u00e9tait que celle-ci croyait, \u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison, mais ce n'est pas \u00e0 moi de d\u00e9cider, qu'il avait contrevenu \u00e0 ses r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 ses politiques.\n[91] Je vais maintenant me pencher sur la question du contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Le plaignant demande au Tribunal de conclure que les modalit\u00e9s de ce contrat donnaient \u00e0 penser qu'il \u00e9tait alcoolique et qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'un acte discriminatoire. L'intim\u00e9e soutient que la seule \u00e9tiquette attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne assujettie \u00e0 un contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique est que cette personne a contrevenu aux r\u00e8gles de travail.\n[92] Afin de mieux comprendre les raisons pour lesquelles le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u, il est important d'examiner le document de l'intim\u00e9e intitul\u00e9 La pr\u00e9vention : un choix s\u00e9curitaire. Politique sur la pr\u00e9vention des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l'alcool et les drogues en milieu de travail - Politiques et directives. Ce document pr\u00e9voit ceci :\nAlcool\nLa possession, la distribution ou la vente de boissons alcoolis\u00e9es, ainsi que la consommation d'alcool sous quelque forme que ce soit, sont interdites pendant que la personne est en service (y compris pendant les pauses prises sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du CN ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur), qu'elle est en service command\u00e9 ou qu'elle se trouve sur les lieux appartenant au CN, dans les v\u00e9hicules et sur le mat\u00e9riel de la Compagnie. Cette interdiction peut \u00eatre lev\u00e9e dans certains cas, avec l'autorisation pr\u00e9alable d'une vice-pr\u00e9sidence. Ces dispositions n'emp\u00eachent pas les commer\u00e7ants et les \u00e9tablissements d\u00e9tenant un permis d'alcool de pratiquer leurs activit\u00e9s habituelles.\nIl est \u00e9galement interdit \u00e0 tout membre du personnel d'effectuer son service, normal ou command\u00e9, ou de se trouver sur les lieux appartenant au CN avec un taux d'alcool\u00e9mie sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 0,04. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 un membre du personnel doit subir un test de d\u00e9pistage pour motifs raisonnables, y compris apr\u00e8s un accident ou un incident, il lui est interdit de consommer de l'alcool dans les huit heures qui suivent l'accident ou l'incident ou jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le test soit effectu\u00e9 ou encore qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que ce test ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[93] Ce document d\u00e9finit \u00e9galement ce qui constitue un poste o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est primordiale. Il y est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 qu'il s'agit de postes qui, selon la Compagnie, ont un r\u00f4le majeur directement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exploitation ferroviaire et pour lesquels toute baisse de performance ou de vigilance pourrait entra\u00eener un incident grave susceptible d'affecter la sant\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des membres de son personnel, de ses clients ou du public, ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou la protection des biens ou de l'environnement. Il y est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les postes de m\u00e9canicien, de serre-frein et de chef de train sont classifi\u00e9s comme des postes o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est primordiale.\n[94] Le document pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que l'employ\u00e9 qui enfreint les dispositions de la politique ou qui ne satisfait pas aux normes de performance de la Compagnie par suite de consommation d'alcool ou de drogues est passible de mesures correctives. Ces mesures correctives varieront selon la nature de l'infraction et les circonstances qui l'entourent. Certaines infractions, si elles sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant suffisamment graves, peuvent entra\u00eener le renvoi de l'employ\u00e9 d\u00e8s le premier incident.\n[95] Le document pr\u00e9voit aussi la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration d'un employ\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une infraction \u00e0 la politique. Il y est mentionn\u00e9 ceci :\nDans certaines circonstances, les membres du personnel peuvent \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 poursuivre leur travail au sein de la Compagnie, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s des conditions associ\u00e9es au maintien de leur emploi; ces conditions doivent comprendre au minimum :\nune \u00e9valuation par un sp\u00e9cialiste en toxicomanie ou en alcoolisme;\nl'ach\u00e8vement de tout programme de traitement recommand\u00e9 et le respect de tout programme de pr\u00e9vention des rechutes cons\u00e9cutif au traitement;\nune abstinence de toute consommation d'alcool ou de drogues pendant au moins deux ans;\ndes tests pratiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'improviste pendant une p\u00e9riode d'au moins deux ans;\naucune autre infraction \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente politique durant la p\u00e9riode de suivi;\nle maintien d'une performance conforme aux attentes;\nle maintien d'emploi \u00e0 un poste o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est primordiale est sujet aux exigences m\u00e9dicales du poste en question en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'aptitude au travail.\n[96] La politique pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que l'intim\u00e9e peut faire enqu\u00eate sur des activit\u00e9s qui ont lieu en dehors du service dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ont trait \u00e0 l'alcool ou \u00e0 la drogue et dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ont des r\u00e9percussions sur le milieu de travail. Pour ce qui est du retour au travail d'un employ\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool ou de drogues ou apr\u00e8s avoir commis une infraction grave \u00e0 la politique, cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9voit que des tests de d\u00e9pistage peuvent \u00eatre exig\u00e9s. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la politique pr\u00e9voit ceci :\nTous les membres du personnel relev\u00e9s de leurs fonctions \u00e0 la suite d'une infraction, y compris ceux occupant des postes o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est primordiale et ceux dont les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'abus d'alcool et de drogues sont connus, peuvent \u00eatre tenus de passer un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool ou de drogues avant la conclusion d'un contrat de maintien de l'emploi ou d'un contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Dans ces circonstances, le d\u00e9pistage a lieu \u00e0 l'improviste pendant une p\u00e9riode d'au moins deux ans, et conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s du contrat r\u00e9gissant le maintien de l'emploi ou du contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dont la Compagnie et le syndicat ont convenu.\nLes dates, qui ne sont pas divulgu\u00e9es, sont fix\u00e9es avec les Services m\u00e9dicaux. La direction du lieu de travail de la personne concern\u00e9e est avis\u00e9e que cette derni\u00e8re doit se pr\u00e9senter pour un test de d\u00e9pistage, et les dispositions pour la collecte de l'\u00e9chantillon sont prises aussit\u00f4t que possible apr\u00e8s la notification. La date et l'heure pr\u00e9cises ne sont communiqu\u00e9es au membre du personnel en question qu'apr\u00e8s r\u00e8glement des d\u00e9tails concernant la collecte.\n[97] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que le plaignant n'est pas alcoolique. Cependant, serait-il possible de soutenir que la politique de l'intim\u00e9e a pour effet qu'une personne qui a eu en sa possession ou qui a consomm\u00e9 de l'alcool sur les lieux de travail ou lors d'activit\u00e9s en dehors du service est trait\u00e9e comme si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'alcoolisme et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle peut faire l'objet d'un cong\u00e9diement? La politique pr\u00e9voit que si un employ\u00e9 enfreint ses dispositions \u00e0 la suite de consommation d'alcool, les sanctions appropri\u00e9es pourront \u00eatre prises. Ces sanctions d\u00e9pendent de la nature de l'infraction et des circonstances qui l'entourent. Si cette infraction est suffisamment grave, elle peut entra\u00eener un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e8s le premier incident. Selon l'intim\u00e9e, les incidents du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2001 \u00e9taient de cette nature.\n[98] Pouvons-nous comparer la politique de l'intim\u00e9e avec celle d'Imperial Oil dans l'arr\u00eat Entrop c. Imperial Oil Ltd (2000), 189 D.L.R. (4th) 14? Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 92 :\n[traduction]\nPar cons\u00e9quent, bien que le buveur mondain et le consommateur de drogue occasionnel ne souffrent pas de d\u00e9pendance, Imperial Oil, pour l'application de sa politique, estime qu'ils sont d\u00e9pendants. En d'autres termes, Imperial Oil croit que toute personne qui obtient un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogue pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'embauche ou \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues ou d'alcool inopin\u00e9 souffre d'une d\u00e9pendance. Parce que le Code, dans sa d\u00e9finition du mot handicap, inclut autant la d\u00e9pendance per\u00e7ue que la d\u00e9pendance r\u00e9elle, toute personne qui obtient un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogues pr\u00e9vu par la politique a droit \u00e0 la protection fournie par [le] Code. Imperial Oil impose des sanctions \u00e0 toute personne qui obtient un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 un test - soit en refusant de l'embaucher, soit en lui imposant une mesure disciplinaire, soit en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi - en pr\u00e9sumant que cette personne risque, t\u00f4t ou tard, de se pr\u00e9senter au travail avec des facult\u00e9s affaiblies et que, en cons\u00e9quence, elle n'est pas apte \u00e0 travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, la politique a une incidence d\u00e9favorable sur les personnes qui obtiennent un r\u00e9sultat positif \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool ou de drogue - elles sont per\u00e7ues comme souffrant d'une d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 une substance. Les dispositions de la politique pr\u00e9voyant un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'embauche et des tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogue et d'alcool inopin\u00e9s sont par cons\u00e9quent discriminatoires prima facie. Il incombe \u00e0 Imperial Oil de prouver qu'il s'agit d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es.\n[99] De plus, il existe une similitude entre l'arr\u00eat susmentionn\u00e9 et l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles c. Banque Toronto-Dominion (1998), 163 D.L.R. (4th) 193, o\u00f9 la Cour d'appel a affirm\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\nJe ne vois pas comment il est possible de ne pas conclure que la politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues de la Banque constitue \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue un acte discriminatoire. Je le dis parce qu'en vertu de la politique de la Banque, il est possible que les employ\u00e9s qui ont une d\u00e9pendance envers la drogue perdent l'emploi qu'ils viennent d'obtenir. Une politique d'emploi qui vise \u00e0 assurer un milieu de travail dans lequel on ne consomme pas de drogues ill\u00e9gales doit n\u00e9cessairement avoir un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur les toxicomanes.\n[100] Je ne crois pas que les d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es s'appliquent en l'esp\u00e8ce. Par exemple, dans l'arr\u00eat Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues \u00e9tait susceptible de faire perdre leur emploi aux employ\u00e9s toxicomanes. En cons\u00e9quence, l'acte discriminatoire visait les employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient toxicomanes. Le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce n'est ni alcoolique ni toxicomane. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'incidence que la politique de l'intim\u00e9e a sur lui n'est pas la m\u00eame que l'incidence qu'avait la politique de d\u00e9pistage de drogues sur les employ\u00e9s test\u00e9s dans l'affaire Association canadienne des libert\u00e9s civiles.\n[101] Encore une fois, dans l'arr\u00eat Entrop, la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a convenu que la d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 une substance constituait un handicap au sens de la loi et a conclu qu'il y avait discrimination prima facie parce que tous les consommateurs \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s, selon la politique, comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9pendants. Par sa politique, l'employeur utilisait les tests de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogue pour reconna\u00eetre les employ\u00e9s ou les futurs employ\u00e9s qui avaient consomm\u00e9 de l'alcool ou des drogues et les sanctionnait sur la base de ce qu'ils auraient pu faire plus tard.\n[102] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la politique de l'intim\u00e9e ne vise pas \u00e0 d\u00e9pister tous les consommateurs d'alcool ou de drogues. Elle sanctionne plut\u00f4t les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s en possession de drogues ou d'alcool ou qui en ont consomm\u00e9 pendant le travail. Rien dans la politique n'emp\u00eache les employ\u00e9s de consommer de l'alcool dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ne le font pas pendant le travail et dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne les emp\u00eache pas d'accomplir leurs t\u00e2ches. (Voir aussi Middlemiss c. Norske Canada Ltd, 2002 BCHRT 5, au paragraphe 25.)\n[103] Quant au contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, il visait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les conditions auxquelles le plaignant pouvait reprendre son emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e. Selon l'article 1 de ce contrat, celui-ci durait deux ans \u00e0 partir de la date de la signature du plaignant, \u00e0 moins d'une preuve m\u00e9dicale indiquant que [traduction] le suivi [devait] \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 de ces deux ann\u00e9es, comme le d\u00e9ciderait le m\u00e9decin chef de l'intim\u00e9e. L'article 2 stipulait que le plaignant acceptait de subir un examen m\u00e9dical, ce qui comprenait un test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogue pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 de subir des tests inopin\u00e9s de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogues pendant deux ans ou plus, comme le d\u00e9ciderait le m\u00e9decin chef.\n[104] L'article 3 pr\u00e9cisait que, si le plaignant \u00e9chouait le test de d\u00e9pistage d'alcool et de drogues, il ne serait pas admissible \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration et son dossier chez l'intim\u00e9e serait clos. L'article 4 pr\u00e9voyait que le plaignant devait se conformer enti\u00e8rement aux exigences de la Politique sur la pr\u00e9vention des probl\u00e8mes caus\u00e9s par l'alcool et les drogues en milieu de travail, \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 1.1 ainsi qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e8gle G du REF, ce qui comprenait l'interdiction de consommer de l'alcool et des drogues.\n[105] L'article 5 stipulait que, pour la dur\u00e9e du contrat, le plaignant devait s'abstenir de consommer des drogues et de l'alcool et se conformer aux modalit\u00e9s du contrat. Un manquement \u00e0 ces conditions pouvait entra\u00eener son renvoi ou le rendre inadmissible \u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Le plaignant devait \u00e9galement se soumettre \u00e0 de fr\u00e9quents examens du rendement de la part de son superviseur et les r\u00e9sultats de ces examens seraient consign\u00e9s et communiqu\u00e9s au m\u00e9decin chef.\n[106] Finalement, l'article 7 pr\u00e9voyait que le plaignant serait tenu de rencontrer Eric Blokzyl, lequel travaille pour l'intim\u00e9e, avant de retourner au travail. Le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par le plaignant, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Travailleurs unis des transports et par un agent du CN.\n[107] Le contrat faisait partie d'une proposition relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du grief portant sur le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant. Afin de mieux comprendre l'origine de ce document, j'ai l'intention d'examiner la proc\u00e9dure qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 sa conclusion.\n[108] Apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement du plaignant, le syndicat Travailleurs unis des transports a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief dans lequel il prenait la position suivante :\n[traduction]\n[L]e syndicat est d'avis que la Compagnie a pris une mesure disciplinaire contre W.C. Witwicky en se fondant sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le syndicat soutient que l'enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d'un vice et demande que soit annul\u00e9e la mesure disciplinaire inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 W.C. Witwicky et qu'il soit r\u00e9tabli dans sa position ant\u00e9rieure.\n\u00c0 titre subsidiaire, et sans porter atteinte \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le syndicat soutient que le simple fait que la police ait rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 le plaignant prouve qu'il \u00e9tait sobre. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il a enfreint une r\u00e8gle et le syndicat demande que soit annul\u00e9e la mesure disciplinaire inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 W.C. Witwicky et qu'il soit r\u00e9tabli dans sa position ant\u00e9rieure.\n[109] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner que le grief ne fait nulle part mention d'une quelconque violation des droits de la personne du plaignant ni du fait que son cong\u00e9diement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 par la perception qu'il \u00e9tait alcoolique. Le grief n'est fond\u00e9 que sur ce que le syndicat qualifie d'[traduction] \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve obtenus de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e.\n[110] Le grief a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu selon les modalit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans une lettre de D. Edison, vice-pr\u00e9sident de la division Pacifique de l'intim\u00e9e, approuv\u00e9e par B.J. Henry, pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du syndicat. Dans cette lettre, l'intim\u00e9e acceptait de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le plaignant, \u00e0 condition qu'il accepte les modalit\u00e9s du contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. Le plaignant a accept\u00e9 ces modalit\u00e9s le 2 novembre 2002.\n[111] Le fait que le grief ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu \u00e0 la satisfaction des parties n'emp\u00eache pas le plaignant de d\u00e9poser une plainte concernant les droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, je dois maintenant r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question suivante : le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration viole-t-il les droits que garantit la Loi au plaignant? L'arbitre Michel G. Picher a expos\u00e9 le droit applicable en de telles circonstances dans Bureau d'arbitrage et de m\u00e9diation des chemins de fer du Canada, dossier no 3598, une d\u00e9cision arbitrale rendue le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir commis une infraction \u00e0 la politique sur les drogues et l'alcool de l'intim\u00e9e, [traduction] sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration est conditionnelle \u00e0 ce qu'il accepte de se soumettre \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical complet visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il est d\u00e9pendant de la drogue ou de l'alcool. Si cet examen r\u00e9v\u00e9lait une d\u00e9pendance, sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration serait conditionnelle \u00e0 ce qu'il suive le traitement ordonn\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9 ayant proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen et \u00e0 ce qu'il satisfasse \u00e0 toute obligation de production de documents pouvant s'y rapporter. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[112] Nous ne saurons jamais comment aurait r\u00e9agi l'intim\u00e9e si le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 positif ou s'il avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations \u00e9tablies dans le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, car le plaignant, du d\u00e9but jusqu'\u00e0 la fin du contrat, n'a consomm\u00e9 ni drogues ni alcool et n'a jamais \u00e9chou\u00e9 de test. Dans la d\u00e9cision Milazzo c. Autocar Connaisseur Inc., [2003] D.C.D.P. no 24, aux paragraphes 177 \u00e0 180, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n177 Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique d'Autocar Connaisseur en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9pistage des drogues, la compagnie mettra fin sommairement \u00e0 l'emploi de tout employ\u00e9 qui obtiendra des r\u00e9sultats positifs \u00e0 la suite d'un test de d\u00e9pistage de l'alcool ou des drogues. Si les r\u00e9sultats du test administr\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 \u00e9ventuel sont positifs, Autocar Connaisseur retirera son offre d'emploi.\n178 On se rappellera que M. Devlin a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'Autocar Connaisseur est d'avis que ces mesures sont n\u00e9cessaires, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 qui, sciemment, se pr\u00e9sente au travail avec de l'alcool ou des drogues dans son organisme se trouve \u00e0 trahir enti\u00e8rement la confiance de son employeur, qui n'a d'autre choix que de mettre fin \u00e0 la relation d'emploi. Il se peut fort bien qu'il soit loisible \u00e0 Autocar Connaisseur (\u00e0 tout le moins du point de vue des droits de la personne) de proc\u00e9der ainsi dans les cas o\u00f9 des employ\u00e9s consomment de l'alcool ou des drogues par choix et contreviennent volontairement \u00e0 la politique de la compagnie en mati\u00e8re d'alcool et de drogues.\n179 Cependant, la situation est diff\u00e9rente dans les cas o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 souffre d'un \u00e9tat qu'on peut \u00e0 juste titre qualifier de d\u00e9ficience. Dans ces cas-l\u00e0, l'employeur est tenu d'accommoder l'employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la contrainte excessive, \u00e0 moins qu'il lui soit impossible de le faire.\n180 Le fait qu'un employ\u00e9 obtienne des r\u00e9sultats positifs \u00e0 la suite d'un test de d\u00e9pistage des drogues administr\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l'employeur ne signifie pas n\u00e9cessairement que l'employ\u00e9 est atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience. Afin de distinguer les employ\u00e9s qui sont atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'usage de substances intoxicantes de ceux qui ne le sont pas, il sera peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d'exiger que l'employ\u00e9 se soumette \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation professionnelle de la part d'un professionnel de la sant\u00e9 comp\u00e9tent. Si l'employeur doit \u00eatre sensibilis\u00e9 au r\u00f4le que le d\u00e9ni peut jouer dans les probl\u00e8mes d'abus d'alcool et autres drogues, il appartient en bout de ligne \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9ventuel de d\u00e9montrer qu'il a droit \u00e0 la protection offerte par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[113] En l'esp\u00e8ce, puisqu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que le plaignant souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience, r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue, l'obligation d'accommodement dont il est question dans la d\u00e9cision Milazzo n'entrait pas en cause. En outre, puisqu'il n'y a pas eu de violation du contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, le Tribunal n'a rien \u00e0 juger relativement \u00e0 l'obligation d'accommodement.\n[114] Dans sa plaidoirie, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 que, parce qu'il exigeait des \u00e9chantillons de sang, le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration violait les droits de la personne. En l'esp\u00e8ce, les \u00e9chantillons de sang ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis avec le consentement du plaignant. Aucune preuve n'indique qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de fournir ces \u00e9chantillons. Dans ces circonstances, je ne peux pas conclure qu'il y a eu violation des droits de la personne du plaignant (voir R. c. Dersch, [1993] 3 R.C.S. 768).\nC. Conclusion au sujet des plaintes relatives aux articles 7 et 10 de la Loi [115] Comme le plaignant n'a pu \u00e9tablir qu'il avait une d\u00e9ficience ou que l'intim\u00e9e estimait qu'il avait une d\u00e9ficience, le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait discrimination prima facie et, par cons\u00e9quent, sa plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 7 est rejet\u00e9e.\n[116] Pour ce qui est de la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 10, compte tenu de la preuve dont je suis saisi, je ne peux pas conclure que la politique de l'intim\u00e9e concernant l'alcool et la drogue en milieu de travail et le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration conclu avec le plaignant contreviennent \u00e0 cet article. Il ne s'agit pas d'une situation o\u00f9 un individu souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience. Dans un tel cas, l'employeur aurait l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'employ\u00e9 sans que cela ne repr\u00e9sente une contrainte excessive pour l'employeur, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne lui soit impossible de le faire. Nous sommes ici en pr\u00e9sence d'une politique qui sanctionne les personnes qui sont en possession de drogues ou d'alcool ou qui en consomment pendant les heures de travail. Rien dans la politique n'emp\u00eache les employ\u00e9s de consommer de l'alcool dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ne le font pas pendant qu'ils sont au travail et dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne les emp\u00eache pas d'accomplir leurs t\u00e2ches. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 10 est \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\nD. La plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 14 de la Loi [117] Aux termes de l'article 14, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu. Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les motifs illicites comprennent, selon la Loi, les d\u00e9ficiences physiques per\u00e7ues, comme l'alcoolisme. Puisque j'ai conclu que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il souffre d'une d\u00e9ficience, r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue, il n'y a aucune raison pour que je me penche davantage sur cette question parce que, s'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement, mais je ne conclus pas qu'il y en a eu, il n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'article 14.\n[118] La preuve a bien \u00e9tabli qu'il existait une relation tendue entre le plaignant et son superviseur, M. Gosse. Il ne fait aucun doute que le plaignant \u00e9tait irrit\u00e9 par l'attitude et le comportement de son superviseur et qu'il se peut qu'il ait eu raison de l'\u00eatre. Il se peut \u00e9galement qu'il ait eu des raisons d'\u00eatre exasp\u00e9r\u00e9 par ce qu'il consid\u00e9rait comme une r\u00e9ponse insuffisante de la part de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses plaintes, mais cela ne suffit pas au regard de la Loi. Pour que la protection de la Loi puisse s'appliquer, le comportement reproch\u00e9 doit porter sur un motif illicite.\n[119] Pour ce motif, la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 14 est rejet\u00e9e.\nE. La plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 14.1 : L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant? [120] L'article 14.1 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant.\n[121] Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 deux interpr\u00e9tations l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes quant au cadre juridique dans lequel une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e. Ces interpr\u00e9tations sont illustr\u00e9es dans deux d\u00e9cisions : Wong c. Banque royale du Canada, [2001] D.C.D.P. no 11, et Virk c. Bell Canada (Ontario), [2005] D.C.D.P. no 2. La principale diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux interpr\u00e9tations a trait \u00e0 l'importance accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intention de la personne \u00e0 qui on reproche d'avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[122] Dans la d\u00e9cision Wong, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que, compte tenu du caract\u00e8re r\u00e9parateur de la Loi, la plaignant ne doit pas \u00eatre tenu de prouver que l'intim\u00e9 avait l'intention d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui. L'essentiel de l'analyse porte plut\u00f4t sur la perception du plaignant et sur la question de savoir si le plaignant aurait pu ou non croire raisonnablement que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 constituait des repr\u00e9sailles :\n219 Selon Entrop, pour prouver que cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint, il faut d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'un lien entre les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles et l'exercice des droits du plaignant en vertu de la Loi. Lorsque des faits d\u00e9montrent que l'intim\u00e9 entendait user de repr\u00e9sailles en raison d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, le lien n\u00e9cessaire est \u00e9tabli. Toutefois, si le plaignant per\u00e7oit raisonnablement que les mesures prises constituent des repr\u00e9sailles en raison de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, il pourrait \u00e9galement s'agir de repr\u00e9sailles, nonobstant l'intention prouv\u00e9e de l'intim\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr, il faut d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la perception du plaignant est raisonnable. L'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenu responsable de l'angoisse ou des r\u00e9actions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es du plaignant.\n220 Un certain nombre de tribunaux provinciaux des droits de la personne se sont inscrits en faux contre l'analyse pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans Entrop. Ces tribunaux ont soutenu qu'en vertu des dispositions relatives aux repr\u00e9sailles que renferme la loi applicable, le plaignant doit prouver l'intention de l'intim\u00e9 d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles. La disposition relative aux repr\u00e9sailles ne s'apparente pas aux autres dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui conf\u00e8rent des droits et ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme s'appliquant \u00e0 des gestes en apparence neutres de l'intim\u00e9 qui sont susceptibles d'avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables pour le plaignant.\n221 Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a affirm\u00e9 dans Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) (5), la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne vise \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les distinctions injustes. La Loi s'attache \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 punir; par cons\u00e9quent, les motifs ou les intentions des auteurs d'actes discriminatoires ne constituent pas une pr\u00e9occupation majeure du l\u00e9gislateur.\n222 \u00c0 mon avis, on ne devrait pas, selon la logique de Robichaud, interpr\u00e9ter le par. 14.1 comme exigeant que le plaignant prouve l'intention d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles. On ne devrait pas non plus, \u00e0 mon avis, interpr\u00e9ter le par. 14.1 comme \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent, du point de vue de l'application, des articles de la Loi qui conf\u00e8rent des droits. D'apr\u00e8s le libell\u00e9 du par. 14.1, exercer des repr\u00e9sailles constitue un acte discriminatoire. Les mesures de redressement qui s'appliquent aux infractions \u00e0 cet article sont les m\u00eames que celles qui s'appliquent aux autres actes discriminatoires aux termes de la Loi. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le par. 14.1 devrait \u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 l'art. 59 de la Loi.\n[123] Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation dans d'autres d\u00e9cisions. (Voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, [2004] D.C.D.P. no 26, et Warman c. Winnicki [2006] D.C.D.P. no 18.)\n[124] L'autre interpr\u00e9tation est expos\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Virk :\n155 En vertu de l'article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d'exercer ou de menacer d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n156 L'exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d'acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte. Ce point de vue d\u00e9roge en partie \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles (Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] TCDP 11; Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004 CHRT 40).\n157 Dans Wong et Bressette, les points de vue exprim\u00e9s portent qu'un plaignant n'a pas \u00e0 prouver une intention d'exercer des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles et que si un plaignant per\u00e7oit raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 constitue des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plainte relative aux droits de la personne, il pourrait \u00e9galement s'agir de repr\u00e9sailles, nonobstant l'absence de toute preuve de l'intention de l'intim\u00e9.\n158 C'est au plaignant qu'incombe le fardeau de prouver qu'il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles et celui-ci doit prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la personne qu'il pr\u00e9tend avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence de la plainte, que cette personne a agi d'une mani\u00e8re inopportune et que l'inconduite de cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne par le plaignant. Les repr\u00e9sailles constituant une forme de discrimination en vertu de la Loi, le m\u00eame fardeau de la preuve devrait s'appliquer aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination et de repr\u00e9sailles.\n159 Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve de la part du plaignant que la personne qui aurait exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence de la plainte et qu'elle aurait agi d'une mani\u00e8re inopportune peut donner naissance \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles exigeant que la personne qui aurait exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles fournisse une explication raisonnable quant aux motifs \u00e0 l'origine de ses actes. Si l'explication donn\u00e9e n'est pas cr\u00e9dible, le Tribunal doit conclure que l'all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est justifi\u00e9e.\n[125] Cette interpr\u00e9tation a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Shulyer c. Nation des Oneidas de la Thames, [2006] D.C.D.P. no 35.\n[126] Que nous adoptions l'une ou l'autre des interpr\u00e9tations susmentionn\u00e9es, la conclusion demeure la m\u00eame : rien ne prouve l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui parce qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi. La seule preuve de repr\u00e9sailles produite par le plaignant \u00e9tait qu'il s'\u00e9tait vu refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de postuler pour un poste chez Union Pacific Railway, \u00e0 l'automne 2003, parce qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi. Malheureusement pour le plaignant, rien dans la preuve ne vient \u00e9tayer cette pr\u00e9tention. La seule preuve \u00e0 ce sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9e, M. Blokzyl. Lorsque ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur la raison pour laquelle la demande du plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, il a expliqu\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e jugeait qu'elle ne serait pas en mesure de surveiller de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate le respect des conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le contrat de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration si le plaignant \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Rien ne prouve que le refus de l'intim\u00e9e ait eu quoi que ce soit \u00e0 voir avec la plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant. Cette explication de M. Blokzyl n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e lors du contre-interrogatoire et aucun autre t\u00e9moin n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 sur ce sujet.\n[127] Le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que l'intim\u00e9e avait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de refuser la demande du plaignant sur la plainte relative aux droits de la personne qu'il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e ou qu'il peut \u00eatre conclu que l'intim\u00e9e avait l'intention d'exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de cette plainte.\n[128] Pour ce motif, la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 14.1 est rejet\u00e9e.\nIX. CONCLUSION [129] Pour l'ensemble des motifs expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je juge que les plaintes de William Carl Witwicky, d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, le 8 ao\u00fbt et le 25 octobre 2003, devraient \u00eatre et sont par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision rejet\u00e9es.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 6 juillet 2007\n1 Une [traduction] indemnit\u00e9 pour attente excessive est vers\u00e9e \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui se trouve \u00e0 une gare de d\u00e9tachement et n'est pas rappel\u00e9 pour travailler dans un autre train dans les onze heures suivantes. L'employ\u00e9 continue \u00e0 recevoir cette indemnit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il accepte un travail qui le ram\u00e8nera \u00e0 sa gare d'attache.\n2 La main-d'oeuvre de l'intim\u00e9e est divis\u00e9e en deux tableaux et les employ\u00e9s sont partag\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre ces tableaux. L'un est appel\u00e9 [traduction] tableau de personnel en surplus prot\u00e9g\u00e9 alors que l'autre est appel\u00e9 [traduction] tableau de personnel en surplus non prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Pendant qu'il est inscrit au tableau de personnel en surplus prot\u00e9g\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 sept jours sur sept, 24 heures sur 24, pendant quatorze jours. Quand il a termin\u00e9 un voyage, l'employ\u00e9 a le droit de prendre au plus 24 heures de repos pendant lesquelles il ne peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler.\n2 Quand les deux semaines d'inscription au tableau de personnel en surplus prot\u00e9g\u00e9 sont termin\u00e9es, l'employ\u00e9 est inscrit au tableau de personnel en surplus non prot\u00e9g\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode de deux semaines. Pendant ce temps, l'employ\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler, mais il re\u00e7oit n\u00e9anmoins une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration au taux quotidien pr\u00e9vu. La main-d'uvre est ainsi organis\u00e9e parce que l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 aux prises, \u00e0 un certain moment, avec un surplus d'employ\u00e9s et \u00e9tait incapable de garantir du travail pour tout le monde en m\u00eame temps.\n2\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1123\/0506\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : William Carl Witwicky c.

INTRODUCTION [1] L'intim\ufffde, Manitoba TeleCom Services Inc. (MTS), a pr\ufffdsent\ufffd une requ\ufffdte afin d'obtenir une ordonnance portant sur ce qui suit :\nles parties sont li\ufffdes par les conclusions de fait et de droit tir\ufffdes par un arbitre dans sa d\ufffdcision rendue en 2004 (la d\ufffdcision Graham) et les plaignants ne peuvent produire des \ufffdl\ufffdments de preuve qui les contredisent; le plaignant Hando, parce qu'il a d\ufffdpos\ufffd un grief puis l'a retir\ufffd de la d\ufffdcision Graham, ne peut porter sa plainte devant le Tribunal; la Telephone Employees' Association of Manitoba (le syndicat) doit \ufffdtre ajout\ufffde \ufffd titre d'intim\ufffde dans le cadre de la plainte; le syndicat ne peut \ufffdtre un plaignant au sens des paragraphes 40(1) et 40(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\nII. LE CONTEXTE [2] Les plaignants dans la pr\ufffdsente instruction sont le syndicat et cinq individus membres du syndicat, soit Hando, Mulligan, Giroux, Sirett et Custance. Les cinq plaignants ont tous \ufffdt\ufffd mis \ufffd pied par la MTS en janvier 2003. Le syndicat a contest\ufffd les mises \ufffd pied en d\ufffdposant des griefs.\n[3] Le syndicat a retir\ufffd un des griefs, qui avait \ufffdt\ufffd d\ufffdpos\ufffd au nom de Hando (le grief Hando). Ce faisant, le syndicat a affirm\ufffd que le retrait du grief ne causerait aucun pr\ufffdjudice \ufffd Hando s'il portait sa plainte all\ufffdguant des violations des droits de la personne par MTS devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP). Le grief Hando ne faisait mention d'aucune pr\ufffdsum\ufffde violation de la LCDP.\n[4] Le syndicat a d\ufffdpos\ufffd un autre grief au nom d'un groupe de 14 personnes, dont Mulligan, Giroux, Sirett et Custance (le grief de groupe). Le grief de groupe a \ufffdt\ufffd rejet\ufffd dans la d\ufffdcision Graham.\n[5] La port\ufffde du grief de groupe s'est r\ufffdtr\ufffdcie entre le moment du d\ufffdp\ufffdt et le moment de l'arbitrage. Au moment o\ufffd il a \ufffdt\ufffd sign\ufffd, le grief portait sur de pr\ufffdsum\ufffdes violations de la convention collective et de la LCDP. Pourtant, le r\ufffdsum\ufffd du grief apparaissant dans la d\ufffdcision Graham ne comprenait aucune r\ufffdf\ufffdrence \ufffd la LCDP et celle-ci n'a \ufffdt\ufffd examin\ufffde nulle part ailleurs dans le document.\n[6] De m\ufffdme, selon les all\ufffdgations du grief de groupe dans sa forme originale, certains des employ\ufffds mis \ufffd pied auraient \ufffdt\ufffd cibl\ufffds de mani\ufffdre injustifi\ufffde en raison de leurs absences dues \ufffd la maladie et(ou) en raison du fait qu'ils avaient r\ufffdcemment demand\ufffd des prestations d'invalidit\ufffd de longue dur\ufffde. Cependant, avant l'arbitrage, le syndicat a fait savoir qu'il ne pr\ufffdsenterait aucun argument quant \ufffd la question de la s\ufffdlection injustifi\ufffde fond\ufffde sur ces absences.\n[7] En outre, dans la d\ufffdcision Graham, il est not\ufffd que [traduction] le syndicat a choisi de ne pas d\ufffdposer 14 griefs individuels dans le cadre desquels chaque plaignant aurait tent\ufffd de prouver que ses comp\ufffdtences individuelles, son rendement et ses qualifications m\ufffdritaient qu'il soit gard\ufffd comme employ\ufffd au d\ufffdtriment d'un autre employ\ufffd donn\ufffd. Bien qu'il ne soit pas clair que cela ait \ufffdt\ufffd l'intention du syndicat, la d\ufffdcision Graham donne \ufffd penser qu'il s'agissait l\ufffd d'une possibilit\ufffd.\n[8] Par cons\ufffdquent, le grief de groupe ne portait que sur la m\ufffdthode utilis\ufffde par MTS, laquelle \ufffdtait pr\ufffdvue \ufffd l'article 26.03 de la convention collective, pour choisir les employ\ufffds qui allaient \ufffdtre mis \ufffd pied. Essentiellement, selon l'article 26, quand il est temps de d\ufffdterminer quels titulaires d'un poste doivent \ufffdtre mis \ufffd pied, l'anciennet\ufffd ne devient un facteur que lorsqu'il n'y a aucune diff\ufffdrence entre les titulaires pour ce qui est des comp\ufffdtences, des habilet\ufffds, du rendement et des qualifications. Il ressort de cet article que MTS avait le droit de mettre \ufffd pied les employ\ufffds qui, selon elle, \ufffdtaient les moins qualifi\ufffds.\n[9] Dans l'examen du grief, l'arbitre de la d\ufffdcision Graham s'est pench\ufffd sur les mises \ufffd pied de MTS en vue d'\ufffdtablir : 1) si elles \ufffdtaient conformes \ufffd la convention collective; 2) si la proc\ufffddure appliqu\ufffde, conform\ufffdment aux normes de l'article 26, \ufffdtait juste, appropri\ufffde et impartiale; 3) si la d\ufffdcision de proc\ufffdder \ufffd des mises \ufffd pied \ufffdtait raisonnable.\n[10] En particulier, la d\ufffdcision Graham a port\ufffd sur un certain nombre d'all\ufffdgations avanc\ufffdes par le syndicat, et sur la preuve \ufffd l'appui de ces all\ufffdgations selon lesquelles les mises \ufffd pied de MTS furent fond\ufffdes sur des renseignements incomplets ou inexacts qui ont men\ufffd \ufffd une analyse comparative erron\ufffde des employ\ufffds mis \ufffd pieds par rapport aux autres employ\ufffds.\nA. L'instruction sur la LCDP [11] Devant le Tribunal, les plaignants demandent que soit r\ufffdactiv\ufffde l'all\ufffdgation de discrimination soulev\ufffde dans le grief de groupe, laquelle, pour une raison quelconque, n'a pas \ufffdt\ufffd examin\ufffde en arbitrage. Les plaintes d\ufffdpos\ufffdes par Mulligan, Giroux, Sirett et Custance aupr\ufffds de la CCDP mentionnent que chaque plaignant a \ufffdt\ufffd d\ufffdlib\ufffdr\ufffdment cibl\ufffd par MTS dans ses mises \ufffd pied pour le motif qu'ils \ufffdtaient consid\ufffdr\ufffds comme \ufffdtant handicap\ufffds. La plainte Hando et la plainte d\ufffdpos\ufffde directement par le syndicat comportent les m\ufffdmes all\ufffdgations.\n[12] En outre, dans leur expos\ufffd conjoint des pr\ufffdcisions, les plaignants visent directement l'analyse comparative men\ufffde par MTS en application de l'article 26. Par exemple, au paragraphe 20 de leur expos\ufffd, ils affirment que Sirett, Mulligan, Giroux et Custance poss\ufffddent des comp\ufffdtences, habilet\ufffds et qualifications au moins \ufffdgales ou sup\ufffdrieures \ufffd celles d'autres employ\ufffds ayant moins d'anciennet\ufffd qui n'ont pas \ufffdt\ufffd mis \ufffd pieds.\n[13] L'intim\ufffde MTS affirme que les plaignants ne devraient pas \ufffdtre autoris\ufffds \ufffd mettre en doute la validit\ufffd de la proc\ufffddure de mise \ufffd pied pr\ufffdvue \ufffd l'article 26, car elle a d\ufffdj\ufffd \ufffdt\ufffd contest\ufffde dans le cadre de l'arbitrage et a \ufffdt\ufffd maintenue par la d\ufffdcision Graham. De plus, dans la mesure o\ufffd Hando n'est pas assujetti \ufffd la d\ufffdcision Graham (puisqu'il ne participait pas au grief de groupe), Hando devrait \ufffdtre \ufffdgalement li\ufffd puisqu'il a renonc\ufffd \ufffd son droit \ufffd l'arbitrage.\n[14] Les plaignants r\ufffdpliquent que le grief de groupe portait essentiellement sur la proc\ufffddure; il ne portait pas sur les effets de l'analyse comparative sur chacun des plaignants. Par ailleurs, la preuve n\ufffdcessaire pour ce faire n'avait pas \ufffdt\ufffd produite. Finalement le grief Hando ne contenait d\ufffdlib\ufffdr\ufffdment aucune all\ufffdgation de discrimination contraire \ufffd la LCDP.\nB. Les principes juridiques [15] La question de proc\ufffddures multiples devant diff\ufffdrents tribunaux met en \ufffdvidence une des difficult\ufffds pos\ufffdes par la LCDP. D'une part, une jurisprudence abondante, suivie dans des affaires comme Weber c. Ontario Hydro,[1995] 2 R.C.S. 929, et Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 460, limite le droit de l'employ\ufffd de porter devant un tribunal un diff\ufffdrend en mati\ufffdre d'emploi qui a d\ufffdj\ufffd \ufffdt\ufffd tranch\ufffd ou qui aurait pu \ufffdtre tranch\ufffd par un arbitre. Ces d\ufffdcisions sont clairement motiv\ufffdes par l'int\ufffdr\ufffdt public, notamment la n\ufffdcessit\ufffd d'assurer le caract\ufffdre d\ufffdfinitif des litiges et d'\ufffdviter les risques de r\ufffdsultats contradictoires.\n[16] D'autre part, le l\ufffdgislateur semble avoir d\ufffdclar\ufffd que les recours pr\ufffdvus dans la LCDP sont cummulatifs ou s'ajoutent \ufffd d'autres recours. Voir Sherman c. Canada (Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada), 2006 CF 715, aux paragraphes 23 et 24. Dans le m\ufffdme ordre d'id\ufffde, le juge Sopinka a d\ufffdcrit les lois sur les droits de la personne comme \ufffdtant le dernier recours des membres les plus vuln\ufffdrables de la soci\ufffdt\ufffd (Zurich Insurance c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321).\n[17] La Cour f\ufffdd\ufffdrale a conclu que le Tribunal a comp\ufffdtence pour rejeter, par voie de requ\ufffdte pr\ufffdliminaire, une plainte pour abus de proc\ufffddure, s'il y a des motifs valables de le faire. En outre, l'autorit\ufffd de la chose jug\ufffde est un des moyens par lequel un tribunal peut pr\ufffdvenir l'abus de proc\ufffddure (C.C.D.P. c. Postes Canada, 2004 CF 81, aux paragraphes 19 et 31).\n[18] Le principe de la chose jug\ufffde ne sert pas qu'\ufffd emp\ufffdcher les parties de soumettre \ufffd nouveau au tribunal des questions qui ont d\ufffdj\ufffd \ufffdt\ufffd d\ufffdfinitivement tranch\ufffdes (pr\ufffdclusion pour question d\ufffdj\ufffd tranch\ufffde). Il sert \ufffdgalement \ufffd pr\ufffdvenir les [traduction] poursuites par \ufffdtape, o\ufffd les parties ont eu l'occasion de r\ufffdgler leur litige dans une proc\ufffddure pr\ufffdc\ufffddente, mais ont pr\ufffdf\ufffdr\ufffd ne pas le faire et intenter une poursuite plus tard. Une pareille situation est souvent consid\ufffdr\ufffde comme un motif d'irrecevabilit\ufffd r\ufffdsultant de l'identit\ufffd des causes d'action (Postes Canada, aux paragraphes 29 \ufffd 32; Desormeaux c. Commission de transport r\ufffdgionale d'Ottawa-Carleton, 2002 CanLII 45932 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 35)\nC. Application en l'esp\ufffdce [19] En l'esp\ufffdce, le dossier donne \ufffd penser que le syndicat a d\ufffdlib\ufffdr\ufffdment d\ufffdcid\ufffd de ne pas exposer enti\ufffdrement devant l'arbitre ses craintes relatives \ufffd la possible nature discriminatoire des mises \ufffd pied. Il ressort \ufffdgalement des documents que le syndicat a choisi d\ufffdlib\ufffdr\ufffdment, lors de l'arbitrage relatif au grief de groupe, de ne pas contester la m\ufffdthode comparative pr\ufffdvue \ufffd l'article 26 pour les mises \ufffd pied dans la mesure o\ufffd elle touchait Sirett, Mulligan, Giroux et Custance. Le dossier de requ\ufffdte ne semble pas contenir d'explication justifiant les d\ufffdcisions du syndicat.\n[20] Dans la mesure o\ufffd l'arbitrage a men\ufffd aux conclusions g\ufffdn\ufffdrales tir\ufffdes dans la d\ufffdcision Graham selon lesquelles la proc\ufffddure de mise \ufffd pied comparative \ufffdtait conforme \ufffd l'article 26, le syndicat et les autres plaignants souhaitent maintenant contredire ces conclusions, semble-t-il en introduisant des \ufffdl\ufffdments de preuve d\ufffdmontrant que les absences des employ\ufffds ont \ufffdt\ufffd prises en compte pour d\ufffdcider quels employ\ufffds seraient mis \ufffd pied.\n[21] Si le tribunal acueillait la requ\ufffdte, de toute \ufffdvidence, la capacit\ufffd de chaque plaignant de d\ufffdfendre sa cause telle que pr\ufffdsent\ufffde dans son expos\ufffd des pr\ufffdcisions pourrait \ufffdtre r\ufffdduite, voire \ufffdlimin\ufffde. C'est le syndicat qui avait la responsabilit\ufffd de mener les griefs. Si le Tribunal accueillait la requ\ufffdte, il ferait payer aux plaignants les cons\ufffdquences de d\ufffdcisions prises par le syndicat, notamment la d\ufffdcision de ne pas soumettre \ufffd l'arbitrage l'\ufffdl\ufffdment de la plainte portant sur la LCDP. Dans ces circonstances, il serait in\ufffdquitable d'exposer les plaignants \ufffd l'application du principe de la chose jug\ufffde.\n[22] Pour ce qui est de la requ\ufffdte de l'intim\ufffde visant \ufffd faire ajouter le syndicat comme intim\ufffd, je n'en vois pas la n\ufffdcessit\ufffd. Le syndicat est d\ufffdj\ufffd partie \ufffd la plainte. Je souscris \ufffd la position des plaignants (expos\ufffde \ufffd la page 9, paragraphe 31, du m\ufffdmoire additionnel relatif \ufffd la requ\ufffdte dat\ufffd du 26 juin 2007) selon laquelle l'intim\ufffde peut demander r\ufffdparation au syndicat si le Tribunal conclut qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire de la part de l'intim\ufffde et auquel le syndicat a particip\ufffd.\n[23] Le Tribunal s'est pench\ufffd sur le droit du syndicat de d\ufffdposer une plainte en vertu de l'article 40 de la LCDP dans CTEA c. Bell Canada, [1999] D.C.D.P. no 3. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal avait conclu que le syndicat, pour les motifs expos\ufffds dans la d\ufffdcision, pouvait d\ufffdposer une plainte en vertu de l'article 40 de la LCDP. En l'esp\ufffdce, dans sa plainte, le syndicat all\ufffdgue qu'il y a eu violation de l'article 10 de la LCDP. Le syndicat souhaite obtenir \ufffd titre de r\ufffdparation une ordonnance qui visera le syst\ufffdme, alors que les plaignants souhaitent obtenir des r\ufffdparations individuelles. Dans cette mesure, la plainte du syndicat est ind\ufffdpendante et se distingue de celles des plaignants (bien que les plaignants all\ufffdguent \ufffdgalement qu'il y a eu violation de l'article 10, ils n'en font pas l'objet de leur recours), le syndicat doit avoir le droit d'agir dans la pr\ufffdsente instance.\n[24] Pour tous ces motifs, la requ\ufffdte de l'intim\ufffde MTS est rejet\ufffde. La question des d\ufffdpens relatifs \ufffd la requ\ufffdte, le cas \ufffdch\ufffdant, sera examin\ufffde par le Tribunal qui entendra les plaintes.\nJ.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le plaignant, Richard Warman, all\u00e8gue dans sa plainte que les intim\u00e9s, Bobby Wilkinson et le Parti nazi canadien (PNC), ont commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), en diffusant \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises de la propagande haineuse sur un site Web. La discrimination aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, la religion, la race, la couleur, l'orientation sexuelle et l'origine nationale ou ethnique. M. Warman soutient que la propagande v\u00e9hiculait un message susceptible d'exposer [traduction] les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience mentale, les juifs, les hispaniques, les noirs, les gais et les lesbiennes, les Roms (aussi appel\u00e9s Tziganes), les Pakistanais, les Arabes, les Chinois et les Japonais, \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\nA. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas comparu \u00e0 l'audience [2] \u00c0 l'ouverture de l'audience, qui a eu lieu dans les bureaux du Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de bien vouloir se pr\u00e9senter. M. Warman \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, ainsi qu'un avocat repr\u00e9sentant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 si les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient dans la salle. Il n'y a eu aucune r\u00e9ponse. L'agent du greffe du Tribunal est sorti de la salle d'audience et s'est rendu dans la salle d'attente, o\u00f9 il a encore demand\u00e9 si les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents. Il n'y a eu aucune r\u00e9ponse.\n[3] Le Tribunal a alors suspendu l'audience durant 15 minutes. Pendant la pause, les membres du personnel en poste \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du Tribunal ont confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent du greffe que personne n'avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 de la part des intim\u00e9s. Quand l'audience a repris, il n'y avait toujours aucun signe des intim\u00e9s ou de leurs repr\u00e9sentants.\n[4] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le dossier du greffe du Tribunal r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de la tenue de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure ou auraient d\u00fb raisonnablement \u00eatre au courant. Lorsque la Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal de sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte de M. Warman pour qu'elle soit entendue, elle a inclus dans sa lettre une copie de la plainte ainsi qu'un formulaire intitul\u00e9 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte rempli par la Commission. Selon ce formulaire, M. Wilkinson et le PNC avaient la m\u00eame adresse. La Commission a par la suite inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que l'adresse donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'origine \u00e9tait incorrecte (pour des raisons que j'explique plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision) et, le 6 juin 2006, elle a fourni au Tribunal la nouvelle adresse de M. Wilkinson.\n[5] Le Tribunal a l'habitude, apr\u00e8s qu'une plainte lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, d'envoyer un certain nombre de lettres aux parties. En l'esp\u00e8ce, dans la premi\u00e8re lettre, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e le 7 juillet 2006, on demandait aux parties si elles souhaitaient participer au processus de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal. Bien que la lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la nouvelle adresse, le Tribunal n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse de la part des intim\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une seconde lettre le 31 juillet 2006. Cette lettre n'a \u00e9galement suscit\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9ponse de la part des intim\u00e9s. En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal a fait appel \u00e0 un huissier pour signifier les deux lettres. Dans un affidavit o\u00f9 il explique comment il a tent\u00e9 de signifier les documents, lequel affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en tant que pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 l'audience, l'huissier a affirm\u00e9 que, entre le 29 ao\u00fbt et le 12 septembre 2006, il avait tent\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq reprises de signifier les lettres au domicile de M. Wilkinson, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes heures de la journ\u00e9e. Chaque fois, il n'y avait personne. Les documents n'ont donc pu \u00eatre signifi\u00e9s. Au cours de l'une de ces visites, un voisin a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'huissier que M. Wilkinson demeurait bien \u00e0 cette adresse.\n[6] Le Tribunal a fait appel \u00e0 un huissier pour signifier une autre lettre, dat\u00e9e du 23 novembre 2006, invitant M. Wilkinson \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire avec le Tribunal. L'huissier a mentionn\u00e9 dans son affidavit s'\u00eatre rendu trois fois chez M. Wilkinson afin de signifier la lettre, mais que personne n'avait r\u00e9pondu. L'huissier a affirm\u00e9 que, lors de sa troisi\u00e8me tentative, il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un voisin, lequel avait confirm\u00e9 qu'il venait de parler \u00e0 M. Wilkinson et que celui-ci se trouvait bien chez lui. Le voisin a d\u00e9crit la voiture de M. Wilkinson et sa description correspondait \u00e0 la voiture stationn\u00e9e devant la maison. L'huissier a frapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte et s'est identifi\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait des documents du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne \u00e0 livrer. Il a entendu quelqu'un \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la maison dire \u00e0 un chien de se tenir tranquille. L'huissier a ensuite plac\u00e9 les documents dans une enveloppe scell\u00e9e et a coll\u00e9 celle-ci \u00e0 la porte d'en avant avec du ruban adh\u00e9sif.\n[7] D'autres affidavits d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par l'huissier r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que personne n'a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la porte quand il a tent\u00e9 plusieurs fois de signifier une lettre dans laquelle figurait un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire ainsi qu'une autre lettre dans laquelle figurait l'avis d'audience, lequel pr\u00e9cisait la date, l'heure et le lieu de l'audience. Les deux lettres ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans des enveloppes scell\u00e9es et coll\u00e9es avec du ruban adh\u00e9sif \u00e0 la porte avant de la maison.\n[8] Compte tenu de ces renseignements, et du fait que ni les intim\u00e9s ni leurs repr\u00e9sentants ne se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de tenir l'audience en leur absence. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont comparu \u00e0 aucun moment au cours de l'audience qui a dur\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e, et ils n'ont pas non plus communiqu\u00e9 avec le greffe du Tribunal apr\u00e8s l'audience.\n[9] Les intim\u00e9s n'ont soumis au Tribunal aucune observation et aucun document. L'expos\u00e9 des faits dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est donc fond\u00e9 uniquement sur la preuve produite par la Commission et par M. Warman.\nB. L'article 13 de la Loi [10] Afin de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, il faut \u00e9tablir l'existence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nune personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord\na utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder\ndes questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[11] Le paragraphe 13(2) pr\u00e9cise que le paragraphe 13(1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'Internet.\nC. Quels sont les documents qui, selon M. Warman, constituent de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi? [12] M. Warman d\u00e9clare dans sa plainte que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e propagande haineuse figurait sur un tableau d'affichage (ou un forum) qui, selon lui, fait partie du site Web du PNC. J'appelerai ce tableau d'affichage forum du PNC. L'adresse du site Web du PNC serait pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty. La Commission et M. Warman pr\u00e9tendent que M. Wilkinson g\u00e9rait et mettait \u00e0 jour le site Web, y compris le forum du PNC, et qu'il a affich\u00e9 personnellement un certain nombre des articles en cause.\n[13] La pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e propagande peut \u00eatre class\u00e9e en deux cat\u00e9gories. La premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie est compos\u00e9e des articles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC par une personne utilisant le pseudonyme Rocket440 et la seconde cat\u00e9gorie est compos\u00e9e des articles affich\u00e9s par une ou des personnes utilisant d'autres pseudonymes. Comme je l'explique plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la preuve \u00e9tablit que les articles affich\u00e9s par Rocket440 sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le fait de l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson et que M. Wilkinson g\u00e9rait le site Web du PNC (soit pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty), y compris son tableau d'affichage, c'est-\u00e0-dire le forum du PNC.\n(i) Quels sont les articles qu'a affich\u00e9s Rocket440? [14] Les articles suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par Rocket440 dans le forum du PNC. Les articles affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC \u00e9taient class\u00e9s en un certain nombre de discussions portant sur un th\u00e8me particulier. J'ai donc mentionn\u00e9 la date de l'article ainsi que le titre de la discussion sous laquelle l'article a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9.\na) 30 septembre 2003 - Titre de la discussion : La voix du peuple [15] Le 30 septembre 2003, Rocket440 a affich\u00e9 quatre articles \u00e0 l'intervalle de cinq minutes chacun. Ces articles ne faisaient pas partie d'une conversation avec d'autres personnes affichant \u00e9galement des articles, comme il arrive souvent dans les forums de discussions. Il semble plut\u00f4t que chacun de ces articles ait \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 d'un grand nombre de courriers \u00e9lectroniques qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s par diff\u00e9rentes personnes \u00e0 une personne anonyme. Dans les quatre articles affich\u00e9s par Rocket440, les courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e9taient regroup\u00e9s par ann\u00e9e : 1997, 1999, 2001 et 2002-2003. Certains commentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9s entre les courriers \u00e9lectroniques et ils laissent entendre que ces courriers \u00e9lectroniques avaient tous d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur un autre site Web. Il semble que Rocket440 ait copi\u00e9 ces courriers \u00e9lectroniques d'un autre site Web et qu'il les ait affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC.\n[16] M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un document de 49 pages (\u00e0 simple interligne) dans lequel figuraient les articles susmentionn\u00e9s. Le th\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de ces articles est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le m\u00eame. J'ai inclus un certain nombre d'extraits tir\u00e9s des passages relev\u00e9s par M. Warman dans son t\u00e9moignage. Ces messages comportent de nombreuses erreurs de grammaire et de typographie. J'ai choisi de ne pas les enlever et de ne pas les corriger [elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente version fran\u00e7aise] :\n[traduction]\nCR\u00c9TIN! Je peux te dire au moins \u00e7a, esp\u00e8ce d'encul\u00e9 d'amoureux des Juifs, tu vas br\u00fbler en enfer. En prot\u00e9geant ces ordures de Juifs, lesquels, comme nous le savons, Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus Christ d\u00e9testait, tu agis comme le diable en personne. Tu sais aussi bien que moi que personne n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gaz\u00e9 \u00e0 Auschwitz et que la majeure partie du MENSONGE qu'ils appellent l'Holocauste n'est que \u00e7a, un mensonge.\nIci en Am\u00e9rique, nous avons des n\u00e8gres qui ne veulent pas travailler, ils restent assis sur leurs culs noirs paresseux et ne font rien d'autre que recevoir leur ch\u00e8que de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, leur ch\u00e8que d'aide sociale et leurs coupons alimentaires!

Ils ont rempli une mission divine pendant la guerre, leur peau faisait de belles bottes et ils ont permis de faire avancer le domaine m\u00e9dical! Mais qu'est-ce que font les n\u00e8gres pour nous aider? [...] Ils conduisent en faisant jouer leur putain de musique de jungle \u00e0 tue-t\u00eate. Ils sont le fl\u00e9au de la nation, et pourtant, personne ne fait rien. Tu veux tuer un n\u00e8gre? Mets fin \u00e0 l'aide sociale. Tu veux faire peur \u00e0 un n\u00e8gre? Am\u00e8ne le salaud \u00e0 une vente aux ench\u00e8res! [...] Ils parlent tout le temps de lib\u00e9rer l'Afrique, renvoyez-y ces putains de n\u00e8gres, nous n'avons pas besoin d'eux! Putain, renvoyez tous les bougnouls, les youpins, les latinos, les dos mouill\u00e9s, mettez-les tous dans un gros bateau, et coulez le putain de bateau! Regardez-les se sauver comme des rats, regardez-les se battre pour survivre, puis abattez tous ceux qui sont sur le point de r\u00e9ussir! [...] Tu es un tra\u00eetre \u00e0 ta race et \u00e0 ton pays si tu penses que les n\u00e8gres vont faire la moindre putain de chose pour le bien de l'humanit\u00e9 sauf crever!\nMessage de la Coalition KKK des \u00c9tats-Unis : N\u00e8gres, vous nous appartenez[...] vos n\u00e8gres de grands-p\u00e8res et vos n\u00e8gres de grands-m\u00e8res nous appartenaient, et ils ont eu vos n\u00e8gres de parents qui ont eu des n\u00e8gres d'enfants, alors vous tous, n\u00e8gres et enfants de n\u00e8gres, vous m'appartenez, alors mettez-vous \u00e0 genoux et sucez-moi!!!

Ils sont des sous-hommes qui ne m\u00e9ritent pas de partager la plan\u00e8te avec nous.\nPourquoi un n\u00e8gre qui n'est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour un emploi peut-il l'obtenir juste parce qu'il est noir? C'est de la discrimination contre les blancs. Le seul espoir qu'il me reste dans ce pays est que le KKK et les groupes de supr\u00e9matie blanche de toute la nation mettent fin \u00e0 ce terrible g\u00e2chis par un g\u00e9nocide.\nb) 1er octobre 2003 - Titre de la discussion : Les m\u00e9dias am\u00e9ricains contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par les Juifs [17] Ce jour-l\u00e0, Rocket440 a affich\u00e9 un texte comptant presque deux pages compl\u00e8tes, \u00e0 interligne simple, dans la discussion intitul\u00e9e [traduction] Les m\u00e9dias am\u00e9ricains contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par les Juifs. Le texte m\u00eame est intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Trois journaux Juifs. J'ai extrait les passages suivants de ce texte :\n[traduction]\nL'abolition de la concurrence et l'\u00e9tablissement de monopoles r\u00e9gionaux sur la diffusion des nouvelles et des opinions ont caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 la prise de contr\u00f4le par les Juifs des journaux am\u00e9ricains. Les cons\u00e9quences ne peuvent \u00eatre mieux illustr\u00e9es que par l'exemple des trois journaux les plus prestigieux et les plus influents du pays : le New York Times, le Wall Street Journal et le Washington Post. [...] Ce sont eux qui d\u00e9cident ce qui constitue une nouvelle ou non, \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle nationale et internationale. Ils cr\u00e9ent la nouvelle; les autres ne font que la copier. Et les trois journaux sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Juifs.\n[...]\nLe New York Times a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 en 1851 par deux Gentils [...] Apr\u00e8s leur mort, ce journal a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 en 1896 [...] par un riche \u00e9diteur juif, Adolph Ochs. Son arri\u00e8re-arri\u00e8re-petit-fils, Arthur Sulzberger fils, est l'\u00e9diteur actuel du journal et le pr\u00e9sident de la New York Times Co. Le directeur ex\u00e9cutif est Joseph Lelyveld, un Juif lui aussi (il est le fils d'un rabbin).\n[...]\nLe Washington Post, comme le New York Times, a des origines non juives. [...]\nIl a [plus tard] \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une faillite lors d'une vente aux ench\u00e8res par Eugene Mayer, un financier juif et un ancien associ\u00e9 du tristement c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Bernard Baruch, tsar de l'industrie en Am\u00e9rique pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale.\nLe Washington Post est maintenant dirig\u00e9 par Katherine Meyer Graham, la fille d'Eugene Mayer. [...]\nLa Washington Post Co. poss\u00e8de un certain nombre d'autres actifs dans le domaine des m\u00e9dias : des journaux [...], des r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision [...] et des magazines, notamment le magazine d'actualit\u00e9s num\u00e9ro deux au pays, Newsweek.\nLe Wall Street Journal, qui se vend \u00e0 1,8 millions d'exemplaires chaque jour du lundi au vendredi, est le quotidien ayant le plus important tirage au pays. Il est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Dow Jones & Company Inc., une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 new-yorkaise qui publie \u00e9galement 24 autres quotidiens ainsi que le tablo\u00efd financier hebdomadaire Barron's, entre autres choses. Le pr\u00e9sident et directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Dow Jones est Peter R. Kann, un Juif. Kann occupe \u00e9galement les fonctions de pr\u00e9sident et \u00e9diteur du Wall Street Journal.\nLa plupart des autres journaux importants de New-York ne sont pas entre de meilleures mains que le New York Times et le Wall Street Journal. En janvier 1993, le New York Daily News a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 de la succession du baron juif des m\u00e9dias Robert Maxwell (n\u00e9 Ludvik Hoch) par le promoteur immobilier juif Mortimer B. Zuckerman. Le Village Voice est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 personnelle de Leonard Stern, le milliardaire juif propri\u00e9taire de l'entreprise d'articles pour animaux domestiques Hartz Mountain. Et, tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le New York Post appartient \u00e0 News Corporation, qui est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par le juif Peter Chernin.\nL'administrateur du forum\nc) 20 octobre 2003 - Titre de la discussion : Heil Hitler [18] Ce jour-l\u00e0, Rocket440 a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 un autre participant dans le forum du PNC, lequel participant avait adopt\u00e9 le pseudonyme Fuhrer.

L'article commence par les paragraphes suivants :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 seule compte l'action et o\u00f9 les paroles sont sans importance\nAdolf Hitler-\nA une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 le racisme est \u00e0 ce point consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un acte de pure atrocit\u00e9 et le fait de personnes \u00e0 l'esprit \u00e9troit, pourquoi la race blanche permet-elle que nous en soyons autant la cible?\nIl est parfaitement acceptable pour un noir d'appeler un autre noir n\u00e8gre. Il est acceptable pour les noirs d'avoir une cha\u00eene de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui leur est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, laquelle s'appelle Black Entertainment Television. \u00c9galement, qui pourrait oublier le mois de l'histoire des noirs, Kwanza et m\u00eame les Black Panthers. On en est rendu jusque dans la sexualit\u00e9. Il y a des parades de la fiert\u00e9 gaie, que la plupart d'entre nous connaissons, eh bien pourquoi ne pourrait-il pas y avoir une parade pour les personnes ``straight'' ou une parade de la fiert\u00e9 h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuelle? La communaut\u00e9 gaie n'y donnerait pas son appui, pas plus que la communaut\u00e9 noire ne soutiendrait le KKK, mais les Black Panthers sont parfaitement acceptables.\nIl est temps de prendre position, une fois pour toute. Il est temps pour le 4e av\u00e8nement. N'en avez-vous pas assez des relations interraciales? La race blanche se fait souiller et ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'elle ne soit compl\u00e8tement \u00e9radiqu\u00e9e. N'en avez-vous pas assez des lois sur l'immigration?\nLe simple fait d'\u00eatre en col\u00e8re n'\u00e9liminera pas ces grandes sources d'irritation. Nous devons nous regrouper en une nation blanche unie et r\u00e9clamer ce qui nous revient en tant que race dominante.\nNous avons un plan pour le faire d\u00e8s maintenant.

[22] M. Warman a soulign\u00e9 un certain nombre d'autres extraits de pages du forum du PNC qu'il avait lues et imprim\u00e9es, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par des personnes utilisant un pseudonyme autre que Rocket440. M. Warman soutient que M. Wilkinson, en tant qu'administrateur du site Web, est responsable pour l'application de l'article 13 de la Loi de tout le contenu du site Web pouvant contrevenir \u00e0 cette disposition. Voici certains de ces extraits :\n[traduction]\n21 octobre 2003 - Article affich\u00e9 par 1488EffeKt1488 dans la discussion intitul\u00e9e Quelle est votre position? : Les noirs : c'est un fait notoire qu'ils commettent des crimes, ils ne causent que des probl\u00e8mes. Tuez-les tous, c'est ce que je dis. Les Juifs : Est-ce que je dois vraiment dire pourquoi? Tuez-les tous, c'est ce que je dis.\n5 novembre 2003 - Article affich\u00e9 par fuhrer dans la discussion intitul\u00e9e Heil Hitler : \u00c0 l'aube de la civilisation du Nord, les races inf\u00e9rieures avaient l'habitude de se terrer dans leurs huttes primitives et de prier \"Seigneur, sauvez-nous de la furie des hommes du Nord!\" C'est CETTE sorte d'hommes qui a b\u00e2ti la civilisation occidentale. Si la civilisation doit aujourd'hui \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9e des masses de Juifs d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s, de leurs complices cannibales et de leurs amis lib\u00e9raux effroyablement d\u00e9prav\u00e9s, ce sera CETTE sorte d'hommes qui la sauvera, JAMAIS les faux jetons.\n(iii) Les articles sont-ils susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable, au sens du paragraphe 13(1)? [23] Pour que le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi s'applique, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que les articles reproch\u00e9s sont susceptibles d'exposer une ou plusieurs personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris pour le motif que cette personne ou ces personnes appartiennent \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[24] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy c. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a conclu que le terme haine connote un ensemble d'\u00e9motions et de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu'on hait quelqu'un, c'est que l'on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 que le terme m\u00e9pris sugg\u00e8re plut\u00f4t le fait de regarder quelqu'un de haut ou de le traiter comme un \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieur. Les deux termes n'ont pas n\u00e9cessairement la m\u00eame port\u00e9e. Dans certains cas, la haine peut \u00eatre due \u00e0 l'envie caus\u00e9e par des qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures comme l'intelligence, la richesse et le pouvoir, ce qui, par d\u00e9finition, ne peut \u00eatre le cas du m\u00e9pris.\n[25] Le Tribunal, dans Nealy, a par la suite affirm\u00e9 que l'utilisation du mot susceptible dans le paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que la communication aura pour effet que les personnes entendant la propagande se mettront directement \u00e0 ha\u00efr et \u00e0 m\u00e9priser d'autres personnes. Il n'est pas non plus n\u00e9cessaire de montrer que, en fait, qui que ce soit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de haine ou de m\u00e9pris.\n[26] Ces conclusions ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892. La Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 que les termes haine ou m\u00e9pris du paragraphe 13(1) visent des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation se traduisant par des calomnies et de la diffamation.\n[27] J'estime que les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce sont susceptibles d'exposer les groupes cibl\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris au sens du paragraphe 13(1). Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, le Tribunal a analys\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions de plus en plus nombreuses portant sur l'article 13 et a fait observer qu'il existe des questions, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es comportant certains th\u00e8mes distinctifs, lesquelles, selon toute vraisemblance, sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres d'un groupe identifiable \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. \u00c0 mon avis, beaucoup de ces th\u00e8mes distinctifs se retrouvent dans les documents qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[28] Un des th\u00e8mes distinctifs relev\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Kouba est la propagation de l'id\u00e9e selon laquelle les membres des groupes identifiables sont d\u00e9pourvus de qualit\u00e9s qui rach\u00e8tent leurs d\u00e9fauts et sont fonci\u00e8rement mauvais ou celle selon laquelle seuls le bannissement, la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation ou l'\u00e9radication du groupe de personnes en question \u00e9pargneront aux autres les pr\u00e9judices caus\u00e9s par ce groupe. Les messages du 30 septembre 2003 contiennent des commentaires reprenant ces th\u00e8mes distinctifs. Beaucoup des messages incitent les lecteurs \u00e0 [traduction] se d\u00e9barrasser de groupes minoritaires et demandent [traduction] la mort de tous les Juifs et de tous les n\u00e8gres. Un autre article presse le gouvernement de [traduction] prendre position et de tuer tous les Arabes, les Africains, les Indiens, les Asiatiques et toutes les autres [traduction] personnes qui ne sont pas blanches de la plan\u00e8te. Ailleurs dans ces messages, il est \u00e9crit que les Arabes sont des sous-hommes qui ne m\u00e9ritent pas de partager la plan\u00e8te [traduction] avec nous.\n[29] Dans le message affich\u00e9 par Rocket440 le 24 novembre 2003, il appelle \u00e0 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, si ce n'est au bannissement, de toutes les personnes qui ne sont pas blanches, en exhortant les autres \u00e0 se [traduction] regrouper en une nation blanche unie et r\u00e9clamer ce qui nous revient en tant que race dominante.\n[30] Les articles affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC par des personnes autres que Rocket440 contiennent des appels \u00e0 l'annihilation d'un groupe identifiable. Le 21 octobre 2003, 1488EffeKt1488 a \u00e9crit, [traduction] Tuez [tous les noirs], c'est ce que je dis. Les Juifs : Est-ce que je dois vraiment dire pourquoi? Tuez-les tous, c'est ce que je dis.\n[31] La d\u00e9cision Kouba souligne qu'un autre des th\u00e8mes distinctifs se trouvant souvent dans la propagande est la d\u00e9shumanisation des groupes identifiables en comparant leurs membres \u00e0 des animaux, \u00e0 de la vermine, \u00e0 des excr\u00e9ments et \u00e0 d'autres substances nocives. De m\u00eame, l'utilisation d'un langage incendiaire et m\u00e9prisant, qui cr\u00e9e un climat de haine et de m\u00e9pris extr\u00eame, constitue \u00e9galement une caract\u00e9ristique de la propagande haineuse.\n[32] Les articles affich\u00e9s le 30 septembres 2003 abondent en messages semblables. Les noirs sont qualifi\u00e9s de [traduction] singes de porche et sont compar\u00e9s \u00e0 des chiens. Les personnes d'origine arabe sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] sous-hommes. Ces extraits sont parsem\u00e9s de mots m\u00e9prisants utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9signer divers groupes identifiables (par exemple, [traduction] putains de youpins, de n\u00e8gres, de latinos, de chinetoques, de japs, [traduction] putain de Juif suceur de bite, [traduction] tuez tous les n\u00e8gres, tous les Juifs et tous les p\u00e9d\u00e9s, [traduction] n\u00e8gres et fils de n\u00e8gres, [traduction] bougnouls). Dans les articles de Rocket440 affich\u00e9s les 17 et 24 novembre 2003, il fait plus d'une fois r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux noirs en les appelants [traduction] n\u00e8gres.\n[33] La banalisation ou la glorification des pers\u00e9cutions ou des trag\u00e9dies dont ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes les membres du groupe identifiable dans le pass\u00e9 sont aussi des th\u00e8mes distinctifs de la propagande. Ce type de message se trouve dans les articles du 30 septembre 2003. Dans un des commentaires, il est \u00e9crit que [traduction] personne n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \"gaz\u00e9\" \u00e0 Auschwitz et que la majeure partie du MENSONGE qu'ils appellent \"l'Holocauste\" est juste \u00e7a, un mensonge. Un autre extrait tourne en d\u00e9rision les victimes de l'Holocauste et glorifie leur victimisation en affirmant ceci : [traduction] quelques youpins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achev\u00e9s sous Hitler [...] Ils ont rempli une mission divine pendant la guerre, leur peau faisait de belles bottes et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement utiles dans le domaine m\u00e9dical. Ailleurs dans les articles, l'esclavage des Afro-Am\u00e9ricains est tourn\u00e9 en d\u00e9rision : [traduction] Tu veux faire peur \u00e0 un n\u00e8gre? Am\u00e8ne le salaud \u00e0 une vente aux ench\u00e8res et [traduction] N\u00e8gres, vous nous appartenez... vos n\u00e8gres de grands-p\u00e8res et vos n\u00e8gres de grands-m\u00e8res nous appartenaient [...].\n[34] Les appels \u00e0 la violence contre les groupes identifiables sont aussi un th\u00e8me distinctif de la propagande haineuse. Les documents qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en l'esp\u00e8ce contiennent beaucoup de telles exhortations. Dans les articles du 30 septembre 2003, l'auteur incite \u00e0 [traduction] tu[er] tous les n\u00e8gres, tous les Juifs et tous les p\u00e9d\u00e9s ainsi que des messages o\u00f9 il est souhait\u00e9 qu'un autre participant au tableau d'affichage aille [traduction] br\u00fbler dans un four \u00e0 Juifs nazi avec le reste de ces \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs de Juifs et de n\u00e8gres. Comme je l'ai not\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, dans un article du 21 octobre 2003, 1488EffeKt1488 soutient que les noirs et les juifs doivent \u00eatre tu\u00e9s ([traduction] Tuez-les tous, c'est ce que je dis.).\n[35] Un autre des th\u00e8mes distinctifs relev\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Kouba consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9peindre le groupe identifiable comme une puissante menace qui prend le contr\u00f4le des principales institutions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui prive les autres de leur gagne-pain, de leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de leur libert\u00e9 de parole et de leur bien-\u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. L'article affich\u00e9 le 1er octobre 2003 dans la discussion [traduction] Les m\u00e9dias am\u00e9ricains contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par les Juifs entre dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. Selon cet article, les Juifs ont pris le contr\u00f4le des principaux m\u00e9dias en Am\u00e9rique aux d\u00e9pens des Gentils. Il fait le lien entre le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne clairement ind\u00e9sirable de [traduction] l'abolition de la concurrence et l'\u00e9tablissement de monopoles r\u00e9gionaux sur la diffusion des nouvelles et des opinions et [traduction] la prise de contr\u00f4le par les Juifs des journaux am\u00e9ricains. Il s'appuie sur de pr\u00e9tendus faits concernant l'origine ethnique et religieuse de personnes \u00e9voluant dans le domaine des m\u00e9dias pour avancer ces g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations n\u00e9gatives, ce qui constitue un autre th\u00e8me distinctif relev\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Kouba.\n[36] On pourrait affirmer que la concentration de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des m\u00e9dias constitue un sujet l\u00e9gitime du discours public. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le contexte des autres articles sur les Juifs que Rocket440 a affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC (par exemple [traduction] putain de Juif suceur de bite, [traduction] mort \u00e0 tous les Juifs, [traduction] [...] br\u00fbler dans un four \u00e0 Juifs nazi avec le reste de ces \u00eatres inf\u00e9rieurs de Juifs et de n\u00e8gres), il est clair que cet article n'est pas une discussion sur l'\u00e9tat du capitalisme en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, mais plut\u00f4t une caract\u00e9risation des Juifs comme \u00e9tant une menace \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne.\n[37] En somme, par cons\u00e9quent, les articles se trouvant dans le forum du PNC, ceux affich\u00e9s par Rocket440 et par d'autres, contiennent un ou plusieurs des th\u00e8mes distinctifs de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. Je dois donc conclure que ces documents sont susceptibles d'exposer les membres de groupes identifiables (dont les noirs, les Juifs, les Asiatiques, les homosexuels et les Latino-Am\u00e9ricains) \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris pour le motif qu'ils appartiennent \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3.\nD. Les articles reproch\u00e9s ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e? [38] Selon le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, la propagande haineuse doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour qu'elle constitue un acte discriminatoire. M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que n'importe quel membre du public aurait pu consulter le forum du PNC par Internet. Puisque la propagande pouvait \u00eatre lue \u00e0 tout moment par n'importe qui utilisant l'Internet, \u00e0 mon avis, ils ont bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e (voir Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 62; Schnell c. Micka (20 ao\u00fbt 2002 : TCDP), au paragraphe 129; Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Winnicki; 2005 CF 1493, au paragraphe 32).\nE. La preuve \u00e9tablit-elle que l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson a utilis\u00e9 l'Internet pour aborder ou faire aborder les questions trait\u00e9es dans la propagande en cause? [39] Afin d'\u00e9tablir le lien entre la propagande en cause se trouvant dans le forum du PNC et l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson, M. Warman a produit des extraits de discussions tir\u00e9es du forum du PNC ainsi que d'autres forums en ligne se trouvant sur un site Web appel\u00e9 Stormfront.org, lequel est bas\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[40] Un des participants \u00e0 la discussion sur Stormfront.org utilisait le pseudonyme MeinStruggle. Les participants \u00e0 ce forum pouvaient indiquer le [traduction] lieu o\u00f9 ils se trouvaient dans la marge \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs articles. MeinStruggle a inscrit Canada comme lieu de r\u00e9sidence. Dans un article affich\u00e9 dans le forum de Sormfront.org, dat\u00e9 du 2 octobre 2003, MeinStruggle \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] Je tente \u00e0 l'heure actuelle de lancer mon propre mouvement. Pour plus de renseignements, visitez notre tableau d'affichage. Il a ensuite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le tableau d'affichage se trouvait \u00e0 l'adresse pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty, qui est l'adresse du site Web o\u00f9 M. Warman pr\u00e9tend avoir lu la propagande haineuse analys\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, c'est-\u00e0-dire le forum du PNC.\n[41] Le 23 novembre 2003, un article a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 dans le forum du PNC par [traduction] deux Italiens nazis, lesquels demandaient des conseils sur la fa\u00e7on d'immigrer au Canada. Quelqu'un utilisant le pseudonyme Rocket440 a r\u00e9pondu au message le 26 novembre 2003 et a propos\u00e9 qu'ils communiquent directement avec lui par courrier \u00e9lectronique en utilisant l'adresse bobby.wilkinson@sympatico.ca. \u00c0 la fin du message de Rocket440 apparaissaient les mots [traduction] L'administrateur du forum\/Napkin Monitor.\n[42] Bell Sympatico est un fournisseur d'acc\u00e8s Internet exploit\u00e9 par Bell Canada. M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il a compris, Bell Sympatico donne \u00e0 ses clients \u00e0 qui elle fournit l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet un peu d'espace sur son site Web (sympatico.ca) o\u00f9 ils peuvent \u00e9tablir leur propre petit site Web. Ces petits sites Web sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement enregistr\u00e9s sous l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique du client. M. Warman soutient qu'il a compris cela \u00e0 partir de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite dans une autre affaire devant le Tribunal dans laquelle il \u00e9tait partie, Warman c. Winnicki, dossier T1021\/0205. Il est possible de consulter ces sites Web de clients en passant par le site Web de Bell Sympatico, soit www3.sympatico.ca. Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2003, M. Warman a cherch\u00e9 le nom bobby.wilkinson sur ce site Web et une page nomm\u00e9e Index de \/bobby.wilkinson\/ est apparue. Il n'y avait aucun dossier ou document dans l'index, mais, selon M. Warman, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il comprend du fonctionnement de ce service de Bell Sympatico, il faut qu'un client actif de Bell Sympatico ait utilis\u00e9 le nom bobby.wilkinson pour que l'index puisse exister. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l'absence de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, la preuve de M. Warman \u00e0 ce sujet n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite.\n[43] Le 29 novembre 2003, Rocket440 a affich\u00e9 un article dans le forum du PNC en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un article d'une personne de Toronto qui venait de se joindre au forum. Rocket440 a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] Bienvenue! Je suis d'Ottawa, mais je visite souvent Toronto. Il a encore sign\u00e9 son message [traduction] L'administrateur du forum.\n[44] M. Warman a produit une copie imprim\u00e9e de ce qu'il dit \u00eatre la page d'accueil du site Web et du forum du Parti nazi canadien. Il s'agit principalement d'une table des mati\u00e8res \u00e9num\u00e9rant le sujet des diff\u00e9rentes discussions en cours pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le forum du PNC. En haut de la page se trouve l'image d'une swastika. \u00c0 la fin de la page d'accueil se trouve un lien sur lequel un visiteur peut cliquer pour [traduction] contacter [l']administrateur. M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en cliquant sur ce lien, son programme de courrier \u00e9lectronique a automatiquement ouvert une fen\u00eatre pour envoyer un nouveau courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'adresse bobby.wilkinson@sympatico.ca.\n[45] M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait r\u00e9ussi pour la derni\u00e8re fois \u00e0 voir le forum du PNC sur Internet le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Quand il a tent\u00e9 de visiter le site Web le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2004, l'acc\u00e8s lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9. \u00c0 la place, il est apparu un message syst\u00e8me de la part d'ezboard qui affirmait que le site avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] Banni et verrouill\u00e9!. Le message disait ensuite :\n[traduction]\n(partinazicanadien) a \u00e9t\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment\naux conditions d'utilisation d'ezboard\nMotif : propagande haineuse\n[46] M. Warman a affirm\u00e9 qu'ezboard est un service d'h\u00e9bergement de sites Web accessible \u00e0 partir du site Web ezboard.com. Il permet aux utilisateurs de b\u00e2tir des sites Web et des forums gratuitement. Je d\u00e9duis du libell\u00e9 de l'adresse Internet du forum du PNC que ce tableau d'affichage \u00e9tait h\u00e9berg\u00e9 chez ezboard.com (c'est-\u00e0-dire pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty).\n[47] Le 28 ao\u00fbt 2004, MeinStruggle a affich\u00e9 un article dans le forum de Stormfront.org. Son article \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Appel \u00e0 tous les Aryens du Canada, de l'aide s.v.p.. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au premier paragraphe :\n[traduction]\nMon nom est Bobby, j'\u00e9tais anciennement l'administrateur du forum nazi\/socialiste canadien qui se trouvait sur ezboard jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le forum ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 pour raison de propagande haineuse. C'\u00e9tait au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, et le forum a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 environ en janvier de cette ann\u00e9e.\nLa date de fermeture tombe entre la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Warman a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable pour la derni\u00e8re fois de consulter le forum du PNC (le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2003) et la date \u00e0 laquelle l'acc\u00e8s au site Web lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 (le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2004).\n[48] Dans le m\u00eame article du 28 ao\u00fbt 2004 affich\u00e9 sur Stormfront.org, MeinStruggle a \u00e9crit le paragraphe suivant au sujet de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui, mais signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 son grand-p\u00e8re :\n[traduction]\nCe matin, une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 mon grand-p\u00e8re (\u00e0 qui appartient la maison \u00e0 partir de laquelle j'exploitais le site Web) est arriv\u00e9e... le plus dr\u00f4le, c'est qu'elle \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 mon grand-p\u00e8re, mais elle m'accusait purement et simplement d'\u00eatre un fanatique, de faire de la propagande haineuse, ce qui contrevient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi sur les droits de la personne. J'insiste, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 mon grand-p\u00e8re. La connexion Internet est \u00e0 mon nom et l'adresse de courriel utilis\u00e9e pour la correspondance dans le forum \u00e9tait \u00e0 mon nom, de m\u00eame que le nom d'utilisateur sur ezboard. Toutes les all\u00e9gations dans cette affaire me visent, mais la lettre est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 mon grand-p\u00e8re?\n[49] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 l'audience selon lesquels la plainte de M. Warman en l'esp\u00e8ce a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e par erreur \u00e0 un individu nomm\u00e9 Robert P. Wilkinson, qui n'est pas un des intim\u00e9s. Une enqu\u00eateuse examinant les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne, dans une note, dat\u00e9e du 3 novembre 2004, au dossier de la Commission, d\u00e9clare qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9e par un avocat repr\u00e9sentant Robert P. Wilkinson. L'avocat a expliqu\u00e9 que son client \u00e9tait le grand-p\u00e8re de l'intim\u00e9, Bobby James Wilkinson. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le jeune M. Wilkinson habitait au sous-sol chez son grand-p\u00e8re et que le petit-fils poss\u00e9dait un ordinateur au sous-sol. Le 8 novembre 2004, la Commission a re\u00e7u une lettre de l'avocat confirmant que son client, Robert P. Wilkinson, [traduction] n'est pas la m\u00eame personne que Bobby James Wilkinson, l'auteur du site Web et le propri\u00e9taire de l'ordinateur d'o\u00f9 proviennent les documents faisant l'objet de la plainte.\n[50] La Commission semble avoir appris par la suite que l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson avait plus tard d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 de chez son grand-p\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a engag\u00e9 un huissier pour trouver sa nouvelle adresse. Le 29 mai 2006, l'huissier a avis\u00e9 la Commission qu'elle avait retrouv\u00e9 M. Wilkinson et qu'il habitait dans la r\u00e9gion d'Ottawa. Ce renseignement a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au Tribunal. C'est \u00e0 cette nouvelle adresse que l'huissier du Tribunal s'est rendu pour signifier les lettres mentionn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[51] \u00c0 partir de toute cette preuve, je tire les conclusions suivantes. Pour commencer, un individu nomm\u00e9 Bobby affichait des articles sur le tableau d'affichage de Stormfront.org sous le nom MeinStruggle. Bobby a pr\u00e9tendu exploiter son propre tableau d'affichage, dont l'adresse Internet \u00e9tait pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty. Il s'agit de l'adresse Internet apparaissant sur les copies imprim\u00e9es des pages du forum du PNC, o\u00f9 M. Warman a trouv\u00e9 et lu la propagande haineuse en cause. Bobby a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sur Stormfront.org qu'ezboard avait ferm\u00e9 son tableau d'affichage \u00e0 un moment concordant avec la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Warman, selon ce qu'il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, n'a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'acc\u00e9der au site Web. Je conclus donc que Bobby \u00e9tait l'administrateur du forum du PNC.\n[52] L'administrateur du forum (c'est-\u00e0-dire Bobby) a affich\u00e9 des articles sur le tableau en utilisant le pseudonyme Rocket440 et avait une adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique compos\u00e9e \u00e0 partir du nom bobby.wilkinson. L'article affich\u00e9 sur Stormfront.org par Bobby (alias MeinStruggle) le 28 ao\u00fbt 2004 ainsi que les renseignements fournis par l'avocat de Robert P. Wilkinson m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 conclure que cet individu (Bobby) est le petit-fils de la personne (Robert P. Wilkinson) ayant re\u00e7u par erreur signification de la plainte de M. Warman. Le nom de son petit-fils est Bobby Wilkinson.\n[53] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre des articles affich\u00e9s par Rocket440 (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'administrateur du forum, Bobby Wilkinson), de m\u00eame que plusieurs autres articles affich\u00e9s dans le forum du PNC sous diff\u00e9rents pseudonymes, constituent de la propagande haineuse au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi. Bien que la preuve ne donne pas \u00e0 penser que M. Wilkinson soit l'auteur des articles affich\u00e9s sous des pseudonymes autres que Rocket440 (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu'il a personnellement utilis\u00e9 l'internet pour faire aborder des questions contenues dans ces articles), il peut quand m\u00eame \u00eatre reconnu coupable d'avoir commis un acte discriminatoire en contravention avec l'article 13 s'il a utilis\u00e9 l'internet pour faire aborder les questions. J'ai conclu que M. Wilkinson \u00e9tait l'administrateur du forum du PNC. M. Warman a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve un extrait de la page d'aide en ligne d'ezboard.com concernant le r\u00f4le des mod\u00e9rateurs de forum dans les tableaux d'affichage. Ce document pr\u00e9cise que l'administrateur du tableau d'affichage a, semble-t-il, la capacit\u00e9 de modifier ou de supprimer les articles ou le contenu de discussions en entier. L'administrateur peut \u00e9galement activer des param\u00e8tres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que les articles soient filtr\u00e9s avant qu'ils puissent \u00eatre lus par le public.\n[54] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, je conclus que M. Wilkinson, en tant qu'administrateur du forum du PNC, disposait des moyens pour emp\u00eacher la publication des articles en cause affich\u00e9s par d'autres participants ou pour les supprimer subs\u00e9quemment. En outre, puisque M. Wilkinson a personnellement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 certains groupes de discussion o\u00f9 ces articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s (par exemple, la discussion dans laquelle 1488EffeKt1488 a affich\u00e9 l'article du 21 octobre 2003), M. Wilkinson devait les avoir lus. Il a n\u00e9anmoins permis que ces messages demeurent accessibles au public. Ainsi, je suis convaincu que M. Wilkinson a fait aborder les questions contenues dans ces articles au sens de l'article 13 (voir la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 111 et 112).\n[55] \u00c0 mon avis, par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli prima facie que l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson a commis un acte discriminatoire. Ces inf\u00e9rences, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8te[s] et suffisante[s] pour justifier un verdict en faveur [du plaignant], en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 (O'Malley), \u00e0 la page 558). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l'absence de M. Wilkinson \u00e0 l'audience, aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve produite contre lui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie et aucune r\u00e9ponse ou explication ne ressort de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par les autres parties en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[56] Qui plus est, on ne m'a soumis aucune preuve contredisant la conclusion selon laquelle l'individu nomm\u00e9 Bobby Wilkinson, \u00e0 qui de nombreux documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, est le Bobby Wilkinson qui administrait le forum du PNC et qui a affich\u00e9 de la propagande dans ce forum sous le pseudonyme Rocket440.\nF. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que le Parti nazi canadien a commis un acte discriminatoire? [57] M. Warman a nomm\u00e9 le Parti nazi canadien en tant que partie dans sa plainte. Il souligne que le forum du PNC a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 sur un site Web dont le nom comprenait les mots Parti nazi canadien (soit pub68.ezboard.com\/bcanadiannaziparty). Le nom en fait utilis\u00e9 pour d\u00e9crire le forum du PNC sur le site Web \u00e9tait [traduction] Forum nazi et socialiste national. Quand M. Wilkinson a affich\u00e9 des articles sur le tableau d'affichage de Stormfront.org en octobre 2003, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] Je tente \u00e0 l'heure actuelle de lancer mon propre mouvement. Pour plus de renseignements, visitez notre tableau d'affichage. L'adresse Internet donn\u00e9e dans les articles \u00e9tait celle du forum du PNC.\n[58] Sur la page principale du forum du PNC, on pouvait voir une liste de liens vers les diff\u00e9rentes discussions du forum. Une de ces discussions \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9e [traduction] Adh\u00e9rez au mouvement socialiste nazi national : renseignements sur l'adh\u00e9sion au Mouvement nazi national. En cliquant sur le lien, le visiteur \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 vers une autre page, en bas de laquelle les [traduction] Conditions d'adh\u00e9sion au Mouvement nazi national \u00e9taient pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[traduction]\nAvoir au moins 17 ans\n\u00catre blanc d'origine pure\nSoutenir le nazisme et le mouvement socialiste\n\u00catre pr\u00eat \u00e0 agir\nAimer sa race\nLa page demandait ensuite aux visiteurs de fournir les renseignements essentiels suivants :\nNom\n\u00c2ge\nLieu de r\u00e9sidence\nRace\nCourrier \u00e9lectronique\n[59] Aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits ne d\u00e9montrait que le Parti nazi canadien existe en tant que personne morale. La seule mention de ce nom dans la preuve se trouve dans l'adresse Internet mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus. Ailleurs sur le site Web, il est question du [traduction] Mouvement nazi national et du [traduction] Mouvement socialiste nazi national.\n[60] Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour un groupe de personnes agissant d'un commun accord, d'utiliser ou de faire utiliser l'Internet de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour communiquer de la propagande haineuse (paragraphes 13(1) et 13(2) de la Loi). Le groupe de personnes vis\u00e9 dans ces dispositions n'a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre organis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 former une entit\u00e9 distincte ayant un statut juridique (voir Nealy c. Johnston (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, \u00e0 la page D\/6464).\n[61] La page d'accueil du site Web pr\u00e9sente une liste des principales discussions qui se trouvent dans le forum du PNC. Un de ces sujets de discussion est intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Membres. La description de cette discussion est : [traduction] Membres du Parti nazi\/socialiste. M. Warman a soumis en preuve une copie imprim\u00e9e d'un article affich\u00e9 par Rocket440 dans cette discussion. Le titre de cet article \u00e9tait [traduction] Bienvenue \u00e0 nos nouveaux membres, \u00e0 la suite duquel \u00e9tait inscrit le nom d'un individu, son \u00e2ge, son origine (\u00e9cossaise), son sexe (homme), son lieu de r\u00e9sidence (Toronto) et son adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique. M. Warman note que ces renseignements correspondent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 ceux demand\u00e9s dans le formulaire [traduction] Adh\u00e9rez au Mouvement nazi national.\n[62] Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, ce document ne prouve rien sinon que ce pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 nouveau membre a rempli le questionnaire se trouvant sur le site Web du forum du PNC. M\u00eame si on acceptait que cet individu \u00e9tait bel et bien membre du mouvement de M. Wilkinson, pour que s'applique l'article 13, il faut plus que la simple existence d'un groupe de personnes. Ces personnes doivent agir d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun pour aborder ou faire aborder les questions trait\u00e9es dans la propagande en cause. Rien ne prouve que ce pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 nouveau membre a particip\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la communication de la propagande, pas plus d'ailleurs qu'il n'y a de preuve attestant de r\u00e9unions, de rencontres ou de structure organis\u00e9e de quelque sorte associ\u00e9es \u00e0 ce pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 groupe.\n[63] M. Warman a soulign\u00e9 que la page d'accueil du site Web \u00e9num\u00e9rait les pseudonymes des personnes agissant comme mod\u00e9rateur des groupes de discussion dans le forum du PNC. Deux pseudonymes sont donn\u00e9s : Meinstruggle (vraisemblablement M. Wilkinson) et Landser88, dont la v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9, si cette personne n'est pas M. Wilkinson, ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie \u00e0 partir de la preuve dont je dispose. \u00c0 mon sens, ce renseignement ne suffit pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que deux individus ou plus agissaient d'un commun int\u00e9r\u00eat pour administrer ou mod\u00e9rer le contenu du forum du PNC, au moyen duquel ils ont fait aborder les questions trait\u00e9es dans la propagande en cause. Je ne suis pas convaincu que le Parti nazi canadien ait jamais exist\u00e9 sous quelque forme que ce soit ni qu'il ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autre chose que le double de M. Wilkinson. La preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas qu'une personne autre que M. Wilkinson, seul, ait administr\u00e9 le site Web.\n[64] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte contre la Parti nazi canadien n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9e et est rejet\u00e9e.\nG. R\u00e9parations [65] La Commission et M. Warman demandent que le tribunal rende diverses ordonnances en vertu du paragraphe 54(1) de la Loi.\n(i) Une ordonnance enjoignant de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 54(1)a)) [66] L'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[67] En cons\u00e9quence, j'ordonne \u00e0 M. Wilkinson de cesser d'aborder ou de faire aborder, en utilisant les moyens vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 13 de la Loi, et particuli\u00e8rement au moyen d'Internet, des questions du type que contient la propagande en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce, lesquelles sont susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite.\n(ii) La sanction p\u00e9cuniaire (alin\u00e9a 54(1)c)) [68] Le Tribunal peut imposer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qui a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 13 de la Loi une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d'au plus 10 000 $, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Le paragraphe 54(1.1) \u00e9num\u00e8re plusieurs facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte lorsqu'il d\u00e9cide de rendre une telle ordonnance :\n[69] La nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l'acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l'entourant;\nLa nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l'acte, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\nLa Commission et M. Warman ont demand\u00e9 que soit impos\u00e9e une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 6 000 $ \u00e0 chacun des intim\u00e9s.\n[70] L'avocate de la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans sa plaidoirie finale, que le contenu de la propagande haineuse \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00e0 la fois vicieux et extr\u00e9miste. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que [traduction] non seulement certains articles attribuaient des actes criminels divers et nombreux aux groupes [cibl\u00e9s], les d\u00e9crivaient comme \u00e9tant corrompus et retors, mais certains articles allaient jusqu'\u00e0 plaider ouvertement pour l'extermination des Juifs, des noirs et des autres personnes qui ne sont pas blanches. Elle a conclu que [traduction] ce fait doit favoriser de mani\u00e8re importante l'imposition d'une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire consid\u00e9rable. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve vient \u00e9tayer cette observation.\n[71] J'ajouterais de plus qu'il importe peu que M. Wilkinson ait ou non r\u00e9ellement r\u00e9dig\u00e9 certains des articles de propagande haineuse, y compris ceux du 30 septembre 2003. En fin de compte, c'est lui qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'afficher ces articles sur son tableau d'affichage, peu importe leur origine. D'ailleurs, M. Wilkinson a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment fait aborder de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e toutes les questions trait\u00e9es dans la propagande haineuse en cause en mettant sur pied et en administrant le forum du PNC o\u00f9 \u00e9tait affich\u00e9e la propagande (voir par analogie la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 144).\n[72] Je ne dispose d'aucune preuve directe relativement \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Wilkinson de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire, bien qu'il puisse \u00eatre conclu, \u00e0 partir du fait qu'il a v\u00e9cu dans le sous-sol chez son grand-p\u00e8re jusqu'\u00e0 une date entre 2004 et 2006, qu'il est une personne plut\u00f4t jeune ayant peu de moyens. Je note aussi que rien ne prouve que M. Wilkinson ait commis par le pass\u00e9 des actes discriminatoires.\n[73] Apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de tous ces facteurs, j'impose \u00e0 M. Wilkinson une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 4 000 $. Cette somme doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat \u00e0 l'ordre du Receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, lequel doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u par le Tribunal dans les 120 jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision aura \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 M.

Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal le 3 juillet 2007 et le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, Grant Sinclair, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 responsable de la gestion de l'instance, a ordonn\u00e9 que la question soit trait\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de l'audience du 9 juillet 2007.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9 s'oppose \u00e0 la production de ce document. Il soutient que le document contient des renseignements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l'article 34 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, L.C. 1995, ch. 44, qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n34 (1) Les renseignements obtenus par la Commission dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente loi sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Nul ne peut sciemment les communiquer ou les laisser communiquer sans l'autorisation \u00e9crite de la personne dont ils proviennent.\n(2) Il ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9 d'un commissaire ou d'un agent de la Commission qui obtient des renseignements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente loi qu'il d\u00e9pose en justice \u00e0 leur sujet, ni qu'il produise des d\u00e9clarations, \u00e9crits ou autres pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, sauf lors d'une instance relative \u00e0 l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n(5) Les renseignements obtenus par la Commission ou un tribunal dans le cadre de l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi ne peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s, sans le consentement de l'employeur concern\u00e9, dans des proc\u00e9dures intent\u00e9es en vertu d'une autre loi.\n[3] L'intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que les renseignements compris dans ce document ne seraient pas pertinents quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire et constitueraient une preuve par ou\u00ef-dire.\n[4] Je traiterai bri\u00e8vement du deuxi\u00e8me argument. La production de documents est assujettie au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle, qui n'est pas un crit\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant. Il doit y avoir une certaine pertinence entre le document ou les renseignements demand\u00e9s et la question en litige. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient disponibles dans le cadre d'une affaire comme celle en l'esp\u00e8ce. Une partie a le droit d'obtenir les renseignements ou les documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 l'affaire ou qui pourraient l'\u00eatre. Cela ne veut pas dire que ces documents ou renseignements seront admis en preuve ou qu'on leur accordera une importance significative.\n[5] L'article 34 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi interdit-il la divulgation du document? L'objet de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi est de r\u00e9aliser l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en milieu de travail pour les personnes membres de quatre groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s - les femmes, les Autochtones, les personnes handicap\u00e9es et les personnes qui font partie des minorit\u00e9s visibles. En vertu de l'article 22, la Commission peut effectuer une v\u00e9rification de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi chez n'importe quel employeur vis\u00e9 par la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Le paragraphe 34(1) pr\u00e9voit que les renseignements que la Commission obtient des employeurs pendant une v\u00e9rification sont des renseignements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s et que nul ne peut les communiquer ou les laisser communiquer sans l'autorisation de la personne dont ils proviennent.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public servi par la garantie que les renseignements que le rapport provisoire comporte restent confidentiels est la promotion d'un \u00e9change de renseignements complet et franc entre les employeurs et la Commission.\n[7] Pour examiner l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public envers la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements, il est n\u00e9cessaire de tenir compte de l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Ces deux lois sont de nature quasi constitutionnelle : voir Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 R.C.S. 571, Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536. L'objet de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi est de r\u00e9aliser l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en milieu de travail pour les membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, alors que l'objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est de donner effet au principe du droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, \u00e0 l'abri de consid\u00e9rations aboutissant \u00e0 des pratiques discriminatoires. Comme nous pouvons le voir, les deux objets sont tr\u00e8s semblables et ils visent tous deux \u00e0 atteindre des buts tr\u00e8s importants pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[8] Les plaignants ne demandent pas la divulgation des documents ou des renseignements que l'intim\u00e9 a fournis \u00e0 la Commission, lesquels renseignements seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de l'article 34 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. En fait, ils demandent la divulgation du rapport provisoire, un document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Commission et qui se trouve en annexe du rapport final, aussi pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la Commission. Le rapport final a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 sans objection de la part de la Commission ou de l'intim\u00e9.\n[9] L'intim\u00e9 a soutenu que certaines parties du rapport provisoire contenaient des renseignements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 la Commission et qui \u00e9taient donc prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de l'article 34 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal une copie du rapport provisoire dans laquelle il a surlign\u00e9 les passages qui, \u00e0 son avis, contenaient de tels renseignements. J'ai eu l'occasion d'examiner ce document et les passages surlign\u00e9s.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je suis d'avis que, si l'on \u00e9limine les passages surlign\u00e9s, il n'y a aucune raison pour laquelle le document ne pourrait pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 aux plaignants.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne que l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente aux plaignants, sans tarder, une copie du rapport provisoire qui appara\u00eet \u00e0 l'annexe D du rapport sur la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, du 26 mai 2004, et que les renseignements suivants, qui sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de l'article 34 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, soient masqu\u00e9s :\nPage 3 - La section intitul\u00e9e [traduction] II M\u00e9thodologie de la v\u00e9rification et \u00e9tat\nPage 4 - La premi\u00e8re ligne du premier paragraphe de la section B - [traduction] R\u00e9alisations de l'employeur\nPage 10 - Le paragraphe suivant le titre [traduction] M\u00e9thodologie pour l'examen des syst\u00e8mes d'emploi de 2002\nPage 10 - Le premier paragraphe suivant le titre [traduction] Zones s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es pour l'examen des syst\u00e8mes d'emploi de MTS\n[12] Les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair dans son ordonnance du 29 juin 2007 s'appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 16 juillet 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1161\/4306\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nAssociation des employ\u00e9(e) de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc., Barbara Custance, Carmen Giroux, Chuck Hando, Kathleen Mulligan et Janice Sirett c.

L'intim\u00e9e conteste principalement l'argument soulev\u00e9 par l'avocat des plaignants dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 juillet 2007, dans laquelle il soutenait que l'intim\u00e9e avait l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement tant qu'il n'en r\u00e9sultait pas pour elle une contrainte excessive.\n[2] L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a soutenu que ces arguments \u00e9taient de nouvelles all\u00e9gations qui modifiaient les plaintes.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les plaintes, l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et l'expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, je note qu'\u00e0 chaque fois, les plaignants ont mentionn\u00e9 la [traduction] pr\u00e9somption d'une d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois pas comment les all\u00e9gations ou les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la lettre du 6 juillet 2007 pourraient causer un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\n[4] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de la contrainte excessive et des mesures d'accommodement, je crois qu'il est important d'examiner le droit en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer \u00e0 employer un individu. L'article 10 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait pour un employeur de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite. Contrairement aux plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi, qui porte sur les actions d'un employeur affectant un individu pr\u00e9cis, l'article 10 de la Loi porte sur les effets discriminatoires que les lignes de conduite d'un employeur peuvent avoir sur un individu ou sur un groupe d'individus.\n[5] L'article 3 de la Loi pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9ficience constitue un motif de distinction illicite. De plus, il est maintenant bien \u00e9tabli que la protection de la Loi s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 ceux qui, \u00e0 tort, sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s souffrir d'une d\u00e9ficience.

BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Meiorin] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Grismer], la distinction classique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e de traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d'abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[7] Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou la norme discriminatoire comporte un motif justifiable. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit prouver :\nqu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, par exemple la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. Si l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire de consacrer beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape; qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'elle ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l'analyse passe de l'objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme \u00e0 la norme elle-m\u00eame; que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che de mani\u00e8re s\u00fbre et efficace. L'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne peut composer avec le plaignant et les autres personnes touch\u00e9es par la norme sans en subir une contrainte excessive. Il doit veiller \u00e0 ce que la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement tienne compte de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'elle puisse \u00eatre ind\u00fbment discriminatoire sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. En outre, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte par l'employeur doit \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque cas. Subsidiairement, l'employeur doit justifier pourquoi il n'a pas offert une telle norme.\n[8] Les arr\u00eats Meiorin et Grismer comportent des param\u00e8tres qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer si l'argument fond\u00e9 sur une contrainte excessive a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9. Dans Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame fait observer que l'utilisation du mot excessive laisse supposer qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la norme, il faut absolument que la contrainte impos\u00e9e soit excessive. Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore faut-il, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, que cette norme tienne compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive.\n[9] Compte tenu de l'\u00e9tat du droit et du fait que les plaignants ont mentionn\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part la [traduction] pr\u00e9somption d'une d\u00e9ficience, je rejette l'argument de l'intim\u00e9e selon lequel la lettre du 6 juillet 2007 soul\u00e8ve de nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 16 juillet 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1161\/4306\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nAssociation des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba Inc., Barbara Custance, Carmen Giroux, Chuck Hando, Kathleen Mulligan et Janice Sirett c.

Jensen\n2007 TCDP 3 2007\/02\/05\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire demandant le rejet sans audience d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada. La plaignante, Mme Brigitte Lavoie, a port\u00e9 plainte contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, all\u00e9guant le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e mise en uvre par l'intim\u00e9. Cette politique ne tient pas compte de la dur\u00e9e d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou d'un cong\u00e9 parental dans le calcul des trois ann\u00e9es cumulatives de service exig\u00e9es pour passer du statut d'employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 celui d'employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (permanent) dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[2] Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor all\u00e8gue que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la plainte puisque le r\u00e8glement d'une plainte ant\u00e9rieure fait en sorte qu'il n'y a plus de litige actuel \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre. L'intim\u00e9 estime donc que l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Borowski c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 342 s'applique et que la plainte est sans objet.\nContexte [3] Mme Lavoie a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par Industrie Canada en ao\u00fbt 2000 comme programmeuse-analyste, en vertu d'un contrat d'un an. Son contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2001, et de nouveau en ao\u00fbt 2002. Le 19 ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Lavoie est partie en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et est rentr\u00e9e au travail le, ou vers, le 5 ao\u00fbt 2003.\n[4] Avant de rentrer au travail, Mme Lavoie a appris de son employeur qu'elle aurait la possibilit\u00e9 de participer aux concours ouverts pour plusieurs postes permanents (\u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e) \u00e0 Industrie Canada et que les personnes qui ne seraient pas retenues disposeraient de trois semaines pour trouver un nouveau poste. Mme Lavoie n'a pas remport\u00e9 le concours visant \u00e0 doter plusieurs postes pour one p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Son contrat avec Industrie Canada a pris fin en ao\u00fbt 2003 et n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9.\n[5] Avant que Mme Lavoie parte en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, son emploi \u00e9tait assujetti \u00e0 la politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor sur les emplois pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, laquelle stipulait que si une personne avait travaill\u00e9 pour un m\u00eame minist\u00e8re comme employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e9quivalant au total \u00e0 cinq ans sans interruption de service de plus de soixante jours, le minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait tenu de nommer cet employ\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de niveau \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui de son poste d'attache. Le temps pass\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 sans solde comptait alors dans le calcul des cinq ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives exig\u00e9es en vue de la nomination pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et les cong\u00e9s parentaux \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des cong\u00e9s sans solde.\n[6] La politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e a toutefois chang\u00e9 pendant que Mme Lavoie \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Les cinq ann\u00e9es requises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ramen\u00e9es \u00e0 trois, mais la dur\u00e9e d'un cong\u00e9 sans solde ne compte plus dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode cumulative de travail. Sans ce cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou cong\u00e9 parental d'une ann\u00e9e, Mme Lavoie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible \u00e0 un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e en vertu de la nouvelle politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor.\n[7] Le 10 juillet 2003, Mme Lavoie a port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne contre Industrie Canada, all\u00e9guant que la nouvelle politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Elle consid\u00e9rait aussi comme discriminatoire la fa\u00e7on dont Industrie Canada a tenu les concours pour les poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Elle demandait entre autres r\u00e9parations d'\u00eatre nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 Industrie Canada.\n[8] Le 20 octobre 2003, Mme Lavoie est parvenue \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement extrajudiciaire avec Industrie Canada, acceptant de retirer sa plainte en \u00e9change de certaines concessions. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, Industrie Canada lui a accord\u00e9 un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de programmeuse-analyste, avec effet le 17 novembre 2003. Mme Lavoie a accept\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement comme indemnisation int\u00e9grale et finale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les incidents \u00e9voqu\u00e9s dans sa plainte contre Industrie Canada, se r\u00e9servant toutefois le droit de porter plainte contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor relativement \u00e0 la nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 19 janvier 2004, Mme Lavoie a saisi la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d'une nouvelle plainte, contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor cette fois, all\u00e9guant le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de cette nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Bien que les cons\u00e9quences du caract\u00e8re discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la politique aient \u00e9t\u00e9 compens\u00e9es depuis, puisqu'elle est titulaire d'un poste de dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 Industrie Canada, Mme Lavoie dit souffrir encore d'autres cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives de la politique, pour lesquelles elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9e. Elle demande en outre au Tribunal d'obliger le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 modifier sa Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de sorte que la dur\u00e9e d'un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou d'un cong\u00e9 parental compte dans le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de travail cumulative.\nAnalyse [10] L'intim\u00e9 soutient que, en acceptant le r\u00e8glement d'octobre 2003 avec le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, la plaignante a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de r\u00e9clamer une r\u00e9paration individuelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations contenues dans la premi\u00e8re plainte. L'intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, puisque les all\u00e9gations et le redressement demand\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re plainte sont semblables, voire identiques, \u00e0 ceux de la seconde plainte, la plaignante ne peut pas r\u00e9clamer de r\u00e9paration individuelle dans le second cas. L'intim\u00e9 \u00e9voque par ailleurs le principe de l'indivisibilit\u00e9 de la Couronne.\n[11] L'intim\u00e9 fait valoir que m\u00eame si la plaignante s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e le droit de porter plainte contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il n'y a plus de litige actuel entre la plaignante et lui, puisque la plaignante n'a pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel dans la r\u00e9solution de la plainte. Sans cet int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel, soutient le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, la plainte n'a qu'un caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique et ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue par ce Tribunal. Enfin, l'intim\u00e9 soutient que d'autres tribunaux ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 statu\u00e9 sur les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la nature discriminatoire de la nouvelle politique et que l'intervention de ce Tribunal ne servirait pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[12] Pour les raisons que j'expose ci-dessous, j'estime que ces arguments sont sans fondement.\n[13] D'abord, la Loi n'exige pas qu'une plainte vise l'obtention d'une r\u00e9paration individuelle pour le plaignant. De fait, elle n'exige m\u00eame pas que le plaignant soit victime des pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es. Selon l'article 40, un individu ou un groupe d'individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission. De plus, l'article 53 conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, une r\u00e9paration qui, sans \u00eatre de nature personnelle, sert un objectif d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e9tendu dans les mesures correctives qu'elle offre. Il n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire que la plainte soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vue d'une r\u00e9paration individuelle pour que le Tribunal soit habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entendre.\n[14] Deuxi\u00e8mement, ce Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l'\u00e9volution de la situation apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une plainte ou le r\u00e8glement des int\u00e9r\u00eats personnels ne le prive pas de son pouvoir d'entendre une plainte (Parisien c. OC Transpo, 15 juillet 2002; TCDP, par. 42; et Kavanagh c. Canada (Service correctionnel) 31 ao\u00fbt 2001; TCDP, par. 7 \u00e0 9). Il s'agira alors de d\u00e9terminer quelle est la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e si la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[15] Selon le formulaire de plainte, il semble que Mme Lavoie r\u00e9clame des mesures de r\u00e9paration en sus de ce qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion. Il appartient au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si elle a droit ou non de le faire, si sa plainte se r\u00e9v\u00e8le fond\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement conclu avec Industrie Canada.\n[16] \u00c0 l'occasion du r\u00e8glement extrajudiciaire, Mme Lavoie s'est express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de porter plainte contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa nouvelle Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la politique n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9. Par ailleurs, je souscris aux arguments du conseiller juridique de Mme Lavoie, selon lesquels aucune d\u00e9cision ex\u00e9cutoire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 ce jour \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la question pr\u00e9cise dont Mme Lavoie a saisi ce Tribunal dans le cadre de sa plainte. Outre Braconnier c. Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, 2006 CRTFP 109, aucune des sources \u00e9voqu\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 ne traite de la politique vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Du reste, dans Braconnier, l'arbitre n'a pas examin\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re \u00e9ventuellement discriminatoire de la nouvelle politique puisqu'il a conclu qu'il n'avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour le faire en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique. Le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire ou non de la Politique sur l'emploi pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est donc un litige actuel qui reste \u00e0 trancher.\n[17] Pour toutes les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 demandant le rejet de la plainte parce que les questions soulev\u00e9es auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et seraient maintenant sans objet ne peut \u00eatre accueillie. La requ\u00eate est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Pour ce qui est de l'une des deux all\u00e9gations qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que Mme Lipp avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu discrimination prima facie. Cependant, l'intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9tabli qu'il s'agissait d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es.\n[2] Le Tribunal a conclu qu'il avait comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger les d\u00e9pens et il a ordonn\u00e9 que Postes Canada paye \u00e0 Mme Lipp \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9pens les frais raisonnables qu'elle a engag\u00e9s pour retenir les services d'une avocate, avant et pendant l'audience, en rapport avec les pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es dans la plainte. Le Tribunal a enjoint aux parties de tenter de s'entendre quant au montant. Cependant, il s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence sur la question au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 une entente.\n[3] Les parties ont avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elles n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 en venir \u00e0 une entente. Une audience sur la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence le 16 juillet 2007.\n[4] L'avocate de Mme Lipp a soutenu que l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne autorisait le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser Mme Lipp de la totalit\u00e9 des frais qu'elles avait engag\u00e9s. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pr\u00e9voit que, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire d'indemniser la victime des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\n[5] L'avocate de Mme Lipp a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, [2001] D.C.D.P. no 29, \u00e0 l'appui de son argument. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal avait statu\u00e9 que, lorsqu'une plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit tenter, dans la mesure du possible, de remettre la victime dans la position o\u00f9 elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si le tort ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit, sous r\u00e9serve des principes de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des dommages et de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes. Le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 qu'il est difficile de pr\u00e9tendre qu'une victime d'un acte discriminatoire est remise dans sa position ant\u00e9rieure si elle est incapable de demander le remboursement des frais qu'elle a engag\u00e9s pour faire entendre sa plainte.\n[6] L'avocate de Mme Lipp a soutenu que, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit indemniser Mme Lipp de la totalit\u00e9 des frais engag\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l'audience, quant \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de Mme Lipp au cours de l'audience et quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de la plaidoirie \u00e9crite. Tout cela a demand\u00e9 165 heures de travail et le montant de la facture s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 52 197,75 $. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, l'avocate de Mme Lipp a pr\u00e9tendu que le Tribunal devait taxer les d\u00e9pens en fonction du degr\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussite de la plaignante et en fonction du temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 chacune des all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es. Elle a avanc\u00e9 que, si on pr\u00e9sume que le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'analyse de chaque question en litige dans la d\u00e9cision correspond \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au temps qu'il a fallu pour pr\u00e9parer et pr\u00e9senter cette question \u00e0 l'audience, alors environ 84 p. 100 du temps consacr\u00e9 et des frais engag\u00e9s ont port\u00e9 sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, les d\u00e9pens raisonnables s'\u00e9l\u00e8veraient \u00e0 84 p. 100 du total des frais engag\u00e9s.\n[7] L'avocat de Postes Canada a soutenu que, selon la Loi et le libell\u00e9 de l'ordonnance en l'esp\u00e8ce, les frais pour lesquels une indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e ne peuvent se rapporter qu'aux all\u00e9gations d'acte discriminatoire qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es. Puisque toutes les all\u00e9gations en l'esp\u00e8ce n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es, il ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la totalit\u00e9 des frais engag\u00e9s.\n[8] L'avocat de Postes Canada a soutenu que la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans un litige civil veut que la partie ayant obtenu gain de cause se voit adjuger des d\u00e9pens partie-partie, lesquels sont tax\u00e9s selon le tarif \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente. Le montant de ces d\u00e9pens correspond g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 un montant qui se situe entre 30 et 50 p. 100 des frais engag\u00e9s. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que, si une victime d'agression sexuelle ne peut esp\u00e9rer se voir rembourser que de 30 \u00e0 50 p. 100 de ses frais devant un tribunal civil, rien ne justifie qu'une victime de discrimination s'attende \u00e0 se voir rembourser le montant total de ses frais.\n[9] L'avocat de Postes Canada a soutenu que le Tribunal doit prendre en compte le temps consacr\u00e9 aux all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es et indemniser la plaignante pour une proportion de 30 \u00e0 50 p. 100 de ce temps. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, 50 p. 100 du temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l'audience et \u00e0 l'audience a port\u00e9 sur les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es. Mme Lipp devrait donc se voir adjuger 50 p. 100 de ce montant, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 25 p. 100 du total des frais engag\u00e9s.\n[10] Il n'y a pas de r\u00e8gle absolue sur l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens raisonnables dans le cadre d'une plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[11] Dans Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans, 2005 TCDP 26, le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale relativement \u00e0 l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il utilisait les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales comme ligne directrice \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L'intim\u00e9 dans cette affaire avait demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a formul\u00e9 aucune observation quant au recours par le Tribunal \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode utilis\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re d'adjudication des d\u00e9pens, mais elle a conclu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en ne prenant pas ad\u00e9quatement en compte les offres de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans le cadre de cette affaire (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, 2006 CF 500, au paragraphe 25).\n[12] Dans la d\u00e9cision Mowat c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 49, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que rien dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Brooks n'exigeait que le Tribunal applique ni m\u00eame mentionne les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales lorsqu'il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 la taxation des d\u00e9pens. Dans Mowat, le Tribunal a choisi de ne pas renvoyer aux R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Il a plut\u00f4t pris en consid\u00e9ration trois sources : les services juridiques d\u00e9crits dans les relev\u00e9s de services d'avocats, le nombre de pi\u00e8ces et d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis \u00e0 l'audience en rapport avec les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel fond\u00e9es par rapport au nombre de pi\u00e8ces et d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis en rapport avec les all\u00e9gations rejet\u00e9es, le m\u00e9moire des d\u00e9pens soumis par chacune des parties, lesquels d\u00e9pens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s selon la formule des d\u00e9pens partie-partie.\n[13] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que la plaignante se voit rembourser, selon la formule des d\u00e9pens avocat-client, les frais raisonnablement engag\u00e9s, puisque la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'origine du litige, ainsi que sa conduite durant le litige, \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, scandaleuse et choquante qu'il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de rendre une telle ordonnance.\n[14] Dans la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure que j'ai rendue dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, j'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal n'avait pas l'autorisation en vertu de la Loi d'adjuger des d\u00e9pens avocat-client (Culic c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des Postes, 2007 TCDP 01, au paragraphe 318). En outre, j'ajouterais maintenant que, m\u00eame si le Tribunal avait comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des d\u00e9pens avocat-client, la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est loin d'\u00eatre aussi scandaleuse que celle de l'intim\u00e9 dans l'affaire Nkwazi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 de rendre une telle ordonnance dans les circonstances.\n[15] \u00c0 mon avis, le pouvoir, conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal par l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour les frais entra\u00een\u00e9s par l'acte discriminatoire signifie que l'indemnit\u00e9 doit se limiter \u00e0 la partie des frais pouvant \u00eatre allou\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du litige et au litige m\u00eame portant sur les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es.\n[16] Bien que je souscrive, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e0 l'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Mowat, je ne vois rien dans la loi qui oblige le Tribunal \u00e0 taxer les d\u00e9pens selon la formule des d\u00e9pens partie-partie. Au contraire, compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, il est bien possible qu'il ne convienne pas de rendre une telle ordonnance. Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, ce ne sont pas toutes les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui comportent des questions p\u00e9cuniaires. Les personnes se plaignant de s'\u00eatre vu refuser l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un service, par exemple, peuvent n'avoir subi aucune perte financi\u00e8re et, donc, peuvent n'avoir aucune possibilit\u00e9 de se voir accorder une r\u00e9paration p\u00e9cuniaire, sauf peut-\u00eatre un montant peu important pour pr\u00e9judice moral. La plupart des personnes qui d\u00e9posent des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne disposent de moyens tr\u00e8s modestes. En cons\u00e9quence, il se peut fort bien qu'elles h\u00e9siteront \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des plaintes si elles s'exposent \u00e0 des frais juridiques \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour lesquels elles ne recevront qu'une indemnisation peu \u00e9lev\u00e9e.\n[17] Ce fait est d'autant plus vrai que, au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a choisi de ne pas participer \u00e0 de nombreuses audiences devant le Tribunal. Les plaignants, dont la plupart n'ont absolument aucune formation juridique, doivent souvent se d\u00e9fendre contre les avocats tr\u00e8s exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que de nombreux plaignants choisissent de retenir les services d'un avocat.\n[18] En l'esp\u00e8ce, Mme Lipp a choisi de retenir les services d'une avocate la veille de l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, les frais engag\u00e9s pour la pr\u00e9paration pr\u00e9liminaire, la repr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 l'audience et le travail sur les observations \u00e9crites soumises au Tribunal le 21 ao\u00fbt 2006 sont peu \u00e9lev\u00e9s.\n[19] Mme Lipp a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver trois des cinq all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans sa plainte. Bien que je ne souscrive pas \u00e0 l'argument selon lequel 84 p. 100 du temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e0 la plaidoirie a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 aux all\u00e9gations jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es, je ne souscris pas non plus \u00e0 l'observation de l'intim\u00e9e selon laquelle ce pourcentage ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve qu'\u00e0 50 p. 100. Les trois all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es comportaient des circonstances factuelles complexes et n\u00e9cessitaient une analyse et une pr\u00e9sentation minutieuse. Cependant, je suis d'accord avec l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e pour affirmer que la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation, qui portait sur une question de discrimination syst\u00e9matique dans le cadre de l'\u00e9tablissement des horaires de travail chez Postes Canada et qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, a fait l'objet d'un d\u00e9bat beaucoup plus long lors de l'audience et lors de la plaidoirie finale que n'en convient l'avocate de Mme Lipp.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve et les observations de la partie plaignante, j'estime que le temps et les ressources consacr\u00e9s aux all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 65 p. 100 du temps et des ressources consacr\u00e9es dans l'ensemble. \u00c0 mon avis, il s'agit du pourcentage des d\u00e9penses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire. Mme Lipp a donc droit \u00e0 un montant s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 65 p. 100 des frais qu'elle a engag\u00e9s. Ce montant s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 33 928,54 $.\n[21] En vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(1)c), j'ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada de payer \u00e0 Mme Lipp la somme de 33 928,54 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les frais raisonnablement engag\u00e9s du fait de l'acte discriminatoire.\nKaren A.

La responsabilit\u00e9 du STTP\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce est Brian Rick Moore. Celui-ci travaille pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (SCP), au Centre de traitement du courrier de Vancouver (CTCV).\n[2] M. Moore a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, dat\u00e9e du 12 juillet 2001, contre la SCP, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il all\u00e8gue que cette derni\u00e8re a enfreint les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP). La d\u00e9ficience est le motif de discrimination illicite.\n[3] \u00c0 la requ\u00eate de la SCP, le Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte.\n[4] La plainte de M. Moore comporte deux volets. Premi\u00e8rement, il all\u00e8gue que la SCP a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en l'affectant de fa\u00e7on permanente \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et en le reclassifiant du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4, \u00e0 un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration inf\u00e9rieur, et ce, \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[5] Deuxi\u00e8mement, M. Moore soutient qu'en 1999 la SCP a adopt\u00e9 une politique qui faisait une distinction d\u00e9favorable entre les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience partielle et permanente (DPP) et les autres employ\u00e9s en restreignant les choix de quarts de travail offerts aux employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP. En raison de cela, M. Moore a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au quart de nuit (de minuit \u00e0 8 heures) en 2001 et 2002, ce qui lui a caus\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s physiques et affectives.\n[6] M. Moore r\u00e9clame des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour perte de salaire et autres avantages par suite de sa r\u00e9affectation et de sa reclassification, ainsi que pour les difficult\u00e9s qu'il a subies parce qu'il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 d'effectuer le quart de nuit. Et, pour les deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, il r\u00e9clame des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour la perte du droit d'\u00eatre exempt de toute discrimination.\nII. LA D\u00c9CISION [7] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Moore n'a pas justifi\u00e9 le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de sa revendication. Quant au second \u00e9l\u00e9ment, le Tribunal conclut que la SCP s'est effectivement livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire. Toutefois, M. Moore n'a pas \u00e9tabli que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de la pratique discriminatoire, il avait assez d'anciennet\u00e9 pour soumissionner avec succ\u00e8s le quart de jour ou celui de l'apr\u00e8s-midi. Le Tribunal n'a donc pas accord\u00e9 d'indemnit\u00e9.\nIII. LES FAITS\n(i) 1981-1994 [8] M. Moore est entr\u00e9 au service de la SCP en mai 1981, en tant que manutentionnaire du courrier. Son travail consistait \u00e0 trier les colis et les sacs de courrier pour les d\u00e9poser dans des conteneurs, \u00e0 r\u00e9partir le courrier et \u00e0 transporter les conteneurs de courrier jusqu'aux points de chargement.\n[9] En avril 1989, M. Moore s'est bless\u00e9 au dos en soulevant un lourd sac de courrier. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 pendant trois semaines environ et, quand il est revenu au travail, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions modifi\u00e9es.\n[10] Le retour au travail de M. Moore a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur une \u00e9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail (EAPT) \u00e9tablie par son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Taylor, en date du 7 novembre 1989. Dans cette EAPT, le Dr Taylor a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Moore \u00e9tait capable d'ex\u00e9cuter ses fonctions habituelles mais qu'il se pouvait que l'on doive rajuster de temps \u00e0 autre sa charge de travail \u00e0 cause de son probl\u00e8me de dos. Le 11 novembre 1989, M. Moore a repris ses fonctions compl\u00e8tes.\n[11] En mai 1990, la SCP a reclassifi\u00e9 tous les postes de manutentionnaire de courrier de niveau PO2 en les transformant en postes de r\u00e9partiteur de niveau PO5.\n[12] En septembre 1992, M. Moore s'est de nouveau bless\u00e9 au dos, pendant qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la maison. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'en novembre 1992, date \u00e0 laquelle il est revenu au travail sous un r\u00e9gime de fonctions modifi\u00e9es ne correspondant pas \u00e0 ses fonctions de niveau PO5.\n[13] Le Dr Taylor a rempli une autre EAPT pour M. Moore le 30 juin 1993. Dans cette \u00e9valuation, il a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Moore ne pouvait pas rester debout plus de 15 minutes, qu'il devait \u00e9viter toute flexion ou torsion du corps et qu'il ne pouvait pas soulever de charges de plus de 25 livres. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi que M. Moore \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 revenir au travail \u00e0 temps plein mais qu'il devait exercer des fonctions modifi\u00e9es qui tenaient compte de ces restrictions.\n[14] En ao\u00fbt 1993, cherchant \u00e0 mieux comprendre l'aptitude au travail de M. Moore, le m\u00e9decin consultant de la SCP, le Dr Haakonson, a demand\u00e9 au Dr Taylor des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[15] Le Dr Taylor a fourni les renseignements demand\u00e9s le 14 ao\u00fbt 1993. Selon son \u00e9valuation, M. Moore avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de probl\u00e8mes au bas du dos et \u00e9tait enclin \u00e0 se blesser. Il a aussi d\u00e9crit ce qu'il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre les restrictions de travail de M. Moore.\n[16] Ces renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis au Dr Haakonson. Ce dernier a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale du Dr Taylor et a conclu qu'il fallait d\u00e9signer M. Moore comme \u00e9tant atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience partielle et permanente, avec les restrictions de travail suivantes :\nposition debout - pas plus de 30 minutes \u00e0 la fois; flexion et torsion - doit \u00e9viter de se pencher vers l'avant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e; poids soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de la taille - maximum de 55 livres; poids soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 la hauteur de la t\u00eate - maximum de 55 livres; charge port\u00e9e - maximum de 55 livres.\nLe 26 ao\u00fbt 1993, il a inform\u00e9 le directeur, Op\u00e9rations du centre, des restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Moore et a recommand\u00e9 que ce dernier soit affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail permanent qui tient compte de ces restrictions. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Moore pour l'informer de la d\u00e9signation et des restrictions et lui dire aussi que l'on se servirait des restrictions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es pour d\u00e9terminer son poste.\nA. Fonctions modifi\u00e9es temporaires \/ Restrictions pour DDP [17] Il existe \u00e0 la SCP deux cat\u00e9gories d'employ\u00e9s victimes d'un accident de travail : ceux qui sont cens\u00e9s se r\u00e9tablir dans un court laps de temps et que l'on affecte \u00e0 des fonctions modifi\u00e9es temporaires, et ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience partielle et permanente (DPP) et que l'on affecte \u00e0 des fonctions qui tiennent compte des restrictions pour DPP pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es.\n[18] Les employ\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 des fonctions modifi\u00e9es temporaires sont tenus de pr\u00e9senter un billet de leur m\u00e9decin. Si ce billet est suffisant, ils sont affect\u00e9s par leur superviseur aux fonctions modifi\u00e9es appropri\u00e9es. Si la SCP a besoin de plus de renseignements, le superviseur demande que l'employ\u00e9 obtienne un billet plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9, habituellement une EAPT indiquant la nature de sa l\u00e9sion et donnant une estimation du temps pendant lequel il est tenu d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions modifi\u00e9es.\n[19] La plupart des fonctions modifi\u00e9es temporaires sont d'une dur\u00e9e de deux \u00e0 trois mois, mais elles peuvent \u00eatre prolong\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 six mois. Dans un tel cas, une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale suppl\u00e9mentaire est exig\u00e9e.\n[20] Si la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions modifi\u00e9es dure plus de six mois, l'affaire est soumise aux Services de sant\u00e9 au travail (SST) de la SCP. Le m\u00e9decin consultant de la SCP demande des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux additionnels et les \u00e9tudie. La prolongation peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e ou l'employ\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme atteint d'une DPP si les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux le justifient.\n[21] Lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est cat\u00e9goris\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant atteint d'une DPP, le m\u00e9decin consultant de la SCP fournit au directeur, Op\u00e9rations du centre, un document sommaire exposant les restrictions pour DPP. Il transmet ce document au gestionnaire ou au superviseur de l'employ\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que ce dernier soit affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions qui tiennent compte des restrictions.\n[22] Les restrictions pour DPP sont permanentes, \u00e0 moins de recevoir de nouveaux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Si un employ\u00e9 atteint d'une DPP produit de nouveaux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, ces derniers sont remis au m\u00e9decin consultant de la SCP, qui d\u00e9cide ensuite s'il convient de modifier ou de supprimer les restrictions. Dans l'affirmative, un nouveau sommaire est \u00e9tabli.\n[23] En octobre 1993, M. Moore a rencontr\u00e9 son superviseur et son gestionnaire afin de discuter de son affectation \u00e0 un poste de niveau PO5 dans les limites de ses restrictions pour DPP. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au fonctionnement de mat\u00e9riel motoris\u00e9 (chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 fourches), soit l'une des fonctions de niveau PO5 faisant partie des fonctions \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter par rotation. M. Moore devait faire fonctionner le chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 fourches, \u00e0 l'exclusion de toutes les autres fonctions de niveau PO5 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par rotation.\n[24] M. Moore a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 fourches d'octobre 1993 jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1994. Cela, semble-t-il, a suscit\u00e9 beaucoup de ressentiment chez ses coll\u00e8gues de travail, qui estimaient qu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'un traitement sp\u00e9cial. Ils croyaient que s'il \u00e9tait suffisamment apte pour travailler au quai de r\u00e9partition, il fallait qu'il ex\u00e9cute une plus grande part des fonctions de niveau PO5 \u00e0 effectuer par rotation. Certains de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail en ont parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son gestionnaire et ont demand\u00e9 que ce dernier soit affect\u00e9 ailleurs.\n[25] En d\u00e9cembre 1994, \u00e0 cause de ces plaintes, le superviseur de M. Moore a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier de cesser d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions relatives \u00e0 l'utilisation des chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs \u00e0 fourches. Il a accept\u00e9 de le faire de son plein gr\u00e9 afin d'att\u00e9nuer les tensions et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au centre du tri pr\u00e9liminaire destin\u00e9 aux facteurs (TPF), qui fait partie de la Section du tri manuel.\n(i) 1995-1998 [26] M. Moore a travaill\u00e9 au centre du TPF pendant six semaines environ, mais il a estim\u00e9 qu'on ne lui donnait pas l'occasion de se servir du mat\u00e9riel motoris\u00e9 qui se trouvait \u00e0 cet endroit. Il a donc demand\u00e9 de retourner au quai de r\u00e9partition.\n[27] Le superviseur de M. Moore a accept\u00e9 et celui-ci a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de rotation de niveau PO5 au d\u00e9but de 1995, sous un r\u00e9gime de fonctions modifi\u00e9es. La rotation des fonctions de niveau PO5, au quai de r\u00e9partition, \u00e9tait la suivante :\nChariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur - North : Chargement et d\u00e9chargement des remorques (annexe)\nChariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur - Well : D\u00e9chargement des camions et transport du courrier entre le quai de r\u00e9ception et le quai de r\u00e9partition\nChariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur - Rover : Transport et organisation des conteneurs de courrier sur le quai de r\u00e9partition\nChariot Courrier a\u00e9rien : Chargement et d\u00e9chargement des remorques de courrier a\u00e9rien en provenance et \u00e0 destination de l'a\u00e9roport\nChariot Courrier urbain : Chargement des camions de 5 tonnes et organisation des monoteneurs et du courrier au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e\nBasculeur Courrier urbain : D\u00e9p\u00f4t des monoteneurs de courrier urbain dans la chute\nBasculeur Courrier d'acheminement : D\u00e9p\u00f4t des monoteneurs de courrier d'acheminement sur la courroie transporteuse\nChariot \u00e0 palettes de transport : Transport du courrier se trouvant au quai de r\u00e9partition, principalement entre le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e et les 3e et 4e \u00e9tages, par ascenseur\nChariot \u00e0 palettes 3e \u00e9tage : Transport du courrier d'acheminement au 3e \u00e9tage, et entre le 3e et le 2e \u00e9tage, par ascenseur.\nChariot \u00e0 palettes 4e \u00e9tage : Transport des monoteneurs de courrier au 4e \u00e9tage\nTri pr\u00e9liminaire pour facteurs : Tri manuel des sacs et des liasses de courrier se trouvant dans les monoteneurs\nNettoyage du quai : Essentiellement, tri du courrier interne, international et am\u00e9ricain lourd en provenance de l'a\u00e9roport\nPostes de rel\u00e8ve : Rel\u00e8ve pour tout employ\u00e9 absent (jour de cong\u00e9 ordinaire, cong\u00e9 de maladie, cong\u00e9 annuel, etc.)\nLa liste de rotation \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie au moins six semaines \u00e0 l'avance, et chaque employ\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutait par rotation les fonctions qui y \u00e9taient indiqu\u00e9es.\n[28] M. Moore a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le seul travail qu'il ne pouvait pas faire \u00e9tait le nettoyage du quai. Il a dit qu'il \u00e9tait capable d'effectuer les autres fonctions inscrites, en prenant parfois ses propres mesures d'adaptation, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[29] Au quai de r\u00e9partition, les employ\u00e9s avaient l'habitude d'\u00e9changer certaines fonctions. Habituellement, M. Moore \u00e9tait capable d'\u00e9changer avec un coll\u00e8gue de travail le travail de nettoyage du quai pour une autre t\u00e2che. S'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de le faire, ce qui arrivait \u00e0 l'occasion, M. Moore en informait son surveillant, qui le dispensait de cette t\u00e2che.\n[30] M. Moore a effectu\u00e9 les fonctions de rotation de niveau PO5 entre le d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 1994 et le d\u00e9but du mois de juin 1998. Le 14 juin de cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, il a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie pour cause de douleurs au dos. Il a consult\u00e9 le Dr Taylor le 24 juin 1998, et ce dernier a \u00e9tabli une autre EAPT. Le Dr Taylor a indiqu\u00e9 pour certaines activit\u00e9s (marcher, soulever, porter, etc.) des restrictions qui \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrites en ao\u00fbt 1993. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Moore pouvait retourner au travail le 29 juin, et reprendre ses fonctions de niveau PO5 deux ou trois mois plus tard.\n[31] M. Moore est effectivement revenu au travail le 29 juin, mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel, Tri primaire court et long (CL), l'un des emplois les plus s\u00e9dentaires au CTCV. Il y est rest\u00e9 environ deux semaines et a ensuite pris cinq semaines de vacances; il est revenu au travail le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998, et a repris ses fonctions de niveau PO5 ordinaires.\n[32] Cependant, le 24 septembre 1998, il a pris de nouveau un cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 cause de douleurs au dos. Il est revenu au travail le 29 septembre et a travaill\u00e9 pendant une heure environ au quai de r\u00e9partition, mais il n'a pas pu continuer \u00e0 cause de ses douleurs au dos. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 une fois de plus au centre de tri primaire CL.\n[33] \u00c0 la demande de la SCP, M. Moore a obtenu une autre EAPT du Dr Taylor, le 6 octobre 1998. Dans cette \u00e9valuation, le Dr Taylor a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Moore ne devait pas se servir du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 fourches car les secousses aggraveraient ses douleurs au dos. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Moore pourrait reprendre la rotation des fonctions de niveau PO5, en tenant compte de ses limites, dans un d\u00e9lai de 15 \u00e0 28 jours.\n(ii) Notes de service des Services de sant\u00e9 au travail [34] \u00c0 la suite de l'EAPT du 24 juin 1998 du Dr Taylor, Sharon Harlos, l'infirmi\u00e8re charg\u00e9e des services de sant\u00e9 au travail (SST), a envoy\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de notes de service \u00e0 divers surintendants entre les mois de juin et de novembre 1998. Dans sa note de service du 30 juin 1998, Mme Harlos a demand\u00e9 si M. Moore \u00e9tait revenu au travail et on l'a inform\u00e9e que ce dernier \u00e9tait revenu le 29 juin 1998 et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au centre de tri primaire CL.\n[35] Le 22 juillet 1998, l'infirmi\u00e8re charg\u00e9e des SST a demand\u00e9 que l'on fasse le point sur la situation de M. Moore, et on lui a dit que ce dernier \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 annuel pour un mois.\n[36] Dans une note de service dat\u00e9e du 25 septembre 1998 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Harlos, Andrew Langdon, surintendant de secteur, a dit que M. Moore avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 du 14 au 25 juin, qu'il avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 des fonctions modifi\u00e9es au centre de tri primaire CL jusqu'au 13 juillet, date \u00e0 laquelle il avait pris un cong\u00e9 annuel. Le 17 ao\u00fbt 1998, il avait repris ses fonctions de niveau PO5.\n[37] M. Langdon a signal\u00e9 que M. Moore avait pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie le 24 septembre \u00e0 cause de ses probl\u00e8mes de dos et qu'il \u00e9tait toujours en cong\u00e9 le 25 septembre. Il a ajout\u00e9 que M. Moore lui avait dit que s'il revenait, il allait avoir besoin d'un r\u00e9gime de travail modifi\u00e9 pendant un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9. M. Langdon a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 aux SST que l'on demande \u00e0 M. Moore d'obtenir une EAPT s'il n'\u00e9tait pas capable de revenir au travail. Et peut-\u00eatre, vu l'\u00e9tat de M. Moore, la SCP devrait envisager de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9affectation permanente.\n[38] M. Langdon a \u00e9galement eu un entretien avec M. Moore au d\u00e9but d'octobre 1998, au sujet du fait de l'affecter de fa\u00e7on permanente \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel, \u00e0 cause de ses limites. M. Moore s'est souvenu de cet entretien. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Langdon lui avait demand\u00e9 si cela l'int\u00e9resserait d'\u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et de devenir PO4. M. Moore lui avait r\u00e9pondu que non, mais que s'il changeait d'id\u00e9e, il le lui ferait savoir.\n[39] Le 2 novembre 1998, Mme Harlos a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Martin M. Osborne, surintendant de secteur, pour demander si M. Moore ex\u00e9cutait toutes les fonctions que ses restrictions pour DPP lui permettaient d'accomplir. Sinon, il serait n\u00e9cessaire de le r\u00e9\u00e9valuer. M. Osborne a r\u00e9pondu que M. Moore n'avait pas repris ses fonctions de niveau PO5.\n[40] Cet \u00e9change a men\u00e9 \u00e0 l'EAPT de M. Moore du 9 novembre 1998, dans laquelle le Dr Taylor a confirm\u00e9 les restrictions qu'il avait recommand\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement et a ajout\u00e9 que M. Moore devait \u00e9viter de se servir du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 fourches et du chariot \u00e0 palettes. Si c'\u00e9tait le cas, cela emp\u00eacherait M. Moore d'accomplir plus de la moiti\u00e9 des fonctions de niveau PO5.\n[41] M. Moore a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la fin de 1999 il se sentait toujours incapable de reprendre ses fonctions de niveau PO5. Il a continu\u00e9 de consulter le Dr Taylor pour ses probl\u00e8mes de dos en 2002, 2003, 2004 et 2005. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi qu'en raison de ses vives douleurs au dos, le Dr Taylor l'avait envoy\u00e9 voir un physioth\u00e9rapeute, qui l'avait soign\u00e9 entre le mois de d\u00e9cembre 2000 et l'ann\u00e9e 2003. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, il avait eu mal au dos m\u00eame s'il accomplissait l'une des t\u00e2ches les plus s\u00e9dentaires au CTCV.\nB. Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'affectation permanente de M. Moore au centre de tri primaire CL et au niveau PO4 [42] En 1998, Neil McClure \u00e9tait gestionnaire int\u00e9rimaire, Contr\u00f4le de la production et rapports. Son travail consistait \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 ce que le CTCV respecte les engagements pris envers la client\u00e8le sur le plan des livraisons. Ses nombreuses responsabilit\u00e9s englobaient les calendriers de travail, les cong\u00e9s annuels, les vacances, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances, l'ordonnancement, la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les consultations avec le STTP en rapport avec ces questions.\n[43] \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, la SCP avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter ses engagements envers la client\u00e8le. Elle avait d\u00fb faire appel \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s occasionnels et pay\u00e9 du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire pour traiter le courrier. En d\u00e9ambulant dans le centre, M. McClure avait constat\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 il n'y avait que quatre ou cinq personnes qui travaillaient \u00e0 la Section des colis urbains pendant le quart de jour, mais que le calendrier de travail indiquait 25 postes.\n[44] Quand M. McClure a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il y avait si peu de gens qui travaillaient, on lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il y avait des employ\u00e9s qui avaient soumissionn\u00e9 un poste \u00e0 la Section des colis urbains mais que ces derniers n'\u00e9taient pas en mesure d'effectuer les fonctions pr\u00e9vues. Ils avaient donc \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s ailleurs, au centre de tri primaire CL, pour la plupart d'entre eux. Cela avait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 M. McClure car la SCP d\u00e9pensait beaucoup d'argent de plus en temps suppl\u00e9mentaire et en employ\u00e9s occasionnels afin de pouvoir respecter ses engagements envers la client\u00e8le.\n(i) La soumission relative aux quarts de travail de 1999 [45] La convention collective conclue entre la SCP et le STTP pr\u00e9voyait que ce dernier pouvait demander que l'on organise, au sujet des quarts de travail, une soumission annuelle pour certains groupes d'employ\u00e9s du CTCV. Le processus de soumission a eu lieu entre les mois de septembre et de novembre pour des affectations d\u00e9butant le deuxi\u00e8me dimanche de l'ann\u00e9e civile suivante.\n[46] La convention collective pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement que la SCP et le STTP se consulteraient au sujet de changements apport\u00e9s au r\u00e9gime de travail et au sujet d'autres questions. En ao\u00fbt 1998, le STTP a demand\u00e9 la tenue d'un processus de soumission pour les quarts de travail et a inform\u00e9 la SCP qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 tenir des consultations au sujet de ses propositions de dotation en personnel.\n[47] M. McClure a tout d'abord fait \u00e9tat de ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet du d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre de l'effectif, notamment dans le quart de jour, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance de consultation tenue avec le STTP le 2 octobre 1998. Il a fait remarquer que le CTCV comptait 118 employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP. Parmi ces derniers, environ 43 p. 100 \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s au quart du soir (de 16 heures \u00e0 minuit).\n[48] M. McClure a fait \u00e9tat de deux solutions de rechange auxquelles la SCP songeait. La premi\u00e8re permettrait aux employ\u00e9s de pr\u00e9senter une soumission uniquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des sections qui pouvaient les accueillir. L'autre r\u00e9partirait les employ\u00e9s soumis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime de fonctions modifi\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale, parmi les trois quarts de travail.\n[49] Ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre \u00e9tait imputable aux proc\u00e9dures de soumission en vigueur. Les employ\u00e9s soumissionnaient pour un centre de travail qui comportait des t\u00e2ches difficiles. Ils le faisaient en sachant qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas capables d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions prescrites et qu'il faudrait les installer ailleurs, par exemple, \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel, o\u00f9 le travail est plus facile.\n[50] Ils avaient acquis assez d'anciennet\u00e9 dans ce centre de travail pour soumissionner avec succ\u00e8s le quart qu'ils privil\u00e9giaient, habituellement le quart no 2 ou no 3. Lorsque des mesures d'adaptation \u00e9taient prises \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, ils int\u00e9graient leur poste en amenant avec eux leur soumission.\n[51] Cela avait un double effet : trop d'employ\u00e9s dans un centre de travail particulier et pas assez dans un autre. Deuxi\u00e8mement, cela cr\u00e9ait une certaine animosit\u00e9 chez les employ\u00e9s physiquement aptes qui travaillaient dans le centre de travail o\u00f9 \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s les employ\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de mesures d'adaptation et qui avaient plus d'anciennet\u00e9.\n[52] \u00c0 la s\u00e9ance de consultation suivante, tenue le 21 octobre 1998, le STTP a convenu que les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP ne pouvaient pas soumissionner pour une section dans laquelle il \u00e9tait impossible de prendre pour eux des mesures d'adaptation. Mais le STTP a voulu revoir la situation pour chacun de ces employ\u00e9s. La SCP a convenu de remettre au STTP une liste des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP qui montrerait pour quels centres ces derniers avaient soumissionn\u00e9 et dans lesquels ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient de mesures d'adaptation.\n[53] La question des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP et des soumissions relatives aux quarts de travail a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet d'une discussion \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de consultation du 28 octobre 1998. La SCP a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait environ 120 employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP. Environ la moiti\u00e9 d'entre eux avaient soumissionn\u00e9 un poste pour lequel on ne pouvait prendre pour eux aucune mesure d'adaptation et ils avaient demand\u00e9 qu'on les affecte \u00e0 un autre secteur.\n[54] Le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1998, la SCP a remis au STTP une liste des employ\u00e9s pour lesquels il \u00e9tait impossible de prendre des mesures d'adaptation dans le lieu de travail pour lequel ils avaient soumissionn\u00e9. Le nom de M. Moore figurait sur cette liste, et celle-ci montrait que le r\u00e9sultat de sa soumission la plus r\u00e9cente \u00e9tait le quai de r\u00e9partition et le quart de travail no 3 et que la mesure d'adaptation prise \u00e0 son endroit \u00e9tait le centre de tri primaire CL et le quart de travail no 3.\n[55] \u00c0 la s\u00e9ance de consultation suivante, tenue le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1998, le STTP a demand\u00e9 - et la SCP y a souscrit - que la dotation des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP demeure la m\u00eame pour 1999 parce que ces derniers n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment inform\u00e9s de la proposition de la SCP de modifier les proc\u00e9dures de soumission relatives aux quarts de travail. Cependant, pour la soumission relative aux quarts de travail de 2000, les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP ne pourraient soumissionner que pour les secteurs dans lesquels il serait possible de prendre des mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 leur endroit.\n(ii) Le protocole d'entente conclu en 1999 entre la SCP et le STTP [56] \u00c0 la suite des consultations tenues en 1998, la SCP et le STTP ont conclu un protocole d'entente dat\u00e9 du 8 janvier 1999. Ce dernier comportait une s\u00e9rie de proc\u00e9dures concernant la prise de mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP, apr\u00e8s application du paragraphe 54.02 de la convention collective.\n[57] Aux termes du protocole d'entente, la SCP et le STTP devaient se consulter au sujet du placement appropri\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP \u00e0 un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait possible de prendre \u00e0 leur endroit des mesures d'adaptation. Les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme report\u00e9s et comme faisant partie du calendrier de travail auquel ils \u00e9taient affect\u00e9s et ils seraient affect\u00e9s \u00e0 n'importe quel poste vacant dans le cadre du calendrier de travail.\n[58] Au moment de leur affectation, les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP seraient \u00e0 salaire bloqu\u00e9 dans le cadre de leur calendrier de travail. Cela signifiait que si l'on prenait des mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un employ\u00e9 atteint d'une DPP et qu'on l'affectait \u00e0 un poste assorti d'un taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration inf\u00e9rieur, il conserverait son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ant\u00e9rieur jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le taux applicable \u00e0 son poste adapt\u00e9 atteigne le m\u00eame niveau. Cette mesure avait pour but de garantir que les employ\u00e9s d'une DPP ne subiraient aucune perte de salaire \u00e0 cause des mesures d'adaptation.\n[59] Quant aux futures soumissions, les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP ne soumissionneraient en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du calendrier de travail pour lequel ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient de mesures d'adaptation. Ces employ\u00e9s pourraient demander que l'on r\u00e9\u00e9value leur situation si leurs limites physiques venaient \u00e0 changer.\n[60] La prise de mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience ou victimes d'un accident du travail \u00e9tait un probl\u00e8me avec lequel la SCP et le STTP \u00e9taient constamment aux prises. Seule la SCP pouvait d\u00e9cider \u00e0 quel endroit un employ\u00e9 atteint d'une DPP pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d'adaptation. Le STTP ne pouvait pas s'opposer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision; il pouvait uniquement pr\u00e9senter un grief s'il n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord.\n[61] Le STTP voulait un processus qui lui permettrait de consulter la SCP et de prendre part aux d\u00e9cisions concernant les mesures d'adaptation prises \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP. Le protocole d'entente a permis au STTP de participer au processus de prise de mesures d'adaptation.\n(iii) Le processus des soumissions relatives aux quarts de travail de 2000 [62] Le 29 septembre 1999, la SCP a \u00e9crit au STTP au sujet de sa proposition concernant les soumissions relatives aux quarts de travail de 2000. Les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 un secteur particulier \u00e0 la suite de la soumission de l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente resteraient au m\u00eame endroit, sauf si leur situation venaient \u00e0 changer. Et c'\u00e9tait leur anciennet\u00e9 qui d\u00e9terminerait quel serait leur quart de travail. Tous les autres employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP ne soumissionneraient que pour un secteur dans lequel des mesures d'adaptation pouvaient \u00eatre prises, et c'\u00e9tait l'anciennet\u00e9 qui primerait.\n[63] Un certain nombre de consultations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues \u00e0 l'automne de 1999, et la derni\u00e8re a eu lieu le 2 novembre 1999. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, la SCP avait remis au STTP une liste \u00e0 jour des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP et de leurs restrictions connexes, en rapport avec la soumission annuelle. La liste comptait 50 personnes et, pour chacune, elle indiquait les mesures qu'il fallait prendre \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. M. Moore \u00e9tait inscrit comme faisant l'objet de mesures d'adaptation au sein du centre de tri primaire CL, et son salaire \u00e9tait bloqu\u00e9.\n[64] La SCP allait informer ces employ\u00e9s en leur envoyant une lettre qui indiquerait leur situation par rapport \u00e0 leur DPP, leurs limites et les centres pour lesquels ils seraient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 soumissionner.\n[65] La nouvelle proc\u00e9dure de soumission relative aux quarts de travail pour 2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s par le STTP et par la SCP. Dans son bulletin du 3 novembre 1999, le STTP a annonc\u00e9 que la SCP et lui avaient pass\u00e9 un temps consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 se consulter, et qu'ils avaient examin\u00e9 quelles mesures d'adaptation prendre \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une d\u00e9ficience. Le STTP allait communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP pour confirmer leur placement ou les restrictions impos\u00e9es aux soumissions, en fonction de leurs limites.\n[66] Agissant au nom de la SCP, M. McClure a envoy\u00e9 une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 novembre 1999 \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s du CTCV pour d\u00e9crire les changements apport\u00e9s au processus de soumission concernant les quarts de travail pour 2000. Il a \u00e9galement envoy\u00e9 une lettre aux diff\u00e9rents employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP pour les aviser de leur situation.\n[67] M. McClure a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Moore une lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 novembre 1999 dans laquelle il a inform\u00e9 ce dernier qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 titre permanent \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel puisqu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de mesures d'adaptation dans ce secteur. Les choix de quarts de travail que ce dernier avait faits \u00e9taient le centre de tri primaire et les quarts de travail no 1, no 2 ou no 3. M. McClure a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 M. Moore que son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration PO5 \u00e9tait bloqu\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le taux PO5 atteigne le taux PO4.\n[68] Quant \u00e0 la raison pour laquelle M. Moore \u00e9tait r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 titre permanent, M. McClure a dit que la SCP avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les limites dues \u00e0 sa DPP l'emp\u00eachaient d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions de niveau PO5 au quai de r\u00e9partition. En outre, M. Moore travaillait au centre de tri primaire CL depuis septembre 1998.\n[69] Il est \u00e9vident que le STTP n'a pas pris part \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'affecter M. Moore au centre de tri primaire CL en septembre 1998. Il est \u00e9vident aussi que m\u00eame si le STTP a eu son mot \u00e0 dire lors de la consultation concernant les mesures d'adaptation destin\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP, il n'a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 conjointement avec la SCP d'affecter \u00e0 titre permanent M. Moore \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et de le reclassifier du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4.\nC. Les griefs de M. Moore [70] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de M. McClure dat\u00e9e du 15 novembre 1999, M. Moore a communiqu\u00e9 avec le STTP et a rempli un formulaire de grief interne dans lequel il a soutenu que l'on avait enfreint les droits que lui conf\u00e9rait la convention collective. C'\u00e9tait parce qu'il \u00e9tait atteint d'une DPP que la SCP l'avait reclassifi\u00e9 du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4 sans son consentement, en l'affectant \u00e0 titre permanent \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel. Il a conclu son grief en disant ceci : [traduction] \u00c0 ce moment-ci, je ne suis pas s\u00fbr de pouvoir r\u00e9int\u00e9grer les fonctions modifi\u00e9es que j'exer\u00e7ais auparavant au quai de r\u00e9partition, mais j'aimerais avoir le droit d'exercer mes choix plus tard.\n[71] Le STTP a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief officiel dat\u00e9 du 5 janvier 2000, dans lequel il a indiqu\u00e9 que la SCP, dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 novembre 1999, avait reclassifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tort M. Moore du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4 et qu'elle avait chang\u00e9 \u00e0 tort son statut. Le redressement que sollicitait le STTP \u00e9tait que M. Moore conserve son statut de PO5 et soit r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 en tant que PO5.\n[72] Dans la lettre qu'il a envoy\u00e9e le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2000 \u00e0 M. Moore, M. McClure a officiellement confirm\u00e9 que ce dernier \u00e9tait r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 titre permanent au centre de tri primaire CL et que son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration serait bloqu\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il atteigne le taux applicable au niveau PO4.\n[73] Le STTP a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un second grief au nom de M. Moore, en date du 19 mai 2000. Dans ce grief, le STTP a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la SCP avait r\u00e9duit \u00e0 tort le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Moore du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4. La SCP se devait d'indemniser M. Moore de la totalit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et des avantages perdus et de maintenir le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Moore au niveau existant.\n[74] Les griefs ont tous deux \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite d'une entente de r\u00e8glement conclue entre le STTP et la SCP : le grief du 5 janvier 2000, le 13 juin 2003, et le grief du 19 mai 2000, le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2001.\n[75] Dans son formulaire de grief interne ainsi que dans les deux griefs du STTP, l'affectation de M. Moore au centre de tri primaire CL n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. M. Moore semblait satisfait de travailler au niveau PO4 et de toucher le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration applicable au niveau PO5. Ce n'est que lorsque son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 bloqu\u00e9 qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'inqui\u00e9ter. Mais son inqui\u00e9tude et celle du STTP avaient trait au changement de son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et non \u00e0 son affectation au centre de tri primaire CL.\n[76] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Ken Mooney \u00e9tait l'agent des griefs du STTP et il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 des griefs et des arbitrages. Selon M. Mooney, le STTP a retir\u00e9 les griefs parce qu'il avait conclu que l'on n'y ferait pas droit en arbitrage.\n[77] Selon certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments jurisprudentiels en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 n'est pas capable d'accomplir les fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 un niveau de classification sup\u00e9rieur, l'employeur n'a pas \u00e0 payer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce niveau de classification. M. Mooney a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait express\u00e9ment parl\u00e9 de ces d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage avec M. Moore. Quand le STTP a retir\u00e9 les griefs de M. Moore en 2001 et en 2003, il s'\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es depuis que M. Moore avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 les fonctions de niveau PO5. En outre, M. Moore n'avait pas fourni de preuves m\u00e9dicales \u00e0 jour montrant qu'il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 revenir travailler en tant que PO5.\nD. Les soumissions relatives aux quarts de travail de 2000 et 2001 - Affectation de M. Moore au quart de nuit [78] Le formulaire de soumission de M. Moore pour 2000 limitait son choix \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et aux quarts de travail no 1, no 2 ou no 3. Il avait toujours effectu\u00e9 le quart de travail no 3 \u00e0 titre de PO5, ainsi qu'\u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 l'employeur l'avait affect\u00e9 au centre de tri primaire CL en septembre 1998.\n[79] Pour la soumission relative aux quarts de travail de 2000, il y avait 292 postes disponibles au sein de la Section du tri manuel, r\u00e9partis entre quatre centres\/calendriers de travail : Tri primaire (Court\/Long et Courrier surdimensionn\u00e9, ou CL et CS), Machine \u00e0 trier les grands objets plats, ou MTGOP, Tri pr\u00e9liminaire par itin\u00e9raire de facteur, ou TPIF, et Tri final urbain, ou TFU. Parmi ces quatre centres\/calendriers, M. Moore ne pouvait soumissionner que pour 158 postes, soit 54 p. 100 de la totalit\u00e9 des postes. Les autres employ\u00e9s de la Section du tri manuel pouvaient soumissionner pour la totalit\u00e9 des postes. Malgr\u00e9 les limites, M. Moore a soumissionn\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s pour le quart de travail qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait, celui de l'apr\u00e8s-midi.\n[80] En 2001, la SCP a scind\u00e9 la Section du tri manuel en deux centres de travail : CL et CS (sauf pour le quart de travail no 2, o\u00f9 ces centres sont rest\u00e9s combin\u00e9s). La soumission relative aux quarts de travail de M. Moore a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e au Tri primaire CL et aux quarts de travail no 1 et no 3, ainsi qu'au Tri manuel et au quart de travail no 2.\n[81] Pour la soumission relative aux quarts de travail de 2001, la Section du tri manuel comportait 301 postes, mais le nombre de ceux auxquels M. Moore avait acc\u00e8s \u00e9tait de 119, soit 40 p. 100 de la totalit\u00e9 des postes. Cela \u00e9tait d\u00fb au fait que les centres CL et CS repr\u00e9sentaient maintenant deux calendriers de travail distincts.\n[82] M. Moore n'avait pas l'anciennet\u00e9 requise pour acc\u00e9der au quart de travail no 2 ou no 3 et, de ce fait, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 refoul\u00e9 du quart de travail no 3 au quart de travail no 1 (le quart de nuit) pour 2001.\n[83] Pour M. Moore, les r\u00e9sultats de sa soumission de 2002 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les m\u00eames. En 2002, la Section du tri manuel comptait 278 postes. M. Moore n'avait acc\u00e8s qu'\u00e0 84 de ces postes, soit 30 p. 100 de la totalit\u00e9 des postes. L\u00e0 encore, pour cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, il s'est retrouv\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au quart de nuit.\n[84] En 2003, la SCP a restructur\u00e9 le CTCV. Un certain nombre de centres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 combin\u00e9s \u00e0 celui du tri primaire CL, de sorte que le nombre de postes pour lesquels M. Moore pouvait soumissionner a augment\u00e9. Cela lui a permis d'obtenir le quart de travail de son choix. C'est ainsi qu'en janvier 2003, M. Moore a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le centre de tri primaire CL et le quart de travail no 3, o\u00f9 il se trouve aujourd'hui.\nE. M. Moore a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [85] Dans une affaire relative aux droits de la personne soumise au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique raisonnable de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e ne devrait pas entrer en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9cision portant sur le fait de savoir si la partie plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536; ainsi que Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 2004; Dhanjal c. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6.)\n[86] Dans sa plainte, M. Moore all\u00e8gue que la SCP a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en omettant de prendre en compte sa d\u00e9ficience. Je ne saurais trop insister sur le fait que le d\u00e9faut de prendre une mesure d'adaptation n'est ni un motif de distinction illicite ni une pratique discriminatoire aux termes de la LCDP. En vertu de cette derni\u00e8re, il n'existe pas de droit d'adaptation distinct.\n[87] L'obligation d'adaptation ne prend naissance que dans le contexte du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, et uniquement lorsqu'une partie intim\u00e9e invoque un motif justifiable en se d\u00e9fendant contre une all\u00e9gation de discrimination. Pour pouvoir \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, M. Moore doit se fonder sur quelque chose d'autre que le d\u00e9faut de la SCP de prendre des mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[88] Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de M. Moore contre la SCP sont les suivantes :\nla SCP a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience en le r\u00e9affectant \u00e0 titre permanent \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et en le reclassifiant du niveau PO5 au niveau PO4; la SCP a fait une distinction d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 son endroit en limitant, \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience, les choix qu'il pouvait faire dans le cadre des soumissions relatives aux quarts de travail.\nPour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, M. Moore doit d\u00e9montrer que sa r\u00e9affectation et sa reclassification contrevenaient \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7a) ou \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP.\nF. Preuve prima facie - alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP [89] Pour ce qui est de l'alin\u00e9a 7a), il est manifeste que la SCP n'a pas refus\u00e9 d'employer M. Moore. On pourrait faire valoir cependant que la SCP a refus\u00e9 de continuer d'employer M. Moore en tant que PO5 en le reclassifiant au niveau PO4.\n[90] Cependant, la SCP a maintenu le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de niveau PO5 de M. Moore entre les mois de septembre 1998 et de janvier 2000, m\u00eame si ce dernier ex\u00e9cutait des fonctions de niveau PO4. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, M. Moore n'a jamais demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions.\n[91] Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s le 15 novembre 1999, quand M. Moore a appris de M. McClure qu'il serait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 titre permanent \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel et que sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration serait bloqu\u00e9e, qu'il a soulev\u00e9 une objection en d\u00e9posant ses griefs.\n[92] Ce faisant, M. Moore n'a jamais contest\u00e9 les mesures d'adaptation. Comme il l'a lui-m\u00eame reconnu dans son formulaire de grief interne dat\u00e9 de 1999, M. Moore n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr de pouvoir r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions au quai de r\u00e9partition. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la SCP ne refusait pas de continuer d'employer M. Moore au niveau PO5. Ce dernier, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0, n'\u00e9tait pas capable d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions de niveau PO5.\n[93] Devant le Tribunal, M. Moore a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tat de son dos s'\u00e9tait suffisamment am\u00e9lior\u00e9 pour qu'il puisse r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions de niveau PO5 en janvier 2000. Par co\u00efncidence, c'est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement r\u00e9affect\u00e9 et reclassifi\u00e9. Mais M. Moore n'a jamais demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer les fonctions de niveau PO5. Il n'a pas dit \u00e0 son superviseur, ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit d'autre \u00e0 la SCP, qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 le faire. Il n'a pas non plus fourni de preuve m\u00e9dicale indiquant qu'il \u00e9tait capable de le faire.\n[94] M. Moore a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il croyait que sa reclassification au niveau PO4 excluait la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en mesure de reprendre ses fonctions de niveau PO5. Mais M. Moore aurait pu prendre des mesures pour r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions de niveau PO5 s'il s'en sentait capable. La convention collective comporte des dispositions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es au sujet des mutations et, en fait, elle oblige un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite \u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat une demande \u00e9crite faisant \u00e9tat de son souhait.\n[95] M. Moore a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e9galement qu'il avait continu\u00e9 de consulter le Dr Taylor au sujet de ses probl\u00e8mes de dos en 2002, 2003, 2004 et 2005. Et, \u00e0 la recommandation de ce m\u00e9decin, il a suivi une physioth\u00e9rapie entre 2000 et 2003 \u00e0 cause des vives douleurs qu'il ressentait au dos. Pendant ces ann\u00e9es-l\u00e0, jamais M. Moore n'a demand\u00e9 au Dr Taylor une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale qui lui aurait permis de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions de niveau PO5.\nIV. CONCLUSION [96] Je conclus que lorsque la SCP a reclassifi\u00e9 M. Moore au niveau PO4 et qu'elle l'a r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la Section du tri manuel en janvier 2000, ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions de niveau PO5. Il ne ressort pas non plus de la preuve que ce dernier aurait pu effectuer du travail de niveau PO5 \u00e0 un moment quelconque par la suite.\n[97] Je souscris \u00e0 la th\u00e8se \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9cisions arbitrales, \u00e0 savoir que si un employ\u00e9 n'est pas capable d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions essentielles de son emploi, l'employeur est justifi\u00e9 de le reclassifier \u00e0 un poste de niveau inf\u00e9rieur. (Voir Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association c. OPEIU, b1 LAC (4th) 109; Chamberlin c. 599273 Ontario Ltd., 11 C.H.R.R. D\/110.)\n[98] La SCP n'a pas refus\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 employer M. Moore en le reclassifiant au niveau PO4. M. Moore n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP. Cet aspect de la plainte de M. Moore n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9.\nA. Preuve prima facie - Alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP [99] La reclassification et la r\u00e9affectation de M. Moore donne-t-elle lieu \u00e0 une preuve prima facie au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP? Je ne crois pas. R\u00e9duire la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d'un employ\u00e9 atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience pour qu'elle corresponde \u00e0 la valeur du travail accompli ne constitue pas une distinction d\u00e9favorable.\n[100] En outre, comparativement aux employ\u00e9s physiquement aptes de niveau PO4 qui ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions de niveau PO4, M. Moore touchait la m\u00eame r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Quant aux employ\u00e9s touchant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de niveau PO5, leur situation ne se comparait pas \u00e0 celle de M. Moore. Ils ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions de niveau PO5, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de M. Moore.\n[101] Pour ces raisons, M. Moore n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP \u00e0 cause de sa reclassification.\nB. Preuve prima facie? - Restriction des droits de soumission de M. Moore, alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP [102] En tant qu'employ\u00e9 atteint d'une DPP, M. Moore ne pouvait soumissionner que pour certains postes de la Section du tri manuel. Les employ\u00e9s physiquement aptes de cette Section n'\u00e9taient pas soumis \u00e0 de telles restrictions. M. Moore l'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause de sa d\u00e9ficience. Cela suffit pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cet aspect de sa plainte.\n[103] Il incombe donc \u00e0 la SCP de d\u00e9montrer que cette restriction \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 un motif justifiable et que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Moore constituaient une contrainte excessive, comme le prescrit le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[104] La justification de la SCP \u00e9tait qu'elle avait de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 respecter les engagements qu'elle avait pris envers sa client\u00e8le. Cela \u00e9tait d\u00fb au fait que des employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP soumissionnaient pour des centres de travail dont ils n'\u00e9taient pas capables d'ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions et qu'il fallait les affecter \u00e0 un autre centre de travail. Cela cr\u00e9ait un d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre dans certaines sections du CTCV, et une p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s dans d'autres. La SCP avait donc adopt\u00e9 la politique suivante : un employ\u00e9 ne pouvait soumissionner que pour un centre ou un calendrier de travail o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait possible de prendre des mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 son endroit.\n[105] Cependant, la SCP \u00e9tait tenue de d\u00e9montrer que M. Moore \u00e9tait incapable d'effectuer le travail dans n'importe quel centre de travail de la Section du tri manuel, sauf celui du tri primaire CL. Il n'existe aucune preuve pr\u00e9cise que lorsque la soumission relative aux quarts de travail de M. Moore a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e, la SCP avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de ce dernier de travailler dans n'importe quel centre de travail de la Section du tri manuel autre que celui du tri primaire CL.\n[106] Il semble plut\u00f4t que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en se fondant sur une preuve impressionniste, \u00e0 savoir que M. Moore b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de mesures d'adaptation au centre du tri primaire CL depuis un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es. Il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 d'une r\u00e9plique suffisante \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de M. Moore. Cela \u00e9tant, je conclus que la SCP s'est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire.\nV. R\u00c9PARATION [107] M. Moore a demand\u00e9 la somme de 2 500 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte du droit d'\u00eatre exempt de discrimination \u00e0 cause des restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 son droit de soumissionner pour les quarts de travail de 2001 et 2002; la somme de 2 500 $ pour l'insouciance avec laquelle la SCP l'a r\u00e9affect\u00e9 et reclassifi\u00e9 et restreint ses droits de soumission, ainsi que la somme de 1 500 $ pour les difficult\u00e9s physiques et affectives qu'il a subies apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 refoul\u00e9 au quart de nuit en 2001 et en 2002.\n[108] La LCDP n'habilite pas le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte du droit d'\u00eatre exempt de discrimination. Quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention du plaignant \u00e0 propos de la conduite insouciante de la SCP, je conclus que cette derni\u00e8re a pris la d\u00e9cision de le reclassifier et de le r\u00e9affecter dans le cadre de la strat\u00e9gie op\u00e9rationnelle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'elle a adopt\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne parvenait pas \u00e0 respecter les engagements pris envers la client\u00e8le. Cette mesure a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie de la politique de la SCP consistant \u00e0 affecter les employ\u00e9s l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait possible de prendre des mesures d'adaptation \u00e0 leur endroit. Je ne conclus pas qu'en agissant de la sorte, la SCP a agi de mani\u00e8re insouciante.\n[109] Quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de M. Moore au sujet de difficult\u00e9s physiques et affectives, le Tribunal peut reconna\u00eetre ce fait en accordant une indemnit\u00e9 pour les douleurs et les souffrances subies. M. Moore a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cause du quart de nuit, il avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir lorsqu'il ne travaillait pas. Il dit qu'il ne pouvait dormir que trois ou quatre heures \u00e0 la fois. Le Dr Taylor a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit dans ses notes du 27 avril 2001 : [traduction] insomnie, travail de nuit permanent, d'o\u00f9 probl\u00e8mes de sommeil et palpitations. Il a prescrit \u00e0 M. Moore des m\u00e9dicaments qui l'aideraient \u00e0 dormir.\n[110] M. Moore a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e9galement que le quart de nuit affectait sa vie \u00e0 la maison. Le travail le mettait de mauvaise humeur et le rendait agressif quand il \u00e9tait question d'affaires familiales. Bien des gens devenaient nerveux lorsqu'ils le c\u00f4toyaient \u00e0 la maison. Il disait qu'il avait l'impression de vivre dans le brouillard la majeure partie du temps, sauf peut-\u00eatre les fins de semaine, o\u00f9 il pouvait reprendre le sommeil qui lui manquait.\n[111] J'admets que M. Moore a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 quelques difficult\u00e9s physiques et affectives parce qu'il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 au quart de nuit. Mais, pour recevoir une indemnit\u00e9 quelconque, M. Moore doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il y avait une possibilit\u00e9 s\u00e9rieuse que, n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de la discrimination, il aurait obtenu le quart de travail no 3 (son premier choix) ou le quart de travail no 2 (son deuxi\u00e8me choix) (Sangha c. McKenzie Valley Land and Water Board, 2006 CHRT 9, au paragraphe 216; Brooks c. Canada, 2006 C.F. 1244, aux paragraphes 40 \u00e0 45).\n[112] M. Moore n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve indiquant que son anciennet\u00e9 lui aurait permis d'obtenir autre chose que le quart de travail no 1. Pour cette raison, il ne convient pas d'accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour souffrances et douleurs.\nA. La plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Moore [113] Dans sa plainte, M. Moore a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e9galement une violation de l'article 10 de la LCDP. Mais il n'a fait \u00e9tat d'aucune preuve \u00e0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation, ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations finales sur le sujet. Je pr\u00e9sume qu'il a laiss\u00e9 tomb\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation. Sinon, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e.\nB. La responsabilit\u00e9 du STTP [114] Quant \u00e0 une responsabilit\u00e9 quelconque du STTP \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9affectation et de la reclassification de M. Moore et de la limitation de sa soumission relative aux quarts de travail, il est vrai que le STTP a pris part aux consultations qui ont men\u00e9 au protocole d'entente. Mais c'est la SCP qui avait le dernier mot au sujet du sort de M. Moore. Le r\u00f4le du STTP a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir des consultations afin de s'assurer, dans la mesure du possible, que les employ\u00e9s atteints d'une DPP b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient de mesures d'adaptation convenables. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas le STTP qui prenait pas la d\u00e9cision finale.\n[115] Je conclus que le STTP n'assume aucune responsabilit\u00e9 par suite de la plainte de M. Moore.\nJ.

Ron Roffey, directeur de l'exploitation chez l'intim\u00e9e, AZ Bus Tours Inc., ainsi que ceux d'une rencontre avec Terry Barnett, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'intim\u00e9e, qui a eu lieu le 6 septembre 2001.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'introduction de la transcription et de l'enregistrement de ces conversations. Elle a soutenu que ces conversations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es \u00e0 l'insu de M. Barnett et de M. Roffey et sans leur consentement. L'intim\u00e9e a ajout\u00e9 que l'acte de la plaignante constituait un enregistrement de conversations priv\u00e9es entre individus sans leur consentement. Elle a de plus soutenu que l'enregistrement de ces conversations contrevenait \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents \u00e9lectroniques, L.C. 2000, ch. 5, et aux paragraphes 5(1) et 5(2) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, L.R.C. 1985, ch. C-5. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e a finalement ajout\u00e9 que la valeur probante des renseignements contenus dans ces enregistrements ne compense pas l'effet pr\u00e9judiciable que leur introduction aurait sur l'intim\u00e9e, bien qu'elle n'ait jamais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quel serait cet effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[3] J'ai examin\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 ce sujet et j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les enregistrements et les transcriptions devraient \u00eatre admis en preuve pour les motifs suivants.\n[4] Dans l'arr\u00eat R. c. Pleich (1980), 55 C.C.C.(2d) 13, la Cour d'appel de l'Ontario a conclu qu'une conversation enregistr\u00e9e doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme le t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin ayant entendu une conversation et ayant pris des notes fid\u00e8les. Les enregistrements sonores sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve originaux qui peuvent apporter une preuve pertinente et convaincante. Un enregistrement n'a pas de trou de m\u00e9moire et peut rapporter les mots utilis\u00e9s et le ton avec lesquels ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s plus exactement qu'un t\u00e9moin ayant pris part \u00e0 une conversation il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es.\n[5] Au criminel, des dispositions l\u00e9gales r\u00e9gissant l'autorisation d'intercepter des communications priv\u00e9es et leur admissibilit\u00e9 subs\u00e9quente en preuve s'appliquent. Ce n'est pas le cas au civil. Si la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un agent du gouvernement pour l'application de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, l'introduction de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve enregistr\u00e9 en secret aurait pu \u00eatre contest\u00e9e pour le motif que le droit de l'intim\u00e9e, conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Charte, d'\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint. Cependant, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la Charte ne s'applique pas puisque les parties ne sont pas des agents du gouvernement.\n[6] Outre les affaires criminelles, la plupart des affaires dont la preuve comporte une conversation enregistr\u00e9e en secret sont des affaires en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail. Les commissions du travail ont depuis longtemps conclu \u00e0 l'inadmissibilit\u00e9 de ce type de preuve en raison de l'importance capitale du maintien de la confiance et de la cordialit\u00e9 dans les relations \u00e0 long terme entre les parties. Ce n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il ne s'agit pas d'un litige en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail et il ne s'agit certainement pas d'une affaire o\u00f9 il existe encore une relation de confiance et de cordialit\u00e9 entre les parties.\n[7] J'ai examin\u00e9 les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives port\u00e9es \u00e0 mon attention par l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e et j'ai conclu qu'elles ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que j'ai \u00e0 prendre sur la question de l'admissibilit\u00e9. Je renvoie les parties \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) et au paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui sont libell\u00e9s ainsi :\n50 (3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\nc) de recevoir, sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (4) et (5), des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire;\n(4) Il ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9e n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ni d\u00e9cision ni argument qui montrerait qu'une telle preuve serait inadmissible devant les tribunaux judiciaires. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de la meilleure preuve, les enregistrements, dans tous les cas o\u00f9 ils ne concorderont pas avec la transcription, pr\u00e9vaudront.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 8 ao\u00fbt 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT832\/8203\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nBarbara Tanzos c.

CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2001, Barbara Tanzos (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) contre AZ Bus Tours Inc. (l'intim\u00e9e). La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience dans une affaire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[2] Aucune requ\u00eate ou objection pr\u00e9liminaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\nA. LES FAITS [3] L'intim\u00e9e est une entreprise de transport par autobus nolis\u00e9. Elle a ouvert ses portes en 1998. Elle fournit des services de transport par autobus sur autoroute pour des passagers voyageant surtout entre des villes situ\u00e9es en Ontario. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce, elle offrait principalement des voyages quotidiens au Casino Rama, \u00e0 Orillia, en Ontario. Elle offrait \u00e9galement du transport en autobus nolis\u00e9 vers d'autres destinations \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'Ontario.\n[4] La plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez l'intim\u00e9e le 21 mai 2000 \u00e0 titre de conductrice d'autobus. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie d'octobre 2000 \u00e0 mars 2001. Elle est revenue au travail le 7 mars 2001, mais sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions m\u00e9dicales. Le 18 octobre 2001, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e.\n[5] La principale t\u00e2che de la plaignante \u00e9tait de conduire un autobus de passagers entre Toronto et Orillia, en Ontario. En particulier, elle devait conduire les passagers, qu'elle passait prendre \u00e0 divers endroits dans la ville de Toronto jusqu'au Casino Rama, \u00e0 Orillia. Il arrivait parfois qu'elle devait conduire un autobus entre d'autres villes, lors de voyages nolis\u00e9s. Lors des voyages au Casino Rama, les passagers descendaient \u00e0 leur arriv\u00e9e au casino, o\u00f9 ils demeuraient plusieurs heures. Il fallait environ une heure et demie \u00e0 la plaignante pour aller de Toronto au Casino Rama. Il lui fallait environ deux heures pour faire le trajet de retour entre le Casino Rama et Toronto, o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9posait les passagers \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits avant de se rendre au garage de l'intim\u00e9e, situ\u00e9 sur Weston Road.\n[6] L'intim\u00e9e consigne le nombre d'heures travaill\u00e9es par ses chauffeurs d'autobus sur une feuille de pr\u00e9sence couvrant deux semaines. Ces feuilles de pr\u00e9sence comprennent une colonne intitul\u00e9e [traduction] Nombre total d'heures de travail. Cette colonne renvoie \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant d\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 son lieu de travail, soit chez l'intim\u00e9e, avant son premier voyage de la journ\u00e9e et se terminant apr\u00e8s que l'employ\u00e9 a retourn\u00e9 l'autobus au garage apr\u00e8s son dernier voyage de la journ\u00e9e.\n[7] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les conducteurs sont pay\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e en fonction du nombre de voyages qu'ils effectuent. Le montant de la paye est \u00e9tabli selon un bar\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Selon le bar\u00e8me en vigueur le 5 mars 2001, un voyage simple de moins de douze heures et demie \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 100 $; les voyages durant plus de douze heures et demie \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s 110 $. Le bar\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9voyait \u00e9galement les voyages doubles ou triples. L'intim\u00e9e versait \u00e9galement une prime de dix dollars par jour aux conducteurs \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te de service.\n[8] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Terry Barnett, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'intim\u00e9e durant toute la p\u00e9riode en cause en l'esp\u00e8ce, le travail \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 aux conducteurs selon l'anciennet\u00e9. Le r\u00e9partiteur avait la responsabilit\u00e9 d'attribuer le travail aux diff\u00e9rents \u00e9quipages de conducteurs. Le travail \u00e9tait d'abord attribu\u00e9 aux \u00e9quipages de conducteurs pour une p\u00e9riode de six semaines. Apr\u00e8s l'attribution du travail aux \u00e9quipages, le r\u00e9partiteur attribuait quotidiennement le travail restant aux employ\u00e9s ne s'\u00e9tant pas vu attribuer de travail.\n[9] Le 7 octobre 2000, la plaignante, suivant la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin, a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 de maladie pour cause [traduction] de stress, de douleurs \u00e0 la poitrine, de maux de t\u00eate chroniques, etc.. L'intim\u00e9e a accord\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 de maladie le 9 octobre 2000. Le 7 mars 2001, le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante lui a donn\u00e9 l'autorisation de retourner au travail [traduction] \u00e0 temps partiel, trois jours par semaine et il a aussi recommand\u00e9 qu'elle ne travaille pas de nuit.\n[10] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s son retour, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler avant le 18 mars. Cette situation l'a inqui\u00e9t\u00e9e, car elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait en train d'embaucher de nouveaux conducteurs alors qu'elle ne recevait aucun travail. Elle croyait que, \u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle \u00e9tait encore une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein, mais que, en raison de ses limites physiques, elle ne pouvait travailler que trois jours par semaine, le jour seulement, conform\u00e9ment aux recommandations de son m\u00e9decin.\n[11] Le 24 mars 2001, apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 que sa situation au travail ne s'\u00e9tait pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, la plaignante a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Ron Roffey, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque directeur de l'exploitation chez l'intim\u00e9e, pour lui demander pourquoi il ne lui \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 aucun travail. Elle a enregistr\u00e9 cet appel \u00e0 M. Roffey. \u00c0 l'audience, l'intim\u00e9e s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'introduction en preuve de l'enregistrement de cette conversation et de sa transcription. Elle s'est \u00e9galement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'introduction en preuve de l'enregistrement d'une autre conversation, cette fois avec Terry Barnett. Nous reviendrons \u00e0 cette conversation avec M. Barnett plus tard. J'ai rendu oralement une d\u00e9cision dans laquelle j'admettais en preuve les enregistrements et leur transcription. Une d\u00e9cision \u00e9crite concernant cette objection est rendue en m\u00eame temps que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[12] Voici des extraits de la transcription de la conversation qu'a eue la plaignante avec Ron Roffey, le 24 mars 2001 :\n[traduction]\n[...]\nBarbara Pourquoi est-ce qu'on ne m'attribue aucun travail?\nRon Bien, je n'en ai aucune id\u00e9e.\nBarbara Je suis plac\u00e9e au bas de la liste et tout le travail est attribu\u00e9 aux travailleurs \u00e0 temps plein. Comment suis-je cens\u00e9e obtenir assez de travail pour redevenir un travailleur \u00e0 temps plein?\nRon Bien, quand il y aura du travail \u00e0 faire, il vous sera attribu\u00e9.\nBarbara Mais \u00e7a ne fonctionne pas comme \u00e7a.\nRon Comment est-ce que \u00e7a devrait fonctionner, Barb?\nBarbara \u00cates-vous en train de me dire que, lorsqu'une personne revient d'un cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle n'a pas de travail?\nRon Je n'ai pas dit que vous n'aviez pas de travail.\nBarbara Mais je suis cens\u00e9e travailler trois jours.\nRon Qui dit \u00e7a?\nBarbara Le m\u00e9decin l'a dit, plut\u00f4t que de travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Alors si je revenais \u00e0 temps plein, vous n'auriez pas de travail pour moi?\nRon S'il y a du travail \u00e0 faire, il vous sera attribu\u00e9. Il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire.\nBarbara Alors mettez-moi \u00e0 pied. Si vous ne pouvez me garder, s'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire, vous devez me mettre \u00e0 pied.\nRon Nous avons du travail, mais, comme je l'ai dit, quand il y aura du travail \u00e0 faire, il vous sera attribu\u00e9.\nBarbara Mais vous ne pouvez pas me garder dans cette situation, je suis cens\u00e9e travailler trois jours par semaine. Vous \u00eates injustes envers moi. Vous savez exactement comment \u00e7a fonctionne.\nRon Je ne comprend pas quel est votre probl\u00e8me, sauf le fait qu'Eddie [le r\u00e9partiteur de l'intim\u00e9e] ne vous a pas attribu\u00e9 de travail cette semaine.\nBarbara Je n'ai eu qu'une journ\u00e9e de travail en trois semaines, depuis que je vous ai appel\u00e9.\nRon Vous n'avez eu qu'une journ\u00e9e de travail?\nBarbara En trois semaines, depuis que je vous ai appel\u00e9.\nRon Je ne peux pas vraiment vous mettre \u00e0 pied au moment o\u00f9 j'embauche des gens, non?\nBarbara C'est \u00e0 vous de d\u00e9cider ce que vous allez faire avec moi. Vous ne pouvez pas me donner seulement une journ\u00e9e de travail en un mois. Comment suis-je cens\u00e9e vivre?\nRon Bien, qu'est-ce que vous voulez faire, Barb?\nBarbara Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire pour moi?\nRon Je vais parler \u00e0 Eddie et je vais lui dire de vous donner du travail au moins trois jours par semaine.\nBarbara C'est bien.\nRon S'il y en a.\nBarbara Bien... OK... mais... non. Soit je travaille trois jours par semaine, soit vous me mettez \u00e0 pied. C'est \u00e7a que je veux, l'un ou l'autre.\nRon Je ne peux pas vous mettre \u00e0 pied quand j'embauche des gens.\nBarbara Bien, vous devrez faire quelque chose, parce que ce n'est pas correct. Vous ne pouvez pas embaucher des gens et ne pas avoir de travail \u00e0 me donner. \u00c7a n'a aucun sens.\nRon Bien, comme je l'ai dit, ce n'est pas tout le monde qui travaille actuellement. Mais \u00e7a va devenir plus occup\u00e9 et vous aurez alors du travail.\n[...]\nBarbara Vous savez, en trois semaines, je n'ai travaill\u00e9 qu'une journ\u00e9e. Vous ne pouvez pas... vous savez.\nRon Je ne comprends pas pourquoi Eddie ne vous a donn\u00e9 qu'une journ\u00e9e de travail, je vais y voir. Il n'est pas ici en ce moment, mais je vais y voir et je vais...\nBarbara Je dois travailler au moins trois jours par semaine en tant qu'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein qui revient au travail avec l'autorisation du m\u00e9decin. Au moins, je devrais pouvoir reprendre le poste que j'avais avant de partir.\nRon Mais vous revenez au travail dans un poste diff\u00e9rent...\nBarbara Seulement une journ\u00e9e de travail en trois semaines, c'est ridicule.\nRon Bien, mais, l'autre chose que vous ne devez pas oublier, ce sont les autres employ\u00e9s ici, comme...\nBarbara Je connais les autres employ\u00e9s.\nRon Je comprends ce que vous dites, mais ce n'est pas tout le monde qui travaille \u00e0 l'heure actuelle.\nBarbara Je viens juste de rouler sur l'autoroute 11 et j'ai compt\u00e9 au moins 10 autobus qui allaient au casino.\nRon Oui, c'est le service habituel.\nBarbara C'est \u00e7a, donc tout le monde travaille, il y a des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel et des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein.\nRon Ce n'est pas tout le monde qui travaille \u00e0 l'heure actuelle.\n[...]\nBarbara Je ne suis pas idiote, je sais comment fonctionne le syst\u00e8me. Si vous voulez vous d\u00e9barrasser de moi, mettez-moi \u00e0 pied. Sinon, faites-moi travailler.\nRon Je ne veux pas me d\u00e9barrasser de vous.\nBarbara Bien, c'est l'impression que j'ai, ne croyez-vous pas?\nRon Comme je l'ai dit, je ne sais pas quel est le probl\u00e8me. Laissez-moi examiner la situation et je vais veiller \u00e0 ce que vous ayez plus de travail.\nBarbara Faites-le, merci.\n[...]\n[13] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s sa conversation avec M. Roffey, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler quatre jours cons\u00e9cutifs, du 26 au 29 mars 2001. Ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que, certaines semaines, elle travaillait trois jours et m\u00eame plus, alors que, d'autres semaines, elle ne travaillait pas du tout. Du 7 mars 2001 \u00e0 la fin de son emploi le 21 octobre 2001, elle a travaill\u00e9 environ 99,5 jours, soit une moyenne de 3,1 jours par semaine. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ses feuilles de temps montrent qu'elle a eu l'horaire suivant :\nDu 7 mars au 24 mars un jour\nDu 25 mars au 22 avril quatre jours\nDu 23 avril au 6 mai cinq jours\nDu 7 mai au 20 mai cinq jours\nDu 21 mai au 3 juin cinq jours\nDu 4 juin au 17 juin six jours\nDu 18 juin au 1er juillet sept jours\nDu 1er juillet au 15 juillet huit jours\nDu 16 juillet au 29 juillet neuf jours\nDu 30 juillet au 12 ao\u00fbt sept jours\nDu 13 ao\u00fbt au 26 ao\u00fbt six jours\nDu 27 ao\u00fbt au 9 septembre dix jours\nDu 10 septembre au 23 septembre neuf jours\nDu 24 septembre au 7 octobre sept jours et demi\nDu 8 octobre au 21 octobre sept jours\n[14] Le 6 septembre 2001, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 Terry Barnett pour discuter de sa situation. Voici des extraits de la conversation ayant eu lieu lors de cette r\u00e9union. Ron Roffey \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union.\n[traduction]\nTerry Quand vous \u00e9tiez en cong\u00e9 de maladie, peu importe ce que c'\u00e9tait. [...] Je me rappelle qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question du fait que vous ne vouliez travailler que quatre jours par semaine ou trois jours par semaine.\nBarbara Ce n'est pas moi qui le demande, c'est le m\u00e9decin. La note du m\u00e9decin se trouve dans ma voiture. Le m\u00e9decin m'a autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 revenir au travail, mais seulement trois jours par semaine.\nTerry D'accord, \u00e7a confirme le fait que vous \u00eates pass\u00e9e du statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 plein temps \u00e0 celui d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel.\nBarbara Non, je suis une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein. L'article 239 du code du travail dit que, lorsqu'un conducteur \u00e0 temps plein ou un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein part en cong\u00e9 de maladie et revient travailler avec une note du m\u00e9decin qui dit que...\nTerry Barbara, longtemps apr\u00e8s la note de votre m\u00e9decin, le r\u00e9partiteur m'avait laiss\u00e9 entendre, et je dois le v\u00e9rifier, que vous \u00e9tiez pass\u00e9 de temps plein \u00e0 temps partiel et que vous ne souhaitiez pas travailler cinq jours par semaine.\nBarbara Non, je n'\u00e9tais pas capable de travailler cinq jours par semaine.\nTerry M\u00eame quand votre maladie aura \u00e9t\u00e9 gu\u00e9rie, vous ne serez pas capable de travailler...\nBarbara Non, ce n'est pas vrai. Ce n'est pas vrai parce que j'ai eu une conversation avec Ron, je lui ai demand\u00e9 comment je pouvais recommencer \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein.\nTerry Est-ce que Barb travaille \u00e0 temps plein maintenant?\nRon C'est la question que nous nous posons. On proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate.\nBarbara Oui.\nTerry D'accord.\nBarbara J'ai eu une conversation avec Ron et je lui ai dit que je suis une conductrice \u00e0 temps plein qui revient au travail \u00e0 temps partiel selon la recommandation du m\u00e9decin.\nTerry Je vois.\nBarbara Oui, je voulais travailler, alors il devait me donner du travail ou me mettre \u00e0 pied.\nTerry Bien.\nBarbara Il ne pouvait pas me mettre \u00e0 pied parce qu'il \u00e9tait en train d'embaucher des conducteurs.\nTerry Bien.\nBarbara Oui. Et il me dit qu'il n'y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire, mais qu'il est en train d'embaucher des conducteurs et il me laisse \u00e0 la maison sans me donner de travail.\nTerry D'accord, j'\u00e9tais... Laissez-moi vous pr\u00e9senter les choses tr\u00e8s clairement. J'avais l'impression que : a) vous \u00e9tiez employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel.\nBarbara Non.\nTerry Je vais discuter de cette question avec vous, mais je ne discute jamais de quoi que ce soit avant que j'aie fait enqu\u00eate et je n'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la situation qu'hier soir.\nBarbara D'accord.\nTerry Deuxi\u00e8mement, la question est de savoir si vous avez le temps r\u00e8glementaire en cons\u00e9quence de votre cong\u00e9 de maladie qui influe sur votre p\u00e9riode d'emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Alors, je vais examiner le moment o\u00f9 je vous consid\u00e9rerai comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 temps plein de nouveau. Alors, selon une convention collective, si vous partez en cong\u00e9 de maladie pendant six mois, vous avez perdu six mois d'anciennet\u00e9 parce que vous \u00e9tiez absente, en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\nBarbara Mais...\nTerry Alors, si nous vous consid\u00e9rons comme \u00e9tant une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein... Je ne sais pas combien de temps vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9, je vais devoir v\u00e9rifier.\nBarbara Un peu moins de cinq mois.\nTerry D'accord, ces cinq mois seront ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 nous vous rendrions admissible \u00e0 un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Par exemple, pour ce qui est de vos avantages sociaux ou de votre indemnit\u00e9 d'habillement, si vous vous absentez cinq mois, \u00e0 votre retour il faut compter cinq mois avant que vous deveniez admissible \u00e0 recevoir l'indemnit\u00e9 d'habillement.\nBarbara Mais il y a aussi le fait que je suis revenue comme conductrice \u00e0 temps plein qui travaille \u00e0 temps partiel en raison de ma...\nTerry D'accord, c'est un fait qui peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 parce que, quand je v\u00e9rifierai aupr\u00e8s du r\u00e9partiteur, je sais qu'il me dira que vous vouliez travailler \u00e0 temps partiel et non \u00e0 temps plein.\nBarbara Je peux vous le dire maintenant, j'ai bien enregistr\u00e9 ce qu'il a dit.\nTerry Je ne doute pas de ce qu'il a dit, je doute de ce que les autres membres du service de r\u00e9partition vont me dire...\nBarbara Non, non, le fait est que je suis \u00e0 temps plein.\nTerry Parce que c'est Eddie qui est le...\nBarbara Non, si c'est le cas, j'ai un probl\u00e8me avec lui. Il a agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire contre moi. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, j'ai perdu beaucoup d'argent potentiel avec cette entreprise. J'\u00e9tais cens\u00e9e revenir comme employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein, il devait prendre des mesures d'accommodement en me donnant trois jours par semaine tout en \u00e9tant consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein et il ne l'a pas fait. J'ai eu une conversation avec Ron, j'ai une preuve.\nTerry Un instant, vous savez tr\u00e8s bien comment je fais les choses. De la fa\u00e7on dont je fonctionne, je respecte simplement un ensemble de lignes directrices, de r\u00e8gles et de r\u00e8glements.\n[...]\nTerry Vous pouvez, vous pouvez vous sentir aussi f\u00e2ch\u00e9e que vous le voulez.\n[...]\nTerry Vous pouvez prendre les mesures que vous voudrez, parce que c'est votre choix en tant qu'employ\u00e9e, mais moi, en tant qu'employeur, j'agirai selon les renseignements que j'ai en main.\n[...]\nTerry Non, non, laissez-moi finir, laissez-moi finir, je sens votre col\u00e8re monter et je ne veux pas que vous soyez en col\u00e8re.\nBarbara Non, c'est que j'ai perdu beaucoup d'argent avec cette entreprise pour ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme...\nTerry Vous faites un tas de d\u00e9clarations, vous dites d'abord que mon personnel agit de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 votre endroit et je n'ai jamais entendu \u00e7a avant. En tant que directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de cette entreprise, la question me concerne.\n[...]\nTerry Si vous voulez agir ainsi, faites-le, c'est votre choix. Je vais agir aussi, je vais avoir des avocats et j'ai toutes sortes de ressources, parce que je respecte les r\u00e8gles.\nBarbara Moi aussi.\nTerry Et c'est bien comme \u00e7a, mais n'essayer pas de m'imposer votre volont\u00e9.\n[...]\nTerry D'abord, \u00e9coutez-moi. Ne m'envoyez pas devant un tribunal avant que j'aie pu faire enqu\u00eate. Je n'agis pas comme \u00e7a.\nBarbara \u00c7a va.\nTerry Je vais commencer mon enqu\u00eate et vous faire part des r\u00e9sultats.\nBarbara Oui et il y aura une r\u00e9union, parce qu'il y a deux autres conducteurs et j'aimerais vous rencontrer. Il y a plein de choses qui se passent ici. Nous allons fixer une date. Ce n'est pas maintenant le moment de r\u00e9ellement tenir une r\u00e9union.\nTerry Nous ne fixerons pas de date. Vous allez me demander \u00e0 quelle date je voudrais tenir une r\u00e9union et vous allez me dire de quoi il sera question avant m\u00eame la tenue de la r\u00e9union.\n[...]\nTerry Et si vous \u00e9prouvez des difficult\u00e9s, vous avez des ressources, vous avez le gouvernement, le minist\u00e8re du Travail. Allez les voir et expliquez-leur la situation. Je vais faire affaire avec eux. Je ne veux pas avoir \u00e0 discuter avec des conducteurs rebelles qui se plaignent de mon r\u00e9partiteur, absolument pas.\nBarbara Non, bien s\u00fbr que non, parce que j'ai... j'ai parl\u00e9 trois fois \u00e0 Ron, d'accord, il a dit qu'il allait y voir et il a dit qu'il allait veiller \u00e0 ce que j'aie du travail s'il y en avait.\nTerry Bien, je vois tr\u00e8s clairement, je crois, que Ron consid\u00e8re, tout comme moi, que vous \u00eates une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel et je vais continuer \u00e0 soutenir cela.\n[...]\nBarbara Maintenant, il y a une autre question. Je vous dis tr\u00e8s clairement que je ne suis pas revenue travailler et dit que je voulais \u00eatre \u00e0 temps partiel. Je suis revenue au travail avec une note du m\u00e9decin disant que je peux travailler \u00e0 temps partiel et il recommande que je ne travaille pas de nuit.\nTerry Il ne s'agit pas d'un type de travail o\u00f9 l'on peut choisir. [...] Je ne fournirai pas ce genre de travail.\n[...]\nBarbara L'an dernier, je travaillais de jour. Alors je reviens au travail et j'affirme que je ne suis pas capable de travailler de nuit [...]\nTerry Vous n'avez pas le choix, Barbara. Pour ce qui est de la fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dont est exploit\u00e9e une entreprise d'autobus, les lois du travail nous impose l'obligation de donner du travail, nous ne sommes pas oblig\u00e9s de vous faire travailler au moment o\u00f9 vous estimez \u00eatre en mesure de le faire.\n[...]\nTerry \u00c0 mon avis, \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, vous \u00eates une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[...]\nTerry C'est comme \u00e7a que j'interpr\u00e8te la situation \u00e0 l'heure actuelle.\n[...]\nTerry C'est la directive que j'ai donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Ron hier et c'est ce que je crois sans avoir fait d'enqu\u00eate.\n[...]\nTerry Nous avons des r\u00e8gles et des lignes directrices qui permettent de d\u00e9terminer qui est employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein.\n[...]\nTerry Vous avez peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein.\n[...]\nTerry Je ne le conteste pas.\nBarbara Et j'ai une note du m\u00e9decin. Avez-vous vu la note du m\u00e9decin?\nTerry Non, je n'ai rien vu.\nBarbara D'accord, mais vous devrez la voir.\nTerry Une note du m\u00e9decin n'\u00e9tablit pas la diff\u00e9rence entre un statut d'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein et un statut d'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle ne fait que pr\u00e9ciser les limites de l'employ\u00e9.\n[15] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Barnett a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait jamais vu les notes du m\u00e9decin de la plaignante et qu'il n'avait jamais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 les voir. Il a ajout\u00e9 que ces notes avaient [traduction] selon toute probabilit\u00e9 \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es au directeur de l'exploitation, poste qu'occupait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque Ron Roffey. Ce dernier n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience et aucune explication raisonnable ou acceptable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour justifier son absence, sauf une d\u00e9claration de l'avocat selon laquelle M. Roffey n'a pu \u00eatre trouv\u00e9. M. Barnett a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, quand la plaignante a pris son cong\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 de maladie, son statut est pass\u00e9 de celui d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 celui d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'un nouvel employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour occuper ce qu'il a d\u00e9crit comme le [traduction] poste vacant.\n[16] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'avait jamais eu l'intention de devenir employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle voulait qu'on prenne des mesures pour qu'elle puisse respecter les directives de son m\u00e9decin et pour qu'elle puisse plus tard reprendre son travail \u00e0 temps plein, c'est-\u00e0-dire travailler cinq jours par semaine. La position de l'intim\u00e9e est que la note du m\u00e9decin a eu pour effet de la rel\u00e9guer au statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel. M. Barnett a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein est un employ\u00e9 qui peut travailler cinq jours par semaine. Si l'employ\u00e9 n'est pas en mesure de travailler cinq jours par semaine, il est alors consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel et cet employ\u00e9 sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler en fonction de la quantit\u00e9 de travail \u00e0 faire.\n[17] Le 21 septembre 2001, Terry Barnett a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante. Dans sa lettre, il a fait mention de la r\u00e9union tenue le 6 septembre et il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] Comme je vous l'ai mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment, j'\u00e9tais au courant que, plus t\u00f4t dans l'ann\u00e9e, vous aviez perdu votre statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein, comme me l'avait affirm\u00e9 le r\u00e9partiteur. Par contre, puisque je ne savais pas qu'il y avait une raison m\u00e9dicale, j'ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que ce changement d\u00e9coulait d'un choix que vous aviez fait. Pour ce qui est de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante visant \u00e0 obtenir la prime de 10 $ par jour accord\u00e9e aux conducteurs \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e d'emploi, il a affirm\u00e9 que cette prime \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein. Il a en outre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] Puisque votre \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 vous emp\u00eache de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, vous ne pouvez \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 cette prime.\n[18] Au sujet du statut de la plaignante, la lettre contient ceci : [traduction] La lettre de votre m\u00e9decin, dat\u00e9e du 7 mars, fait savoir que vous pouvez revenir au travail \u00e0 temps partiel [...] Quoi qu'il en soit, vous pourrez reprendre le travail \u00e0 temps plein d\u00e8s que votre m\u00e9decin vous donnera l'autorisation de travailler cinq (5) jours par semaine, sans imposer de restrictions. Bien que je ne puisse encore confirmer le nombre de jours o\u00f9 vous avez travaill\u00e9 depuis le 7 mars, je sais que le r\u00e9partiteur vous a attribu\u00e9 du travail. Selon vos calculs, du 28 mai au 31 ao\u00fbt 2001, vous avez travaill\u00e9 55 jours. Compte tenu de vos limites, cette donn\u00e9e d\u00e9montre que l'entreprise a bel et bien essay\u00e9 de satisfaire vos besoins. Puisque la basse saison approche et que l'entreprise devra apporter des ajustements \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 d'\u00e9quipement et de main-d'uvre qu'elle utilisera quotidiennement, il se peut qu'il soit alors encore plus difficile de vous trouver du travail tout en respectant les limites impos\u00e9es par votre m\u00e9decin.\n[19] M. Barnett a affirm\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e ferait son possible pour attribuer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement du travail \u00e0 la plaignante, en tenant compte de ses besoins de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'un accommodement. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait faire preuve de [traduction] bon sens et que c'est pourquoi elle conserverait le statut de conductrice \u00e0 temps partiel jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'aucune restriction ne l'emp\u00eache de travailler \u00e0 temps plein.\n[20] Finalement, dans le dernier paragraphe de sa lettre du 21 septembre 2001, M. Barnett a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] [p]arce que vous vous inqui\u00e9tez en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la quantit\u00e9 de travail qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 et parce que la basse saison s'amorce, ce \u00e0 quoi s'ajoute une diminution de la demande externe en raison de la trag\u00e9die survenue aux \u00c9tats-Unis, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 examiner la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der d'un commun accord \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 pied pour que vous puissiez prendre le temps de vous r\u00e9tablir.\n[21] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette lettre, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une nouvelle note de son m\u00e9decin. Cette note, dat\u00e9e du 28 septembre 2001, laissait savoir que la plaignante pouvait recommencer \u00e0 travailler cinq jours par semaine, mais le m\u00e9decin maintenait la restriction concernant le travail de nuit, [traduction] car cela contribue \u00e0 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[22] La plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Barnett le 1er octobre 2001, dans laquelle elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle ne consentirait pas \u00e0 [traduction] proc\u00e9der d'un commun accord \u00e0 une mise \u00e0 pied, comme il l'avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 21 septembre 2001. M. Barnett lui a r\u00e9pondu le 16 octobre 2001 : [traduction] Jusqu'\u00e0 ce que vous acceptiez et soyez en mesure de travailler 5 jours par semaine sans aucune restriction, le travail vous sera attribu\u00e9 par le r\u00e9partiteur en fonction des besoins, comme c'est le cas pour tous les conducteurs \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[23] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi de la plaignante chez l'intim\u00e9e le 17 octobre 2001. Selon l'intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a volontairement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste, bien que l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e, dans sa d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire, ait laiss\u00e9 entendre que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied pour des raisons d'ordre \u00e9conomique, mais aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'appui de cette affirmation. La plaignante, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, soutient que sa mise \u00e0 pied a \u00e9t\u00e9 une cons\u00e9quence directe de la lettre que lui a envoy\u00e9e M. Barnett le 16 octobre 2001.\n[24] Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission des droits de la personne, dat\u00e9e du 4 juillet 2002, o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle avait une politique applicable aux employ\u00e9s ayant des restrictions m\u00e9dicales, M. Barnett a offert la r\u00e9ponse suivante : [traduction] L'administration a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un document d\u00e9taill\u00e9 intitul\u00e9 Politique et manuel de proc\u00e9dure, document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 par la suite approuv\u00e9 par un comit\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s apr\u00e8s quelques changements mineurs. En particulier, les employ\u00e9s ayant des restrictions m\u00e9dicales n'y sont pas mentionn\u00e9s express\u00e9ment, mais le bon sens qui sous-tend cette politique fait en sorte que l'obligation l\u00e9gale de prendre des mesures d'accommodement est reconnue. Apr\u00e8s plus de 30 ans dans le domaine des entreprises d'autobus et de transport public, je suis bien au courant de l'obligation de prendre les mesures d'accommodement n\u00e9cessaires pour satisfaire le mieux possibles les besoins.\n[25] Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Barnett a expliqu\u00e9 comment il interpr\u00e9tait l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'un employ\u00e9 ayant une d\u00e9ficience relativement au fait que l'intim\u00e9e fonctionne, dans ses propres mots, selon un [traduction] syst\u00e8me fond\u00e9 sur l'anciennet\u00e9. Il a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] Je ne peux donner [\u00e0 la plaignante] un quart de travail qui revient \u00e0 une personne ayant plus d'anciennet\u00e9 simplement \u00e0 titre de mesure d'accommodement pour des restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Il croyait que l'intim\u00e9e devait, pour satisfaire \u00e0 l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement, donner \u00e0 la plaignante [traduction] autant d'heures que possible.\nB. ANALYSE DU DROIT [26] Afin de pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Loi, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer qu'un ou plus d'un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi est en cause.\n(i) La plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 7 [27] Mme Tanzos a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 7. L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. L'article 3 de la Loi \u00e9tablit que la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite.\n[28] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience dans une affaire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite pour \u00e9tablir l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne portera donc que sur la question de l'acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) Y a-t-il preuve prima facie? [29] \u00c0 la suite des arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer), la distinction historique entre la discrimination directe et indirecte a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par une approche unifi\u00e9e lorsqu'il faut trancher les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette nouvelle approche, il incombe au plaignant de prouver prima facie qu'il y a discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9 (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558.)\n[30] Dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi, il incombe au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie qu'il y a discrimination. En mati\u00e8re de discrimination, la norme de la preuve est la norme de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qui s'applique dans les causes civiles ordinaires. Lorsqu'une preuve circonstancielle est produite, le crit\u00e8re peut \u00eatre formul\u00e9 ainsi :\n[traduction] On peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que toute autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible.\n(B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Toronto, Carswell, 1987, \u00e0 la page 142; Uzoaba c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [1994] D.C.D.P. no 7, \u00e0 la page 40.)\n[31] Quel crit\u00e8re convient-il d'appliquer pour juger s'il y a preuve prima facie? Dans l'arr\u00eat Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9finition juridique de la preuve prima facie n'exige pas que la plaignante soumette un type particulier de preuve afin d'\u00e9tablir qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire. Il vaut mieux appliquer un crit\u00e8re plus souple.\n[32] Selon l'arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des Droits de la personne et des Droits de la jeunesse) c. Ville de Montr\u00e9al, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665, \u00e0 la page 701 (\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 Mercier), afin d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, le plaignant doit prouver : a) l'existence d'une distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la d\u00e9cision de refuser d'employer ou de continuer \u00e0 employer un individu; b) que la distinction est fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience r\u00e9elle ou per\u00e7ue; c) que la distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence a pour effet de d\u00e9truire ou de compromettre le droit \u00e0 l'exercice, en pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9, des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne.\n[33] Une des questions cl\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si la plaignante a ou non une d\u00e9ficience ou si l'intim\u00e9e la consid\u00e9rait ou non comme ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[34] Un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant la d\u00e9ficience pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de la plaignante est la demande de cong\u00e9 de maladie pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 7 octobre 2000. Selon cette demande de cong\u00e9 de maladie, c'est le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante qui a exig\u00e9 ce cong\u00e9, parce que la plaignante souffrait [traduction] de stress, de douleurs \u00e0 la poitrine, de maux de t\u00eates chroniques. L'intim\u00e9e a accord\u00e9 la demande. Une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 2 mars 2001, envoy\u00e9e par le Markham Headache and Pain Treatment Centre au docteur Adrian R. Woodrow, le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante, r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la plaignante souffre de c\u00e9phal\u00e9e cervicog\u00e8ne post-traumatique et de douleurs myo-fasciales cervicales. Un examen par IRM de sa colonne cervicale a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence de la colonne cervicale ainsi que deux disques cervicaux herni\u00e9s. Rien ne prouve que cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance de l'intim\u00e9e. Le 7 mars 2001, le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re une note confirmant qu'elle pouvait retourner au travail, mais en respectant certaines conditions, soit qu'elle travaille [traduction] \u00e0 temps partiel, trois jours par semaine. Cette note pr\u00e9cisait \u00e9galement qu'elle ne devait pas travailler la nuit, [traduction] car cela nuirait \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 actuel. Rien ne prouve que l'intim\u00e9e ait contest\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de ces restrictions. Finalement, le 28 septembre 2001, la plaignante a fourni \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e une autre note de son m\u00e9decin, cette fois du docteur Mayer Yacowar, laquelle note laissait savoir que la plaignante pouvait retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein, mais maintenait la restriction lui interdisant de travailler de nuit et pr\u00e9cisait cette restriction en ajoutant [traduction] apr\u00e8s minuit.\n[35] Bien que la plaignante n'ai appel\u00e9 ni ses m\u00e9decins ni tout autre expert m\u00e9dical \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au sujet de sa maladie, je conclus n\u00e9anmoins qu'elle a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination.\n[36] Quand elle est revenue au travail le 7 mars 2001, la plaignante souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience m\u00e9dicale, comme le prouve la note de son m\u00e9decin. Cette preuve m\u00e9dicale n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e et, au cours du contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante, l'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e ne l'a jamais interrog\u00e9e au sujet de sa maladie. La preuve confirme m\u00eame que l'intim\u00e9e reconnaissait que les capacit\u00e9s de la plaignante \u00e9taient restreintes pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Dans sa lettre du 21 septembre 2001, par exemple, M. Barnett d\u00e9clare : [traduction] Quoi qu'il en soit, vous pourrez reprendre le travail \u00e0 temps plein d\u00e8s que votre m\u00e9decin vous donnera l'autorisation de travailler cinq (5) jours par semaine, sans restrictions. Encore une fois, dans sa lettre du 16 octobre 2001, il affirme : [traduction] Jusqu'\u00e0 ce que vous acceptiez et soyez en mesure de travailler 5 jours par semaine sans aucune restriction, le travail vous sera attribu\u00e9 par le r\u00e9partiteur en fonction des besoins, comme c'est le cas pour tous les conducteurs \u00e0 temps partiel. Si l'intim\u00e9e croyait que la plaignante ne souffrait pas d'une d\u00e9ficience m\u00e9dicale, elle aurait pu demander l'avis d'un autre m\u00e9decin, ce qu'elle a choisi de ne pas faire.\n[37] Puisqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination, l'intim\u00e9e peut maintenant justifier la pratique discriminatoire en question en \u00e9tablissant ce qui suit selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve :\nL'intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 la pratique dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exercice de l'emploi en cause;\nL'intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 cette pratique particuli\u00e8re de bonne foi, en croyant qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\nLa norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Afin d'\u00e9tablir que la pratique est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l'intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte des contraintes excessives pour l'intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re doit prouver qu'elle a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement.\n(Voir Grismer, au paragraphe 20.)\n(a) Les deux premiers volets de Grismer [38] L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e a soutenu qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel pour cette derni\u00e8re d'exercer ses activit\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9curitaire sept jours par semaine, vingt-quatre heures par jour. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, pour ce faire, l'intim\u00e9e avait besoin d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein qui peuvent travailler cinq jours par semaine et qui sont disponibles pour les quarts de nuit. L'avocate a ajout\u00e9 que la seule possibilit\u00e9 dans une situation comme celle en l'esp\u00e8ce est de consid\u00e9rer la plaignante comme \u00e9tant une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel et de lui attribuer du travail en fonction des besoins de l'entreprise.\n[39] Les parties n'ont pas jug\u00e9 bon, ni dans le cadre de la preuve ni dans la plaidoirie, d'aborder les deux premi\u00e8res exigences de Grismer. Nous pouvons en d\u00e9duire qu'elles admettent que la pratique adopt\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e avait un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exercice de l'emploi en cause.\n[40] Nous pouvons \u00e9galement en d\u00e9duire que l'intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 cette pratique de bonne foi, en croyant qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer le bon fonctionnement de ses activit\u00e9s.\n(b) L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 qu'il serait impossible de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour Mme Tanzos sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour l'intim\u00e9e des contraintes excessives? [41] Selon l'intim\u00e9e, les notes de m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la plaignante ne pr\u00e9cisaient pas clairement quelle \u00e9tait vraiment sa maladie. Elle soutient de plus qu'elle n'a jamais su de quelle maladie souffrait v\u00e9ritablement la plaignante. L'intim\u00e9e ajoute qu'elle a n\u00e9anmoins pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et qu'elle s'est pli\u00e9e aux recommandations du m\u00e9decin sans compromettre son obligation d'attribuer du travail aux autres employ\u00e9s.\n[42] Comme le r\u00e9v\u00e8le la preuve, la plaignante a d'abord demand\u00e9 qu'il lui soit permis de reprendre son emploi \u00e0 temps plein en travaillant trois jours par semaine, seulement le jour. En octobre 2001, la note du m\u00e9decin faisait savoir que la plaignante pouvait maintenant travailler cinq jours par semaine, mais encore seulement le jour. Outre l'affirmation de M. Barnett selon laquelle cela ne se fait habituellement pas puisque l'intim\u00e9e exerce ses activit\u00e9s 24 heures par jour, sept jours par semaine, rien ne prouve que cette demande entra\u00eenait une contrainte excessive. M. Barnett, le seul t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9e, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la pratique normale dans le milieu, mais il n'a apport\u00e9 aucune preuve \u00e0 l'appui de cette d\u00e9claration.\n[43] Pour \u00e9tablir qu'une pratique est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, l'employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il lui est impossible de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour le plaignant sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une contrainte excessive. Par cons\u00e9quent, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a fait des efforts pour accommoder la plaignante dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle ne subissait pas de contrainte excessive (voir Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) (1990), 72 D.L.R.(4th) 417, \u00e0 la page 439).\n[44] La Cour supr\u00eame, dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, au paragraphe 64, conseille aux tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs de tenir compte des diverses mani\u00e8res dont il est possible de composer avec les capacit\u00e9s d'un individu. L'employeur doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration la possibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter le travail de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi que vise l'employeur. Les aptitudes, les capacit\u00e9s et l'apport potentiel du plaignant et de ceux qui sont dans la m\u00eame situation que lui doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9s autant qu'il est possible de le faire.\n[45] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la pratique met l'accent sur le besoin d'avoir des employ\u00e9s disponibles pour travailler cinq jours par semaine et, si n\u00e9cessaire, pour travailler de nuit. Le fait que cette pratique exclue certaines cat\u00e9gories de personnes ne constitue pas de la discrimination si l'intim\u00e9e parvient \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la pratique est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser un objectif appropri\u00e9 et si la pratique fait place \u00e0 l'accommodement. L'exclusion ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e que si l'employeur a pris toutes les mesures d'accommodement possibles tant qu'il n'en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour lui de contrainte excessive (voir Grismer, au paragraphe 21).\n[46] La recherche d'un accommodement est un processus multipartite. De toute \u00e9vidence, la plaignante a l'obligation d'aider l'intim\u00e9e pour parvenir \u00e0 un accommodement qui convient (voir l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 555.) Cela ne signifie pas qu'en plus de porter \u00e0 l'attention de l'employeur les faits relatifs \u00e0 la discrimination, le plaignant est tenu de proposer une solution. Bien que le plaignant puisse \u00eatre en mesure de faire des suggestions, l'employeur est celui qui est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on dont il est possible de composer avec le plaignant sans que cela n'intervienne ind\u00fbment dans l'exploitation de son entreprise. Lorsque l'employeur fait une proposition qui est raisonnable et qui, si elle \u00e9tait mise en uvre, remplirait l'obligation d'accommodement, le plaignant est tenu d'en faciliter la mise en uvre. Si l'omission du plaignant de prendre des mesures raisonnables est \u00e0 l'origine de l'\u00e9chec de la proposition, la plainte sera rejet\u00e9e. L'autre aspect de cette obligation est le devoir d'accepter une mesure d'accommodement raisonnable. Le plaignant ne peut s'attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite (voir Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970).\n[47] L'intim\u00e9e, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, est tenue de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a pris toutes les mesures d'accommodement possibles tant qu'il n'en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour elle de contrainte excessive. Pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui constitue une contrainte excessive, elle doit prouver qu'elle a envisag\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 raisonnablement toute forme possible d'accommodement. Elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible d'incorporer des mesures individuelles d'accommodement sans qu'il lui en cause une contrainte excessive.\n[48] L'emploi de l'adjectif excessive donne \u00e0 penser qu'un certain degr\u00e9 de contrainte est acceptable; ce n'est que la contrainte jug\u00e9e excessive qui peut excuser un employeur de son obligation. L'intim\u00e9e ne m'a pas persuad\u00e9 que respecter les restrictions m\u00e9dicales de la plaignante n\u00e9cessiterait une r\u00e9organisation importante de toutes les t\u00e2ches au point o\u00f9 cela entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive. L'intim\u00e9e soutient, sans preuve convaincante \u00e0 l'appui de son argument, que l'accommodement demand\u00e9 par la plaignante aurait un effet n\u00e9gatif sur ses activit\u00e9s. Aucune preuve convaincante n'\u00e9taye cette conclusion.\n[49] \u00c0 au moins deux reprises, la plaignante a rencontr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants de la direction pour leur faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de ses heures de travail et pour parvenir \u00e0 une solution. Elle cherchait une occasion de montrer que, avec un accommodement, elle pouvait accomplir les t\u00e2ches d'un conducteur d'autobus. Elle a demand\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin, \u00e0 travailler trois jours par semaine. En r\u00e9ponse, l'intim\u00e9e lui a donn\u00e9 un poste \u00e0 temps partiel en lui attribuant du travail en fonction des besoins de l'entreprise. En septembre 2001, elle a fait savoir que son m\u00e9decin l'avait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 reprendre le travail cinq jours par semaine, mais qu'il avait maintenu la restriction lui interdisant le travail de nuit. L'intim\u00e9e a encore refus\u00e9 de lui redonner le statut d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein et a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle maintiendrait son refus jusqu'\u00e0 ce que soient lev\u00e9es les restrictions. Encore une fois, rien ne prouve que l'intim\u00e9e aurait subi une contrainte excessive si elle avait accept\u00e9 de prendre des mesures pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[50] Bien qu'elle n'ait jamais contest\u00e9 la maladie de la plaignante ni les restrictions impos\u00e9es par son m\u00e9decin, l'intim\u00e9e a agi comme si elle n'\u00e9tait pas concern\u00e9e et comme si son obligation d'accommodement \u00e9tait une obligation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite et limit\u00e9e. Si l'intim\u00e9e estimait qu'elle n'avait pas suffisamment de renseignements pour d\u00e9cider quelles mesures d'accommodement \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires, elle aurait pu s'informer aupr\u00e8s du m\u00e9decin de la plaignante pour savoir si les restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e9taient temporaires ou permanentes, si elles n\u00e9cessitaient que des mesures d'accommodement soient prises, quelle sorte de t\u00e2ches la plaignante pouvait effectuer, quelle sorte de t\u00e2ches la plaignante devait \u00e9viter, combien de temps il faudrait maintenir ces mesures d'accommodement, \u00e0 quelle date la plaignante allait \u00eatre r\u00e9examin\u00e9e ou ce que l'employeur, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, pouvait faire pour faciliter le retour au travail de la plaignante.\n[51] Il ressort de la preuve que l'intim\u00e9e ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'accommoder la plaignante sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte des contraintes excessives pour l'intim\u00e9e. Il se peut que, du point de vue de l'employeur, une pratique rigoureuse ne permettant aucune concession, comme celle de l'intim\u00e9e, soit id\u00e9ale. Cependant, pour que cette pratique soit justifi\u00e9e au regard de la Loi, elle doit permettre le respect des capacit\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res de chaque individu, de sa valeur intrins\u00e8que et de sa dignit\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 l'employeur ne subit pas de contrainte excessive.\n[52] L'intim\u00e9e savait que la plaignante avait une d\u00e9ficience. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Elle n'a produit aucune preuve relative \u00e0 ses efforts pour accommoder la plaignante, \u00e0 l'exception du fait qu'elle l'a trait\u00e9e comme une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel. Ces efforts ne sont pas suffisants pour satisfaire \u00e0 son obligation.\n(iii) Conclusion sur la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 7 [53] Compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, j'estime que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience, en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi.\nC. LES REDRESSEMENTS [54] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante demande les redressements suivants :\nune indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire; une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral; le remboursement de certaines d\u00e9penses.\n[55] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que, si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne reconnue coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\n53(2) [...]\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\nd) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d'autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d'h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\ne) d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n53 (4) Sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e8gles vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l'article 48.9, le membre instructeur peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l'indemnit\u00e9 au taux et pour la p\u00e9riode qu'il estime justifi\u00e9s.\n53(2) [...]\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n53 (4) Subject to the rules made under section 48.9, an order to pay compensation under this section may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member or panel considers appropriate.\n(i) L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire [56] La plaignante r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire dues au fait que l'intim\u00e9e ne l'a pas accommod\u00e9e. Elle r\u00e9clame aussi une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire perdu quand l'intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de la faire travailler cinq jours par semaine \u00e0 partir du 28 septembre 2001. La preuve concernant le salaire perdu n'est pas des plus claires et l'intim\u00e9e, pour sa part, n'a jamais contest\u00e9 cette preuve et n'a jamais contre-interrog\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 ce sujet. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ferai de mon mieux pour \u00e9tablir ce qui, \u00e0 mon avis, constitue un montant raisonnable pour le salaire perdu.\n[57] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, du 7 mars 2001 au 28 septembre 2001, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 quatre-vingt-cinq (85) jours, soit une moyenne de 3,1 jours par semaine. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne semble pas que la plaignante ait subi une perte de salaire durant cette p\u00e9riode. Si l'intim\u00e9e avait pris des mesures d'accommodement et avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante trois jours de travail par semaine, celle-ci n'aurait pas re\u00e7u plus d'argent qu'elle en a re\u00e7u pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n[58] Pour la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 28 septembre 2001, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait en mesure de travailler cinq jours par semaine, la preuve montre qu'elle a travaill\u00e9 11,5 jours jusqu'au 21 octobre 2001, son dernier jour de travail chez l'intim\u00e9e. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, elle aurait d\u00fb travailler 15 jours. Elle a donc, pour cette p\u00e9riode, subi une perte de salaire \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 3,5 jours de travail. Si on consid\u00e8re que, pour une journ\u00e9e de travail de douze heures ou moins, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, selon la preuve, cent dollars par jour, le montant de sa perte de salaire pour cette p\u00e9riode est de 350 $.\n[59] Selon son relev\u00e9 d'emploi, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] mise \u00e0 pied le 21 octobre 2001. Il ne s'agit pas d'une mise \u00e0 pied accept\u00e9e d'un commun accord, comme l'a pr\u00e9tendu l'intim\u00e9e. La preuve montre clairement que la plaignante ne voulait pas \u00eatre mise \u00e0 pied, mais que, puisque l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre des mesures d'accommodement, elle estimait ne pas avoir pas d'autre choix. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante a le droit de r\u00e9clamer le salaire perdu \u00e0 la suite de sa mise \u00e0 pied.\n[60] Pour l'ann\u00e9e 2000, la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d'emploi \u00e0 temps plein de la plaignante chez l'intim\u00e9e, le total de ses revenus, selon sa d\u00e9claration de revenus, s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 24 594 $. En 2001, ses revenus ont totalis\u00e9 19 729 $, dont 5 740 $ en prestations d'assurance-emploi. Une partie de ces prestations a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, mais rien dans la preuve soumise \u00e0 l'audience n'indique \u00e0 quelle somme cela correspondait. Si la plaignante avait travaill\u00e9 cinq jours par semaine, \u00e0 100 $ par jour, pour le reste de cette ann\u00e9e, elle aurait travaill\u00e9 40 jours de plus, pour lesquels elle aurait re\u00e7u un salaire de 4 000 $. Compte tenu du fait qu'elle a re\u00e7u des prestations d'assurance-emploi, ainsi que d'autres facteurs qui ont pu influencer sa capacit\u00e9 de gagner sa vie, il serait raisonnable d'\u00e9valuer le montant de sa perte de salaire pour cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 3 000 $.\n[61] Pour l'ann\u00e9e 2002, son revenu total s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 19 485 $, une diff\u00e9rence de 5 109 $ avec son revenu de 2001. Je fixe le montant de la perte de salaire pour l'ann\u00e9e 2002 \u00e0 5 109 $.\n[62] Pour l'ann\u00e9e 2003, son revenu s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 21 368 $, une diff\u00e9rence de 3 226 $ par rapport \u00e0 son revenu en 2001. Le montant de sa perte de salaire pour l'ann\u00e9e 2003 est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 3 226 $.\n[63] En conclusion, la plaignante a droit \u00e0 350 $ pour le salaire perdu pendant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant sa mise \u00e0 pied en 2001. Elle a aussi droit \u00e0 3 000 $ en salaire perdu pour le reste de l'ann\u00e9e 2001. Pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 et 2003, je fixe le montant de ses pertes de salaire \u00e0 5 109 $ et 3 226 $ respectivement.\n[64] La plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement la perte de salaire pour le Vendredi saint et pour le dimanche de P\u00e2ques, salaire qu'elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir. Elle pr\u00e9tend aussi qu'elle a droit \u00e0 la prime de dix dollars par jour pay\u00e9e aux conducteurs \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s un an de service.\n[65] J'ordonne que soit pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante 200 $ pour le Vendredi saint et le dimanche de P\u00e2ques. Pour ce qui est de la prime de 10 $ par jour, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez l'intim\u00e9e le 21 mai 2000. Si elle avait travaill\u00e9 sans interruption, elle aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir cette prime le 21 mai 2001. Cependant, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie d'octobre 2000 \u00e0 mars 2001. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle n'a pas accumul\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 et cette p\u00e9riode ne peut \u00eatre prise en compte pour calculer la date \u00e0 partir de laquelle elle aurait eu droit \u00e0 la prime. La plaignante est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 7 mars 2001 et elle a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 18 octobre 2001, apr\u00e8s quoi elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied. Le 7 octobre 2001, elle aurait occup\u00e9 son poste d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein depuis un an et, \u00e0 partir de cette date, elle aurait eu droit \u00e0 la prime de dix dollars par jour. Du 7 octobre 2001 \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, elle aurait d\u00fb travailler environ 50 jours. En cons\u00e9quence, j'ordonne que lui soit pay\u00e9e la prime pour cette p\u00e9riode, ce qui donne un montant de 500 $. Parce qu'aucune preuve n'\u00e9tablit que cette prime \u00e9tait encore vers\u00e9e en 2002 et 2003, je n'ordonnerai rien pour ces ann\u00e9es.\n[66] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante pour obtenir une prime de No\u00ebl, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui de cette r\u00e9clamation et, par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ordonnerai pas que cette prime soit pay\u00e9e.\n[67] En application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, la plaignante a donc droit \u00e0 12 035 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9e. Cette somme semble raisonnable compte tenu de la qualit\u00e9 de la preuve soumise et de l'obligation de la plaignante d'att\u00e9nuer ses pertes.\n(ii) L'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [68] La plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e). Encore une fois, je dois dire que la preuve soumise \u00e0 l'appui de cette r\u00e9clamation est quelque peu faible et ne suffit certainement pas \u00e0 justifier un montant figurant aux \u00e9chelons les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s pr\u00e9vus par la Loi. Bien que le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9parations lorsqu'une plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit exercer judicieusement ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve dont il dispose. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plainte est accueillie et il ne se d\u00e9gage du t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante aucune raison de lui refuser une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (voir Dumont c. Transport Jeannot Gagnon, 2002 CFPI 1280).\n[69] Je conviens que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e a bel et bien caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante un pr\u00e9judice moral, ne serait-ce que de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'accorde 3 000 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(iii) Le remboursement de certaines d\u00e9penses [70] La plaignante a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 le remboursement de certaines de ses d\u00e9penses, mais aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui. Il est donc impossible pour le Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance concernant le remboursement de d\u00e9penses.\n(iv) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [71] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce seront vers\u00e9s (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-01-04), c'est-\u00e0-dire selon un taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d'escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 la date du versement de l'indemnit\u00e9.\nII. CONCLUSION [72] Je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi et j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer \u00e0 la plaignante 15 035 $ \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire et pour pr\u00e9judice moral, plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, au taux susmentionn\u00e9, \u00e0 partir de la date de la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date du versement de l'indemnit\u00e9.\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 8 ao\u00fbt 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT832\/8203\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nBarbara Tanzos c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2003, Suresh Khiamal (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) contre Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation (l'intim\u00e9e). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, l'\u00e2ge et la d\u00e9ficience dans une affaire en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[2] Le plaignant et l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente.\nII. LES FAITS [3] Le plaignant, n\u00e9 le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1948, a 58 ans. Il est un citoyen canadien originaire de l'Inde. Il a immigr\u00e9 au Canada en 1979 depuis l'Afrique du Sud. Il a travaill\u00e9 comme m\u00e9canicien brevet\u00e9 de 1970 \u00e0 1979 en Afrique du Sud et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez l'intim\u00e9e le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1980 \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien de deuxi\u00e8me classe. Apr\u00e8s quelques mois, le plaignant a obtenu son brevet au Canada et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu m\u00e9canicien de premi\u00e8re classe. Au cours de l'audience, son poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom de m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde.\n[4] Les faits \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte se sont produits au garage de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Edmonton, en Alberta (le garage d'Edmonton). Le garage d'Edmonton comporte deux aires de travail o\u00f9 les m\u00e9caniciens de machinerie lourde accomplissent leurs t\u00e2ches. La premi\u00e8re est l'aire de service, o\u00f9 les autobus Greyhound sont entretenus, c'est-\u00e0-dire o\u00f9 se fait l'inspection pour savoir si les autobus sont en \u00e9tat de rouler, o\u00f9 les autobus sont lav\u00e9s, o\u00f9 se fait le plein d'essence et o\u00f9 se fait la maintenance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La deuxi\u00e8me est l'aire de levage, o\u00f9 les autobus font l'objet d'une r\u00e9vision compl\u00e8te et sont plac\u00e9s sur un palan pour qu'y soient faites les r\u00e9parations m\u00e9caniques plus importantes, comme la r\u00e9paration des freins, l'alignement des roues, etc. Le travail des m\u00e9caniciens de machinerie lourde travaillant dans l'aire de levage est plus exigeant physiquement.\n[5] Durant les ann\u00e9es de service du plaignant chez l'intim\u00e9e, il y a eu plusieurs changements au sein du personnel et dans le style de gestion. Il y avait parfois plus d'un contrema\u00eetre et d'autres fois il n'y en avait aucun. Le r\u00f4le du superviseur, et des employ\u00e9s ayant agi \u00e0 titre de superviseur, a \u00e9galement chang\u00e9 au fil des ans.\n[6] Au cours de son emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e, depuis 1980, le plaignant a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 au poste de chef d'\u00e9quipe pour de longues p\u00e9riodes. Ses talons de ch\u00e8que de paie montrent que, lorsqu'il \u00e9tait chef d'\u00e9quipe, il recevait un dollar l'heure de plus. Bien qu'il ait travaill\u00e9 tant dans l'aire de service que dans l'aire de levage, il a travaill\u00e9 principalement dans l'aire de service, particuli\u00e8rement au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[7] Les t\u00e2ches du chef d'\u00e9quipe ressemblent \u00e0 celles du contrema\u00eetre, c'est-\u00e0-dire que le chef d'\u00e9quipe supervise les autres m\u00e9caniciens pour veiller \u00e0 ce que le travail n\u00e9cessaire soit fait, qu'il distribue les ressources et qu'il assigne certaines t\u00e2ches aux m\u00e9caniciens, qu'il communique avec le r\u00e9partiteur, qu'il utilise le syst\u00e8me informatis\u00e9 de maintenance MCMS et qu'il est responsable de veiller \u00e0 ce que les autobus soient pr\u00eats \u00e0 rouler et que l'horaire soit respect\u00e9. Les principales diff\u00e9rences entre les deux postes est que le chef d'\u00e9quipe n'a pas de pouvoir disciplinaire, n'a pas de t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 la paie et n'a pas affaire aux superviseurs occupant un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans l'administration. Des comp\u00e9tences en leadership sont essentielles.\n[8] Le garage d'Edmonton est un milieu de travail syndiqu\u00e9. Le plaignant est membre du Syndicat uni du transport (le syndicat) et a occup\u00e9 le poste de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. Pendant son emploi, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de nombreux griefs, certains en son nom et plusieurs au nom d'autres travailleurs; il connaissait donc bien la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs. Une convention collective, modifi\u00e9e au fil du temps, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en vigueur tout le long de la p\u00e9riode en cause.\n[9] Au moment o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, le plaignant \u00e9tait le m\u00e9canicien ayant le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 au garage d'Edmonton. L'anciennet\u00e9 est un facteur donnant la priorit\u00e9 pour le choix des vacances et peut \u00eatre un facteur pour choisir les employ\u00e9s qui recevront de la formation ou des cours donn\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e ou le syndicat. Elle est aussi un facteur pris en compte, sans qu'il soit d\u00e9terminant, dans la promotion d'un employ\u00e9 du poste de m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde \u00e0 celui de contrema\u00eetre.\n[10] Quand un m\u00e9canicien est promu au poste de contrema\u00eetre, il n'appartient plus au syndicat et il n'a plus le droit d'utiliser les outils d'un m\u00e9canicien, sauf en cas de r\u00e9elle urgence. Selon la convention collective en vigueur au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, un contrema\u00eetre pouvait reprendre ses t\u00e2ches de m\u00e9canicien, tout en conservant son anciennet\u00e9, s'il perdait son poste de contrema\u00eetre, mais pas s'il \u00e9tait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e.\nIII. APER\u00c7U DE LA PLAINTE ET DES ALL\u00c9GATIONS [11] Les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte peuvent \u00eatre class\u00e9es ainsi :\nLa premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation concerne la demande d'emploi du plaignant pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre de la maintenance pour les quarts de nuit et la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas l'embaucher \u00e0 ce poste. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e est un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience, l'\u00e2ge, la race, la couleur ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique. La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation concerne une s\u00e9rie d'incidents, ou de traits caract\u00e9ristiques de ce que le plaignant a v\u00e9cu au travail, qui constituent, selon le plaignant, du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la race. La troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation porte principalement sur les incidents mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus (c'est-\u00e0-dire le refus de l'intim\u00e9e de permettre au plaignant de suivre de la formation et des cours) et soutient que ce refus le d\u00e9favorise et annihile ses chances d'emploi en raison de sa race.\nIV. LE DROIT A. Les motifs de distinction illicite [12] L'article 3 de la LCDP \u00e9nonce que la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, l'\u00e2ge et la d\u00e9ficience constituent des motifs de distinction illicite.\nB. Le fardeau du plaignant et le fardeau de l'intim\u00e9e [13] Il incombe d'abord au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 (O'Malley)).\n[14] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli dans l'arr\u00eat Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, que le Tribunal ne doit pas tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e pour d\u00e9cider si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[15] Si le plaignant \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable et d'\u00e9tablir qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un simple pr\u00e9texte lui permettant de commettre des actes discriminatoires (Lincoln, au paragraphe 23).\nC. L'article 7 [16] Selon l'article 7, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects : a) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[17] Selon la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario dans Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd. (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9e aurait refus\u00e9 d'employer la plaignante pour un motif discriminatoire, l'acte discriminatoire est \u00e9tabli prima facie si la preuve \u00e9tablit ceci :\nle plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l'emploi en question; le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; une autre personne, qui n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique distinctive constituant le fondement de la plainte, a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste.\n[18] Cela dit, le crit\u00e8re adopt\u00e9 dans Shakes n'est pas une r\u00e8gle de droit, mais uniquement un exemple de l'application du principe \u00e9tabli dans O'Malley. Le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Shakes ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on rigide ou arbitraire dans chaque affaire portant sur l'embauchage (Lincoln, au paragraphe 18; C.C.D.P. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, aux paragraphes 25 et 26).\nD. L'article 14 [19] Aux termes de l'article 14 de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[20] Lorsque le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14, il doit d\u00e9montrer que la conduite reproch\u00e9e :\n\u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite; \u00e9tait non sollicit\u00e9e; \u00e9tait assez persistante et s\u00e9rieuse pour avoir un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail.\n(Voir Morin c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2005 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 246.)\nE. L'article 10 [21] L'article 10 de la LCDP vise l'employeur qui applique des lignes de conduite fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite et susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi d'un individu.\nF. L'\u00e9valuation de la preuve [22] Pour que la plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que seuls des motifs discriminatoires soient \u00e0 l'origine des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il suffit qu'un des facteurs \u00e0 l'origine de la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur soit de nature discriminatoire (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.)).\n[23] Il peut \u00eatre conclu \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 partir d'une preuve circonstancielle, \u00e0 la condition que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rende cette conclusion plus probable que toute autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible (voir Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) (2001), 40 C.H.R.R. D\/396 (TCDP), au paragraphe 286).\n[24] Finalement, dans la d\u00e9cision Kasongo c. Financement agricole Canada, 2005 TCDP 24, aux paragraphes 29 et 30, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der de mani\u00e8re objective; les arbitres doivent faire preuve de prudence avant de se fier aux perceptions des parties, lesquelles perceptions peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9form\u00e9es en raison de caract\u00e9ristiques de la personnalit\u00e9, comme un degr\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 de sensibilit\u00e9 ou des r\u00e9flexes d\u00e9fensifs importants.\nV. ANALYSE DES ALL\u00c9GATIONS DU PLAIGNANT A. PREMI\u00c8RE ALL\u00c9GATION - L'AVIS D'EMPLOI POUR LE POSTE DE CONTREMA\u00ceTRE DE LA MAINTENANCE POUR LE QUART DE NUIT, JUILLET 2002 [25] Le plaignant a soutenu que :\nsa d\u00e9ficience, son \u00e2ge, sa race, sa couleur ou son origine nationale ou ethnique\nont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l'intim\u00e9e de refuser de l'employer au poste mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus.\n[26] Pour faciliter l'analyse, les motifs ci-dessus seront examin\u00e9s \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le, afin de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie.\n[27] Dans les cas o\u00f9 une preuve prima facie aura \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, les explications de l'intim\u00e9e seront prises en compte.\n(a) Le refus d'embaucher fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience - la preuve prima facie\n[28] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a le diab\u00e8te. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 souffrir de neuropathie aux pieds. Cependant, \u00e0 l'audience, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise relativement \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de son diab\u00e8te, \u00e0 ses r\u00e9percussions sur sa sant\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 la maladie a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9e ni au traitement suivi.\n[29] La plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il croit que Steven Watson, ainsi que tout le monde au travail, sait qu'il a le diab\u00e8te parce qu'il l'aurait vu prendre de l'insuline. Cependant, il n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quand et o\u00f9 les deux superviseurs (Chuck Seeley et Steven Watson) qui ont men\u00e9 l'entrevue pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre l'auraient vu prendre de l'insuline avant que soit affich\u00e9 l'avis d'emploi en juillet 2002 ou pendant que se d\u00e9roulait le processus de s\u00e9lection. Il a avanc\u00e9 qu'ils auraient pu le voir dans la salle \u00e0 manger ou dans la salle de toilettes des hommes. Toutefois, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que M. Seeley, qui se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait en chaise roulante, prenait rarement son repas dans la salle \u00e0 manger et qu'il utilisait habituellement une autre salle de toilettes.\n[30] Le plaignant a de plus t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas soulev\u00e9 la question de son diab\u00e8te pendant l'entrevue pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre, pas plus qu'il ne l'avait fait lors des br\u00e8ves conversations qu'il a eues avec Steven Watson sur le plancher de travail au sujet des t\u00e2ches \u00e0 faire. En d'autres termes, le plaignant n'a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir une d\u00e9ficience pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause et il n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[31] La preuve du plaignant \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait \u00e9vasive, faible et vague. Pour ces motifs, je conclus qu'il n'a pas \u00e9tabli prima facie que sa d\u00e9ficience a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas l'embaucher au poste de contrema\u00eetre de la maintenance pour le quart de nuit en juillet 2002.\n(b) Le refus d'embaucher fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge - la preuve prima facie\n[32] \u00c0 l'audience, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il est n\u00e9 le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1948, donc qu'il avait 53 ans en juillet 2002 quand l'avis d'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9. M. Kenneth Mullan (le candidat retenu) a affirm\u00e9 qu'il est n\u00e9 le 19 janvier 1959, donc qu'il avait 43 ans en juillet 2002 quand l'avis d'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9. Le certificat de naissance de M. Mullan a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve et corrobore son t\u00e9moignage quant \u00e0 son \u00e2ge.\n[33] Dans sa lettre de candidature, le plaignant n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 son \u00e2ge ou sa date de naissance, pas plus qu'il n'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue ou \u00e0 tout autre moment pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce qu'il voulait obtenir un accommodement pour ce motif.\n[34] Aucune preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que l'\u00e2ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur pris en compte dans le choix du contrema\u00eetre de la maintenance au garage d'Edmonton n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite. \u00c0 53 ans, le plaignant \u00e9tait encore \u00e0 de nombreuses ann\u00e9es de l'\u00e2ge normal de la retraite. Le plaignant n'a pas tent\u00e9 de porter son \u00e2ge \u00e0 l'attention de l'intim\u00e9e lors de l'entrevue pour le poste ni \u00e0 tout autre moment pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce. Rien ne prouve que la question de l'\u00e2ge a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e lors de l'entrevue avec le plaignant ou lors de celle avec M. Mullan et rien ne prouve non plus que la diff\u00e9rence d'\u00e2ge entre les deux hommes \u00e9tait apparente \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.\n[35] Je conclus que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli prima facie que son \u00e2ge a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas retenir sa candidature.\n(c.1) Le refus d'embaucher fond\u00e9 sur la race, la couleur, l'origine nationale ou ethnique - la preuve prima facie\n[36] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il postulait pour un poste de contrema\u00eetre depuis son arriv\u00e9e au garage d'Edmonton en 1980. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne l'avait pas fait avant parce qu'il ne croyait pas que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 avoir [traduction] un contrema\u00eetre de couleur maintenant et parce qu'il \u00e9tait en forme, il pouvait donc facilement faire le travail d'un m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde, et parce qu'il pouvait gagner plus d'argent qu'un contrema\u00eetre en raison des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[37] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui avait chang\u00e9 pour qu'il postule en 2002, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] ma sant\u00e9, mon \u00e2ge et a dit ne pas \u00eatre au courant de l'existence de programmes d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi en vigueur au garage d'Edmonton. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il accepterait le poste s'il lui \u00e9tait offert aujourd'hui et que, au moment o\u00f9 avait lieu l'audience, un poste de contrema\u00eetre \u00e9tait libre.\n[38] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a postul\u00e9, il a d'abord pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 Steven Watson au sujet du salaire, des avantages sociaux [traduction] et de tout le reste, mais que M. Watson n'en savait rien. Il a quand m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de postuler, car il croyait que le travail serait moins dur pour lui, puisqu'il avan\u00e7ait en \u00e2ge et que sa sant\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait plus ce qu'elle \u00e9tait.\n[39] Une copie de la demande \u00e9crite soumise par le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite en preuve. Une partie de son contenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 lue et confirm\u00e9e par le plaignant :\n[traduction]\nApr\u00e8s 22 ans de travail comme m\u00e9canicien\/chef d'\u00e9quipe, je fais une demande pour obtenir le poste de contrema\u00eetre de la maintenance.\n[40] En fait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, le plaignant avait 32 ans d'exp\u00e9rience, parce qu'il avait accumul\u00e9 10 ans d'exp\u00e9rience en Afrique du Sud avant d'\u00eatre embauch\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e.\n[41] Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la demande \u00e9crite :\n[traduction]\nJ'ai examin\u00e9 les qualifications qu'il faut avoir pour le poste et je suis qualifi\u00e9 pour tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l'avis d'emploi. Si vous avez besoin de plus de renseignements, je les fournirai \u00e0 votre demande.\n[42] Le plaignant n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'autre curriculum vitae ou preuve de ses qualifications et les superviseurs qui ont men\u00e9 l'entrevue, Chuck Seeley et Steven Watson, ne le lui ont pas demand\u00e9.\n[43] Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 propos du manque de renseignements fournis, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les superviseurs savaient tout \u00e0 son sujet parce qu'il avait pass\u00e9 22 ans au garage d'Edmonton et que M. Watson savait quels dipl\u00f4mes il d\u00e9tenait.\n[44] \u00c0 mon avis, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonnant que M. Watson ait pu se souvenir de tous les brevets que lui avait montr\u00e9s le plaignant en 1989, treize ans avant l'entrevue. Cela dit, j'estime que M. Watson aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement au courant de la qualit\u00e9 du travail accompli par le plaignant au cours de ses nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'emploi en tant que m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde, tant dans l'aire de service que dans l'aire de levage, de ses relations avec ses coll\u00e8gues et de ses habilet\u00e9s en tant que chef d'\u00e9quipe.\n[45] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'entrevue n'a dur\u00e9 qu'environ trois minutes et que, bien que M. Seeley ait eu du papier et un crayon devant lui (les superviseurs et le plaignant \u00e9taient assis de part et d'autre d'un bureau), il n'a pris aucune note en sa pr\u00e9sence.\n[46] Le plaignant a cit\u00e9 M. Mullan \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Mullan a affirm\u00e9 que son entrevue n'avait pas dur\u00e9 longtemps non plus, soit moins d'une demi-heure. Il se rappelle s'\u00eatre fait demander comment il se conduirait s'il \u00e9tait gestionnaire, mais qu'il s'agissait d'une entrevue non officielle, car il connaissait les superviseurs, pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e depuis cinq ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Il se rappelle vaguement que Chuck Seeley a pris des notes pendant l'entrevue, mais on lui avait demand\u00e9 peu de choses au sujet de son exp\u00e9rience de travail. Comme le plaignant, il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il croyait que les superviseurs menant l'entrevue le connaissaient assez bien pour que son expertise ne soit pas mise en question et ne soit pas mentionn\u00e9e pendant la discussion.\n[47] Le plaignant est originaire de l'Inde. M. Mullan est blanc.\n[48] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, selon le crit\u00e8re de Shakes, la preuve prima facie peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie en d\u00e9montrant que le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l'emploi en question, que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et qu'une autre personne, qui n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique distinctive constituant le fondement de la plainte, a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste.\n[49] Puisqu'il est clair que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et que M. Kenneth Mullan, le candidat retenu, ne poss\u00e8de pas la caract\u00e9ristique distinctive constituant le fondement de la plainte, la question est de savoir si le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour l'emploi de contrema\u00eetre et si M. Mullan n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9 que le plaignant.\n[50] M. Mullan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentant syndical au moment o\u00f9 il a postul\u00e9, mais qu'il n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 chef d'\u00e9quipe chez l'intim\u00e9e. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e en 1997 et y avoir travaill\u00e9 comme m\u00e9canicien de classe A1 jusqu'\u00e0 sa promotion au poste de contrema\u00eetre en ao\u00fbt 2002.\n[51] Il n'avait que cinq ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience comme m\u00e9canicien brevet\u00e9, en comparaison des 32 ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience du plaignant. Tout le monde a convenu que le contrema\u00eetre n'a plus \u00e0 accomplir les t\u00e2ches d'un m\u00e9canicien. Cependant, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant selon lequel il est essentiel de conna\u00eetre les t\u00e2ches du m\u00e9canicien pour bien faire le travail de contrema\u00eetre, puisque ce dernier a toujours affaire \u00e0 des m\u00e9caniciens, \u00e0 des conducteurs et \u00e0 des r\u00e9partiteurs qui ont besoin de supervision, de conseils et d'aide.\n[52] La collaboration avec les coll\u00e8gues de travail et les dirigeants constituait \u00e9galement, de l'avis g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, une partie importante du travail du contrema\u00eetre. De nombreux t\u00e9moins ont affirm\u00e9 que le plaignant travaillait bien avec ses coll\u00e8gues. En fait, il entretenait des rapports tr\u00e8s amicaux avec certains d'entre eux et il conservait de saines relations de travail avec d'autres. Pour ce qui est de la direction, il n'a fait \u00e9tat de tensions qu'avec son superviseur, Steven Watson. Gary Peach, qui est aujourd'hui \u00e0 la retraite, mais qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en cause r\u00e9partiteur au centre-ville d'Edmonton, communiquait quotidiennement par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec le plaignant alors qu'il \u00e9tait chef d'\u00e9quipe. Il n'a eu que des bons mots \u00e0 dire au sujet des connaissances du plaignant et de la coop\u00e9ration dont celui-ci a fait preuve quotidiennement durant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'interaction.\n[53] Nizar Dalla (un gestionnaire de la maintenance de Calgary), Richard Baker (\u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque, contrema\u00eetre au garage d'Edmonton), Steven Pejkovic, Gary Peach et Jace Loewen ont tous t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le plaignant \u00e9tait hautement qualifi\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s consciencieux dans son travail, qu'il interagissait bien avec ses coll\u00e8gues et qu'il avait des aptitudes de leadership. Par contre, Richard Baker, Gary Peach et Steven Pejkovic ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que M. Mullan n'avait pas autant de connaissances que le plaignant, qu'il ne se montrait pas aussi coop\u00e9ratif et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas aussi comp\u00e9tent.\n[54] M. Mullan a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e en 1997. Il avait donc 17 ans d'anciennet\u00e9 de moins que le plaignant au garage d'Edmonton. Avant de travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e, M. Mullan n'a pas accumul\u00e9 d'exp\u00e9rience de travail pertinente. Au moment du concours pour l'emploi, M. Mullan \u00e9tait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical depuis environ un an et demi. Le plaignant avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 auparavant d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es.\n[55] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la preuve est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir que le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre et que M. Mullan \u00e9tait moins qualifi\u00e9 ou n'\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9 que le plaignant.\nL'usage inappropri\u00e9 du dossier disciplinaire\n[56] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement introduit un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve selon lequel, malgr\u00e9 ses qualifications \u00e9gales ou sup\u00e9rieures, son dossier disciplinaire pass\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e et que cela a nui \u00e0 sa candidature pour l'emploi. \u00c0 ce sujet, il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon lui, l'intim\u00e9e avait pris en compte de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e un conflit en milieu de travail pour examiner s'il avait les habilet\u00e9s en communication interpersonnelles n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre contrema\u00eetre.\n[57] Le 11 mars 1992 (dix ans avant le concours pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre en cause), le plaignant et son superviseur, Steven Watson, ont eu un diff\u00e9rent. Selon le plaignant, le ton a mont\u00e9, mais il n'y a pas eu de contact physique. Au moment du conflit, le plaignant venait d'utiliser un couteau japonais pour enlever de la fen\u00eatre d'un autobus une vignette autocollante attestant une inspection.\n[58] M. Watson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte officielle contre le plaignant \u00e0 la suite de ce conflit. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, dans cette plainte, M. Watson l'a accus\u00e9 \u00e0 tort de l'avoir menac\u00e9, en lui enfon\u00e7ant le doigt dans la poitrine pendant la querelle et en \u00e9tant en possession de couteaux, ce que M. Watson a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant de l'intimidation.\n[59] Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que cet incident a jou\u00e9 contre le plaignant dix ans plus tard, au cours du processus d'embauche d'un contrema\u00eetre, et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un exemple des mauvaises relations qu'entretenait le plaignant avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs hi\u00e9rarchiques. La preuve donne \u00e0 penser que cet incident a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas embaucher le plaignant, bien qu'elle aurait d\u00fb ne pas en tenir compte vu qu'il s'\u00e9tait produit il y a si longtemps. Le plaignant semble affirmer que, en raison de sa race, l'intim\u00e9e a fouill\u00e9 loin dans ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents professionnels afin de trouver une raison de ne pas retenir sa candidature. De cette mani\u00e8re, sa candidature pouvait ne pas \u00eatre retenue pour le poste bien qu'il poss\u00e9d\u00e2t des qualifications sup\u00e9rieures.\nConclusion\n[60] Je conclus, \u00e0 partir de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli prima facie l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la race relativement au concours pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre en 2002.\n(c.2) Le refus d'embaucher fond\u00e9 sur la race, la couleur, l'origine nationale ou ethnique - l'explication de l'intim\u00e9e\n[61] L'intim\u00e9e a fourni un certain nombre de raisons expliquant pourquoi le poste de contrema\u00eetre a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 M. Kenneth Mullan \u00e0 la suite du concours de juillet 2002.\n(1) M. Mullan \u00e9tait, malgr\u00e9 la preuve du plaignant, le meilleur candidat pour le poste;\n(2) L'embauche de M. Mullan au poste de contrema\u00eetre permettait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de s'adapter \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience physique;\n(3) La d\u00e9cision d'embaucher M. Mullan a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par des individus du bureau de Calgary, lesquels ne connaissaient vraisemblablement pas les candidats personnellement;\n(4) \u00c0 supposer que le plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 injustement au cours du processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste, cela \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 l'animosit\u00e9 personnelle entre le plaignant et Steve Watson et il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas de discrimination.\n[62] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve des explications concernant l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle l'altercation survenue au travail en 1992 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue contre lui lors du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[63] Toutes ces explications seront examin\u00e9es une par une.\nM. Mullan \u00e9tait, malgr\u00e9 la preuve du plaignant, le meilleur candidat pour le poste\n[64] En comparant l'exp\u00e9rience de travail du plaignant \u00e0 celle de M. Mullan, l'intim\u00e9e note que ce dernier n'a soumis qu'une courte lettre de candidature, sans donner de d\u00e9tails sur ses qualifications ou son exp\u00e9rience, dans laquelle il d\u00e9clare n'avoir que 12 ans d'exp\u00e9rience chez l'intim\u00e9e en tant que chef d'\u00e9quipe. Cependant, encore une fois, la preuve soumise \u00e0 l'audience n'\u00e9taye pas cette affirmation, puisque le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 chef d'\u00e9quipe plusieurs fois au cours de ses 22 ann\u00e9es de service chez l'intim\u00e9e, et j'ai conclu que le plaignant avait plus de 12 ans d'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de chef d'\u00e9quipe chez l'intim\u00e9e.\n[65] L'intim\u00e9e a voulu contester l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle il n'a pas eu droit \u00e0 une entrevue \u00e9quitable. Un document pr\u00e9sentant les questions qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es au plaignant lors de l'entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit un preuve. M. Chuck Seeley a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9crit ce document \u00e0 la main pendant l'entrevue avec le plaignant. Les questions qui y figuraient ressemblaient \u00e0 celles que comportaient d'autres documents introduits en preuve, lesquels seraient les notes prises lors des entrevues men\u00e9es avec d'autres candidats pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre en cause et pour d'autres postes de contrema\u00eetres. L'avocate du plaignant a mis en question l'auteur du document et le moment o\u00f9 le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9.\n[66] Finalement, compte tenu de la preuve concernant tant l'entrevue du plaignant que celle de M. Mullan, je ne crois pas qu'il s'agisse d'un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel. J'estime que le document cens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter les notes prises lors de l'entrevue avec le plaignant a bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Chuck Seeley. Bien qu'il soit possible que ces notes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises durant l'entrevue, il est tout aussi possible qu'elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par la suite. Par cons\u00e9quent, le document ne constitue pas une preuve permettant de conclure que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement lors du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[67] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement essay\u00e9 de contester la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 des qualifications du plaignant par rapport \u00e0 celles de M. Mullan en mettant en cause ses connaissances en informatique. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont affirm\u00e9 que, environ un an auparavant, l'intim\u00e9e avait mis en place un nouveau syst\u00e8me informatique appel\u00e9 MCMS visant \u00e0 g\u00e9rer la maintenance au garage d'Edmonton. Tous les m\u00e9caniciens ont d\u00fb apprendre \u00e0 l'utiliser afin d'ex\u00e9cuter les commandes, d'obtenir leur emploi du temps, de remplir leurs fiches de pr\u00e9sence \u00e9lectroniques et de consulter certains manuels d'instructions sur la maintenance. Tant le chef d'\u00e9quipe que le contrema\u00eetre devaient utiliser ce syst\u00e8me. M. Mullan a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ce syst\u00e8me au cours de son entrevue, que ses superviseurs avaient laiss\u00e9 entendre que, selon eux, il connaissait le syst\u00e8me aussi bien que n'importe qui d'autre devant travailler avec le nouveau programme et que, s'il \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s, ils pouvaient l'aider.\n[68] M. Watson a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il doutait de la comp\u00e9tence du plaignant avec le syst\u00e8me MCMS \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qu'il croyait qu'il \u00e9tait plus lent et moins habile avec le MCMS que d'autres employ\u00e9s. Cependant, le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait parfaitement capable d'utiliser le syst\u00e8me puisqu'il s'en servait quotidiennement en tant que chef d'\u00e9quipe. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant selon lequel il connaissait suffisamment le syst\u00e8me MCMS pour accomplir le travail du contrema\u00eetre et qu'il \u00e9tait au moins aussi comp\u00e9tent que M. Mullan.\n[69] M. Watson a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de l'exp\u00e9rience de travail de M. Mullan. Il a reconnu que M. Mullan \u00e9tait m\u00e9canicien de classe A1 au garage d'Edmonton et qu'il n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 chef d'\u00e9quipe. Il a de plus affirm\u00e9 que M. Mullan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 apprenti m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde imm\u00e9diatement avant d'entrer chez l'intim\u00e9e, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 apprenti m\u00e9canicien g\u00e9n\u00e9ral avant cela et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entretien chez Edmonton Transit avant cela. Bref, l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9montrer que M. Mullan \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 que le plaignant, donc la premi\u00e8re explication doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nL'embauche de M. Mullan au poste de contrema\u00eetre permettait \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de s'adapter \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience physique\n[70] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement avanc\u00e9 l'explication selon laquelle la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi lui conf\u00e9rait l'obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement envers ses employ\u00e9s ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Nommer M. Mullan, qui souffre d'arthrite, au poste moins exigeant physiquement de contrema\u00eetre \u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on de s'adapter \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[71] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'avis d'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9, Ken Mullan \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 en raison de son arthrite. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu'il souffrait d'arthrite, car il avait plusieurs fois d\u00fb prendre cong\u00e9 pendant plusieurs mois cons\u00e9cutifs. De toute \u00e9vidence, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de sa maladie. Cependant, dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience, M. Mullan a affirm\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement que son arthrite ne l'emp\u00eachait pas d'accomplir toutes les t\u00e2ches incombant au m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde et a dit express\u00e9ment ne pas se consid\u00e9rer comme une personne ayant une d\u00e9ficience et n'avoir pas demand\u00e9 le poste de contrema\u00eetre \u00e0 titre d'accommodement. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il voulait r\u00e9ellement le poste et qu'il a bien fait part de son enthousiasme lors de l'entrevue, car il voulait obtenir la promotion.\n[72] M. Mullan a de plus affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi de contrema\u00eetre chez l'intim\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir occup\u00e9 ce poste pendant environ un an et demi, il voulait reprendre son travail de m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, il se sentait parfaitement capable d'accomplir les t\u00e2ches de m\u00e9canicien de machinerie lourde, mais qu'on ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 la chance de retourner [traduction] sur le plancher. Depuis, il a chang\u00e9 d'emploi d'apr\u00e8s la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin, mais, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en question, il voulait reprendre son ancien travail et se croyait capable de le faire.\n[73] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Mullan \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par ni l'un ni l'autre des superviseurs ayant men\u00e9 l'entrevue, Steven Watson et Chuck Seeley. Aucun repr\u00e9sentant du bureau de Calgary de l'intim\u00e9e n'a t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[74] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime que cette autre explication de l'intim\u00e9e - selon laquelle elle a embauch\u00e9 M. Mullan au poste de contrema\u00eetre dans le but de s'adapter \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience - n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte.\nLa d\u00e9cision d'embaucher M. Mullan a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par des individus du bureau de Calgary, lesquels ne connaissaient vraisemblablement pas les candidats personnellement\n[75] L'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que ses actes n'\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires en soutenant que la d\u00e9cision finale d'embaucher M. Mullan plut\u00f4t que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par des personnes du bureau de Calgary, et non par une personne du garage d'Edmonton. Toutefois, j'estime que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9ritablement prise par Steven Watson, avec l'accord de Chuck Seeley. L'intim\u00e9e a choisi de ne faire t\u00e9moigner que Steven Watson pour sa d\u00e9fense et personne du bureau de Calgary n'a comparu pour t\u00e9moigner. Il ressort clairement des preuves apport\u00e9es par M. Seeley et par M. Watson, lorsqu'elles sont examin\u00e9es conjointement, qu'ils avaient choisi avant d'appeler le bureau de Calgary d'offrir le poste \u00e0 M. Mullan et qu'ils ont fait part de leurs conclusions tir\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite des entrevues de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que ce soit bien M. Mullan qui soit embauch\u00e9.\n[76] Je suis d'avis qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une explication convaincante ou raisonnable.\n\u00c0 supposer que le plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 injustement au cours du processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste, cela \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 l'animosit\u00e9 personnelle entre le plaignant et Steven Watson et il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas de discrimination\n[77] L'intim\u00e9e affirme que le superviseur Steven Watson et le plaignant ont eu des diff\u00e9rends par le pass\u00e9. Pour illustrer ses propos, elle affirme que le plaignant s'est plaint de M. Watson aupr\u00e8s d'autres employ\u00e9s et qu'il a mis en doute ses capacit\u00e9s de gestionnaire, ce qui a caus\u00e9 des tensions entre les deux hommes. L'intim\u00e9e insiste sur le fait que les tensions entre M. Watson et le plaignant ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite, mais plut\u00f4t sur un conflit de personnalit\u00e9.\n[78] M. Watson et le plaignant d\u00e9clarent dans leur t\u00e9moignage que, \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des amis proches, tant au travail qu'\u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du travail. Bien que M. Watson ait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au garage d'Edmonton en 1973 et que le plaignant ait commenc\u00e9 en 1980, M. Watson a d\u00fb travailler pour gravir les \u00e9chelons de la hi\u00e9rarchie. Le plaignant est entr\u00e9 au garage d'Edmonton en tant que m\u00e9canicien brevet\u00e9. M. Watson a \u00e9t\u00e9 apprenti avec le plaignant et M. Watson a d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 sous la supervision du plaignant. Le plaignant a consacr\u00e9 de son propre temps \u00e0 aider M. Watson \u00e0 obtenir son brevet de m\u00e9canicien. Ils ont souvent travaill\u00e9 ensemble sur des voitures \u00e0 la ferme d'un ami et ils sortaient manger ensemble. Leur relation personnelle s'est cependant aigrie apr\u00e8s que M. Watson fut devenu le sup\u00e9rieur du plaignant.\n[79] Compte tenu de leurs liens personnels \u00e9troits, la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve donne \u00e0 penser que les tensions survenues entre eux n'\u00e9taient pas de nature discriminatoire.\n[80] J'estime que le conflit de personnalit\u00e9 entre le plaignant et Steven Watson a influenc\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e la fa\u00e7on dont M. Watson a g\u00e9r\u00e9 le processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre de nuit \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2002. L'entrevue qu'ont men\u00e9e M. Watson et M. Seeley avec le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve. M. Watson a pos\u00e9 les questions; il n'a pas abord\u00e9 comme il l'aurait fallu les qualifications du plaignant et il ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 les renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires que le plaignant avait propos\u00e9 de fournir. M. Watson a exag\u00e9r\u00e9, avec la participation de M. Seeley, les qualifications de M. Mullan quand il a fait part des r\u00e9sultats des entrevues aux personnes de Calgary devant prendre la d\u00e9cision.\n[81] De m\u00eame, je crois que M. Watson a tent\u00e9 de nuire \u00e0 la candidature du plaignant en utilisant contre lui le conflit survenu au travail en 1992. Steven Watson a affirm\u00e9 que tout employ\u00e9, s'il le d\u00e9sire, a le droit d'examiner son propre dossier dans le bureau de M. Watson. Apr\u00e8s examen de son dossier personnel, l'employ\u00e9 a le droit de d\u00e9truire ou de faire d\u00e9truire toute trace de mesure disciplinaire ou document semblable apr\u00e8s cinq ans. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu'un conflit se soit v\u00e9ritablement produit, il a eu lieu dix ans avant que le plaignant ne demande le poste de contrema\u00eetre; l'incident s'\u00e9tait donc produit longtemps auparavant et n'\u00e9tait pas pertinent dans le cadre du concours. Malgr\u00e9 cela, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrent que Steven Watson en voulait encore personnellement au plaignant en raison de cet incident. Compte tenu de leur amiti\u00e9 aigrie, il est plus que probable que ce soit le cas.\n[82] La preuve \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle M. Watson ne voulait pas avoir affaire au plaignant plus souvent, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas si ce dernier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 contrema\u00eetre, en raison du conflit survenu plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant entre les deux hommes ainsi que de la suspicion et de l'animosit\u00e9 qui en ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9. Le plaignant, pour sa part, a l'impression d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de l'animosit\u00e9 que le superviseur Steven Watson lui t\u00e9moignait, ce qui semble justifi\u00e9, compte tenu de la preuve.\n[83] Cependant, il faut qu'il y ait un lien entre l'acte \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude et un motif de distinction illicite. Le lien peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duit \u00e0 partir d'une preuve circonstancielle, mais la conclusion de discrimination doit \u00eatre plus probable que toute autre conclusion possible. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de cela, le plaignant peut utiliser les autres recours qu'offrent le milieu de travail, le syndicat ou les tribunaux civils, mais il n'a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re permettant de prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne.\n[84] La protection pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e lorsque les difficult\u00e9s qu'a subies le plaignant au travail ne sont dues qu'\u00e0 un conflit de personnalit\u00e9 avec un superviseur (voir Hill c. Air Canada (2003), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/456 (T.C.D.P.), aux paragraphes 132, 164, 165, 169 et les d\u00e9cisions qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es).\n[85] En l'esp\u00e8ce, j'estime que l'animosit\u00e9 personnelle entre le plaignant et M. Watson explique de mani\u00e8re convaincante l'acte discriminatoire prima facie qui se serait produit lors du processus de s\u00e9lection. Cette animosit\u00e9 est issue de l'interaction entre les deux hommes ainsi que de leurs cheminements de carri\u00e8re diff\u00e9rents et n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec la race, la couleur ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique du plaignant - ni d'ailleurs avec son \u00e2ge ou sa d\u00e9ficience. Il est plus probable que l'animosit\u00e9 personnelle soit fond\u00e9e sur les tensions pass\u00e9es li\u00e9es au travail que sur un motif illicite de distinction.\n[86] Puisque l'intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable, la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation est rejet\u00e9e.\nB. DEUXI\u00c8ME ALL\u00c9GATION - HARC\u00c8LEMENT PASS\u00c9 ET PR\u00c9SENT COMMIS PAR LES COLL\u00c8GUES ET LES GESTIONNAIRES [87] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relativement \u00e0 huit incidents ou traits caract\u00e9ristiques illustrant ce qu'il a v\u00e9cu au travail, lesquels, selon lui, constituent du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la race, au sens de l'article 14 de la LCDP. Ces huit incidents ou traits caract\u00e9ristiques seront examin\u00e9s un \u00e0 la fois.\n(i) Le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail que lui a fait subir le contrema\u00eetre de l'\u00e9poque, Bruce Morrison, \u00e0 partir de 1984\n[88] Le plaignant a introduit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves relativement \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement qu'il aurait subi au travail du fait du contrema\u00eetre de l'\u00e9poque, Bruce Morrison, lequel harc\u00e8lement aurait commenc\u00e9 en 1984 et se serait poursuivi pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte officielle relative aux droits de la personne, \u00e9galement fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge, la race et la d\u00e9ficience, contre l'intim\u00e9e en 1990, laquelle plainte a fait l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate et a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en 1994. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Morrison \u00e9tait celui qui l'avait r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 de chef d'\u00e9quipe \u00e0 m\u00e9canicien, qu'il avait prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des remarques \u00e0 connotation raciale dans son dos et qu'il avait refuser de le laisser suivre les cours [traduction] que recevaient les m\u00e9caniciens blancs.\n[89] Le plaignant est d'avis que, bien que sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 1990 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, il faudrait encore la prendre en compte dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente audience en tant qu'\u00e9l\u00e9ment prouvant que la discrimination a commenc\u00e9 dix-neuf ans avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis d'accord avec l'intim\u00e9e et j'estime que cette affaire s'est produite il y a trop longtemps par rapport \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte pour qu'il convienne de la consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant un facteur dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux la prendre en compte ni en tant qu'incident isol\u00e9 ni en tant qu'acte parmi d'autres constituant du harc\u00e8lement.\n(ii) Les fausses accusations d'avoir prof\u00e9r\u00e9 des menaces contre M. Watson le 11 mars 1992\n[90] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le 11 mars 1992, le plaignant et Steven Watson ont eu un conflit au travail le 11 mars 1992. Selon M. Watson, lors de cet incident, le plaignant l'a menac\u00e9 en lui enfon\u00e7ant deux doigts dans la poitrine de mani\u00e8re mena\u00e7ante alors qu'il avait \u00e0 la main un couteau japonais. En fin de compte, Steven Watson a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en bonne et due forme contre le plaignant, ce qui l'a beaucoup tourment\u00e9, car ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 bons amis. Il affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision par ses sup\u00e9rieurs, qui l'ont convaincu qu'il devait prendre ces mesures officielles afin d'assurer le maintien du respect qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb et qui \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 son rang. Selon ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9crit dans la plainte officielle, le plaignant avait [traduction] des petits couteaux en sa possession, ce qui a intimid\u00e9 M. Watson. Cependant, au cours de l'audience, M. Watson a confirm\u00e9 que le plaignant avait dans la main un couteau japonais, dont il se servait pour travailler, et non [traduction] des petits couteaux.\n[91] Deux documents en particulier ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis relativement \u00e0 cet incident. L'un d'eux, introduit par l'intim\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme contenant des documents administratifs (appel\u00e9s formulaires 6) montrant que des mesures disciplinaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises contre le plaignant relativement \u00e0 cet incident et d\u00e9crivant l'incident comme M. Watson l'avait fait, sauf la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux petits couteaux qu'aurait poss\u00e9d\u00e9s le plaignant. Le formulaire 6 est un formulaire utilis\u00e9 fr\u00e9quemment au garage d'Edmonton pour diverses raisons. Il est indiqu\u00e9 sur le formulaire \u00e0 qui des copies doivent \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es. Dans le cas de mesures disciplinaires, la personne vis\u00e9e re\u00e7oit normalement une copie du formulaire. Selon le formulaire 6 produit, le plaignant en aurait re\u00e7u une copie.\n[92] Cependant, dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir pas re\u00e7u de mesure disciplinaire et n'avoir jamais re\u00e7u le formulaire 6 faisant \u00e9tat de la r\u00e9primande produit en preuve. Le formulaire 6 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au plaignant lors du contre-interrogatoire et l'avocate du plaignant s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 son introduction. Elle a soutenu que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait tenue de divulguer tout le dossier d'emploi du plaignant et qu'elle n'avait pas divulgu\u00e9 auparavant les documents en question.\n[93] J'ai permis que les documents soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au plaignant parce que les documents du formulaire 6 rempli relativement \u00e0 l'incident s'\u00e9tant produit en 1992 peuvent ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s pertinents avant l'audience. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le plaignant a fait sous serment des d\u00e9clarations que les documents tendent \u00e0 r\u00e9futer, j'autorise l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 les introduire, car la question de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience. Lors du contre-interrogatoire, les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits en tant que pi\u00e8ce uniquement afin de les identifier, car rien ne prouvait que le plaignant les avait vu auparavant et il a donc t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne les reconnaissait pas.\n[94] Par la suite, les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits en tant que documents administratifs, gard\u00e9s dans le cours normal des activit\u00e9s par Steven Watson.\n[95] L'autre document relatif \u00e0 cet incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit par le plaignant, lequel document serait une copie d'une plainte \u00e9crite r\u00e9dig\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, dans laquelle le superviseur du plaignant, Steven Watson, pr\u00e9sente les d\u00e9tails de l'incident. Cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9chir\u00e9e, puis r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la poubelle par le plaignant et d'autres personnes. Le plaignant a conserv\u00e9 ce document depuis ce temps.\n[96] Steven Pejkovic a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le plaignant au sujet de l'incident du 11 mars 1992. Il a affirm\u00e9 n'avoir jamais vu le plaignant \u00eatre agressif physiquement envers qui que ce soit au garage au cours des ann\u00e9es. Toutefois, il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent au moment o\u00f9 s'est produit l'incident du 11 mars 1992 et qu'il ne pouvait donc pas confirmer ce qui s'\u00e9tait produit. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas cit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin (autre que M. Watson) \u00e0 compara\u00eetre relativement \u00e0 l'incident.\n[97] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de Steven Watson. Il s'est montr\u00e9 assez \u00e9motif lorsqu'il a racont\u00e9 avoir longuement h\u00e9sit\u00e9 avant de signaler un incident qui entra\u00eenerait des mesures disciplinaires contre le plaignant, en raison de leur ancienne amiti\u00e9. Il a admis que la mention des [traduction] petits couteaux, qui appara\u00eet dans le premier document, \u00e9tait une erreur et il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il se souvenait clairement des d\u00e9tails. Cela faisait contraste avec la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation totale du plaignant. J'estime que l'incident s'est bien produit comme l'a d\u00e9crit Steven Watson et que le plaignant a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9primande.\n[98] Cependant, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la position du plaignant selon laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 faussement accus\u00e9 et qu'il s'agit d'un exemple du harc\u00e8lement continu de la part de la direction, harc\u00e8lement dont il serait victime pour des motifs de discrimination. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet incident n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec la race du plaignant et qu'il d\u00e9coulait plut\u00f4t de l'animosit\u00e9 personnelle entre le plaignant et Steven Watson. \u00c0 l'audience, l'un et l'autre ont ni\u00e9 l'existence de toute animosit\u00e9 entre eux, mais elle ressort clairement de leur t\u00e9moignage respectif. En cons\u00e9quence, je ne peux accorder d'importance \u00e0 cet incident dans mon analyse relative au harc\u00e8lement.\n(iii) L'horaire des vacances du plaignant en 2000\n[99] Le plaignant soutient que sa demande de vacances d'\u00e9t\u00e9 en 2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 son insu. L'\u00e9tablissement de l'horaire des vacances au garage d'Edmonton est r\u00e9gi par la convention collective. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 lors de son contre-interrogatoire qu'il n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de grief relativement \u00e0 l'incident en question. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit d'autre incident concernant les vacances depuis ce temps. Il a par contre affirm\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu des incidents concernant les vacances avant celui en question, mais il n'a pas donn\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails ou de dates et aucune preuve corollaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'appui. Par cons\u00e9quent, le seul incident sur lequel je dois me pencher est celui s'\u00e9tant produit en 2000.\n[100] En avril 2000, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 des vacances du 17 juin au 30 juin 2000. En raison de son anciennet\u00e9, il aurait d\u00fb avoir droit \u00e0 son premier choix. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 achet\u00e9 des billets d'avion et fait des projets pour passer ses vacances aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il ne fait aucun doute que la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e. Une copie de la demande \u00e9crite \u00e0 la main a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite en preuve, laquelle copie montre clairement que l'ann\u00e9e 2000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 biff\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e par 2001. Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite concernant la personne qui pourrait \u00eatre responsable de la modification. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne l'a pas fait et j'accepte son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet. Il n'aurait pas pris le risque de g\u00e2cher ses vacances et de permettre \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre de se voir attribuer la p\u00e9riode de vacances qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait.\n[101] Le plaignant a bien d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en question, il a remis sa demande \u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait alors le deuxi\u00e8me superviseur au garage d'Edmonton, Chuck Seeley. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Steven Watson lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour lui signaler qu'il avait demand\u00e9 des vacances pour la mauvaise ann\u00e9e. Bien qu'il n'ai pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de grief par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son syndicat, le plaignant a par contre consult\u00e9 Keith Hutchings, alors dirigeant syndical, ainsi qu'un directeur principal des relations avec les employ\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s leur intervention, le plaignant a re\u00e7u les vacances qu'il avait demand\u00e9es, mais il semble qu'il ne les aurait pas obtenues sans leur intervention. Cette p\u00e9riode de vacances avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 au deuxi\u00e8me employ\u00e9 ayant le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 et il a fallu revenir sur cette d\u00e9cision.\n[102] Le plaignant affirme qu'il s'agit d'un exemple de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail que lui fait subir la direction. Puisque le plaignant avait donn\u00e9 sa demande \u00e0 son superviseur, Chuck Seeley, et que la preuve devant moi r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la seule autre personne ayant eu la demande entre les mains \u00e9tait le superviseur Steven Watson, je conclus que la demande de vacances a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par une personne de la direction.\n[103] En outre, la direction n'a pas agi convenablement pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation quand elle a d\u00e9couvert que le plaignant n'avait pas modifi\u00e9 sa demande. L'intim\u00e9e a bel et bien donn\u00e9 au plaignant les vacances auxquelles il avait droit en fin de compte, mais uniquement apr\u00e8s qu'il eut demand\u00e9 l'aide de personnes occupant un rang plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 au sein de l'entreprise. Ses superviseurs directs ont refus\u00e9 de lui accorder ce \u00e0 quoi il avait droit, bien qu'il soit vite apparu clairement que sa demande de vacances comportait une erreur. Quelqu'un a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 sa demande et ses sup\u00e9rieurs imm\u00e9diats, soit Steven Watson et Chuck Seeley, n'ont pas r\u00e9agi comme il le fallait quand ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s du probl\u00e8me. Cette situation n'aurait pas d\u00fb n\u00e9cessiter l'intervention du syndicat pour \u00eatre corrig\u00e9e.\n[104] Cependant, afin de constituer du harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14, l'incident doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Rien dans la preuve ne laisse croire que la modification de la demande de vacances du plaignant, ou la r\u00e9action de la direction \u00e0 la situation, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en tout ou en partie sur la race du plaignant.\n(iv) La menace de Steve Watson, le 23 juillet 2003, de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant s'il obtenait le poste de contrema\u00eetre\n[105] Le plaignant affirme que, au moment o\u00f9 il a pris des renseignements au sujet du concours pour le poste de contrema\u00eetre de la maintenance pour le quart de nuit, le superviseur Steven Watson lui a dit qu'il le cong\u00e9dierait s'il obtenait le poste, parce qu'il ne serait plus membre du syndicat. M. Watson nie avoir dit cela. Cependant, le t\u00e9moin du plaignant, Euclide Plamondon, un m\u00e9canicien d'entretien au garage d'Edmonton, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Watson avait dit cela au plaignant en sa pr\u00e9sence. Selon ce que M. Plamondon se rappelle, M. Watson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] Si tu obtiens le poste, je vais de cong\u00e9dier. Tu ne seras plus membre du syndicat. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Plamondon \u00e0 ce sujet. Il se souvenait clairement des circonstances dans lesquelles les paroles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dites, de sa r\u00e9action et de la r\u00e9action du plaignant.\n[106] \u00c0 l'audience, beaucoup de temps a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la question de savoir si, en fait, le plaignant aurait pu \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 ou mis \u00e0 pied s'il avait obtenu le poste de contrema\u00eetre. Qu'il ait pu \u00eatre en fait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 ou non une fois qu'il n'aurait plus \u00e9t\u00e9 membre du syndicat n'est pas pertinent dans le cadre de la plainte, laquelle est fond\u00e9e sur ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit au plaignant. J'accepte les t\u00e9moignages du plaignant et de M. Plamondon selon lesquels Steven Watson a prof\u00e9r\u00e9 la menace et qu'il l'a fait publiquement, sur le plancher de travail, en pr\u00e9sence de M. Plamondon.\n[107] Cependant, la suite du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait curieuse. M. Plamondon a affirm\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait pas que Steven Watson faisait une farce quand il a formul\u00e9 la remarque; il croyait que M. Watson \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieux. Toutefois, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il ne croyait pas que M. Watson \u00e9tait [traduction] vraiment s\u00e9rieux et qu'il croyait que M. Watson [traduction] faisait une farce. Si le plaignant a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la remarque comme \u00e9tant une farce, on peut douter qu'il l'ait vraiment per\u00e7ue comme \u00e9tant [traduction] malvenue. Il a n\u00e9anmoins postul\u00e9 pour le poste.\n[108] Cela dit, m\u00eame si le plaignant a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la menace de M. Watson comme \u00e9tant des paroles malvenues qui empoisonnaient le milieu de travail, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la menace \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la race du plaignant ou qu'elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un autre motif de distinction illicite. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'incident ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un exemple de harc\u00e8lement.\n(v) L'incident impliquant Ken Pauli, le 4 octobre 2005\n[109] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 4 octobre 2005, un autre m\u00e9canicien, Ken Pauli, l'a harcel\u00e9 au travail en lui lan\u00e7ant des insultes comme [traduction] stupide, [traduction] paresseux et [traduction] tout le reste. Il \u00e9tait chef d'\u00e9quipe, c'\u00e9tait une journ\u00e9e f\u00e9ri\u00e9e et M. Watson n'\u00e9tait pas au travail cette semaine-l\u00e0. Nizar Dalla, une gestionnaire de Calgary, \u00e9tait en devoir plus tard cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] M. Watson avait pris une semaine de vacance et j'avais l'impression qu'il avait permis \u00e0 Ken Pauli de me harceler. Pour s'expliquer, il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il croyait que [traduction] [M. Watson] avait fait en sorte que Ken Pauli me harc\u00e8le. Son raisonnement est qu'il n'avait jamais eu de probl\u00e8me avec Ken Pauli auparavant.\n[110] Marcia Reynold, du service des ressources humaines de l'intim\u00e9e, a conseill\u00e9 au plaignant de d\u00e9poser une plainte \u00e9crite au sujet de l'incident, ce qu'il a fait. Par la suite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant que Mme Reynolds avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate et il a re\u00e7u une lettre de Mme Reynolds dans laquelle M. Pauli reconnaissait l'avoir harcel\u00e9 et avoir agi contrairement \u00e0 la politique sur les relations de l'intim\u00e9e, laquelle politique est affich\u00e9e bien en vue au garage d'Edmonton et dans d'autres lieux de travail appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. L'enqu\u00eate n'a pas port\u00e9 sur la racisme, seulement sur le harc\u00e8lement. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait senti que la race \u00e9tait en cause, mais il ne l'a pas signal\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte \u00e0 son travail. Il a \u00e9galement senti que la conduite de M. Pauli \u00e9tait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de M. Watson pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. (Cependant, il n'a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 formellement \u00e0 l'audience, ni avant, qu'il y avait eu repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l'article 14.1 de la Loi.)\n[111] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait du [traduction] seul incident qu'il avait eu avec qui que ce soit sur le plancher au garage et qu'il s'agissait d'un [traduction] incident isol\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Watson a ni\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 auparavant de la conduite de M. Pauli et il a confirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en vacances au moment o\u00f9 l'incident s'est produit. Rien ne prouve que M. Watson a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans cet incident, que ce soit en l'ayant encourag\u00e9 ou en l'ayant approuv\u00e9. L'enqu\u00eate suivant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au travail par le plaignant n'a pas vis\u00e9 M. Watson. Au mieux, l'impression du plaignant selon laquelle M. Watson a pouss\u00e9 M. Pauli \u00e0 le harceler pendant que M. Watson \u00e9tait en vacances n'est que pure hypoth\u00e8se.\n[112] En outre, la seule preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant donnant \u00e0 penser que la race a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la conduite de M. Pauli \u00e9tait la d\u00e9claration du plaignant selon laquelle il croyait que la race \u00e9tait en cause, bien qu'il ne l'ait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au travail.\n[113] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le plaignant n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cet incident peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un exemple de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14.\n(vi) Le refus de permettre de suivre de la formation et des cours\n[114] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en de nombreuses occasions, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre des cours sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, mais il n'en a pas re\u00e7u l'autorisation. La question des cours et de la formation peut faire l'objet d'un grief r\u00e9gi par la convention collective, mais le plaignant n'en a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9, bien qu'il ait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un dirigeant syndical, Nelson Holst.\n[115] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend s'\u00eatre vu refuser la chance de suivre les cours ou de recevoir la formation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts aux autres employ\u00e9s et que, au fil des ann\u00e9es, ces refus ont nui \u00e0 l'avancement de sa carri\u00e8re et ont eu des r\u00e9percussions directes sur sa capacit\u00e9 d'accomplir certaines t\u00e2ches sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. En plus d'all\u00e9gations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de discrimination relativement \u00e0 l'inscription aux cours, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que, en 2001, il s'\u00e9tait vu refuser la chance d'obtenir son permis de classe 2 (une am\u00e9lioration par rapport \u00e0 son permis de classe 3) et que, en 2003, quand il a suivi et \u00e9chou\u00e9 le cours sur l'air climatis\u00e9 devenu r\u00e9cemment obligatoire, il a soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 le superviseur Steven Watson d'avoir influenc\u00e9 l'instructeur pour qu'il ne lui donne pas la note de passage.\n[116] Le plaignant a produit peu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant qu'il n'a pas re\u00e7u la formation ad\u00e9quate au cours de ses ann\u00e9es d'emploi. Cependant, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu'il n'avait pas eu droit aux cours les plus longs qu'il avait demand\u00e9s ou dont il croyait avoir besoin pour maintenir son niveau de comp\u00e9tence dans son travail. En particulier, en 2000 ou vers cette date, une nouvelle exigence est entr\u00e9e en vigueur, laquelle obligeait les m\u00e9caniciens ayant un permis de classe 3 \u00e0 obtenir un permis de classe 2 pour pouvoir transporter un passager lorsqu'ils testent les autobus. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de pouvoir transporter des passagers quand le m\u00e9canicien souhaite emmener un apprenti ou un autre passager avec lui quand il teste l'autobus pour les vibrations ou quelque trouble semblable. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que plusieurs m\u00e9caniciens ont obtenu leur permis de classe 2 et que, lorsque le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Steven Watson de suivre le cours, ce dernier lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il avait suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s ayant la nouvelle classification. Il n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette formation et, encore aujourd'hui, il ne peut tester les autobus \u00e0 moins qu'un employ\u00e9 ayant un permis de classe 2 l'accompagne. En tant que m\u00e9canicien ayant le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 au garage, et agissant souvent \u00e0 titre de chef d'\u00e9quipe, il s'agit v\u00e9ritablement d'une restriction \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'accomplir les t\u00e2ches qu'il pouvait accomplir auparavant. Plusieurs m\u00e9caniciens, dont le plaignant en tant que chef d'\u00e9quipe est le superviseur, poss\u00e8dent maintenant ce permis de classe 2.\n[117] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il travaillait principalement dans l'aire de levage, il travaillait sur des moteurs, mais qu'il n'a jamais re\u00e7u de cours sur les moteurs. Il a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 un cours sur l'\u00e9lectronique offert en 2003 portant sur analyseur informatis\u00e9 permettant de d\u00e9celer ce qui ne fonctionne pas dans les moteurs d'autobus. Il a affirm\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s devaient utiliser cet analyseur, qu'ils travaillent dans l'aire de service, dans l'aire de levage ou n'importe o\u00f9 ailleurs. On lui a refus\u00e9 cette opportunit\u00e9.\n[118] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement donn\u00e9 l'exemple d'un cours sur l'air climatis\u00e9 (AC) qu'il demandait \u00e0 suivre depuis 1999, mais qu'il n'a suivi qu'en 2003 apr\u00e8s avoir dit \u00e0 un dirigeant syndical qu'on lui refusait ce cours. Il avait beaucoup travaill\u00e9 sur les appareils d'AC des autobus. Il estime que le cours est tr\u00e8s pertinent et essentiel pour sa carri\u00e8re. Selon les r\u00e8glements provinciaux de l'Alberta actuellement en vigueur, une personne ne peut travailler sur un appareil d'AC que si elle a r\u00e9ussi ce cours et si elle d\u00e9tient le certificat n\u00e9cessaire de l'ICCCR.\n[119] Il s'agissait d'un cours d'une semaine, comportant un examen final o\u00f9 la consultation de toute documentation \u00e9tait permise, et le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9 ce cours. Un certain Peter Jasmin, qui ne travaillait pas pour l'intim\u00e9e, a enseign\u00e9 ce cours. Le plaignant a vu Steven Watson parler avec Peter Jasmin et, bien qu'il n'ait pas entendu ce qu'ils disaient, il a cru qu'ils parlaient de lui. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu'il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le cours \u00e0 cause de l'interf\u00e9rence de Steven Watson. Il n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de grief par l'interm\u00e9diaire du syndicat et il ne s'est pas plaint aupr\u00e8s de l'intim\u00e9e, parce qu'il \u00e9tait embarrass\u00e9. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 que, bien qu'il ait travaill\u00e9 sur les appareils d'AC depuis 1970, il ne peut plus le faire.\n[120] Le plaignant n'a pas apport\u00e9 de preuve montrant qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 reprendre le cours ou \u00e0 refaire l'examen. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, on peut conclure qu'il n'a fait ni l'un ni l'autre.\n[121] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'affirmation du plaignant selon laquelle Steven Watson est intervenu aupr\u00e8s de l'instructeur du cours sur l'AC et qu'il a fait pression sur lui pour qu'il fasse \u00e9chouer le plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y avait harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n(vii) Les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires refus\u00e9es\n[122] Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on lui avait refus\u00e9 la chance de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Selon ce qu'il a pr\u00e9tendu, il a dit \u00e0 Steven Watson il y a quelque temps qu'il souhaitait prendre sa retraite bient\u00f4t et qu'il voulait d'abord am\u00e9liorer sa pension en faisant des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Watson lui a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] Non. Il n'y a pas d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il a ensuite affirm\u00e9 que les autres m\u00e9caniciens blancs pouvaient faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, avant que M. Watson devienne contrema\u00eetre, il avait fait une bonne quantit\u00e9 d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[123] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 d'apporter des pr\u00e9cisions sur les refus, il a affirm\u00e9 que, s'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires il y a deux ans, M. Watson le lui aurait refus\u00e9, mais que la situation avait chang\u00e9 il y a environ un an ou un an et demi. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il y a une p\u00e9nurie de m\u00e9caniciens, donc que les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ne sont pas un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l'heure actuelle.\n[124] Malgr\u00e9 le fait que plusieurs personnes, qui travaillaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en cause chez l'intim\u00e9e et qui travaillent encore chez elle, aient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pour le plaignant, aucune d'entre elles n'a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de leurs propres heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ni sur la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au garage d'Edmonton. La seule preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e par le plaignant et Steven Watson.\n[125] Bien qu'il soit possible que le plaignant se soit parfois vu refuser la permission de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires lorsqu'il l'avait demand\u00e9, son t\u00e9moignage n'est pas clair quant aux dates et aux p\u00e9riodes en cause. Le plaignant n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve suffisante pour \u00e9tablir prima facie que la race a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les d\u00e9cisions de lui refuser l'occasion de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n(viii) Le harc\u00e8lement pass\u00e9 et pr\u00e9sent au travail\n[126] Le plaignant a apport\u00e9 peu d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet autre que ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations et aux incidents particuliers d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9s. Il a affirm\u00e9 que [traduction] toute la situation est de la discrimination raciale en raison de ma race, de mon \u00e2ge et de ma d\u00e9ficience. Sa preuve se r\u00e9sumait \u00e0 [traduction] il y a de la discrimination partout et \u00e0 partout o\u00f9 il y a du travail de col bleu, c'est la m\u00eame chose. Il a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] C'est la m\u00eame sorte de comportement, la m\u00eame mentalit\u00e9, la m\u00eame culture, c'est pareil. Il semble que ce soit le filtre d\u00e9fensif par lequel le plaignant voit tout milieu de travail, y compris le garage d'Edmonton o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 pendant 26 ans.\n[127] Quand on lui a pos\u00e9 des questions sur le harc\u00e8lement actuel all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plainte, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 : [traduction] On m'insulte dans mon dos. Ce n'est jamais fait ouvertement... Il dit \u00eatre au courant parce que [traduction] des gens m'en parlent. Cependant, le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard manque de d\u00e9tails : il n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qui lui en avait parl\u00e9 ni quand on lui en avait parl\u00e9 et il n'a apport\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la nature de la discussion ou quant \u00e0 ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[128] Je conclus que le plaignant n'a pas \u00e9tabli de preuve prima facie relativement \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de harc\u00e8lement. La preuve n'est pas compl\u00e8te ou suffisante.\n[129] Je n'estime pas non plus que les huit incidents ou traits caract\u00e9ristiques de son milieu de travail, lorsqu'ils sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, constituent du harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14 de la LCDP. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, pour qu'il y ait harc\u00e8lement, il doit y avoir un lien entre les actes malvenus et un motif de distinction illicite. Un lien semblable n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour aucun des huit incidents ou caract\u00e9ristiques. Rien dans la preuve ne permet de d\u00e9duire \u00e0 l'existence d'un tel lien relativement \u00e0 l'ensemble des huit incidents ou traits caract\u00e9ristiques ni relativement \u00e0 un sous-groupe de ces incidents ou traits caract\u00e9ristiques.\n[130] La deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nC. TROISI\u00c8ME ALL\u00c9GATION - LE REFUS DE PERMETTRE DE RECEVOIR DE LA FORMATION ET DE SUIVRE DES COURS [131] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle Steven Watson l'aurait harcel\u00e9 en faisant pression sur un instructeur pour qu'il lui fasse \u00e9chouer le cours sur l'AC. Cependant, de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le plaignant affirme \u00e9galement que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e relativement au refus de lui permettre de recevoir de la formation et de suivre des cours constitue un acte discriminatoire tant au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) que de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP.\n[132] Cette all\u00e9gation est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le fait que le plaignant n'a pu suivre les cours pour obtenir un permis de classe 2 et sur l'analyseur \u00e9lectronique et que, pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, il s'est vu refuser l'autorisation de suivre le cours sur l'AC. Tous ces cours sont essentiels au plaignant pour qu'il conserve son niveau de comp\u00e9tence ou pour lui permettre de faire avancer sa carri\u00e8re. En fait, le manque de cours avait compromis la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 faire son travail au garage d'Edmonton malgr\u00e9 son anciennet\u00e9 et son exp\u00e9rience. Tous les cours en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts \u00e0 d'autres m\u00e9caniciens du garage d'Edmonton, souvent \u00e0 ceux qui ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler sous la supervision du plaignant.\n[133] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j'estime qu'il est prouv\u00e9 prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 le plaignant relativement \u00e0 l'approbation pour les cours et la formation. De m\u00eame, il est \u00e9tabli prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e, en la personne de Steven Watson, a bel et bien agi, relativement aux cours et \u00e0 la formation, d'une mani\u00e8re susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi du plaignant.\n[134] Toutefois, afin de s'acquitter du fardeau de la preuve prima facie, la preuve doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision en faveur du plaignant. En l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune preuve ne relie le traitement d\u00e9favorable ou l'annihilation de chances d'emploi \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le plut\u00f4t que le conflit de personnalit\u00e9 entre le plaignant et Steven Watson a influenc\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e les d\u00e9cisions que M. Watson a prises relativement \u00e0 la formation et aux cours offerts au plaignant. Comme je l'ai affirm\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, selon la preuve, je conclus que ce conflit de personnalit\u00e9 n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec la race, l'\u00e2ge ou la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant.\n[135] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la troisi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nVI. D\u00c9CISION [136] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e n'a droit \u00e0 aucuns d\u00e9pens, car la LCDP ne le pr\u00e9voit pas.\nKerry-Lynne D.

Jensen\n[1] Le syndicat Chalk River Technicians and Technologists - 404 (CRTT) demande qu'une ordonnance soit rendue pour substituer CRTT \u00e0 l'auteur d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre \u00c9nergie atomique du Canada limit\u00e9e (EACL), soit le Syndicat international des employ\u00e9s professionnels et de bureau, section locale 404 (le Syndicat international). L'intim\u00e9e a consenti \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[2] En mai 2002, le Syndicat international a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait une violation de l'article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[3] En 2002, au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, le Syndicat international \u00e9tait l'agent n\u00e9gociateur d'une unit\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s de bureau et de services administratifs d'EACL qui travaillent \u00e0 Chalk River. En juin 2004, le Comit\u00e9 national canadien du Syndicat international a exerc\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 l'autonomie pr\u00e9vu par la constitution du Syndicat international, et il est devenu le Syndicat canadien des employ\u00e9es et employ\u00e9s professionnels et de bureau, section locale 404 (le Syndicat canadien). Le Syndicat canadien a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la section locale 404 de changer son nom et son papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate; l'employeur a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du nouveau nom de la section locale. Le Syndicat canadien a continu\u00e9 de traiter avec EACL au nom des employ\u00e9s de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, mais en tant que le Syndicat canadien; EACL ne s'y est pas oppos\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 14 novembre 2005, le Syndicat canadien a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait une violation de l'article 11 de la Loi. Les deux plaintes en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu'elles seraient instruites ensemble.\n[5] En avril 2006, sur ordonnance du Conseil canadien des relations industrielles, le Syndicat canadien a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par CRTT en tant qu'agent n\u00e9gociateur de l'unit\u00e9.\n[6] Le Syndicat canadien a autoris\u00e9 CRTT \u00e0 r\u00e9gler et \u00e0 retirer les deux plaintes en son nom.\n[7] CRTT et le Syndicat canadien ont conclu avec EACL un r\u00e8glement amiable des deux plaintes. Un avis de requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire changer le nom du plaignant a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au Syndicat international, mais il n'a pas r\u00e9pondu.\n[8] Il ressort clairement de l'affidavit de Suzanne Sheridan-Cole, vice-pr\u00e9sidente du Syndicat international au moment o\u00f9 la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, que le Syndicat canadien a remplac\u00e9 le Syndicat international et en a assum\u00e9 toutes les responsabilit\u00e9s et obligations relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats des membres de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. Par la suite, CRTT a remplac\u00e9 le Syndicat canadien et a assum\u00e9 les obligations l\u00e9gales de ce dernier lorsqu'il a obtenu l'accr\u00e9ditation \u00e0 titre de nouvel agent n\u00e9gociateur.\n[9] L'article 36 du Code canadien du travail pr\u00e9voit qu'un syndicat-successeur assume les responsabilit\u00e9s du syndicat remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'agent n\u00e9gociateur pour l'application de la convention collective.\n[10] Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 des modifications \u00e0 des plaintes lorsqu'il \u00e9tait question de clarifier les aspects juridiques de la situation et que l'intim\u00e9 ne subissait aucun pr\u00e9judice; voir Gaucher c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), 2005 TCDP 1. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement accueilli des requ\u00eates visant \u00e0 faire substituer une partie lorsqu'il \u00e9tait convaincu que, m\u00eame si le statut de la partie avait chang\u00e9, elle continuait d'exister en tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nouvelle et assumait l'ensemble des responsabilit\u00e9s et des droits l\u00e9gaux de la partie remplac\u00e9e; voir Bozek c. MCL Ryder Transport Ltd., 2002 CanLII 45937 (T.C.D.P.).\n[11] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal conclut que, pour les motifs suivants, il y a lieu de substituer CRTT au Syndicat international, auteur de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 :\nle Syndicat canadien, CRTT et EACL consentent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate;\nle Syndicat canadien a assum\u00e9 les responsabilit\u00e9s du Syndicat international, comme la constitution de ce dernier l'autorisait \u00e0 le faire;\nen vertu du Code canadien du travail, CRTT est le successeur des droits de repr\u00e9sentation qu'avait le Syndicat canadien;\nil n'y a aucune r\u00e9percussion d\u00e9favorable apparente sur les droits des pr\u00e9tendues victimes et personne n'a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il y en avait.\n[12] CRTT n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 remplacer l'auteur de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11, vraisemblablement parce que le Syndicat canadien et CRTT ont particip\u00e9 aux n\u00e9gociations en vue du r\u00e8glement et que le Syndicat canadien a autoris\u00e9 CRTT \u00e0 r\u00e9gler l'affaire en son nom.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande visant \u00e0 faire remplacer l'auteur de la plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 par CRTT est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKarren A.

INTRODUCTION [1] George Vilven et Robert Neil Kelly ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pilotes chez Air Canada. M. Vilven a travaill\u00e9 chez Air Canada du 26 mai 1986 au 1er septembre 2003, date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez Air Canada. M. Vilven a eu 60 ans le 30 ao\u00fbt 2003. M. Kelly s'est joint \u00e0 Air Canada le 11 septembre 1972 et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez Air Canada le 1er mai 2005. Il a eu 60 ans le 30 avril 2005.\n[2] M. Vilven et M. Kelly \u00e9taient tenus de prendre leur retraite d'Air Canada \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions concernant l'\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite que contient le r\u00e9gime de retraite des pilotes d'Air Canada, lequel r\u00e9gime a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 la convention collective conclue entre Air Canada et l'Association des pilotes d'Air Canada (APAC), le syndicat repr\u00e9sentant les pilotes d'Air Canada.\n[3] L'article en cause du r\u00e9gime de pension pr\u00e9voit qu'il sera mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi de tout pilote chez Air Canada au plus tard le premier jour du mois civil suivant le 60e anniversaire de naissance du pilote.\n[4] Tant M. Vilven que M. Kelly veulent continuer \u00e0 piloter des avions chez Air Canada. Tous deux ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP); M. Vilven a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 5 ao\u00fbt 2004 et M. Kelly, le 5 mars 2006. Dans leur plainte, ils pr\u00e9tendent qu'Air Canada a commis \u00e0 leur endroit un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge, en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) en exigeant qu'ils prennent leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans. M. Kelly a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre l'APAC, dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue qu'il y a violation des articles 9 et 10 et de la LCDP.\n[5] Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'APAC le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la plainte de M. Vilven. Il a \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Fly Past 60 Coalition (la Coalition), laquelle est form\u00e9e d'un groupe de pilotes ou d'anciens pilotes d'Air Canada qui se sont unis dans le but de faire abolir l'\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite chez Air Canada. \u00c0 la demande des parties, le Tribunal a regroup\u00e9 les trois plaintes et elles ont toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues lors de la m\u00eame audience.\n[6] La Coalition a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle dans lequel elle conteste la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP en soutenant que cet alin\u00e9a contrevient au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte) et que cette violation n'est pas justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 1er de la Charte.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [7] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte de M. Vilven contre Air Canada ainsi que les plaintes de M. Kelly contre Air Canada et l'APAC n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9es et doivent donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. Le Tribunal estime que 60 ans est l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, pour ce genre d'emploi. Ainsi, la politique de retraite obligatoire d'Air Canada ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire au regard de la LCDP. Le Tribunal conclut \u00e9galement que l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP ne contrevient pas au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte.\nIII. LES FAITS A. M. Vilven [8] Air Canada a embauch\u00e9 M. Vilven \u00e0 titre de pilote en formation le 26 mai 1986. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 second officier et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un appareil B-727 le 11 septembre 1987. Selon la convention collective, les pilotes utilisent les droits que leur conf\u00e8re leur anciennet\u00e9 pour faire avancer leur carri\u00e8re, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'anciennet\u00e9 influe entre autres sur le type d'appareil qu'ils piloteront, le statut qu'ils auront (capitaine, premier officier ou pilote de rel\u00e8ve) et l'endroit qui leur servira de port d'attache.\n[9] M. Vilven s'est servi de son anciennet\u00e9 pour passer du poste de premier officier \u00e0 bord d'un appareil B-727 \u00e0 celui de premier officier \u00e0 bord d'un A340 bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, \u00e0 partir du 1er ao\u00fbt 2000. M. Vilven a choisi de se servir de son anciennet\u00e9 non pas pour devenir pilote commandant de bord, mais plut\u00f4t pour demeurer pilote \u00e0 bord d'un A340 et \u00eatre bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, o\u00f9 il pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e8s de sa famille.\n[10] M. Vilven a \u00e9t\u00e9 pilote d'un vol d'Air Canada pour la derni\u00e8re fois le 24 ao\u00fbt 2003, tout juste avant son 60e anniversaire de naissance, vol pour lequel il a pilot\u00e9 un appareil A340 de S\u00e9oul \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[11] En application des dispositions du r\u00e9gime de pension en vigueur le 1er septembre 2003, M. Vilven s'est vu reconna\u00eetre 17,3334 ann\u00e9es de service admissibles chez Air Canada. Il s'est \u00e9galement vu reconna\u00eetre 5,5833 ann\u00e9es de service militaire pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant son embauche, soit un total de 22,9167 ann\u00e9es de service admissibles aux fins du calcul de sa pension. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la modalit\u00e9 qu'il a choisie, M. Vilven re\u00e7oit maintenant une pension de 6 094,04 $ par mois, qu'il recevra jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans, et il recevra 5 534,33 $ par mois \u00e0 partir de son 65e anniversaire jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort.\n[12] Depuis qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez Air Canada, M. Vilven a continu\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re de pilote. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pilote chez Flair Airlines d'avril 2005 \u00e0 mai 2006. Il poss\u00e8de une licence de pilote de ligne valide avec la cat\u00e9gorie la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e de qualification de vol aux instruments. Cette licence est valide jusqu'au 1er d\u00e9cembre 2007. M. Vilven a cess\u00e9 de piloter chez Flair Airlines afin de se pr\u00e9parer pour l'audience en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nB. M. Kelly [13] Air Canada a embauch\u00e9 M. Kelly le 11 septembre 1972 \u00e0 titre de second officier de DC-8. Il a pilot\u00e9 un certain nombre de types d'appareils \u00e0 divers titres jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit promu capitaine le 16 janvier 1992. M. Kelly a utilis\u00e9 son anciennet\u00e9 chez Air Canada pour passer de pilote commandant de bord d'un B-727 \u00e0 pilote commandant de bord d'un A340.\n[14] M. Kelly a pilot\u00e9 pour la derni\u00e8re fois un avion d'Air Canada juste avant son 60e anniversaire de naissance, le 30 avril 2005, de Hong Kong \u00e0 Toronto, aux commandes d'un appareil A340-500.\n[15] En application des dispositions du r\u00e9gime de pension en vigueur le 1er mai 2005, M. Kelly s'est vu reconna\u00eetre 32.6667 ann\u00e9es de service admissibles chez Air Canada. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la modalit\u00e9 qu'il a choisie, M. Kelly re\u00e7oit maintenant une pension de 10 223,96 $ par mois, qu'il recevra jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans, et il recevra 9 477,56 $ par mois \u00e0 partir de son 65e anniversaire jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort.\n[16] Depuis qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi chez Air Canada, M. Kelly a continu\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re de pilote et il a toujours poss\u00e9d\u00e9 une licence de pilote de ligne valide, avec un certificat m\u00e9dical de cat\u00e9gorie 1.\n[17] En 2005, il a obtenu un contrat de premier officier \u00e0 bord d'appareils B757 et B767 chez Skyservice Airlines \u00e0 destination de l'Europe et des Cara\u00efbes. Il travaille maintenant \u00e0 titre de capitaine d'un B757 chez Skyservice et il effectue des vols internationaux.\n[18] M. Kelly a obtenu son plus r\u00e9cent certificat m\u00e9dical de cat\u00e9gorie 1 (sans dispense) le 11 octobre 2006. Il a obtenu sa licence et son renouvellement de qualification de vol aux instruments le 16 novembre 2006 en utilisant un simulateur de B767 d'Air Canada \u00e0 Toronto.\nC. Les carri\u00e8res de pilote chez Air Canada [19] Air Canada est un transporteur international et interm\u00e9diaire majeur, qui offre des vols nationaux et des vols internationaux entre le Canada et plusieurs continents et qui effectue r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des vols \u00e0 destination de 33 pays \u00e9trangers (dont les \u00c9tats-Unis).\n[20] Air Canada est l'entreprise qui r\u00e9mun\u00e8re le mieux ses pilotes au Canada et qui offre les meilleurs avantages sociaux et le plus grand nombre de vols internationaux de longue dur\u00e9e int\u00e9ressants et lucratifs. Sa flotte comporte les plus grand nombre d'appareils \u00e0 la fine pointe de la technologie au Canada, ce qui repr\u00e9sente ce que les pilotes souhaitent piloter. De nombreux pilotes consid\u00e8rent qu'Air Canada offre les meilleurs emplois de pilote de l'aviation commerciale au Canada. Le nombre de postes de pilotes chez Air Canada est demeur\u00e9 relativement stable depuis un certain nombre d'ann\u00e9es, soit entre 2 500 et 3 000 postes. Le nombre de personnes postulant pour les emplois de pilotes chez Air Canada exc\u00e8de de beaucoup le nombre de postes vacants.\n[21] Les pilotes d'Air Canada sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'APAC depuis novembre 1995. Avant cette date, ils \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'Association canadienne des pilotes de ligne depuis 1945. La plupart des modalit\u00e9s d'emploi des pilotes travaillant chez Air Canada sont \u00e9tablies par la convention collective conclue entre l'APAC et Air Canada.\nD. Le r\u00e9gime de pension [22] Les pilotes d'Air Canada b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'un r\u00e9gime de pension tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reux. Il est constitu\u00e9 de deux parties : la premi\u00e8re est le r\u00e9gime agr\u00e9\u00e9 de pension r\u00e9gi par la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et la Loi sur les normes de prestation de pension; la deuxi\u00e8me est le r\u00e9gime de pension compl\u00e9mentaire. Le r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9voit des pensions dont le montant exc\u00e8de le maximum permis par la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Ces pensions compl\u00e9mentaires sont pay\u00e9es \u00e0 m\u00eame les recettes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d'Air Canada. Les avantages du r\u00e9gime de pension sont partie int\u00e9grante du syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration n\u00e9goci\u00e9 par l'APAC au nom des pilotes d'Air Canada.\nE. L'anciennet\u00e9 [23] L'anciennet\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s importante chez les pilotes d'Air Canada. De nombreux aspects du travail des pilotes peuvent \u00eatre demand\u00e9s et accord\u00e9s en fonction de l'anciennet\u00e9. Ainsi, l'anciennet\u00e9 permet de d\u00e9terminer le statut du pilote (c'est-\u00e0-dire capitaine, premier officier ou pilote de rel\u00e8ve), son revenu, son port d'attache et l'horaire entre pilotes occupant le m\u00eame poste, d'\u00e9tablir la priorit\u00e9 pour les vacances et de prot\u00e9ger contre les mises \u00e0 pied. L'avancement professionnel et le salaire d'un pilote sont en grande partie tributaires de son anciennet\u00e9.\nF. La r\u00e9glementation de l'aviation commerciale [24] Le Canada n'a pas fix\u00e9 d'\u00e2ge maximal au-del\u00e0 duquel un pilote de ligne ne peut obtenir de licence. Au Canada, pour obtenir leur licence, les pilotes doivent r\u00e9ussir un examen m\u00e9dical approuv\u00e9 par Transport Canada. Les pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de moins de 40 ans doivent subir l'examen m\u00e9dical une fois par an. Les pilotes de plus de 40 ans doivent subir l'examen m\u00e9dical deux fois par an.\n[25] Air Canada est assujettie aux normes et recommandations de l'Organisation de l'aviation civile internationale (OACI) parce que le Canada est signataire (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il est un \u00c9tat contractant) de la Convention relative \u00e0 l'aviation civile internationale sign\u00e9e \u00e0 Chicago (la Convention de Chicago). L'OACI est un organisme de l'Organisation des Nations Unies charg\u00e9e de favoriser la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l'aviation civile et d'\u00e9laborer des normes mondiales r\u00e9gissant l'attribution de licences aux pilotes.\n[26] L'OACI a \u00e9labor\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 des normes ainsi que des recommandations relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge maximal des pilotes effectuant des vols commerciaux de ligne. Selon les normes de l'OACI en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Kelly a pris sa retraite, l'\u00e2ge maximal pour les pilotes commandants de bord \u00e9tait de 60 ans. Les normes de l'OACI en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Vilven a pris sa retraite recommandaient, sans l'obliger, que les pilotes agissant \u00e0 titre de copilotes ne pilotent pas de vols internationaux apr\u00e8s leur 60e anniversaire de naissance.\n[27] Un \u00c9tat contractant est libre d'adopter pour ses pilotes un \u00e2ge maximal moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que la norme de l'OACI. Par contre, cet \u00e2ge maximal moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 ne s'appliquera qu'aux pilotes ayant obtenu leur licence de l'\u00c9tat contractant en question. Il ne s'appliquera pas aux pilotes \u00e9trangers provenant d'autres pays membres de l'OACI, lesquels pilotes n'auront qu'\u00e0 respecter l'\u00e2ge maximal impos\u00e9 par l'OACI pour piloter un avion dans l'\u00c9tat contractant.\n[28] En mars 2006, l'OACI a modifi\u00e9 sa norme relative \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge maximal des pilotes. Cette nouvelle norme de l'OACI, entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 23 novembre 2006, fixe \u00e0 65 ans l'\u00e2ge maximal des pilotes. Elle \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que, \u00e0 bord d'un vol comptant plus d'un pilote, si un des pilotes a plus de 60 ans, l'autre doit avoir moins de 60 ans. L'OACI recommande \u00e9galement que les premiers officiers cessent de piloter des vols commerciaux internationaux \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans.\nIV. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE a) \u00c0 qui incombe le fardeau de la preuve pour ce qui est de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP? Pour \u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y a acte discriminatoire, les plaignants doivent-ils montrer qu'ils n'ont pas atteint l'\u00e2ge de la retraite au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP? Ou incombe-t-il aux intim\u00e9es de montrer que 60 ans constitue l'\u00e2ge de la retraite au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c)?\nb) S'il incombe aux plaignants d'\u00e9tablir ce qu'est l'\u00e2ge normal de la retraite, ont-ils \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge?\nc) Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les intim\u00e9es ont-ils d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que 60 ans est l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les pilotes occupant le m\u00eame genre d'emploi que les plaignants, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) s'applique?\nd) Si l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP s'applique, contrevient-il au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte? Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) est-il justifi\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 1er de la Charte?\ne) Si l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) contrevient \u00e0 la Charte, la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans constitue-t-elle une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP?\n[29] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions, le Tribunal a pris en compte la situation telle qu'elle se pr\u00e9sentait le 1er septembre 2003 pour M. Vilven, date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi, et le 1er mai 2005 pour M. Kelly, date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Il en est ainsi, car les intim\u00e9es ne doivent \u00eatre tenus responsables que des d\u00e9cisions prises \u00e0 partir des faits existants au moment o\u00f9 les actes discriminatoires se seraient produits.\nA. \u00c0 qui incombe le fardeau? [30] Dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et al c. Municipalit\u00e9 d'Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 qu'il incombe au plaignant de prouver prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire. Par la suite, dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique raisonnable de l'employeur intim\u00e9. Quand la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable.\n[31] Dans l'arr\u00eat Stevenson c. Air Canada, [1984] 2 C.F. 691, dans lequel l'alin\u00e9a 14c) [aujourd'hui l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c)] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 en vertu de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que l'alin\u00e9a 14c) circonscrivait ou limitait la protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la LCDP. Seuls ceux qui n'ont pas atteint l'\u00e2ge de la retraite peuvent se plaindre qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 leur emploi en raison de l'\u00e2ge.\n[32] Nulle part dans l'arr\u00eat Stevenson la Cour d'appel n'aborde la question du fardeau de la preuve relativement \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de l'acte discriminatoire. En fait, les termes prima facie et fardeau de la preuve ne sont pas du tout mentionn\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision. Cette absence est compr\u00e9hensible \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission avait rejet\u00e9 la plainte et que la Cour n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 examiner le fardeau de la preuve applicable \u00e0 la preuve prima facie.\n[33] En outre, l'arr\u00eat Stevenson a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu avant que la Cour supr\u00eame rende l'arr\u00eat O'Malley en 1985. Dans O'Malley, la Cour supr\u00eame a reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario d'avoir exig\u00e9 de la Commission et de la plaignante qu'ils \u00e9tablissent que l'employeur n'avait pas pris de mesures raisonnables compte tenu des circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce. Le fardeau, a-t-elle affirm\u00e9, doit incomber tout \u00e0 fait \u00e0 l'employeur, puisque c'est lui qui dispose de l'information n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9montrer l'existence d'une contrainte excessive et que l'employ\u00e9 est rarement, sinon jamais, en mesure d'en d\u00e9montrer l'absence. La Cour a statu\u00e9 que l'attribution du fardeau de la preuve \u00e0 la bonne partie est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du processus.\n[34] Dans certains arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents (Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18; Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 26), la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 l'importance de satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les arr\u00eats Etobicoke et O'Malley et de respecter le fardeau de la preuve incombant tour \u00e0 tour aux deux parties.\n[35] En fait, M. Vilven a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience qu'il a eu beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements au sujet de l'\u00e2ge de la retraite et des politiques de retraites obligatoires en vigueur chez d'autres transporteurs a\u00e9riens au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu'il appelait et expliquait les motifs de sa demande, les repr\u00e9sentants des autres entreprises h\u00e9sitaient toujours \u00e0 lui donner les renseignements qu'il demandait. Air Canada, par contre, avec un peu d'effort, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'obtenir un nombre consid\u00e9rable de donn\u00e9es concernant l'\u00e2ge de la retraite et les politiques de retraite en vigueur chez diff\u00e9rents transporteurs a\u00e9riens au Canada et ailleurs dans le monde.\n[36] Il pourrait \u00eatre soutenu, comme l'ont fait les intim\u00e9es, qu'une analyse textuelle de l'article 15 de la LCDP, qui comparerait les alin\u00e9as 15(1)a) et 15(1)c) de la LCDP, viendrait \u00e9tayer la conclusion selon laquelle le fardeau incombe aux plaignants. Lorsque le fardeau incombe \u00e0 l'employeur, l'article 15 l'\u00e9nonce explicitement.\n[37] L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) est ambigu quant \u00e0 l'attribution du fardeau. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 que le Tribunal doit interpr\u00e9ter toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 de la LCDP d'une mani\u00e8re qui favorise plut\u00f4t que contrecarre la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de la Loi (Bell Canada c. A.C.E.T., [2003] 1 R.C.S. 884, au paragraphe 26; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Lignes a\u00e9riennes Canadien International lt\u00e9e, [2006] 1 R.C.S. 3). Le principal objectif de la LCDP est de favoriser l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances ind\u00e9pendamment de consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires (article 2). Il s'agit d'un moyen de mettre en \u00e9vidence les actes discriminatoires et d'y rem\u00e9dier.\n[38] Compte tenu du d\u00e9savantage qu'ont les plaignants pour ce qui est de l'acc\u00e8s aux renseignements et des ressources financi\u00e8res, leur attribuer le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'ils ont d\u00fb prendre leur retraite \u00e0 un \u00e2ge qui n'est pas l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour leur genre d'emploi contrecarrerait l'objectif visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence d'actes discriminatoires - ou leur absence, d'ailleurs. Il ne s'agirait certainement pas de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP la plus favorable \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de ses objectifs (Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. C.C.D.P., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, \u00e0 la page 1134.)\n[39] L'objectif visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir s'il y a eu ou non acte discriminatoire est mieux atteint en attribuant aux employeurs-intim\u00e9s le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que les plaignants ont d\u00fb prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour le genre d'emploi qu'exercent les plaignants.\nB. Les plaignants et la Commission ont-ils \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire en violation des articles 7, 9 et 10 de la LCDP? [40] L'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. L'\u00e2ge est un des motifs de distinction illicite mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi.\n[41] Selon l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi des plaignants uniquement en raison de l'application des dispositions relative \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite. Chez Air Canada, quand un capitaine ou un premier officier atteint l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans, il est mis fin \u00e0 son emploi; le pilote doit alors prendre sa retraite. Le fait qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi des plaignants chez Air Canada en raison de la politique de retraite obligatoire est une preuve suffisante pour conclure que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi.\n[42] L'article 9 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu'il constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour une organisation syndicale, de prendre toute mesure susceptible soit de priver un adh\u00e9rent de ses chances d'emploi ou d'avancement, soit de limiter ses chances d'emploi ou d'avancement, ou, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, de nuire \u00e0 sa situation. L'ACAP a accept\u00e9 que soient incluses les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire dans le r\u00e9gime de pension d'Air Canada, lesquelles mesures sont incorpor\u00e9es par renvoi \u00e0 la convention collective. La retraite obligatoire a nui \u00e0 la situation professionnelle de M. Kelly. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans le cadre de la plainte relative \u00e0 l'article 9 que M. Kelly a port\u00e9 contre l'APAC, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu acte discriminatoire.\n[43] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 10b) de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi d'un individu, le fait, pour l'employeur ou l'organisation syndicale, de conclure des ententes touchant tout aspect d'un emploi. L'APAC et Air Canada ont conclu une entente concernant la retraite obligatoire, laquelle entente touche l'emploi de M. Kelly et de M. Vilven. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie pour ce qui est des plaintes relatives \u00e0 l'article 10.\nC. Les intim\u00e9es ont-ils d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que 60 ans est l'\u00e2ge de la retraite au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP? [44] L'expression \u00e2ge de la retraite \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) est employ\u00e9 avec l'expression en vigueur pour ce genre d'emploi, soit le genre d'emploi que d\u00e9tient la personne ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte. Cela soul\u00e8ve les deux questions suivantes :\nQuel est le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 pour ce qui est d'\u00e9tablir le genre d'emploi que d\u00e9tenaient les plaignants? Quel est l'\u00e2ge de la retraite?\n(i) Le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 [45] Air Canada a soutenu que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 aux fin de l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) sont les pilotes effectuant des vols internationaux pour des transporteurs comme Air Canada ou des [traduction] transporteurs traditionnels. Air Canada a d\u00e9crit les transporteurs traditionnels comme \u00e9tant des transporteurs internationaux importants, \u00e9tablis depuis longtemps, dont le mod\u00e8le de gestion est en grande partie fond\u00e9 sur les vols internationaux. Les transporteurs \u00e9tablis sont souvent la compagnie de pavillon pour le pays dans lequel se trouve leur si\u00e8ge social.\n[46] Air Canada a pr\u00e9tendu \u00eatre le seul transporteur traditionnel au Canada. Tous les autres transporteurs canadiens poss\u00e8dent un nombre consid\u00e9rablement moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'appareils qu'Air Canada et la nature de leurs activit\u00e9s ne font pas d'eux des transporteurs traditionnels. Par cons\u00e9quent, Air Canada a soutenu que la comparaison doit \u00eatre faite avec les postes de pilotes des autres transporteurs internationaux importants au monde.\n[47] L'APAC a adopt\u00e9 un point de vue assez diff\u00e9rent, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle consid\u00e8re que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 doit \u00eatre compos\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s ayant des modalit\u00e9s d'emploi et des conditions de travail semblables \u00e0 celles des pilotes d'Air Canada. L'APAC a \u00e9galement soutenu que la comparaison doit se limiter aux autres transporteurs canadiens puisque l'article 2 de la LCDP circonscrit l'application de la Loi au champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement.\n[48] La Commission a soutenu que ni l'un ni l'autre des groupes de comparaison propos\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9es ne convenaient. Il serait impossible de d\u00e9terminer quel est l'\u00e2ge normal de la retraite en raison des grandes diff\u00e9rences entre les pilotes quant \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge o\u00f9 ils se retirent, tant au Canada qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\n[49] La Fly Past 60 Coalition a soutenu que rien dans la Loi ne permet d'interpr\u00e9ter l'expression ce genre d'emploi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu'elle d\u00e9signe des emplois dont les titulaires ont des conditions de travail semblables ou des postes chez des transporteurs traditionnels. La Coalition a soutenu qu'un emploi du m\u00eame genre que celui des plaignants est un poste de pilote de ligne, que ce soit un poste de pilote commandant de bord (capitaine) ou de copilote (premier officier), au sein d'entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien poss\u00e9dant des appareils semblables (sans \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement identiques) \u00e0 ceux d'Air Canada.\n[50] Le Tribunal rejette l'argument de l'APAC selon lequel la comparaison doit se limiter aux personnes ayant un emploi au sein d'une entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien dont le si\u00e8ge social se situe en territoire canadien. L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) n'a pas pour objet de r\u00e9gir les individus ou les transporteurs a\u00e9riens hors de sa port\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative. Il ne fait qu'encourager l'\u00e9tablissement d'une comparaison avec les personnes occupant le m\u00eame genre d'emploi.\n[51] En outre, il existe de bonnes raisons de ne pas limiter la comparaison aux emplois semblables au Canada. Comme le Tribunal l'a not\u00e9 dans Campbell c. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602 (T.C.D.P.), si la comparaison se limitait aux emplois au Canada seulement, il risquerait d'en r\u00e9sulter qu'Air Canada fixe de fait la norme quant \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la retraite dans l'industrie. Cela signifierait que, dans les faits, l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) d\u00e9pendrait d'Air Canada.\n[52] Le Tribunal convient avec la Coalition qu'il ne devrait pas y avoir de diff\u00e9rence entre les capitaines et les premiers officiers. Dans l'ensemble, les t\u00e9moins s'\u00e9tant exprim\u00e9s sur la nature de l'emploi s'accordaient pour affirmer que les deux emplois, bien que le capitaine, \u00e0 titre de pilote commandant de bord, soit le responsable de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l'appareil, \u00e9taient par ailleurs tr\u00e8s semblables.\n[53] Selon le Tribunal, la meilleure fa\u00e7on d'\u00e9tablir quel est le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 est de d\u00e9finir les principales caract\u00e9ristiques de l'emploi. La preuve des plaignants a \u00e9tabli que l'une des principales caract\u00e9ristiques de leur emploi est qu'ils effectuaient des vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 bord de gros-porteurs, vers de nombreuses destinations \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, pour une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international. Une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international est une entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien qui est le transporteur principal de son pays, qui emploi un nombre consid\u00e9rable de pilotes et dont les vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers constituent une partie importante de ses activit\u00e9s.\n[54] Il ressortait clairement de la preuve des plaignants que le prestige et le statut d\u00e9coulant du fait de travailler pour une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international, qu'on lui donne le nom de transporteur traditionnel ou de compagnie de pavillon ou tout autre nom, \u00e9tait une des principales caract\u00e9ristiques de l'emploi.\n[55] De ce fait, le Tribunal conclut que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire ce qui correspond au genre d'emploi qu'occupent les plaignants, est constitu\u00e9 des pilotes qui effectuent des vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers pour une importante entreprise de transporte a\u00e9rien international.\n(ii) Quel est l'\u00e2ge de la retraite? [56] Le Tribunal peut adopter deux approches pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question : l'approche normative et l'approche empirique. L'approche normative est tir\u00e9e de la version fran\u00e7aise de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) : Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires le fait de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi d'une personne en appliquant la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d'emploi.\n[57] Cette approche normative exige que l'on cherche une r\u00e8gle r\u00e9gissant l'\u00e2ge maximal de la retraite dans l'industrie du transport a\u00e9rien. Selon le Tribunal, la disposition de l'OACI concernant l'\u00e2ge maximal de la retraite repr\u00e9sente une r\u00e8gle ou une norme, car elle s'applique au m\u00eame groupe d'entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international que le Tribunal a choisi comme groupe de comparaison \u00e9tablissant ce qu'est le genre d'emploi qu'occupent les plaignants.\n[58] En septembre 2003 et en mai 2005, la norme de l'OACI exigeait que les pilotes commandants de bord prennent leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans. L'OACI recommandait, sans l'exiger, que les premiers officiers prennent leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans.\n[59] D'apr\u00e8s l'approche empirique, il faut examiner la preuve statistique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la retraite pour les pilotes de l'aviation commerciale au Canada et les pilotes de l'aviation commerciale \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\n[60] Air Canada est le seul transporteur international important au Canada o\u00f9 les pilotes effectuent des vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers. Bien que Jazz soit le deuxi\u00e8me plus important transporteur a\u00e9rien au Canada, cette entreprise n'effectue que des vols au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Il s'agit d'un transporteur r\u00e9gional, et non d'une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international.\n[61] Aucune des six autres entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien au Canada ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une importante entreprise de transport a\u00e9rien international. Skyservice, Air Transat, Harmony, Canjet et Zoom sont des entreprises exploitant des vols d'affr\u00e8tement et WestJet est un transporteur \u00e0 faibles co\u00fbt qui n'effectuent que peu de vols internationaux. Ensemble, ces six entreprises n'emploient que 885 pilotes, en comparaison des pr\u00e8s de 3 000 pilotes qu'emploie Air Canada.\n[62] Puisque le Tribunal a conclu que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 est constitu\u00e9 des importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international, ces transporteurs canadiens n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 ce groupe et donc ne peuvent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration aux fins de l'\u00e9tablissement de l'\u00e2ge normal de la retraite pour les emplois semblables \u00e0 ceux qu'occupaient les plaignants.\n[63] Les parties ont produit, dans leur expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, un annexe o\u00f9 figuraient 22 transporteurs internationaux \u00e9trangers effectuant des vols internationaux r\u00e9guliers. Cependant, des donn\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes n'ont pu \u00eatre obtenues pour 12 de ces transporteurs.\n[64] Le nombre total de postes de pilote au sein des importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international pour lesquelles les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tes s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 25 308 pour l'ann\u00e9e 2003. En 2003, quand M. Vilven a pris sa retraite, il \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 pour 80 % de ces postes que le titulaire prenne sa retraite \u00e0 60 ans ou avant.\n[65] Les parties ont convenu que le nombre total de pilotes employ\u00e9s par ces transporteurs n'avait pas chang\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous pouvons pr\u00e9sumer que les importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international \u00e9trang\u00e8res (pour lesquelles les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tes) employaient encore environ 25 308 pilotes en 2005, l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Kelly a pris sa retraite.\n[66] Entre 2003 et la fin de 2006, seules deux des importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international imposant la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans ou moins ont fait pass\u00e9 l'\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 63 et \u00e0 65 ans. Ces changements ont eu lieu en novembre 2006, \u00e0 la suite des modifications apport\u00e9es aux normes de l'OACI ce m\u00eame mois.\n[67] Rien ne prouve que, avant 2006, une autre des importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international ayant adopt\u00e9 une politique de retraite obligatoire \u00e0 60 ans ou moins ait apport\u00e9 des changements \u00e0 sa politique de retraite obligatoire.\n[68] Il est raisonnable de conclure que, en 2005, quand M. Kelly a pris sa retraite, la retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans ou moins \u00e9tait exig\u00e9e de 80 % des importantes entreprises de transport a\u00e9rien international pour lesquelles les donn\u00e9es \u00e9taient disponibles.\n[69] Ces donn\u00e9es r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que 60 ans \u00e9tait l'\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire en vigueur pour la majorit\u00e9 des emplois du genre de ceux qu'occupaient les plaignants au moment o\u00f9 ils ont pris leur retraite en 2003 et en 2005. Il s'agissait de l'\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP. Il en r\u00e9sulte que la politique relative \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge obligatoire de la retraite en vigueur chez Air Canada n'est pas un acte discriminatoire contrevenant \u00e0 la LCDP.\nD. L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP contrevient-il \u00e0 la Charte? [70] Dans son avis de question constitutionnelle, la Coalition a mis en question la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, en soutenant que l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) contrevient \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte et n'est pas justifi\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 1er de la Charte. S'il en est ainsi, selon la Coalition, le Tribunal doit alors refuser d'appliquer l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c), ce qui emp\u00eacherait les intim\u00e9es d'invoquer cette d\u00e9fense pour se justifier de l'acte discriminatoire prima facie commis envers les plaignants. Les intim\u00e9es n'ont pas contest\u00e9 que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). Il devrait \u00eatre soulign\u00e9 que la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur cette question est limit\u00e9e aux faits en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n(i) Les contestations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de dispositions sur les droits de la personne autorisant la retraite obligatoire [71] La pr\u00e9sente affaire constitue la premi\u00e8re fois qu'une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP se rend devant le Tribunal. Il existe toutefois deux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada o\u00f9 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de dispositions semblables de lois provinciales sur les droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e. Ces arr\u00eats sont McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, et Harrison c. Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 451.\n[72] L'arr\u00eat McKinney porte sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario. Cet arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en m\u00eame temps que l'arr\u00eat Harrison, qui portait sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 du paragraphe 8(1) de la Human Rights Act de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces deux dispositions autorisaient la retraite obligatoire. Dans l'arr\u00eat Harrison, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s dans l'arr\u00eat McKinney, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 du paragraphe 8(1), qui limitait aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es entre 45 et 65 la protection quant \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge, ne faisait aucun doute.\n[73] Dans l'arr\u00eat McKinney, les appelants, qui \u00e9taient professeurs \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans en raison de la politique sur la retraite obligatoire en vigueur \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9. Dans leur appel, les appelants ont pos\u00e9 deux questions constitutionnelles distinctes \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada :\nLa politique sur la retraite obligatoire en vigueur \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 contrevenait-elle \u00e0 la Charte? L'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario contrevenait-il \u00e0 la Charte en prot\u00e9geant les politiques de retraite obligatoire?\n[74] Pour ce qui est de la politique sur la retraite obligatoire en vigueur \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que la Charte ne s'appliquait pas aux universit\u00e9s parce que les universit\u00e9s ne font pas partie du gouvernement. Cependant, si on pr\u00e9sumait que la Charte s'appliquait, la politique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 contraire \u00e0 au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte. Cependant, cette violation \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 1er de la Charte.\n[75] La Cour s'est ensuite pench\u00e9e sur la deuxi\u00e8me question constitutionnelle qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e : l'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code des droits de la personne de l'Ontario contrevenait-il \u00e0 la Charte? C'est cette deuxi\u00e8me analyse, qui porte sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code, qui est pertinente dans le cadre de l'affaire soumise au Tribunal.\n[76] L'alin\u00e9a 9a) limite la protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par le Code aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es de 18 \u00e0 65 ans. La majorit\u00e9 a conclu que cette disposition violait le droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Charte, puisqu'elle autorisait la retraite forc\u00e9e d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans, mais qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins constitutionnelle en vertu de l'article 1er de la Charte.\n[77] Bien qu'elle soit libell\u00e9e tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9remment, l'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code de l'Ontario (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 depuis) se compare \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP : les deux sont des dispositions facultatives, les deux permettent l'application de politiques sur la retraite obligatoire qui, dans les autres cas, seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des actes discriminatoires prima facie.\n(ii) L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP contrevient-il au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte? [78] Dans l'arr\u00eat McKinney, la majorit\u00e9 a conclu que l'alin\u00e9a 9a) du Code de l'Ontario contrevenait au paragraphe 15 de la Charte parce qu'il privait les plaignants d'une protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par le Code en raison de leur \u00e2ge, lequel est un motif de distinction express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9 dans la Charte. Bien que son analyse de l'article 15 se soit conclu ainsi, le juge La Forest a not\u00e9 que, pour diverses raisons, la distinction fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge n'est pas examin\u00e9e de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur d'autres motifs, comme la race ou le sexe.\n[79] Il a affirm\u00e9 que, bien qu'il faille se m\u00e9fier des lois qui ont des effets pr\u00e9judiciables inutiles sur les personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es en raison de suppositions inexactes quant aux effets de l'\u00e2ge sur les capacit\u00e9s, il y a souvent des motifs s\u00e9rieux de conf\u00e9rer des avantages \u00e0 un groupe d'\u00e2ge plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 un autre dans la mise sur pied de grands r\u00e9gimes sociaux et dans la r\u00e9partition des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices (McKinney, \u00e0 la page 297).\n[80] Cependant, au moment o\u00f9 l'arr\u00eat McKinney a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, de telles questions sur la nature et la port\u00e9e des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l'article 15 \u00e9taient examin\u00e9s en fonction de l'article 1er de la Charte. Depuis que l'arr\u00eat McKinney a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en 1990, le droit concernant l'analyse de plaintes de discrimination fond\u00e9es sur l'article 15 de la Charte a \u00e9volu\u00e9. Cette \u00e9volution peut se voir dans deux arr\u00eats subs\u00e9quents dans lesquels la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9tabli la norme applicable au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte : Law c. Canada, [1999] 1 R.C.S. 497, et Gosselin c. Qu\u00e9bec (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2002] 4 R.C.S. 429.\n[81] Les questions sur la nature et la port\u00e9e de l'article 15 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es dans le cadre de l'analyse de cette disposition, laquelle analyse portait principalement sur l'objectif de cette disposition. L'article 15 vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher que la dignit\u00e9 humaine soit compromise par des distinctions arbitraires caus\u00e9es par la loi ou par l'action du gouvernement.\n[82] Dans l'arr\u00eat Law, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'analyse relative \u00e0 la discrimination sont impr\u00e9gn\u00e9s de la volont\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de pr\u00e9server et de promouvoir la dignit\u00e9 humaine. La dignit\u00e9 humaine est bafou\u00e9e lorsque des personnes sont marginalis\u00e9es, mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et d\u00e9valoris\u00e9es et elle est rehauss\u00e9e lorsque les lois reconnaissent le r\u00f4le \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re jou\u00e9 par tous dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne (Law, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 53).\n[83] Dans l'arr\u00eat Law, il \u00e9tait question d'une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Nancy Law, une conjointe survivante, pour obtenir les prestations pr\u00e9vues par le R\u00e9gime des pensions du Canada (RPC). Selon les crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9, les conjoints survivants qui ne sont pas invalides, qui n'ont pas d'enfant \u00e0 charge et qui avaient moins de 35 ans \u00e0 la mort de leur conjoint ne sont pas admissibles \u00e0 recevoir les prestations de survivant. Mme Law avait 30 ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en cause. Elle a contest\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re de l'\u00e2ge, en soutenant qu'il contrevenait \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte.\n[84] La Cour a convenu que, au m\u00eame titre que les conjoints survivants de tout \u00e2ge, Mme Law pouvait \u00eatre vuln\u00e9rable, financi\u00e8rement ou autrement, tout de suite apr\u00e8s la mort de son conjoint. Cependant, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'objectif de la disposition contest\u00e9e du RPC n'\u00e9tait pas de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins financiers imm\u00e9diats qu'\u00e9prouvent les veuves et les veufs, mais plut\u00f4t de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins \u00e0 long terme des veuves et des veufs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s.\n[85] La Cour a conclu que les veuves plus jeunes sont mieux plac\u00e9es que les veuves de plus de 45 ans pour se trouver du travail et assurer de nouveau leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que la loi d\u00e9favorise les conjoints plus jeunes qui se trouvent dans cette cat\u00e9gorie, il ne s'agit vraisemblablement pas d'un d\u00e9savantage r\u00e9el, si on le regarde \u00e0 long terme. La Cour a statu\u00e9 que, s'il est analys\u00e9 du double point de vue de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme et des possibilit\u00e9s plus grandes offertes par la jeunesse, le fait que la loi traite diff\u00e9remment les personnes plus jeunes ne traduit ni n'encourage l'id\u00e9e que ces personnes sont moins capables, ou moins dignes d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, de respect et de consid\u00e9ration.\n[86] Dans l'arr\u00eat Gosselin, l'appelante a contest\u00e9 une disposition du r\u00e9gime d'aide social du Qu\u00e9bec qui pr\u00e9voyait que le montant des prestations de base payables aux personnes de moins de 30 ans correspondrait \u00e0 environ 30 % de moins de celui des prestations de base vers\u00e9es aux 30 ans et plus. Dans ce nouveau r\u00e9gime, les personnes de moins de 30 ans pouvaient faire augmenter le montant de leur prestation de base en participant \u00e0 certains programmes d'\u00e9ducation ou d'exp\u00e9rience de travail. Mme Gosselin a contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime en invoquant l'article 15 de la Charte et en soutenant qu'il y avait discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge.\n[87] La Cour a conclu que Mme Gosselin n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le gouvernement l'a trait\u00e9e comme une personne de moindre valeur que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d'aide sociale plus \u00e2g\u00e9s, simplement parce qu'il a assujetti le versement de prestations accrues \u00e0 sa participation \u00e0 des programmes con\u00e7us express\u00e9ment pour l'int\u00e9grer dans la population active et promouvoir son autonomie \u00e0 long terme.\n[88] La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 la race, \u00e0 la religion ou au sexe, l'\u00e2ge n'est pas fortement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination et \u00e0 la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation arbitraire de privil\u00e8ges. Les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l'\u00e2ge n'\u00e9voquent pas automatiquement le contexte d'un d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant qui donne \u00e0 croire \u00e0 l'existence d'une discrimination et d'une marginalisation. En effet, ces distinctions sont tout \u00e0 fait raisonnables et non discriminatoires dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ne traitent pas les gens comme des personnes m\u00e9ritant moins de respect ou d'\u00e9gards et o\u00f9 elles ne renforcent pas de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatifs fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge.\n[89] La question est donc de savoir si, \u00e0 la suite de la distinction fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP, il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des plaignants ou s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9s par un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif fond\u00e9 sur leur \u00e2ge.\n[90] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal conclut que, bien que la disposition prive les plaignants de la chance de contester la politique de retraite obligatoire en vigueur dans leur lieu de travail, la perte de cette chance ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 leur dignit\u00e9 et ne fait pas en sorte qu'ils ne sont pas reconnus en tant que membre \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[91] Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 une approche t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique et contextuelle \u00e0 l'analyse de l'acte discriminatoire, comme le proposait la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Law. Cette approche se fonde sur trois grandes questions :\nLa disposition contest\u00e9e cr\u00e9e-t-elle entre le demandeur et les autres personnes une distinction fond\u00e9e sur des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles? Le demandeur est-il trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment d'autrui en raison d'un des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ou analogues? La diff\u00e9rence de traitement impose-t-elle un fardeau qui refl\u00e8te ou renforce un d\u00e9savantage ou un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif; ou a-t-elle un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la dignit\u00e9 de l'individu ou sur son estime de soi? (Law, pages 548 et 549). C'est la troisi\u00e8me question qui est essentielle \u00e0 cette partie de l'examen du Tribunal.\nLa distinction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) contribue-t-il \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou \u00e0 renforcer un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype ou un d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant dont serait victime les plaignants?\n[92] Un des facteurs les plus concluants pour d\u00e9montrer qu'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement impos\u00e9e par une disposition l\u00e9gislative est vraiment discriminatoire sera l'existence d'un d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant ou d'une vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype (Law, au paragraphe 63). Il est clair que les pilotes de ligne, en tant que pilotes, ne sont pas victimes d'un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif ou d'un d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant, mais l'analyse en l'esp\u00e8ce devrait porter principalement sur la question de savoir si les plaignants, \u00e0 titre de membres du groupe form\u00e9 des travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s oblig\u00e9s de mettre fin \u00e0 leur emploi, sont victimes d'un d\u00e9savantage pr\u00e9existant ou d'un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif.\n[93] La jurisprudence a not\u00e9 le d\u00e9savantage que subissent les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s. Par exemple, dans l'arr\u00eat McKinney, le juge La Forest a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 moins qu'elles aient des comp\u00e9tences particuli\u00e8res, on reconna\u00eet g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que les personnes de plus de 45 ans ont plus de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se trouver du travail que les autres. Elles n'ont pas la souplesse des jeunes, un d\u00e9savantage souvent aggrav\u00e9 par le fait que les jeunes disposent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'une formation plus r\u00e9cente dans les techniques plus modernes (\u00e0 la page 299). En outre, bien que les r\u00e9gimes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale et les r\u00e9gimes de retraite priv\u00e9s puissent apporter un certain redressement financier, bon nombre de personnes plus \u00e2g\u00e9es ont besoin d'une source de revenu additionnel, ce qui est de plus en plus fr\u00e9quent \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les gens vivent plus longtemps (\u00e0 la page 300).\n[94] Dans les motifs dissidents qu'elle a expos\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat McKinney, la juge Wilson a not\u00e9 qu'il existe un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel les personnes plus \u00e2g\u00e9es sont improductives, inefficaces et incomp\u00e9tentes (\u00e0 la page 413).\n[95] Rien ne laissait croire que les plaignants ont subi ce type de d\u00e9savantage ou de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge. Au contraire, la preuve montrait que, en tant que pilotes d'exp\u00e9rience, les plaignants connaissaient tr\u00e8s bien les derni\u00e8res technologies et poss\u00e9daient les habilet\u00e9s pour piloter certains des appareils les plus sophistiqu\u00e9s d'un important transporteur a\u00e9rien international.\n[96] Tr\u00e8s peu apr\u00e8s leur retraite d'Air Canada, tous deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de travailler comme pilotes chez d'autres transporteurs a\u00e9riens qui n'avaient pas de politiques de retraite obligatoire. M. Kelly a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, lorsqu'il a retourn\u00e9 son laissez-passer de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 Air Canada apr\u00e8s son dernier vol, il a rencontr\u00e9 un ancien coll\u00e8gue qui lui a offert un emploi chez Skyservice Airlines. Il s'est empress\u00e9 d'accepter l'offre.\n[97] L'emploi qu'il a accept\u00e9 chez Skyservice signifiait que M. Kelly a pu ajouter son salaire de pilote chez Skyservice au revenu de 124 000 $ qu'il touchait \u00e0 titre de pension d'Air Canada. \u00c0 72 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, le revenu de retraite de M. Vilven \u00e9tait moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de M. Kelly, car M. Vilven a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Air Canada plus tard. Cependant, M. Vilven a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'ajouter \u00e0 son revenu de pension le salaire qu'il recevait \u00e0 titre de pilote chez Flair Airlines.\nL'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c), dans son objet ou dans son effet, a-t-il une r\u00e9percussion n\u00e9gative sur la dignit\u00e9 des plaignants?\n[98] L'objectif de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) est de parvenir \u00e0 un \u00e9quilibre entre le besoin de prot\u00e9ger contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des intervenants du milieu du travail qui souhaitent n\u00e9gocier et organiser les modalit\u00e9s d'emploi \u00e0 leur convenance (Campbell c. Air Canada (1981), 2 C.H.R.R. D\/602 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 5483). La disposition n'oblige pas la retraite, elle est facultative et elle permet aux parties comme Air Canada et l'APAC de n\u00e9gocier des ententes qui comportent une disposition de retraite obligatoire.\n[99] Les politiques de retraite obligatoire sont souvent mis en place quand les employ\u00e9s d\u00e9tiennent un pouvoir de n\u00e9gociation important, le plus souvent par la repr\u00e9sentation syndicale. En fait, la tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 des politiques de retraite obligatoire se trouvent dans les milieux de travail syndiqu\u00e9s. Les \u00e9conomistes du travail Jonathan Kesselman et Lorne Carmichael, qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au nom de la Commission et d'Air Canada respectivement, ont convenu que les emplois dans des milieux de travails syndiqu\u00e9s sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant de [traduction] bons emplois, c'est-\u00e0-dire des emplois bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s, avec un haut degr\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, o\u00f9 l'anciennet\u00e9 joue un r\u00f4le important et dot\u00e9 d'un bon r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n[100] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'APAC et Air Canada se sont entendues sur la retraite \u00e0 60 ans en \u00e9change d'un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9reux, lequel comprend un r\u00e9gime de pension qui place les pilotes d'Air Canada dans un groupe privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 de pensionnaires. M. Harlan Clarke, directeur des relations de travail, op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes, chez Air Canada, a soulign\u00e9 une caract\u00e9ristique importante de la politique de retraite obligatoire, soit le fait que les employ\u00e9s, dont les pilotes d'Air Canada, ne sont pas plac\u00e9s dans la situation embarrassante d'\u00eatre oblig\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu'ils sont incapables de satisfaire aux exigences de leur poste ou parce que leur sant\u00e9 se d\u00e9grade. Au contraire, la retraite \u00e0 60 ans pour les pilotes est la conclusion enti\u00e8rement comprise et attendue d'une carri\u00e8re prestigieuse et valorisante p\u00e9cuniairement.\n[101] Les plaignants ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils \u00e9taient parfaitement au courant, quand ils ont commenc\u00e9 leur emploi chez Air Canada, qu'ils seraient tenus de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans. Ils ont affirm\u00e9 que devenir un pilote chez Air Canada \u00e9tait l'objectif de tout pilote : le salaire \u00e9tait excellent, le travail \u00e9tait int\u00e9ressant et le poste \u00e9tait associ\u00e9 d'un prestige consid\u00e9rable. Cependant, ils savaient \u00e9galement que cette situation ne pourrait durer ind\u00e9finiment et que tous les pilotes d'Air Canada sont tenus de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans.\n[102] N\u00e9anmoins, quand ils ont eu 60 ans, le fait que les plaignants aient d\u00fb prendre leur retraite d'Air Canada a port\u00e9 un coup \u00e0 leur estime d'eux-m\u00eames. Les deux plaignants ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que le prestige et l'excitation du travail de pilote chez Air Canada leur manquait. M. Kelly a affirm\u00e9 que les amiti\u00e9s qu'il avait nou\u00e9es chez Air Canada lui manquaient.\n[103] Il ne fait aucun doute qu'une cessation d'emploi a des r\u00e9percussions profondes sur l'estime de soi et la dignit\u00e9 d'un individu (Renvoi relatif au Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313, \u00e0 la page 368). Aussi difficile que la situation puisse \u00eatre pour les plaignants, les r\u00e9percussions qu'ont eu leur mise \u00e0 la retraite sur leur dignit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es dans le contexte global de leur carri\u00e8re.\n[104] La jurisprudence sur des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge contrevenant \u00e0 la Charte montre qu'il faut faire preuve de prudence avant d'\u00e9valuer les r\u00e9percussions sur la dignit\u00e9 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge uniquement \u00e0 partir de moments isol\u00e9s dans le temps (Law, au paragraphe 102; Gosselin, au paragraphe 32; McKinney, \u00e0 la page 297).\n[105] Le professeur Carmichael a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la plupart des gens voient les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l'\u00e2ge de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente des distinctions fond\u00e9es sur des motifs comme le sexe ou la race. Contrairement au sexe ou \u00e0 la race, nous prenons tous de l'\u00e2ge au fil des ann\u00e9es. Pour cette raison, les jeunes travailleurs acceptent qu'un employ\u00e9 plus \u00e2g\u00e9 travaillant \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'eux soit mieux r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils croient qu'ils seront trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on quand ils auront atteint semblable \u00e9tape dans leur carri\u00e8re. Les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l'\u00e2ge sont souvent consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant \u00e9quitables et ne portent pas atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 humaine parce que nous pouvons tous nous attendre \u00e0 en r\u00e9colter les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices ou \u00e0 en porter le fardeau \u00e0 un certain moment dans nos vies.\n[106] Selon le professeur Carmichael, les plaignants, au cours de leur carri\u00e8re chez Air Canada, ont r\u00e9colt\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la r\u00e8gle imposant la retraite obligatoire que leur syndicat avait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 en leur nom. En cons\u00e9quence du d\u00e9part des pilotes \u00e2g\u00e9s de 60 ans d'Air Canada, les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de faire avancer leur carri\u00e8re plus rapidement.\n[107] En outre, le statut des pilotes, leur revenu, leur port d'attache, le choix des horaires et les prestations du r\u00e9gime de pension qu'ils ont re\u00e7ues, entre autres choses, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9s en fonction de la disposition sur la retraite obligatoire. Puisqu'ils ont r\u00e9colt\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la retraite obligatoire, il ne faudrait pas estimer qu'il est injuste que les plaignants en portent finalement le fardeau.\n[108] Il se peut que les plaignants ne soient pas heureux d'avoir \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 leur carri\u00e8re enrichissante de pilotes chez Air Canada, mais la situation ne peut \u00eatre examin\u00e9e isol\u00e9ment. Elle doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le contexte d'un syst\u00e8me qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour r\u00e9partir les responsabilit\u00e9s et les avantages d'\u00eatre pilote chez Air Canada entre les pilotes qui en sont rendus \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de leur carri\u00e8re. Tous les pilotes chez Air Canada comprennent qu'ils partageront ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et ces fardeaux \u00e9galement aux \u00e9tapes appropri\u00e9es de leur carri\u00e8re.\n[109] La d\u00e9ni du droit de contester la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de ce syst\u00e8me - la retraite \u00e0 60 ans - en cons\u00e9quence de l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) ne communique pas le message que les plaignants ne sont pas des membres estim\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, pas plus que cela ne les marginalise. Cela ne fait que montrer qu'il n'est pas injuste que les plaignants assument leur derni\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de pilotes d'Air Canada. Ce message ne peut \u00eatre raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une atteinte \u00e0 leur dignit\u00e9.\n[110] Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal a conclu que le droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des plaignants pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 15 de la Charte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 par l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP. Apr\u00e8s avoir tir\u00e9 cette conclusion, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal examine l'article 1er de la Charte ou la question de savoir si la politique de retraite obligatoire d'Air Canada constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi.\n[111] Les plaintes de M.

Le Tribunal avait donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli des dates pour les argument finaux.\n[3] Lors de l\u2019interrogation des employ\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s de la Commission par Mme Kulaszka, la Commission a soulev\u00e9 de nombreuses objections \u00e0 la divulgation des renseignements demand\u00e9s pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, au sens du paragraphe 37(1) de la LPC. De plus, apr\u00e8s ces dates d\u2019audience, la Commission a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article 37 dans son objection \u00e0 la demande de M. Lemire pour que soit signifi\u00e9 une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner (voir ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet, Warman c. Lemire, 2007 TCDP 21).\n[4] Le 17 mai 2007, M. Lemire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un avis de demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, Dossier de la Cour no T-860-07, pour que soient tranch\u00e9es les demandes d\u2019immunit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de la Commission, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 37(3) de la LPC.\n[5] En pr\u00e9sentant la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en ajournement, M. Lemire soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la [Traduction] proc\u00e9dure normale et attendue, lorsqu\u2019une objection au sens de l\u2019article 37 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant un tribunal, un organisme ou une personne qui ne constituent pas une cour sup\u00e9rieure, d\u2019ajourner la proc\u00e9dure en attendant qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure tranche la question. Comme la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Re Attorney General of Canada et al. and Sander, 1994 CanLII 1658, au paragraphe 84 :\n[Traduction] Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019une objection \u00e0 une divulgation, au sens de l\u2019article 37, est soulev\u00e9e par la Couronne devant un tribunal qui ne constitue pas une cour sup\u00e9rieure, l\u2019instruction de l\u2019instance devrait \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e afin que l\u2019objection puisse \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[6] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 ce point dans R. c. Sander, 1995 CanLII 1229, au paragraphe 29 (B.C.C.A.) :\n[Traduction] Lorsque l\u2019instruction a lieu dans une cour provinciale, une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37 interrompt l\u2019instruction afin de renvoyer \u00e0 une autre cour une question qui serait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tranch\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\n[7] M. Lemire souligne qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure au sujet d\u2019une question soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37 de la LPC constitue une instruction s\u00e9par\u00e9e et ind\u00e9pendante, et non un appel ou un contr\u00f4le judiciaire interlocutoire au sujet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du tribunal d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure. Il ajoute que le Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019a pas rendu de d\u00e9cision au sujet de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission en vertu du paragraphe 37, il a seulement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsque l\u2019immunit\u00e9 est invoqu\u00e9e, la question ne rel\u00e8ve plus du Tribunal. La question ne peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e que par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, sur demande.\n[8] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leurs propres proc\u00e9dures et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire important pour trancher les demandes d\u2019ajournement. Les tribunaux tels que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, qui exercent des fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, doivent utiliser leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en fonction des principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 15 \u00e0 17).\n[9] Je partage les avis exprim\u00e9s dans Baltruweit et Leger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, D\u00e9cision no 1, Dossier du TCDP T527\/2299, (26 novembre 1999), selon lesquels le Tribunal ne devrait pas appliquer le crit\u00e8re en trois parties \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-Macdonald Inc. c. Canada, [1994] 1 R.C.S. 311, lorsqu\u2019il traite des demandes d\u2019ajournement. Le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat RJR-Macdonald s\u2019applique \u00e0 des situations lors desquelles on demande \u00e0 un tribunal ayant le pouvoir de surveillance de suspendre la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019une juridiction inf\u00e9rieure en attendant une demande d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[10] La Commission et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement. Ils soutiennent que les renseignements retenus par la Commission portent sur des enqu\u00eates et d\u2019autres actions que la Commission a prises en application de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Ils font valoir que, compte tenu du pouvoir limit\u00e9 du Tribunal de trancher des questions constitutionnelles, et en l\u2019absence de comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer sur la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission enqu\u00eate sur des plaintes ou s\u2019acquitte de son mandat en vertu de la LCDP, les renseignements que la Commission retient ne sont pas pertinents quant aux questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour trancher la plainte. La Commission soutient aussi que ces renseignements constituent [traduction] une petite partie de la preuve en question. Sur ce dernier point, je ne vois pas comment la taille ou l\u2019importance de la preuve peut avoir une incidence sur la question.\n[11] Ce n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que la Commission et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soul\u00e8vent la question de la port\u00e9e de la preuve. Des objections semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience et, apr\u00e8s un certain d\u00e9bat, j\u2019ai conclu que la preuve au sujet des activit\u00e9s de la Commission li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 de la LCDP est admissible aux fins de la contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition. La question de savoir si le Tribunal devrait tenir compte de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour trancher les questions constitutionnelles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e aux observations finales. Toutes les parties ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pendant l\u2019audience en fonction de cette entente. Il convient cependant de noter que la Commission et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ont, parfois, r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 leur position selon laquelle cette preuve n\u2019a, ultimement, aucune importance. Lorsque cela s\u2019est produit, j\u2019ai r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que le d\u00e9bat sur cette question \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux observations finales.\n[12] Le Tribunal doit veiller au d\u00e9roulement rapide de l\u2019instruction, de la fa\u00e7on la plus informelle possible, tout en respectant les principes de justice naturelle et les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP). \u00c0 mon avis, il serait injuste envers M. Lemire, et il constituerait un d\u00e9ni de justice, de l\u2019obliger \u00e0 terminer sa preuve alors qu\u2019il est possible que la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37 soit tranch\u00e9e en sa faveur, lui donnant ainsi possiblement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des preuves qui sont pertinentes. C\u2019est la preuve que M. Lemire a tent\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable. L\u2019article 50 de la LCDP lui accorde la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019instruction. S\u2019il s\u2019av\u00e8re que l\u2019immunit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, au sens de l\u2019article 37, s\u2019applique, la preuve en question est inadmissible. Cependant, le fait de terminer l\u2019instruction du Tribunal avant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait rendu une d\u00e9cision reviendrait \u00e0 pr\u00e9juger la question de la pertinence et de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et annulerait tout avantage que M. Lemire pourrait obtenir de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[13] Tout d\u00e9lai dans le d\u00e9nouement de l\u2019affaire est regrettable. Je suis convaincu que toutes les parties attendent avec int\u00e9r\u00eat que le Tribunal se prononce sur toutes les questions dont il est saisi. M. Lemire souligne que si la Commission avait invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019immunit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en vertu de la common law, au lieu de soulever une objection en vertu de l\u2019article 37 de la LPC, le Tribunal aurait pu directement trancher les questions de divulgation. Toute contestation des conclusions du Tribunal devraient alors \u00eatre trait\u00e9es par contr\u00f4le judiciaire. David M. Paciocco a soulign\u00e9 ce point dans The Law of Evidence, Third Edition, (Toronto : Irwin Law Inc., 2002), \u00e0 la page 222, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9crit :\n[Traduction] Avant les modifications [d\u00e9coulant de la Loi antiterroriste, 2001, L.C., ch. 41, article 43], les cours avaient conclu que l\u2019article 37 n\u2019avait pas supplant\u00e9 la common law. Les modifications n\u2019ont pas chang\u00e9 ce fait. Cela signifie que la Couronne peut toujours s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la divulgation en vertu de la common law. Une objection en vertu de la common law n\u2019entra\u00eene pas le processus pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 37. De fa\u00e7on plus importante, bien que l\u2019article ne pr\u00e9voie pas que les cours provinciales puissent \u00eatre saisies d\u2019une objection soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas les cours provinciales, dans le cadre d\u2019une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire ou d\u2019une instance, d\u2019\u00eatre saisies d\u2019une demande d\u2019immunit\u00e9 en vertu de la common law. En fait, une telle proc\u00e9dure devrait \u00eatre encourag\u00e9e. Cela \u00e9vitera l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient de l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019affaire qui doit \u00eatre entendue par la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province, comme l\u2019article le pr\u00e9voit.\n[14] Les exemples donn\u00e9s par l\u2019auteur dans cet extrait rel\u00e8vent du contexte du droit p\u00e9nal. En fait, toute la jurisprudence sur laquelle M. Lemire se fonde dans sa requ\u00eate est li\u00e9e \u00e0 des proc\u00e8s criminels. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soutient que ces d\u00e9cisions cl\u00e9s se distinguent donc de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour ce seul motif. Cependant, ni le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ni la Commission n\u2019a produit de d\u00e9cisions (d\u2019ordre civil ou p\u00e9nal) pour contrer les conclusions dans ces affaires en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pratique de l\u2019ajournement des proc\u00e9dures en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue au sujet des questions relevant de l\u2019article 37. De plus, je ne vois pas pourquoi la d\u00e9cision d\u2019ajourner une instance en attendant une d\u00e9cision d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure devrait d\u00e9pendre du fait que l\u2019instruction en premi\u00e8re instance est de nature p\u00e9nale ou civile. Il n\u2019y a aucune distinction du genre \u00e0 l\u2019article 37.\n[15] J\u2019accueille par cons\u00e9quent la demande d\u2019ajournement sine die pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire. Si l\u2019une des parties avait mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u2019autres preuves \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, sauf celles li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37, j\u2019aurais poursuivi l\u2019audience en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas.\n[16] Les parties devraient noter que si le d\u00e9lai caus\u00e9 par la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37 devenait prolong\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public envers une instruction rapide pourrait n\u00e9cessiter que le Tribunal r\u00e9examine sa d\u00e9cision de reporter la prise d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur la pertinence de la preuve vis\u00e9e. Des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion de l\u2019instance seront par cons\u00e9quent men\u00e9es par le Tribunal de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re pour suivre le d\u00e9roulement de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 37 devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le Tribunal s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce que les parties coop\u00e8rent et agissent avec diligence raisonnable pour l\u2019audition de la demande.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthania Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1073\/5405\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Richard Warman c.

INTRODUCTION\nA. Les faits\nB. L'analyse juridique\nII. CONCLUSION\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] Le 17 mai 2002, Maureen Tanzola (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) contre AZ Bus Tours Inc. (l'intim\u00e9e). La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a commis, en cours d'emploi, un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e l'a trait\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et d\u00e9favorable par rapport \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Elle pr\u00e9tend de plus que, \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions, M. Ron Roffey, le directeur de l'exploitation de l'intim\u00e9e, l'a harcel\u00e9e parce qu'elle \u00e9tait une femme. La plaignante pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que l'intim\u00e9e l'a mut\u00e9e \u00e0 son unit\u00e9 de Toronto, lui occasionnant ainsi des d\u00e9placements de trois heures par jour, et qu'elle a diminu\u00e9 son nombre d'heures de travail, l'obligeant ainsi \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner.\n[2] L'intim\u00e9e nie les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\nA. Les faits [3] L'intim\u00e9e est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'autobus nolis\u00e9. Elle a commenc\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s en 1998. \u00c0 l'origine, son objectif principal \u00e9tait le transport de passagers de Toronto vers le Casino Rama, \u00e0 Orillia (Ontario). Par la suite, l'intim\u00e9e s'est mise \u00e0 offrir des services d'autobus nolis\u00e9 vers toutes les destinations au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[4] Le service d'exploitation d'autobus nolis\u00e9 vers le Casino Rama de l'intim\u00e9e est divis\u00e9 en deux unit\u00e9s d'exploitation. Le bureau principal est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto, o\u00f9 la plus grande partie de la flotte d'autobus de l'intim\u00e9e est stationn\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9e poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement une petite unit\u00e9 d'exploitation \u00e0 Orillia. Les deux unit\u00e9s d'exploitation fournissent les m\u00eames services aux m\u00eames clients, lesquels se rendent au m\u00eame endroit, c'est-\u00e0-dire le Casino Rama. Les services d'autobus nolis\u00e9 quant aux destinations plus \u00e9loign\u00e9es que Toronto et Orillia sont exploit\u00e9s uniquement \u00e0 partir de Toronto. M. Terry Barnett, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'\u00e9tablissement du cahier de travail des chauffeurs \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de Toronto \u00e9tait fait par aiguillage, alors que l'\u00e9tablissement de l'horaire de travail des chauffeurs \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia \u00e9tait fait par le superviseur de cette unit\u00e9 d'exploitation en collaboration avec le r\u00e9partiteur de Toronto.\n[5] Jusqu'en 1999, le mari de la plaignante, Tim Tanzola, travaillait comme superviseur \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 d'exploitation d'Orillia. Il fut ensuite remplac\u00e9 par John Westwood. Ce dernier a occup\u00e9 le poste de superviseur jusqu'en 2003, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e. Le superviseur de l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia rendait compte \u00e0 M. Ron Roffey, lequel rendait compte \u00e0 M. Terry Barnett, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. M. Barnett a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Westwood et M. Roffey, n'avaient pas l'autorit\u00e9 pour mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi d'un employ\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait lui qui prenait la d\u00e9cision.\n[6] La plaignante a travaill\u00e9 pour l'intim\u00e9e comme chauffeur d'autobus entre octobre 1997 et novembre 2001. Elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia jusqu'en 2001.\n[7] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que c'est au cours de 1999 que la situation a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer pour elle au travail. Je souligne que cela correspond \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle son mari a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste de superviseur de l'unit\u00e9 d'exploitation d'Orillia.\n[8] Au cours de l'ann\u00e9e susmentionn\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9e a mis en place un syst\u00e8me de primes de conduite prudente, lesquelles primes \u00e9taient accord\u00e9es aux chauffeurs qui n'avaient eu aucun accident au cours de l'ann\u00e9e. Le montant de cette prime \u00e9tait de 1 000,00 $. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune prime parce que, selon l'intim\u00e9e, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un accident. Elle a de plus affirm\u00e9 que bien qu'ils eurent d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir eu des accidents, de nombreux chauffeurs de sexe masculin ont re\u00e7u une prime. Elle a donn\u00e9 les noms de trois chauffeurs, c'est-\u00e0-dire Jean-Guy Desmarais, John Westwood et Tim Tanzola, son mari, qui ont re\u00e7u ou \u00e0 qui on a offert une prime, et ce, bien qu'ils furent impliqu\u00e9s dans des accidents. Dans ses documents, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 les noms de plusieurs autres chauffeurs qui ont \u00e9galement re\u00e7u une prime dans des situations semblables. Aucun d'eux n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[9] Bien que la plaignante soit convaincue qu'elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir une prime de conduite prudente, elle n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir comment la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e de ne pas lui accorder la prime constitue une pratique discriminatoire en vertu de la Loi. M. Barnett a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'octroi de cette prime \u00e9tait discr\u00e9tionnaire et il a cat\u00e9goriquement affirm\u00e9 que la plaignante ne l'avait pas re\u00e7ue pour la seule raison qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un accident qui aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9. La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'\u00e9tablir que cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en raison de son sexe et que, par exemple, les autres chauffeurs de sexe f\u00e9minin s'\u00e9taient \u00e9galement vu refuser l'octroi de la prime.\n[10] La plaignante a ensuite parl\u00e9 d'un incident qui s'est produit le 3 juillet 2000, alors que l'autobus qu'elle conduisait est tomb\u00e9 en panne pendant qu'elle faisait route vers Orillia. Elle a appel\u00e9 au bureau de Toronto et elle a mentionn\u00e9 au r\u00e9partiteur l'endroit o\u00f9 l'autobus de rechange devrait \u00eatre amen\u00e9. Ron Roffey a amen\u00e9 l'autobus de rechange. Lorsqu'il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 la plaignante et son autobus \u00e9taient immobilis\u00e9s, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 crier apr\u00e8s elle et \u00e0 faire des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes devant les passagers. Selon elle, il y avait eu une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 la direction que le r\u00e9partiteur avait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Roffey et ce dernier la tenait responsable de cette situation. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Roffey lui avait dit ce qui suit devant les autres passagers : [traduction] Les directions que tu m'as donn\u00e9es ne valent rien. Elle a de plus ajout\u00e9 que ce comportement injurieux l'avait fait pleurer, qu'elle avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 retrouver son calme et qu'elle s'\u00e9tait sentie humili\u00e9e.\n[11] Une semaine apr\u00e8s l'incident susmentionn\u00e9, une lettre, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit que la plaignante avait fait preuve d'insubordination envers un sup\u00e9rieur, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le dossier personnel de la plaignante. Aucune explication quant \u00e0 l'insubordination n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s cet incident, elle a dit \u00e0 M. Barnett que, \u00e0 l'avenir, elle communiquerait directement avec lui plut\u00f4t que par l'entremise de M. Roffey.\n[12] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que plusieurs anciens employ\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e pourraient \u00e9tayer ses all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles M. Roffey avait fait des remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes sur les femmes, mais aucun de ces anciens employ\u00e9s n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, personnellement, elle n'avait jamais entendu M. Roffey faire ces remarques. M. Tanzola, le mari de la plaignante, a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eateur de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne au cours d'une entrevue qui a eu lieu le 29 mars 2005, qu'il [traduction] ne pouvait honn\u00eatement pas affirmer qu'il avait entendu M. Roffey tenir des propos d\u00e9sobligeants envers la plaignante ou envers les femmes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il savait que sa femme avait eu des probl\u00e8mes avec M. Roffey mais il a ajout\u00e9 que [traduction] de nombreux chauffeurs avaient eu des frictions avec Ron - des chauffeurs de sexe masculin et des chauffeurs de sexe f\u00e9minin. Il \u00e9tait inflexible et traitait les gens de mani\u00e8re irrespectueuse (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.) \u00c0 l'audience, M. Tanzola a confirm\u00e9 une fois de plus qu'il n'avait pas personnellement entendu M. Roffey faire le genre de remarque susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[13] Le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait de John Westwood, lequel a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait entendu M. Roffey faire le genre de remarques susmentionn\u00e9es au cours d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou pendant qu'il se trouvait au si\u00e8ge social de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Toronto. Il n'a donn\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir quand ces incidents s'\u00e9taient produits ou quant \u00e0 savoir combien de fois ils se sont produits, mais il a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Bien, je l'ai tout simplement pris avec un grain de sel de la part de la personne qui affirme cela parce que je croyais que c'\u00e9tait tout simplement terrible la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle il se comportait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des hommes et des femmes, pas seulement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des femmes, vous savez, et je croyais-pour moi c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9gradant d'entendre une personne qui occupe un poste de ce genre parler des employ\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.)\n[14] Il est impossible de tirer une conclusion d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 partir d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve aussi vagues. Le fait que M. Roffey \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre un directeur avec lequel il \u00e9tait difficile de travailler et qu'il manquait peut-\u00eatre de courtoisie et qu'il \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre grossier lorsqu'il s'adressait \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, homme ou femme, ne suffit pas pour conclure que l'intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plaignante ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des autres employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin en raison du sexe.\n[15] La plaignante a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie entre d\u00e9cembre 2000 et mars 2001. En mars 2001, comme elle n'avait pas l'intention de retourner travailler pour l'intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a remis sa d\u00e9mission. Toutefois, elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Terry Barnett lui avait dit qu'elle pouvait revenir travailler quand elle s'en sentirait capable. La plaignante est \u00e9ventuellement retourn\u00e9e travailler en juin 2001, comme chauffeur \u00e0 temps partiel. Selon M. Barnett, c'\u00e9tait M. Westwood, le superviseur \u00e0 Orillia, qui l'avait r\u00e9embauch\u00e9e.\n[16] La plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage un autre incident qui s'est produit le 14 juillet 2001, alors qu'un inspecteur du minist\u00e8re des Transports de l'Ontario a demand\u00e9 d'inspecter l'autobus qu'elle conduisait. L'inspecteur a d\u00e9couvert qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me avec les pneus arri\u00e8re et a ordonn\u00e9 que l'autobus soit mis hors service. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle a alors appel\u00e9 au bureau de l'intim\u00e9e afin de l'informer de la situation. Elle a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Terry Barnett, lequel lui a dit ce qu'elle devait faire. Elle a parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage d'une conversation qu'elle avait eue plus tard avec un certain Greg Larson, qui, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, travaillait comme r\u00e9partiteur chez l'intim\u00e9e. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que celui-ci lui avait dit que Ron Roffey avait fait certains commentaires \u00e0 propos de cet incident. Comme Greg Larson n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, ses pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s commentaires quant aux remarques de Ron Roffey constituent du ou\u00ef-dire et ne sont pas admissibles en preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[17] La plaignante a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 d'un autre incident qui s'est produit le 26 juillet 2001. Ce jour-l\u00e0, M. Roffey lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait travers\u00e9, sans faire un arr\u00eat complet, ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant une voie ferr\u00e9e ferm\u00e9e sur Weston Road. Elle a r\u00e9pondu que la voie ferr\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait plus utilis\u00e9e et que l'autobus \u00e9tait vide. M. Roffey lui a dit que tous les autobus doivent faire un arr\u00eat aux passages \u00e0 niveau non munis d'un dispositif de protection et il lui a dit qu'elle devrait consid\u00e9rer la conversation qu'ils venaient d'avoir comme \u00e9tant une mise en garde. Le mari de la plaignante et M. Westwood ont affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage qu'ils ne faisaient jamais aucun arr\u00eat \u00e0 ce passage \u00e0 niveau. Quoi qu'il en soit, je ne peux tirer aucune conclusion de discrimination \u00e0 partir de cet incident.\n[18] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en ao\u00fbt 2001, son superviseur, John Westwood, s'est rendu chez elle et lui a dit que M. Roffey n'\u00e9tait pas content qu'il la r\u00e9embauche. Selon la plaignante, M. Westwood lui a dit que la direction lui avait ordonn\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Lorsqu'elle lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi, il lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne le savait pas. John Westwood a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, personnellement, il ne voulait pas cong\u00e9dier la plaignante mais que comme il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 64 ans et que son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade, il a estim\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas d'autre choix que d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la direction.\n[19] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'audience a eu lieu, les relations entre la plaignante et M. Westwood semblaient excellentes. Il semble qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas aussi bonnes en 2001. Au cours de l'automne 2001, il semble que les rapports que M. Westwood entretenait avec la plaignante se sont rapidement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9s. Lors de l'audience, la plaignante et M. Westwood ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser qu'on avait oblig\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 adopter une attitude hostile envers elle.\n[20] Les mauvaises relations qui existaient entre ces deux personnes sont illustr\u00e9es par une note dat\u00e9e du 18 octobre 2001. Le 16 octobre 2001, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de participer \u00e0 un cours de formation en conduite. Selon la note, M. Westwood \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7u du comportement de la plaignante lors de ce cours de formation. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait comport\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s peu professionnelle et qu'il avait re\u00e7u de nombreux commentaires \u00e0 propos de son attitude. M. Westwood a dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu'il voulait qu'elle am\u00e9liore son comportement. Des copies de cette note ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Barnett et \u00e0 M. Roffey. Au cours de l'audience, M. Westwood a tent\u00e9 d'assouplir son interpr\u00e9tation de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement. Il a essentiellement expliqu\u00e9 que l'attitude de la plaignante durant le cours de formation avait plus rapport avec son sens de l'humour qu'avec ce qu'il a qualifi\u00e9 dans ses notes de conduite non professionnelle.\n[21] M. Westwood a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que la note du 24 octobre 2001 ainsi que les autres notes se rapportant \u00e0 la plaignante, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites par le bureau de Toronto, lequel les lui avait impos\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9tay\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation en d\u00e9clarant que d'ordinaire il ne tapait pas ses lettres; il les \u00e9crivait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la main. Bien que cela soit possible, il n'en reste pas moins que M. Westwood a sign\u00e9 ces notes. De plus, la nature des renseignements figurant dans celles-ci ne permet pas de conclure que M. Westwood n'a aucunement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 leur r\u00e9daction. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Barnett a admis qu'il se pouvait que M. Westwood e\u00fbt envoy\u00e9 un certain nombre de notes manuscrites \u00e0 Toronto afin de les faire taper car l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia n'\u00e9tait pas dot\u00e9e des ressources n\u00e9cessaires sur le plan du secr\u00e9tariat.\n[22] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le 21 octobre 2001, le r\u00e9partiteur de l'intim\u00e9e lui a dit que Terry Barnett lui avait dit que l'on avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait alors t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Westwood, son superviseur, afin de v\u00e9rifier si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, M. Westwood [traduction] a fait une de ces col\u00e8res. Il lui a dit de monter dans l'autobus et de conduire. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait mis \u00e0 crier apr\u00e8s elle. Cette r\u00e9action de la part de M. Westwood ne t\u00e9moigne certainement pas de l'existence d'une bonne relation de travail entre la plaignante et ce dernier.\n[23] Deux jours plus tard, Terry Barnett a dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu'on l'avait confondue avec Barbara Tanzos, une coll\u00e8gue, dont l'emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e venait tout juste de prendre fin. Le 24 octobre 2001, M. Westwood a \u00e9crit une note de service \u00e0 la plaignante dans laquelle il s'est excus\u00e9 pour la col\u00e8re qu'il avait faite le 21 octobre 2001. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] Maureen, vous \u00eates un bon chauffeur et vous avez d\u00e9pann\u00e9 l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises dans des cas d'urgence et je vous en suis reconnaissant. Mais, vous avez de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler vos col\u00e8res, col\u00e8res dont j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin et dont j'ai fait l'objet \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises Dans sa note, il a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres incidents impliquant la plaignante et il lui a demand\u00e9 de lui remettre une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite.\n[24] La plaignante n'a jamais r\u00e9pondu. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience qu'elle n'avait pas r\u00e9pondu parce qu'elle estimait qu'il n'y avait [traduction] en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 rien \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre. Elle a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Ils ont invent\u00e9 tout \u00e7a et j'ai pens\u00e9 que si je daignais r\u00e9pondre, cela leur fournirait des preuves \u00e9crites quant \u00e0 mon pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 mauvais temp\u00e9rament et ils ins\u00e8reraient ma r\u00e9ponse dans leurs documents.\n[25] Le 6 novembre 2001, M. Westwood a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit : [traduction] Comme vous n'avez pas r\u00e9pondu [...], j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prendre les mesures suivantes. \u00c0 cette note, \u00e9tait jointe une note de service \u00e0 l'attention de M. Roffey avec copie conforme \u00e0 M. Barnett. Dans cette note de service, M. Westwood a fait la d\u00e9claration suivante : [traduction] Pendant environ deux ans, j'ai eu de nombreux conflits avec Maureen en raison de sa haine et de son ressentiment envers le personnel de la direction. Jusqu'\u00e0 tout r\u00e9cemment, sa carri\u00e8re de chauffeur \u00e9tait sans tache. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait un examen s\u00e9rieux, et afin de conserver des relations respectueuses entre les chauffeurs d'Orillia et moi-m\u00eame, je recommande que Maureen soit mut\u00e9e \u00e0 Weston Road (Toronto), et ce, \u00e0 compter du 9 novembre 2001. La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en raison de sa mutation \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de Toronto, elle doit maintenant consacrer trois heures par jour pour faire la navette entre sa r\u00e9sidence et son nouveau lieu de travail.\n[26] En ce qui concerne la mutation de la plaignante \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de Toronto, lorsque celle-ci a interrog\u00e9 M. Westwood, elle a tent\u00e9 de lui faire admettre que la raison de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait de donner l'occasion \u00e0 Ron Roffey de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. La premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse de M. Westwood a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : [traduction] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, ils croyaient qu'ils pouvaient vous accorder un emploi \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Weston Road. Lorsque la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Mais dans votre fort int\u00e9rieur, vous ne croyez tout de m\u00eame pas que Ron Roffey a fait les choses dans les r\u00e8gles en affirmant qu'il allait m'accorder un travail \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Toronto; c'\u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on de m'\u00e9loigner de vous de telle sorte qu'il puisse s'en occuper. N'est-ce pas?. Il a r\u00e9pondu avec h\u00e9sitation et d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s peu convaincante et il a ajout\u00e9 ceci : [traduction] C'est fort possible. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, il semblait [...] que si c'\u00e9tait l'intention-je crois que son intention \u00e9tait tout simplement celle que vous venez tout juste de mentionner, mais je ne l'ai pas cru \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.\n[27] \u00c0 l'audience, M. Westwood a affirm\u00e9 que les nombreux conflits auxquels il faisait allusion dans la note susmentionn\u00e9e \u00e9taient ceux qui avaient eu lieu avec la direction \u00e0 Toronto et non pas n\u00e9cessairement les conflits qu'il avait personnellement eus avec la plaignante. Tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage, les souvenirs des \u00e9v\u00e9nements relat\u00e9s par M. Westwood \u00e9taient pour la plupart vagues et impr\u00e9cis. M. Westwood semblait \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s craintif, il semblait m\u00eame s'excuser lorsqu'il a \u00e9valu\u00e9 l'attitude de la plaignante \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait superviseur de l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia. Il n'a bl\u00e2m\u00e9 que la direction, c'est-\u00e0-dire Ron Roffey et Terry Barnett, quant \u00e0 la situation. Il est important de se rappeler que M. Westwood avait eu ses propres probl\u00e8mes avec l'intim\u00e9e; des probl\u00e8mes qui l'avaient amen\u00e9 \u00e0 perdre son emploi. Il avait m\u00eame entrepris des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires pour cong\u00e9diement injuste contre l'intim\u00e9e et a \u00e9ventuellement sign\u00e9 une entente de r\u00e8glement avec elle. Il entretenait certainement ce que l'on pourrait appeler du ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de AZ Bus Tour car il estimait que celle-ci l'avait trait\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re injuste. Cela a certainement eu un effet sur son appr\u00e9ciation des faits.\n[28] Bien qu'il puisse \u00eatre vrai que M. Westwood a pu \u00eatre quelque peu r\u00e9ticent en rapport avec certaines d\u00e9cisions prises par la direction concernant la plaignante, il a n\u00e9anmoins sign\u00e9 les notes de service qui \u00e9taient adress\u00e9s \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, lesquelles notes de service ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es, comme nous l'avons vu, dans des termes durs. Il ne m'a pas convaincu que, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, il ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation qui \u00e9tait faite de la plaignante dans les notes de service susmentionn\u00e9es. Je crois qu'il a souscris \u00e0 l'opinion que la plaignante avait un probl\u00e8me de col\u00e8re et qu'elle entretenait du ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la direction. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'il avait remplac\u00e9 Tim Tanzola comme superviseur de l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia, cela [traduction] avait rendu les choses plut\u00f4t embarrassantes pour la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que, \u00e0 un certain moment, la plaignante [traduction] esp\u00e9rait que Tim conserve le poste de superviseur et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] froiss\u00e9 que son mari d\u00e9missionne de ce poste. Il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que la relation que la plaignante entretenait avec lui, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait [traduction] plut\u00f4t embarrassante, mais il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'ils ont \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les choses. Il est possible que les choses soient maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, mais ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas en 2001.\n[29] La plaignante a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la note de service concernant les chauffeurs \u00e0 temps partiel travaillant sur des quarts de travail alternatifs qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite par M. Westwood et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9es aux chauffeurs de l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia le 2 novembre 2001. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsque son mari occupait le poste de superviseur \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 d'Orillia, il n'y avait jamais eu aucun quart de travail alternatif. Elle a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction]Pendant ce temps, nous avons organis\u00e9 nos quarts de travail selon ce qui nous convenait le mieux. Certaines personnes aimaient travailler l'apr\u00e8s-midi, certaines aimaient travailler le jour, et, comme je l'ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9, mon mari et moi s'\u00e9tions partag\u00e9s les quarts de travail, l'un de nous deux travaillait le jour, l'autre travaillait le soir. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que John Westwood savait tr\u00e8s bien que, en mettant en place ce syst\u00e8me de rotation, il l'obligerait \u00e0 quitter son travail. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Ils savaient que, comme mon mari travaillait le jour, je devais travailler le soir ou que s'il travaillait le soir, je devais travailler le jour et que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 alternait ces quarts de travail, je ne pourrais plus travailler pour elle. Bien qu'il soit possible que cette nouvelle organisation de la rotation des quarts de travail ait occasionn\u00e9 certains d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments \u00e0 la plaignante ainsi qu'\u00e0 son \u00e9poux, je ne vois pas le lien que cela peut avoir avec les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Il est vrai que, comme elle l'a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, lorsque son mari \u00e9tait superviseur, ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 capables d'\u00e9tablir une routine de travail qui r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 leurs besoins familiaux et que cette routine \u00e9tait compromise par les changements qui \u00e9taient apport\u00e9s, mais elle ne m'a pas convaincu que ces changements furent apport\u00e9s dans le seul but d'agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[30] La plaignante a cess\u00e9 de travailler chez l'intim\u00e9e le 9 novembre 2001.\nB. L'analyse juridique [31] La pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure n'est pas une action en cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Ce dont je suis saisi, c'est d'une all\u00e9gation faite par la plaignante selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en cours d'emploi en raison de son sexe. Je dois r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question en me demandant si l'intim\u00e9e a trait\u00e9 la plaignante d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et pr\u00e9judiciable en comparaison de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin ou si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement en raison de son sexe.\n[32] Il est manifeste que la plaignante a ressenti beaucoup de frustration au cours de son emploi chez l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 tout le moins de 1999 au 9 novembre 2001. Il est \u00e9galement manifeste qu'elle est convaincue que l'intim\u00e9e l'a trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re injuste. Mais cela ne permet pas d'\u00e9tayer ses all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son sexe, et ce, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[33] L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit : constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. Le sexe est compris dans les motifs de distinction illicite mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi. L'article 10 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit : constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite. Contrairement aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi, lequel article a trait aux actes des employeurs touchant des personnes pr\u00e9cises, l'article 10 de la Loi a trait \u00e0 l'effet discriminatoire que les lignes de conduites fix\u00e9es par un employeur peuvent avoir sur un individu ou sur une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus. Rien en l'esp\u00e8ce ne me permet de conclure que l'intim\u00e9e a viol\u00e9 l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[34] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 7, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire, au sens de cet article, en la d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi, par des moyens directs ou indirects, pour un motif de distinction illicite, soit le sexe.\n[35] Pour avoir gain de cause, les plaignants dans les causes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9. (Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28.)\n[36] La plaignante ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ce fardeau. Elle n'a jamais \u00e9tabli que l'intim\u00e9e a commis un quelconque acte discriminatoire envers elle au cours de son emploi. La preuve n'a pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu'il existait, au lieu d'affaires de l'intim\u00e9e, une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de lignes de conduite et que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son sexe.\n[37] Rien dans la preuve ne d\u00e9montre que les lignes de conduite de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et qu'elles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9judiciables aux chauffeurs de sexe f\u00e9minin. Au contraire, la preuve d\u00e9montre que les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin devaient r\u00e9pondre aux m\u00eames exigences et poss\u00e9der les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences. La preuve n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les chauffeurs de sexe masculin \u00e9taient mieux trait\u00e9s que les chauffeurs de sexe f\u00e9minins. Les lignes de conduite de l'intim\u00e9e n'emp\u00eachaient pas les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin d'obtenir et de faire le m\u00eame travail que les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin.\n[38] Les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante n'\u00e9tablissent aucun lien entre la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e et le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait une femme. Afin de faire une analyse plus approfondie, je dois \u00eatre convaincu que la plaignante s'est acquitt\u00e9e de son premier fardeau et qu'elle a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La plaignante ne s'est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ce fardeau.\n[39] La Loi n'a pas pour objet de sanctionner ce qui, selon un plaignant, constitue une faute de la part de son employeur, mais de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination. Rien ne prouve qu'il y a eu discrimination en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nII.

Hadjis\n[TRADUCTION]\n[1] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant l'ajournement de la nouvelle audience portant sur une partie de la plainte.\n[2] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2004, le Tribunal qui a entendu le premier la preuve relative \u00e0 la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce a rendu une d\u00e9cision portant que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination raciale relatives \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode de concours pratiqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es (Brooks c. Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans, 2004 TCDP 36). L'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de r\u00e9viser cette d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[3] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement conclu dans sa d\u00e9cision que le plaignant n'aurait pas obtenu un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le concours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Cette conclusion a eu pour incidence que le plaignant a vu rejeter sa demande d'int\u00e9gration dans l'emploi pour lequel il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature ainsi que sa demande d'indemnisation des pertes de salaire qu'il a subies en n'obtenant pas le poste. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, mais uniquement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la conclusion susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 18 octobre 2006, le juge Michael A. Kelen a rendu un jugement rejetant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l'intim\u00e9 mais accueillant la demande du plaignant (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, 2006 CF 1244). La Cour a jug\u00e9 que le Tribunal n'avait pas appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique appropri\u00e9 pour conclure que le plaignant n'aurait pas obtenu un poste permanent m\u00eame s'il n'y avait pas eu discrimination. La Cour, par cons\u00e9quent, a rejet\u00e9 cette conclusion et a renvoy\u00e9 l'affaire au Tribunal pour qu'une nouvelle d\u00e9cision soit rendue par un tribunal diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9 au vu du dossier dont le Tribunal est d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisi. La Cour a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 que les parties se voient donner l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations au Tribunal quant \u00e0 cette question. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment inform\u00e9 les parties qu'une date (probablement en avril ou mai 2007) sera fix\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la tenue de cette nouvelle audience, laquelle ne devrait pas durer plus d'une journ\u00e9e.\n[5] Le 17 novembre 2006, l'intim\u00e9 a interjet\u00e9 appel du jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente maintenant une requ\u00eate au Tribunal demandant que la nouvelle audience soit ajourn\u00e9e en attendant que l'appel soit tranch\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[6] Selon le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l'instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et, de fa\u00e7on particuli\u00e8rement pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Toutefois, en tant que ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal peut, n\u00e9anmoins, ajourner une instance lorsqu'il estime que cela est appropri\u00e9 (Voir L\u00e9ger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada [1999] D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en tenant compte des principes de la justice naturelle (Baltruweit, paragraphe 17). On pourrait donner comme exemples de probl\u00e8me en mati\u00e8re de justice naturelle auquel le Tribunal pourrait \u00eatre confront\u00e9, la non-disponibilit\u00e9 de la preuve, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'ajourner afin que l'on puisse se pr\u00e9valoir des services d'un avocat ou une divulgation tardive de la part de la partie adverse.\n[7] L'intim\u00e9 ne m'a pas convaincu que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'un probl\u00e8me de ce genre.\n[8] L'intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale puisse renverser la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ainsi que celle du Tribunal, en tout ou en partie, ce qui pourrait avoir comme cons\u00e9quence que l'on conclut qu'il n'y a jamais eu discrimination. Si, dans l'intervalle, le Tribunal entend de nouveau l'affaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la d\u00e9cision qu'il rendra sera frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9. Le temps et les efforts consacr\u00e9s par les parties dans le cadre de ce processus auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 inutiles, surtout si, comme l'intim\u00e9 le donne \u00e0 penser dans ses observations \u00e9crites, [traduction] il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer que le Tribunal arrivera \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion [apr\u00e8s la nouvelle audience] que celle \u00e0 laquelle il est arriv\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement. Cette situation, pr\u00e9tend-on, serait susceptible de d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l'administration de la justice.\n[9] Pourquoi pr\u00e9tendrait-on une telle chose? Il est \u00e9galement possible que le Tribunal diff\u00e9remment constitu\u00e9 arrivera \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle \u00e0 laquelle est arriv\u00e9 l'autre Tribunal et que la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale maintiendra la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, auquel cas, si le pr\u00e9sent ajournement est accord\u00e9, le processus de tenue d'une nouvelle audience aura \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9 inutilement pendant des mois, voire m\u00eame des ann\u00e9es. Le processus devra alors \u00eatre recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau et le r\u00e8glement ultime de la plainte sera retard\u00e9 davantage. Cela constituerait difficilement une ex\u00e9cution exp\u00e9ditive des instances devant le Tribunal.\n[10] Il est impossible de pr\u00e9dire quel sera, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00e9sultat final des proc\u00e9dures. Toutefois, pour que l'intim\u00e9 obtienne un ajournement, il doit \u00e9tablir que si l'on permet que les proc\u00e9dures suivent leur cours normal, notamment que l'on se conforme \u00e0 l'ordonnance du juge Kelen de tenir une nouvelle audience, il en r\u00e9sultera un d\u00e9ni de ses droits \u00e0 la justice naturelle. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il subirait n\u00e9cessairement un tel pr\u00e9judice.\n[11] La requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Conclusion\nI. LE CONTEXTE [1] Sandra Graham, la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce, travaille pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne de postes (SCP) depuis 1977 et a occup\u00e9 divers postes au centre de traitement du courrier de Winnipeg (CTCW). Le 4 juin 2001, elle a obtenu le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim dans les services de transport urbain (UTS). Son poste d'attache \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e9tait celui de superviseure dans l'UTS. Mme Graham a accept\u00e9 ce poste afin que le surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Dave Smook, puisse temporairement quitter son poste afin de repr\u00e9senter les gestionnaires dans une initiative conjointe de la SCP et du Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP) qui portait le nom de projet [traduction] Annexe AA.\n[2] Lorsque Mme Graham a accept\u00e9 le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le CTCW se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 lancer le projet Annexe AA, lequel n\u00e9cessitait la mise en uvre d'importants changements au service de livraison et de ramassage de colis de la SCP. \u00c0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim dans l'UTS, elle avait une tr\u00e8s grande responsabilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la mise en application du projet.\n[3] Le 21 mai 2002, Mme Graham ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail, et elle est rest\u00e9e absente jusqu'en novembre 2005, auquel moment elle a repris le travail \u00e0 plein temps. Elle a soutenu qu'elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9vou\u00e9e au projet et qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 le voir men\u00e9 \u00e0 terme avec succ\u00e8s. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le stress, les longues heures de travail et le manque de soutien en mati\u00e8re de gestion lui ont caus\u00e9 un \u00e9puisement professionnel. Elle est tomb\u00e9e malade et ne pouvait plus travailler.\n[4] Le 12 septembre 2003, pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9, Mme Graham a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte quelques mois apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 la SCP d'intervenir en son nom aupr\u00e8s des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la SCP afin de tenter de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s qui se posaient entre elle et son gestionnaire en raison de son absence.\nII. LES ALL\u00c9GATIONS DE DISCRIMINATION DE MME GRAHAM [5] Dans sa plainte, Mme Graham soutient que :\nLa SCP a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience temporaire; la SCP l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience; all\u00e9gations qui rel\u00e8vent toutes deux de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP), la SCP l'a r\u00e9trograd\u00e9e de son poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience; cependant, elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quel article de la LCDP avait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9; dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour l'audience devant le Tribunal, Mme Graham a ajout\u00e9 une autre all\u00e9gation, soit que sa d\u00e9ficience et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par le fait que la SCP ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s et de soutien pour qu'elle puisse effectuer son travail.\n[6] En guise de question pr\u00e9liminaire, le Tribunal a aussi examin\u00e9 si on lui avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves lui permettant de raisonnablement conclure que Mme Graham souffrait bien d'une d\u00e9ficience pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[7] Mme Graham a refus\u00e9 d'inclure dans sa divulgation avant l'audience des documents m\u00e9dicaux qui d\u00e9crivaient la nature de sa d\u00e9ficience et elle a choisi de ne pas pr\u00e9senter de telles preuves m\u00e9dicales \u00e0 l'audience. Depuis le d\u00e9but, elle est d'avis qu'il s'agit de renseignements confidentiels qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la SCP. En l'absence de preuves m\u00e9dicales, le Tribunal devait d\u00e9terminer si Mme Graham avait bien souffert d'une maladie qui l'avait emp\u00each\u00e9e de travailler pendant la p\u00e9riode en question et si cette maladie constituait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la LCDP.\n[8] Le dernier argument de Mme Graham \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s vaste et il n'y avait aucune pr\u00e9cision ni en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce qu'elle qualifiait d'actes discriminatoires de la part de la SCP, ni en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve \u00e0 l'appui. Son dernier argument n'a gu\u00e8re aid\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 prendre une d\u00e9cision au sujet de sa plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal traite chacune des quatre all\u00e9gations de discrimination pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans sa plainte et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nIII. LA D\u00c9CISION [9] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j'ai conclu que la preuve permettait d'affirmer que Mme Graham avait souffert d'une d\u00e9ficience pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle s'\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e du travail.\n[10] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de Mme Graham selon lesquelles la SCP n'a pas pris de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience temporaire, l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e et ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s de soutien, ce qui a caus\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience, j'ai conclu que Mme Graham n'a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Quant \u00e0 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la SCP a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi \u00e0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, je conclus que Mme Graham a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Cependant, la SCP a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de s'acquitter de son obligation d'accommodement envers Mme Graham parce que cette derni\u00e8re n'a pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d'accommodement. Par cons\u00e9quent, le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Graham contre la SCP n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 et la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. LES FAITS (i) Le projet Annexe AA [11] En mai 2001, M. Dave Smook, le surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'UTS, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Ken Gordon et \u00e0 Mme Graham, qui \u00e9taient tous deux superviseurs dans l'UTS, si l'un d'eux \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 prendre le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9rimaire pendant qu'il travaillait comme repr\u00e9sentant des gestionnaires au projet conjoint de la SCP et du STTP, le projet Annexe AA. M. Gordon n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Il croyait que la charge de travail serait beaucoup plus importante que celle qu'il avait \u00e0 titre de superviseur. Il disait avoir une vie \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du travail. Mme Graham croyait qu'il s'agissait d'une excellente occasion et elle a accept\u00e9 le poste avec bonne volont\u00e9.\n[12] Mme Graham est entr\u00e9e en poste \u00e0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim le 4 juin 2001. Avant de quitter l'UTS, M. Smook a tent\u00e9 de montrer \u00e0 Mme Graham les responsabilit\u00e9s du poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cependant, comme il devait se concentrer sur des questions plus pressantes, Mme Graham n'a pu qu'observer ce qu'il faisait et a eu peu de temps pour mettre ces observations en pratique avant que M. Smook quitte son poste.\n[13] Mme Graham a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'au moment o\u00f9 elle a accept\u00e9 le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim, le projet n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en uvre. M\u00eame si elle ne savait pas quelles seraient les responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises de son poste, elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 y travailler et \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien le projet. Elle a accept\u00e9 le poste en sachant qu'elle devrait travailler beaucoup plus que dans le poste de superviseur qu'elle occupait auparavant. Mme Graham a aussi accept\u00e9 le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim parce qu'elle croyait que cela l'aiderait \u00e0 atteindre son objectif de carri\u00e8re, soit d'obtenir un poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral permanent.\n[14] L'objet du projet pilote Annexe AA \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer la faisabilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration \u00e0 l'UTS de la livraison des colis acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9s en milieu urbain ainsi que du ramassage pour les petits et moyens clients et l'\u00e9limination de la partie des services de livraison qui \u00e9tait assur\u00e9e par des entrepreneurs de l'ext\u00e9rieur.\n[15] Le STTP appuyait ce changement parce que cela signifiait qu'il y aurait plus de travail pour ses membres au CTCW. La SCP voulait mettre en uvre ce changement parce qu'elle esp\u00e9rait que cela aiderait son service de livraison de colis \u00e0 correspondre aux normes de l'industrie et la rendrait plus concurrentielle par rapport aux autres compagnies de livraison de colis.\n[16] En plus d'attribuer \u00e0 l'interne l'exploitation du syst\u00e8me de livraison des colis, le projet Annexe AA apportait d'autres changements importants, y compris le transfert d'un syst\u00e8me ax\u00e9 sur les articles \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me ax\u00e9 sur les arr\u00eats et l'introduction d'une journ\u00e9e de travail dynamique plut\u00f4t que des quarts de travail fixes. Les activit\u00e9s de la SCP passaient aussi de six jours \u00e0 sept jours.\n[17] La journ\u00e9e de travail dynamique signifiait que les livreurs de service postal, c'est-\u00e0-dire les chauffeurs qui ramassaient et livraient les colis, n'avaient plus de quarts de travail fixes. Par exemple, un chauffeur pourrait effectuer des livraisons le matin et n'en avoir d'autres \u00e0 faire qu'en fin d'apr\u00e8s-midi ou en d\u00e9but de soir\u00e9e. Ce n'\u00e9tait plus la rapidit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cution du travail des chauffeurs qui comptait, leur journ\u00e9e de travail \u00e9tait maintenant rentabilis\u00e9e au maximum. En fonction du volume, un chauffeur pouvait travailler plus longtemps le lundi, moins longtemps le mardi, etc.\n[18] Un autre changement apport\u00e9 par le projet Annexe AA \u00e9tait l'\u00e9tiquetage, la saisie et le classement des colis, le tout fait par ordinateur. Les chauffeurs n'avaient donc plus \u00e0 s'occuper de l'organisation de leurs itin\u00e9raires. Dans la nouvelle section, les commis aux postes s'occupaient d\u00e9sormais du triage des colis et du chargement des camions de livraison.\n[19] La mise en uvre de la phase 1 du projet Annexe AA a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en octobre 2001 et touchait la zone du centre-ville, qui repr\u00e9sente environ la moiti\u00e9 de la ville de Winnipeg. La mise en application de la phase 1 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 beaucoup de stress \u00e0 l'UTS parce que le projet \u00e9tait tout nouveau, les crit\u00e8res op\u00e9rationnels \u00e9taient en cours d'\u00e9laboration et \u00e9taient r\u00e9vis\u00e9s \u00e0 mesure que le projet \u00e9voluait.\n[20] Au d\u00e9part, il y a eu une r\u00e9sistance consid\u00e9rable de la part des chauffeurs. Ils \u00e9taient m\u00e9contents du sectionnement de leur journ\u00e9e de travail. De plus, ils ne connaissaient pas les nouvelles proc\u00e9dures. L'attribution \u00e0 l'interne des t\u00e2ches a caus\u00e9 une augmentation importante du volume de travail qui, ajout\u00e9 aux volumes normalement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant No\u00ebl, a cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour les chauffeurs encore plus de stress et de m\u00e9contentement.\n[21] Les chauffeurs \u00e9taient aussi m\u00e9contents parce qu'ils perdaient ainsi une grande partie du contr\u00f4le qu'ils avaient sur leur travail. Avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du projet Annexe AA, les chauffeurs choisissaient la s\u00e9quence de leurs livraisons. Un syst\u00e8me de s\u00e9quen\u00e7age automatis\u00e9 devait d\u00e9sormais se charger de ce processus d\u00e9cisionnel, que les chauffeurs avaient donc perdu. De plus, de nombreux chauffeurs livraient des colis aux m\u00eames entreprises depuis des ann\u00e9es et avaient \u00e9tabli des relations avec elles. Apr\u00e8s la mise en uvre du projet, ils ne livraient plus n\u00e9cessairement des colis \u00e0 ces clients.\n[22] Selon Ken Gordon et Thomas Zarzycki, qui \u00e9taient tous deux des superviseurs \u00e0 l'UTS, la p\u00e9riode d'octobre 2001 jusqu'au d\u00e9but de la mise en uvre de la phase 2 en f\u00e9vrier 2002 a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement stressante tant pour les superviseurs que pour les chauffeurs.\n[23] Comme les chauffeurs ne connaissaient pas la nouvelle proc\u00e9dure, ils appelaient les superviseurs, ce qui signifie que ces derniers passaient beaucoup de temps au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les probl\u00e8mes des chauffeurs. Ils ne pouvaient donc pas toujours terminer leurs autres t\u00e2ches pendant leurs heures habituelles. Les superviseurs devaient aussi composer avec les appels de plus en plus nombreux de la part de clients, parce que ceux-ci ne connaissaient pas la nouvelle proc\u00e9dure. Cette t\u00e2che occupait plus d'heures dans l'horaire des superviseurs qu'avant la mise en uvre du projet.\n[24] La phase 2 du projet Annexe AA, qui touchait le reste de la ville, a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2002. M. Gordon et M. Sylvester ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il y avait alors moins de pression et moins de stress au sein de l'UTS. \u00c0 cette date, les chauffeurs, les clients et les superviseurs avaient appris \u00e0 se familiariser avec le nouveau syst\u00e8me et le connaissaient mieux, la charge de travail, \u00e9lev\u00e9e en raison de No\u00ebl, \u00e9tait revenue \u00e0 la normale et les erreurs dans le syst\u00e8me avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es.\n(ii) Mme Graham et le projet Annexe AA - du 4 juin 2001 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2002 [25] Lorsque Mme Graham a \u00e9t\u00e9 promue au poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim, elle tenait \u00e0 trouver une fa\u00e7on de garantir que les chauffeurs aiment leur travail et de permettre aux superviseurs de quitter \u00e0 la fin de leur journ\u00e9e de travail de huit heures avec la satisfaction de savoir que leur travail \u00e9tait bien fait. \u00c0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim, elle \u00e9tait responsable des superviseurs et elle devait s'assurer qu'ils effectuent leurs t\u00e2ches tous les jours. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas directement responsable des chauffeurs; les superviseurs avaient cette t\u00e2che.\n[26] Au d\u00e9but, Mme Graham ne connaissait pas bien toutes les t\u00e2ches et les responsabilit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 son poste. Cependant, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait graduellement sentie confortable \u00e0 son poste. Elle \u00e9tait quelque peu stress\u00e9e, mais elle \u00e9tait confiante que la mise en uvre de la phase 1 serait couronn\u00e9e de succ\u00e8s.\n[27] Cependant, alors que la mise en uvre de la phase 1 avan\u00e7ait, Mme Graham a senti plus de pression en raison de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier serr\u00e9 pour la mise en application de cette phase et parce qu'elle croyait que les ressources \u00e9taient insuffisantes. Apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9e de No\u00ebl, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir les sympt\u00f4mes physiques de la grippe et elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 se sentir mieux. Elle avait travaill\u00e9 de longues heures, sept jours sur sept, et elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s fatigu\u00e9e.\n[28] En raison de ses longues heures de travail, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 classer ses t\u00e2ches quotidiennes par ordre de priorit\u00e9. Elle n'arrivait pas \u00e0 se concentrer sur une chose \u00e0 la fois et m\u00eame les t\u00e2ches les plus simples lui semblaient \u00e9crasantes. \u00c0 certains moments, elle se sentait comme une rat\u00e9e. Elle ne donnait plus son soutien aux personnes dont elle \u00e9tait responsable.\n(iii) Mme Graham et la phase 2 du projet Annexe AA - de f\u00e9vrier 2002 au 21 mai 2002 [29] Dan Sylvester a pris le poste de gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations en janvier 2002. Il travaillait pour la SCP depuis 20 ans et avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 gestionnaire \u00e0 l'UTS. Lorsqu'il a pris le poste, la phase 1 \u00e9tait presque termin\u00e9e et l'UTS se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 mettre en uvre la phase 2 au d\u00e9but f\u00e9vrier 2002.\n[30] M. Sylvester a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Graham le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2002 pour discuter du plan d'activit\u00e9s d'op\u00e9rations de Winnipeg, du plan d'am\u00e9lioration du rendement de Mme Graham et de l'examen des comp\u00e9tences annuel. Le plan d'am\u00e9lioration du rendement porte sur des objectifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s li\u00e9s \u00e0 des crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9cis qui n\u00e9cessitent une am\u00e9lioration et sur des objectifs de rendements qui comprennent des objectifs de perfectionnement personnel. L'examen des comp\u00e9tences annuel vise \u00e0 cibler les besoins en mati\u00e8re de formation pour des comp\u00e9tences pr\u00e9cises.\n[31] Mme Graham a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours de cette rencontre, elle a dit \u00e0 M. Sylvester qu'elle \u00e9tait surcharg\u00e9e et stress\u00e9e et qu'elle se sentait malade. Mme Graham ne se souvient pas que pendant cette rencontre, elle ait fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de sa surcharge de travail et du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait malade. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au cours de cette rencontre, elle \u00e9tait toujours d'avis que plus d'heures de supervision seraient n\u00e9cessaire pour la phase 2.\n[32] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002, Mme Graham a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 M. Sylvester et lui a demand\u00e9 de la retourner \u00e0 son poste d'attache \u00e0 titre de superviseure au sein de l'UTS. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que comme surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim, elle avait donn\u00e9 tout ce qu'elle avait et fait tout ce qu'elle pouvait pour que le projet soit un succ\u00e8s, mais qu'elle \u00e9tait insult\u00e9e de la cote qu'on lui avait donn\u00e9e dans son \u00e9valuation de rendement de 2001. La SCP semblait avoir conclu que les meilleurs efforts de Mme Graham n'\u00e9taient pas suffisants. Elle \u00e9tait d'avis que les attentes de la SCP n'\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9alistes compte tenu de l'\u00e9tat de la dotation en personnel lors de la mise en uvre du projet Annexe AA.\n[33] M. Sylvester a confirm\u00e9 qu'elle pouvait reprendre son poste d'attache et il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il afficherait l'ouverture du poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim sur le r\u00e9seau des carri\u00e8res de la SCP. Cependant, Mme Graham \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il faudrait au moins un \u00e0 deux mois pour trouver un remplacement et que cette personne ne conna\u00eetrait probablement pas le fonctionnement de l'UTS. Elle croyait que si une nouvelle personne prenait le poste \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, cela pourrait avoir un effet n\u00e9gatif pour le projet Annexe AA. Elle voulait continuer \u00e0 travailler sur le projet, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait \u00e9puis\u00e9e. Elle avait \u00e0 cur le succ\u00e8s du projet et l'UTS. Deux jours plus tard, Mme Graham a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sylvester et lui a annonc\u00e9 qu'elle resterait au poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim.\n[34] M. Sylvester a expliqu\u00e9 que l'une des choses dont il avait discut\u00e9 avec Mme Graham \u00e9tait la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de certaines de ses t\u00e2ches aux superviseurs, ce qu'elle pouvait faire \u00e0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Cependant, Mme Graham a seulement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 son ancien poste de superviseur et elle n'a pas demand\u00e9 d'autres mesures d'accommodement.\n[35] En mars 2002, Mme Graham a donn\u00e9 une pr\u00e9sentation Powerpoint lors d'une r\u00e9union des superviseurs et des gestionnaires de l'UTS. L'une de ses propositions \u00e9tait l'ajout de superviseurs \u00e0 l'UTS. M. Sylvester s'est souvenu de cette pr\u00e9sentation et de cette demande. Il en a discut\u00e9 avec son directeur, Fred Pollard, qui a mis en doute la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un tel ajout et a conclu qu'aucun nouveau poste de superviseur ne serait ouvert.\n[36] Avant janvier 2002, il n'y avait qu'un seul surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et quatre superviseurs dans l'UTS. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve documentaire, en f\u00e9vrier 2002 le nombre de superviseurs \u00e0 l'UTS \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 six. Ces superviseurs \u00e9taient : T. Zarzycki, L. Macario, K. Gordon, B. Friesen, N. MacLean et P. Hamel.\n[37] M. Sylvester a de nouveau rencontr\u00e9 Mme Graham le 26 avril 2002. \u00c0 titre de gestionnaire, M. Sylvester pouvait rencontrer tous les trimestres les personnes qu'il supervisait. Il le faisait afin de prendre du temps pour donner de l'encadrement individualis\u00e9 et cela lui permettait de partager les succ\u00e8s de l'UTS avec les employ\u00e9s.\n[38] M. Sylvester savait que Mme Graham travaillait de longues heures, mais il n'avait pas de compte exact. Il laissait beaucoup de souplesse et comme elle \u00e9tait surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle pouvait organiser son propre horaire. M. Sylvester a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, Mme Graham n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait malade et n'a pas demand\u00e9 de mesure d'accommodement.\n(iv) L'absence du travail de Mme Graham et les communications Sylvester\/Graham - juin 2002 [39] Le 21 mai 2002, Mme Graham a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Diana Quilty, une bonne amie de Mme Graham qui travaillait aussi au CTCW, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Graham \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s engag\u00e9e envers le projet Annexe AA et qu'elle voulait s'assurer qu'il serait mis en uvre avec succ\u00e8s. Apr\u00e8s le lancement de la phase 2, Mme Quilty a remarqu\u00e9 que Mme Graham devenait de plus en plus stress\u00e9e et \u00e0 bout de nerf. Elle avait tent\u00e9 de convaincre Mme Graham de prendre un cong\u00e9, mais Mme Graham avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 se rendre au travail r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement.\n[40] Ce jour-l\u00e0, Mme Graham a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Quilty et lui a demand\u00e9 de passer chez elle parce qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade et avait besoin d'aide. Mme Quilty a trouv\u00e9 Mme Graham couch\u00e9e sur le plancher; elle n'arrivait plus \u00e0 se lever. Elle ne pouvait pas aller travailler.\n[41] M. Sylvester a appris que Mme Graham ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail lorsque M. Tom Zarzycki lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour l'aviser que Mme Graham n'\u00e9tait pas au travail et qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e depuis quelques jours. M. Zarzycki a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sylvester si elle lui avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9. M. Sylvester lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne l'avait pas fait et qu'il essaierait de la rejoindre parce qu'elle n'avait pas l'habitude de s'absenter du travail sans avertir quelqu'un \u00e0 l'UTS.\n[42] Il a tent\u00e9 de rejoindre Mme Graham sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, sans succ\u00e8s. Il lui a alors envoy\u00e9 un courriel dans lequel il lui demandait de lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner. Il s'inqui\u00e9tait \u00e0 son sujet et il voulait savoir comment elle allait. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il posait la question non seulement parce qu'il \u00e9tait son employeur, mais parce qu'il \u00e9tait son ami. Peu apr\u00e8s, M. Sylvester a re\u00e7u sur sa bo\u00eete vocale un message de Mme Graham, qui lui expliquait qu'elle ne se sentait pas bien et qu'elle serait absente pour le reste de la semaine, ainsi que pendant la semaine suivante.\n[43] Lorsque M. Sylvester a appris que Mme Graham serait absente pour le reste de la semaine et la semaine suivante, il s'est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 parce qu'il a pens\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre quelque chose de grave. Il a suppos\u00e9 qu'elle irait voir son m\u00e9decin. Il a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Graham une lettre de suivi le 27 mai 2002 dans laquelle il mentionnait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 qu'elle serait absente du travail pendant un certain temps. Il a joint une \u00e9valuation de l'aptitude physique au travail (EAPT) et lui a demand\u00e9 de faire remplir l'\u00e9valuation par son m\u00e9decin et de la renvoyer au plus tard le 3 juin 2002. Il a joint le formulaire EAPT afin de comprendre les restrictions et les limites de travail de Mme Graham et de lui offrir un accommodement s'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[44] Mme Graham a pris un rendez-vous avec son m\u00e9decin, le Dr Ibbitt, qui a effectu\u00e9 certains examens. Ceux-ci ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Mme Graham n'avait aucun probl\u00e8me physique et le Dr Ibbitt a conclu que du repos l'aiderait et que ses sympt\u00f4mes dispara\u00eetraient.\n[45] Le Dr Ibbitt a rempli l'EAPT le 30 mai 2002. Il n'y a inscrit aucun d\u00e9tail au sujet de la maladie de Mme Graham et n'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 aucune restriction ou limite de travail. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Graham retournerait au travail sept jours plus tard. Les services de sant\u00e9 au travail (SST) de la SCP ont re\u00e7u l'EAPT le 3 juin 2002.\n[46] M. Sylvester s'attendait \u00e0 ce que Mme Graham retourne au travail le 6 juin 2002. Lorsqu'elle ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il lui a \u00e9crit le jour-m\u00eame et a mentionn\u00e9 que son m\u00e9decin avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle serait absente pendant sept jours. Il n'avait aucun d\u00e9tail au sujet de son absence ou d'un quelconque cong\u00e9 qu'elle aurait demand\u00e9. Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait essay\u00e9 de nombreuses fois de la rejoindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et par courriel, mais qu'elle n'avait pas communiqu\u00e9 avec lui directement. La seule fa\u00e7on qu'il avait de communiquer avec elle et de garantir qu'elle recevait les lettres \u00e9tait de les lui envoyer par Xpresspost.\n[47] Dans sa lettre, il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Graham qu'il lui retirait le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim et qu'il l'a r\u00e9affectait au poste d'assistance aux superviseurs en attendant la prochaine ouverture de poste ou en attendant son retour \u00e0 son ancien poste de superviseur. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il faisait cela parce c'\u00e9tait le mieux pour sa maladie et pour le projet Annexe AA. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par Tom Zarzycki en juin 2002.\n[48] Mme Graham a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait laiss\u00e9 un message sur la bo\u00eete vocale de l'UTS dans lequel elle pr\u00e9cisait que le Dr Ibbitt r\u00e9\u00e9valuerait son \u00e9tat le 6 juin 2002. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il y avait des changements dans son \u00e9tat, elle laissait un message sur la bo\u00eete vocale de M. Sylvester ou sur la bo\u00eete vocale de l'UTS. Elle ne communiquait pas directement avec lui pour diverses raisons. Ses habitudes de sommeil \u00e9taient chamboul\u00e9es. Sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir de fa\u00e7on rationnelle \u00e9tait d\u00e9stabilis\u00e9e. Elle n'osait pas parler directement \u00e0 M. Sylvester parce qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il ferait preuve de soutien envers elle.\n[49] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique de la SCP, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 s'absente du travail, il doit t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 son superviseur, ou \u00e0 une autre personne si ce dernier n'est pas rejoignable, et doit mentionner la date \u00e0 laquelle il compte revenir au travail. \u00c0 son retour, il pr\u00e9sente habituellement une note m\u00e9dicale s'il s'est absent\u00e9 plus de quelques jours. Si l'employ\u00e9 ne sait pas pendant combien de temps il sera absent, les SST demandent que son m\u00e9decin remplisse une EAPT afin que la SCP ait une id\u00e9e de la nature de la maladie ou de la blessure, de la date pr\u00e9vue de retour au travail, des limites de travail et des mesures d'accommodement n\u00e9cessaires, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Ces renseignements sont envoy\u00e9s aux SST.\n[50] Lorsque le Dr Ibbitt a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 Mme Graham le 6 juin 2002, il a rempli un certificat pour absence m\u00e9dicale dans lequel il expliquait qu'il s'occupait de Mme Graham depuis le 6 juin 2002, qu'elle \u00e9tait absente pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et qu'elle serait en mesure de retourner au travail le 10 juin 2002. Mme Graham a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9 ce certificat soit \u00e0 M. Sylvester directement, soit aux SST.\n[51] Lorsqu'il a \u00e9crit sa lettre le 6 juin 2002, M. Sylvester n'avait pas encore re\u00e7u le certificat m\u00e9dical du Dr Ibbitt qui pr\u00e9cisait que Mme Graham serait absente jusqu'au 10 juin 2002. Mme Graham a convenu qu'\u00e0 partir du 6 juin 2002, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de M. Sylvester et qu'elle avait eu les m\u00eames renseignements que lui, elle aurait alors suppos\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait absent sans permission (ASP). Cependant, \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du certificat m\u00e9dical du Dr Ibbitt, il aurait eu les documents n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer que l'absence de Mme Graham avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e jusqu'au 10 juin. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait laiss\u00e9 un message sur les bo\u00eetes vocales des num\u00e9ros que M. Sylvester avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans sa lettre et sur la bo\u00eete vocale de l'UTS au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment.\n[52] Mme Graham n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de retourner au travail le 10 juin. Elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Sylvester et a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 annuel parce qu'elle avait des rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux qu'elle ne pouvait pas d\u00e9placer. M. Sylvester a r\u00e9pondu le 11 juin et a confirm\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat de ses cong\u00e9s : cong\u00e9 de maladie jusqu'au 7 juin 2002 et cong\u00e9 annuel du 10 au 14 juin. Il a r\u00e9\u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Graham le 13 juin pour lui demander de se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 19 h le 16 juin au poste de superviseur de nuit \u00e0 l'UTS.\n[53] M. Sylvester lui a ensuite envoy\u00e9 une lettre le 17 juin 2002. Il y mentionnait qu'il avait re\u00e7u le message qu'elle avait laiss\u00e9 sur sa bo\u00eete vocale, dans lequel elle expliquait qu'elle allait obtenir un rendez-vous m\u00e9dical et qu'elle serait absente pour le reste de la semaine. Il lui a demand\u00e9 de faire remplir une autre EAPT par son m\u00e9decin au plus tard le 19 juin pour qu'il puisse comprendre ses restrictions ou ses limites de travail. Il lui a aussi demand\u00e9 d'aviser son m\u00e9decin que la SCP pouvait offrir des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es ou des t\u00e2ches de remplacement.\n[54] Mme Graham a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e et trait\u00e9e au service des urgences de l'h\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral St-Boniface le 19 juin 2002. Le m\u00e9decin traitant lui a donn\u00e9 une note m\u00e9dicale dans laquelle il pr\u00e9cisait qu'elle aurait besoin de deux \u00e0 quatre semaines de cong\u00e9 parce qu'elle \u00e9tait malade. Les deux \u00e0 quatre semaines correspondaient au temps n\u00e9cessaire pr\u00e9vu pour qu'elle obtienne un rendez-vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste.\n[55] Le 21 juin, M. Sylvester a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Graham pour lui dire qu'il avait re\u00e7u le certificat du m\u00e9decin de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface au sujet des deux \u00e0 quatre semaines de cong\u00e9 dont elle aurait besoin parce qu'elle \u00e9tait malade. Il lui a de nouveau demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter l'EAPT qu'il lui avait envoy\u00e9e le 17 juin, au plus tard le 24 juin. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que l'EAPT \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour qu'il puisse comprendre ses restrictions et ses limites de travail et qu'elle devrait mentionner \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin que la SCP offrait des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es et des t\u00e2ches de remplacement.\n[56] \u00c0 ce moment, Mme Graham n'\u00e9tait toujours pas retourn\u00e9e au travail. M. Sylvester ne connaissait toujours pas la nature de sa maladie et ne savait pas si elle avait besoin de t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es ou de remplacement. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Graham ne communiquait avec lui que par messages laiss\u00e9s sur une bo\u00eete vocale \u00e0 des heures \u00e9tranges, comme vers 2 h ou 3 h du matin. Bien qu'il e\u00fbt inscrit dans ses lettres trois num\u00e9ros auxquels Mme Graham pouvait lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner, elle ne les a jamais utilis\u00e9s.\n(v) Communications Sylvester\/Graham - juillet 2002 [57] Mme Graham n'a pas renvoy\u00e9 l'EAPT que M. Sylvester lui avait fait parvenir le 17 juin. Il a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Graham le 3 juillet 2002. Il lui a alors demand\u00e9 que son m\u00e9decin remplisse et renvoie l'EAPT au plus tard le 5 juillet. Il lui a aussi r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle devait mentionner \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin que la SCP offrait des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es et des t\u00e2ches de remplacement. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que s'il ne recevait pas l'EAPT le 5 juillet, il n'aurait d'autre choix que de la consid\u00e9rer comme ASP.\n[58] Le 10 juillet 2002, M. Sylvester a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Graham et y a joint son \u00e9valuation de la mi-ann\u00e9e. M. Sylvester a expliqu\u00e9 qu'en temps normal, il l'aurait rencontr\u00e9 en personne pour discuter de l'\u00e9valuation, mais comme Mme Graham \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9, il ne pouvait pas le faire. Il lui a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle reviendrait au travail, il serait heureux de la rencontrer pour en discuter.\n[59] M. Sylvester a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire \u00e0 Mme Graham et, le 19 juillet 2002, il lui a \u00e9crit que la note qu'il avait re\u00e7ue de l'h\u00f4pital mentionnait qu'elle serait absente de deux \u00e0 quatre semaines. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle aurait d\u00fb se pr\u00e9senter au travail le 18 ou le 19 juillet. Comme elle ne l'avait pas fait et qu'elle n'avait pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour dire qu'elle serait absente, il allait lui attribuer le statut d'ASP et elle ne serait pas pay\u00e9e pour ces deux journ\u00e9es.\n[60] Mme Graham a r\u00e9pondu que M. Sylvester \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant de sa situation parce qu'elle avait laiss\u00e9 des messages sur sa bo\u00eete vocale. En fait, dans la lettre qu'il lui a envoy\u00e9e le 23 juillet 2002, il a reconnu que Mme Graham avait laiss\u00e9 deux messages sur sa bo\u00eete vocale, un \u00e0 23 h 46 et l'autre \u00e0 2 h 20, dans lesquels elle expliquait qu'elle avait un rendez-vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste le 25 juillet et qu'elle ferait remplir l'EAPT \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[61] Dans sa lettre, il s'est excus\u00e9 du fait que Mme Graham se sentait incommod\u00e9e et harcel\u00e9e par ses demandes de renseignements, mais il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas d'autre choix que de lui envoyer des lettres par Xpresspost. Il lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter l'EAPT au plus tard le 25 juillet. Entre temps, elle resterait ASP sans solde \u00e0 partir du 18 juillet.\n[62] En juillet 2002, dans le cadre de son traitement m\u00e9dical, Mme Graham a consult\u00e9 Shannon McGunigal, une th\u00e9rapeute et travailleuse sociale de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface, et lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer une note au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Mme McGunigal a \u00e9crit une note le 30 juillet 2002 dans laquelle elle expliquait que Mme Graham recevait des soins psychiatriques au service de consultation externe de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface et qu'elle ne pouvait pas retourner au travail pour le moment. Elle avait un rendez-vous pr\u00e9vu pour le 12 ao\u00fbt avec la Dre Calhoun et que cette derni\u00e8re enverrait \u00e0 la SCP les documents et les \u00e9valuations appropri\u00e9s par la suite.\n[63] Mme Graham \u00e9tait consciente que la SCP n'accepterait peut-\u00eatre pas cette note parce que Mme McGunigal n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00e9decin. Cependant, elle croyait qu'il \u00e9tait important qu'elle pr\u00e9sente quelque chose avant son prochain rendez-vous sinon elle perdrait son emploi. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Quilty de donner la note \u00e0 Neil Spiring, un employ\u00e9 de la SCP et le vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'Association des officiers des postes du Canada (AOPC) pour la division, qu'elle connaissait bien et en qui elle avait confiance. Mme Graham \u00e9tait soucieuse de s'assurer que tous les renseignements au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 restent confidentiels et elle s'attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Spiring t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 M. Sylvester pour l'aviser que Mme Graham avait un rendez-vous et qu'il ne devait pas la consid\u00e9rer comme ASP. M. Spiring a bien avis\u00e9 M. Sylvester et lui a aussi envoy\u00e9 la note de Mme McGunigal par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur au bureau de l'UTS le 2 ao\u00fbt. Mme Graham \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet, en particulier parce que le t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur du bureau de l'UTS est habituellement facile d'acc\u00e8s.\n[64] Mme Quilty a aussi parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sylvester et lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait une bonne amie de Mme Graham et qu'elle s'occupait d'elle. Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sylvester de ne plus envoyer de lettres parce qu'elles avaient un effet n\u00e9gatif. Elle a dit \u00e0 M. Sylvester que Mme Graham avait besoin de temps pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et qu'elle avait besoin d'un cong\u00e9. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Sylvester a r\u00e9pondu que cela n'avait rien \u00e0 voir avec elle. Il voulait parler \u00e0 Mme Graham.\n[65] M. Sylvester a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait discut\u00e9 avec Dave Smook, le pr\u00e9sident de l'AOPC, et avec Neil Spiring quant aux d\u00e9marches qu'il prenait au sujet de Mme Graham. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 leur avis, il n'y avait rien d'autre qu'il puisse faire.\n(vi) Communications Sylvester\/Graham - ao\u00fbt 2002 [66] Le 1er ao\u00fbt, M. Sylvester a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Graham pour lui dire qu'il n'avait pas re\u00e7u d'autres renseignements m\u00e9dicaux par \u00e9crit et qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours ASP sans solde. Il lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux au plus tard le 2 ao\u00fbt et lui a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente au travail la m\u00eame date. Si elle ne le faisait pas, il n'aurait d'autre choix que de continuer \u00e0 prendre les mesures disciplinaires n\u00e9cessaires, qui pouvaient aller jusqu'au renvoi de la SCP.\n[67] Le 2 ao\u00fbt, lorsque M. Sylvester a re\u00e7u la note de Mme McGunigal, il a demand\u00e9 aux SST de confirmer s'il s'agissait de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suffisants. Les SST ont r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas puisque la note ne venait pas d'un m\u00e9decin. Les SST ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Sylvester devait \u00e9crire \u00e0 Mme Graham et lui demander de faire remplir une Saisie de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux (SRM) par son m\u00e9decin. Il lui a \u00e9crit cette lettre le 8 ao\u00fbt 2002 et il a demand\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin retourne la SRM au plus tard le 26 ao\u00fbt.\n[68] Les SST ont aussi \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Dre Laura Calhoun le 8 ao\u00fbt pour lui demander de remplir la SRM pour Mme Graham afin qu'ils puissent examiner ses capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles. La Dre Calhoun \u00e9tait la sp\u00e9cialiste de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface avec qui Mme Graham avait un rendez-vous le 12 ao\u00fbt. Dans leur lettre, les SST ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible d'offrir \u00e0 Mme Graham des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es si elle avait besoin d'un tel accommodement.\n[69] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2002, la Dre Calhoun a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Sylvester que Mme Graham avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 partir du 18 juin pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et elle lui a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'un rapport m\u00e9dical d\u00e9taill\u00e9 lui serait envoy\u00e9. La Dre Calhoun a rempli la SRM et a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport m\u00e9dical d\u00e9taill\u00e9 le 12 ao\u00fbt et les SST ont re\u00e7u ces documents le 15 ao\u00fbt.\n[70] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2002, la Dre Lori Koz des SST a envoy\u00e9 un rapport local \u00e0 M. Sylvester au sujet de Mme Graham. Le rapport indiquait l'aptitude de Mme Graham \u00e0 travailler, mais ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lait pas son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 la pratique habituelle des SST. Le rapport \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de la Dre Calhoun et pr\u00e9cisait que Mme Graham \u00e9tait temporairement inapte au travail et que son retour possible au travail se ferait dans environ six mois.\n[71] Lorsqu'il a re\u00e7u le rapport, M. Sylvester a cess\u00e9 de communiquer avec Mme Graham, en raison du rapport des SST. Le statut ASP sans solde de Mme Graham a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation que la Dre Calhoun avait faite dans sa lettre du 12 ao\u00fbt 2002, selon laquelle Mme Graham \u00e9tait absente du travail depuis le 18 juin pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales.\n(vii) Tentatives de Mme Graham de r\u00e9soudre sa situation d'emploi - octobre 2002 \u00e0 janvier 2003 [72] Le 31 octobre 2002, Mme Graham a \u00e9crit une lettre [traduction] \u00e0 qui de droit dans laquelle elle expliquait que Ron Kohut, une de ses sources de soutien et un bon ami avec qui elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la SCP, avait offert d'agir \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant pour elle. M. Kohut \u00e9tait superviseur au D\u00e9p\u00f4t B, poste de facteurs.\n[73] Le 22 octobre 2002, il a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mary Traversy, vice-pr\u00e9sidente des ressources humaines \u00e0 la SCP. Il y d\u00e9crivait les d\u00e9tails des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail de Mme Graham \u00e0 la SCP, ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux et ses sentiments au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Sylvester la traitait dans ses tentatives de communication avec elle, qui \u00e0 son avis lui causait plus de d\u00e9tresse. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Traversy d'intervenir afin qu'elle aide \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la situation et que Mme Graham re\u00e7oive la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 laquelle elle avait droit.\n[74] Mme Traversy a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Graham le 28 novembre 2002 et lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Roy Nias, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des op\u00e9rations postales dans la r\u00e9gion des Prairies, d'examiner la question. Mme Traversy a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Graham le 21 janvier 2003. Dans sa lettre, elle mentionnait le Programme de gestion des pr\u00e9sences et pr\u00e9cisait les inqui\u00e9tudes de Mme Graham au sujet du nombre de lettres que M. Sylvester lui avait envoy\u00e9es et dans lesquelles il lui demandait des renseignements au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Elle a aussi indiqu\u00e9 que bien que M. Sylvester ait envoy\u00e9 un nombre plut\u00f4t excessif de lettres, son absence avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9r\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux lignes directrices de ce programme.\n[75] Quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de M. Sylvester de retourner Mme Graham \u00e0 son poste d'attache et de lui retirer le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim, Mme Traversy a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique actuelle de la SCP et qu'elle visait \u00e0 garantir la continuit\u00e9 de l'exploitation de la SCP.\nV. MOTIFS DE LA D\u00c9CISION (i) Mme Graham a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [76] Dans une affaire portant sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204; Dhanjal c. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6).\n[77] Comme je l'ai not\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les all\u00e9gations de discrimination que Mme Graham a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es contre la SCP sont les suivantes :\nla SCP n'a pas pris de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience temporaire; la SCP l'a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience; la SCP a caus\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler parce qu'elle ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 une \u00e9quipe suffisante et n'a pas fait preuve d'un soutien ad\u00e9quat envers elle afin qu'elle puisse effectuer ses t\u00e2ches; la SCP lui a retir\u00e9 le poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) Mme Graham avait-elle une d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque en question? [78] Une all\u00e9gation de discrimination au sens de la LCDP doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut d\u00e9terminer s'il existait une preuve prima facie que Mme Graham souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience pendant son absence du travail, absence qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 21 mai 2002.\n[79] La preuve pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce comprend les faits suivants :\nMme Quilty a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 21 mai 2002, Mme Graham lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et lui a demand\u00e9 de se rendre chez elle parce qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade et avait besoin d'aide.\nM. Sylvester a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait inhabituel pour Mme Graham de ne pas communiquer avec quelqu'un \u00e0 l'UTS pour mentionner qu'elle s'absenterait du travail.\nMme Graham a laiss\u00e9 un message sur la bo\u00eete vocale de M. Sylvester pour lui expliquer qu'elle \u00e9tait malade et qu'elle s'absenterait du travail pendant une ou deux semaines.\nLe Dr Ibbitt a inscrit sur l'EAPT du 30 mai 2002 que Mme Graham \u00e9tait malade depuis le 21 mai et qu'elle ne pourrait retourner travailler que le 6 juin.\nLe 6 juin 2002, le Dr Ibbitt a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un certificat d'absence m\u00e9dicale dans lequel il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, [traduction] pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, Mme Graham ne pouvait retourner au travail que le 10 juin.\nUne employ\u00e9e de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface a \u00e9crit une note le 19 juin 2002 dans laquelle elle mentionnait que Mme Graham avait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e et trait\u00e9e au service des urgences de l'h\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral St-Boniface et qu'elle serait absente du travail de deux \u00e0 quatre semaines parce qu'elle \u00e9tait malade.\nLe 30 juillet 2002, Mme McGunigal a \u00e9crit une note dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9cisait que Mme Graham avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la clinique externe de l'h\u00f4pital St-Boniface pour qu'elle y re\u00e7oive des soins psychiatriques et qu'elle ne pourrait pas retourner au travail pour le moment.\nLa Dre Calhoun a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 M. Sylvester le 12 ao\u00fbt 2002 dans laquelle elle l'avisait que Mme Graham \u00e9tait absente du travail depuis le 18 juin pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales.\nLe rapport d'enqu\u00eate des SST du 22 ao\u00fbt 2002 expliquait que Mme Graham \u00e9tait temporairement inapte au travail et qu'elle ne reprendrait pas le travail pendant environ six mois.\n[80] D\u00e9ficience, au sens juridique, consiste en un handicap physique ou mental, qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d'un handicap. Une maladie chronique ou d\u00e9bilitante qui rend p\u00e9riodiquement une personne invalide de fa\u00e7on significative et qui interf\u00e8re avec la capacit\u00e9 de cette personne \u00e0 faire son travail est une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la LCDP (voir Desormeaux c. Ottawa, 2005 CAF 111, aux paragraphes 13 et 15).\n[81] Cette preuve \u00e9taye solidement la conclusion selon laquelle Mme Graham \u00e9tait atteinte d'une incapacit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale qui l'emp\u00eachait de travailler. Je conclus de prime abord qu'elle souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience pendant son absence qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en mai 2002.\n(iii) Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de Mme Graham a) D\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience [82] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Graham selon laquelle la SCP a fait preuve de discrimination envers elle en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience, je ne saurais trop insister sur le fait que le d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement n'est ni un motif de distinction illicite, ni une pratique discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. La LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit aucun droit distinct \u00e0 l'accommodement.\n[83] L'obligation d'accommodement n'existe que dans le contexte du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP et seulement lorsque l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente une justification de bonne foi \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de discrimination. Pour que Mme Graham \u00e9tablisse une preuve prima facie, elle doit se fonder sur autre chose que le d\u00e9faut de la SCP de prendre des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 son sujet.\nb) Traitement d\u00e9favorable [84] En ce qui \u00e0 trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de Mme Graham selon laquelle la SCP l'a trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, elle n'a mis en \u00e9vidence aucune preuve qui d\u00e9montrait qu'il y avait eu un traitement d\u00e9favorable envers elle. Le Tribunal n'a pas le devoir d'\u00e9plucher la preuve pour d\u00e9montrer le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'all\u00e9gation \u00e0 la place de Mme Graham.\n[85] Pour ces deux all\u00e9gations, Mme Graham n'a pas \u00e9tabli de preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nc) Cause de la d\u00e9ficience temporaire [86] Mme Graham a soutenu qu'alors qu'elle occupait toujours le poste int\u00e9rimaire, la SCP ne lui a pas fourni suffisamment de ressources humaines pour lui permettre de mettre en oeuvre le projet Annexe AA. Le stress cons\u00e9cutif \u00e0 la gestion d'un projet sans le personnel n\u00e9cessaire a caus\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience temporaire.\n[87] Il n'est pas clair si la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu'il est discriminatoire de la part d'un employeur d'\u00eatre la cause d'une d\u00e9ficience chez un employ\u00e9. Si l'on \u00e9carte cette question, cependant, l'all\u00e9gation de Mme Graham suppose qu'elle avait une d\u00e9ficience avant de s'absenter du travail. Malheureusement, elle n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve donnant \u00e0 penser qu'avant de prendre son cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle avait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la LCDP ou, si elle en avait bien une, que le d\u00e9faut de la SCP de donner suite \u00e0 sa demande avait caus\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience temporaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la SCP \u00e9tait la cause de sa d\u00e9ficience doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nd) Fin de son affectation au poste de surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim [88] Finalement, il faut examiner si le fait que la SCP ait mis fin \u00e0 l'affectation int\u00e9rimaire de Mme Graham au poste par int\u00e9rim contrevient \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, c'est \u00e0 dire si cette d\u00e9cision constituait un refus de continuer \u00e0 l'employer. Bien que la fin de son affectation int\u00e9rimaire au poste ne rompait pas les liens d'emploi, il s'agissait tout de m\u00eame d'une perte d'un poste temporaire et d'un renvoi \u00e0 son poste pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui lui \u00e9tait moins avantageux.\n[89] La perte de son poste par int\u00e9rim \u00e9tait li\u00e9e directement ou indirectement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. La d\u00e9cision de la SCP de mettre fin \u00e0 son affectation int\u00e9rimaire au poste \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son absent\u00e9isme, qui \u00e9tait caus\u00e9 par sa d\u00e9ficience. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[90] La SCP a donc l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour Mme Graham jusqu'\u00e0 la contrainte excessive. Dans une analyse des mesures d'accommodement, le plaignant a aussi une obligation. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, aux pages 16 et 17, que la recherche de mesures d'accommodement fait intervenir plusieurs parties. Le plaignant doit aider l'employeur \u00e0 trouver une mesure d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e. C'est-\u00e0-dire que, pour faciliter la recherche d'une mesure d'accommodement, le plaignant doit aussi faire sa part. Il faut aussi tenir compte du comportement du plaignant lors de l'examen visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l'obligation d'accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e.\n[91] En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Sylvester, dans ses lettres \u00e0 Mme Graham, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises si elle avait des limites ou des restrictions de travail et il lui a mentionn\u00e9 que la SCP pouvait offrir des t\u00e2ches de remplacement ou des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient incapables d'exercer leurs t\u00e2ches habituelles. Il lui a aussi demand\u00e9 d'aviser son m\u00e9decin, lorsqu'il remplirait l'EAPT, de l'existence de la politique en mati\u00e8re de mesures d'accommodement de la SCP.\n[92] Mme Graham n'a pas coop\u00e9r\u00e9. Bien qu'elle ait laiss\u00e9 de temps en temps des messages sur la bo\u00eete vocale au sujet de son \u00e9tat et qu'elle ait bien fourni des \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales, ni elle ni son m\u00e9decin n'ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande de renseignements de M. Sylvester quant \u00e0 ses limites ou \u00e0 ses restrictions de travail. Ce n'est que le 15 ao\u00fbt 2002, lorsque les SST ont re\u00e7u la SRM de la Dre Calhoun, que la SCP a appris que Mme Graham \u00e9tait temporairement incapable de travailler et qu'elle ne pourrait retourner au travail qu'environ six mois plus tard.\n[93] Compte tenu des circonstances et du manque de renseignements, il \u00e9tait impossible pour la SCP de mettre en place des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es pour Mme Graham. De plus, le poste de Mme Graham \u00e0 titre de surveillante g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim \u00e9tait essentiel \u00e0 la bonne mise en oeuvre du projet Annexe AA. Il \u00e9tait impossible d'attendre son retour au travail \u00e0 une date ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. La SCP n'avait d'autre choix que de trouver un autre surveillant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim.\nVI. CONCLUSION [94] Je conclus que la plainte de discrimination de Mme Graham contre la SCP n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nJ.

La plaignante s'objecte \u00e0 ce que le Dr. Dufour soit ainsi qualifi\u00e9e au motif qu'elle n'a pas les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre reconnue comme expert en psychologie et sexologie. En ce qui concerne la Commission, celle-ci s'objecte \u00e9galement \u00e0 la qualification du Dr. Dufour comme expert et soutient qu'elle devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e uniquement comme un t\u00e9moin de fait en rapport avec son implication dans l'\u00e9valuation de la plaignante en mai 2006.\n[2] Le Tribunal a entendu le Dr. Dufour en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa qualification \u00e0 titre d'expert. Il ressort du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Dufour que celle-ci poss\u00e8de un doctorat en psychologie, obtenu en 2002 de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et qu'elle est membre de l'Ordre des psychologues du Qu\u00e9bec. Le Dr. Dufour ne poss\u00e8de aucune formation postdoctorale, si ce n'est la pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 quelques activit\u00e9s scientifiques - un congr\u00e8s et un cours de perfectionnement. Elle ne poss\u00e8de aucune publication scientifique \u00e0 son actif en mati\u00e8re de psychologie ou de sexologie, non plus que de pr\u00e9sentations scientifiques dans ces domaines dans le cadre de congr\u00e8s scientifiques. Elle ne poss\u00e8de aucune affiliation professionnelle autre que son inscription \u00e0 l'Ordre des psychologues du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[3] Par ailleurs, le Dr. Dufour est psychologue clinicienne en pratique priv\u00e9e. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, lors de la proc\u00e9dure de qualification, qu'elle a re\u00e7u en consultation, depuis 1998, d'abord en tant que psychoth\u00e9rapeute sexologue, puis en tant que psychologue sexologue, plusieurs personnes pr\u00e9sentant des troubles de dysphorie du genre. Elle a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle travaille depuis plus de 10 ans, \u00e0 titre b\u00e9n\u00e9vole \u00e0 raison d'une demi-journ\u00e9e par semaine, \u00e0 la Clinique de sexualit\u00e9 humaine de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, dirig\u00e9e par le Dr. Pierre Assalian.\n[4] Selon le Dr. Dufour, ces consultations repr\u00e9sentent environ 60% de sa pratique professionnelle. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Dr. Dufour affirme qu'elle re\u00e7oit en th\u00e9rapie de groupe \u00e0 toutes les deux semaines entre 30 et 40 personnes souffrant de dysphorie du genre. Ces personnes proviennent du programme mis sur pied par la Clinique de sexualite humaine de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, dirig\u00e9e par le Dr. Pierre Assalian. En outre, elle dit recevoir \u00e0 toutes les semaines en th\u00e9rapie individuelle de 10 \u00e0 15 personnes souffrant de troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle. Dans le cours de sa pratique, le Dr. Dufour aurait ainsi re\u00e7u en consultation entre 400 et 500 personnes pr\u00e9sentant des troubles de l'identit\u00e9 du genre.\n[5] Pour \u00eatre reconnu expert, une personne doit d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a une expertise particuli\u00e8re dans un champ donn\u00e9 d'activit\u00e9s. Cette expertise doit s'appuyer sur non seulement une solide pratique professionnelle mais \u00e9galement sur un savoir scientifique qui d\u00e9montre que le professionnel est en mesure d'avoir une pens\u00e9e critique et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie par rapport aux diff\u00e9rents points de vue qui peuvent pr\u00e9valoir dans un champ donn\u00e9 d'activit\u00e9s.\n[6] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas que le Dr. Dufour a le cursus acad\u00e9mique et le profil professionnel pour \u00eatre reconnu comme expert dans le domaine de la sexualit\u00e9 humaine ou de la sexologie, disciplines qui, du reste, ne font l'objet d'aucun encadrement professionnel pr\u00e9cis, aucun organisme n'\u00e9tant appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9gir ce champ d'activit\u00e9 professionnelle. Toutefois, le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que le Dr. Dufour a une vaste exp\u00e9rience en ce qui a trait au traitement des personnes qui souffrent de dysphorie du genre ou pr\u00e9sentent des troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal reconna\u00eet au Dr. Dufour une connaissance particuli\u00e8re de la client\u00e8le qui la consulte par rapport \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes.\n[7] Le Tribunal est d'opinion que le Dr. Dufour a les qualit\u00e9s requises pour t\u00e9moigner non seulement en rapport avec l'\u00e9valuation qu'elle a faite de la plaignante en mai 2006 mais \u00e9galement pour faire part au Tribunal de son exp\u00e9rience clinique en mati\u00e8re de dysphorie du genre ou de troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle et pour commenter son \u00e9valuation de la plaignante \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette exp\u00e9rience. Le Dr. Dufour n'est toutefois pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9mettre des opinions sur le sujet ou de commenter la litt\u00e9rature sur la dysphorie du genre, le transsexualisme, le transgend\u00e9risme, le travestisme et autres troubles reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle d'une personne.\n[8] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet donc le Dr. Dufour comme une psychologue - sexologue ayant une connaissance particuli\u00e8re de par sa pratique des personnes souffrant de dysphorie du genre ou pr\u00e9sentant des troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle, tels que les transsexuels et les travestis, et lui permet de faire \u00e9tat dans son t\u00e9moignage non seulement de son implication dans le dossier de la plaignante mais \u00e9galement de son exp\u00e9rience dans le traitement des personnes qui se pr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 elle en consultation pour des probl\u00e8mes d'identit\u00e9 sexuelle ou de dysphorie du genre. Elle ne pourra pas, toutefois, n'\u00e9tant pas reconnue comme experte par le Tribunal, \u00e9mettre d'opinions en rapport avec la litt\u00e9rature scientifique et les hypoth\u00e8ses de nature scientifique reli\u00e9es \u00e0 la dysphorie du genre ou aux troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nQU\u00c9BEC (Qu\u00e9bec)\nLe 16 octobre 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nMicheline Montreuil c.

Hadjis\n[1] La partie intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 28 juin 2007 dans lequel elle demande une ordonnance rejetant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant, Sheldon W. Johnston, pour d\u00e9faut de poursuivre. La partie intim\u00e9e soutient que, depuis que la plainte du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, le plaignant a fait preuve d'un [traduction] m\u00e9pris flagrant envers les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances du Tribunal alors que, parall\u00e8lement, la partie intim\u00e9e et le Tribunal ont fait [traduction] tous les efforts raisonnables pour faire avancer l'instruction de la plainte. La requ\u00eate est appuy\u00e9e par un affidavit sign\u00e9 par Cindy Komodowski, une adjointe juridique du minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la Justice travaillant au bureau de Saskatoon.\n[2] La partie intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal un affidavit de signification \u00e0 une personne, sign\u00e9 par un huissier d'Alberta, dans lequel il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'avis de requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 en personne au plaignant le 9 juillet 2007, \u00e0 son adresse \u00e0 Taber, en Alberta. Le 16 juillet 2007, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au plaignant l'informant qu'il avait jusqu'au 1er ao\u00fbt 2007 pour d\u00e9poser des observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la porte d'entr\u00e9e principale de l'adresse du plaignant par un huissier le 26 juillet 2007. Le plaignant n'a toujours pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d'observations en r\u00e9ponse et n'a communiqu\u00e9 en aucune mani\u00e8re avec le Tribunal.\n[3] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, j'accueille la requ\u00eate de la partie intim\u00e9e et je rejette la plainte.\nI. LES FAITS [4] Les faits expos\u00e9s ci-dessous sont tir\u00e9s du dossier du Tribunal reli\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce et de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'affidavit de Mme Komodowski, lequel n'est pas contest\u00e9 puisque le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[5] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 25 janvier 2002. Il pr\u00e9tendait que, \u00e0 partir de juin 1999, l'intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire contre lui, en violation de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en refusant de l'employer en tant qu'aum\u00f4nier militaire et officier du Programme d'int\u00e9gration \u00e0 la R\u00e9serve en raison de sa religion. Il pr\u00e9tendait \u00e9galement que la partie intim\u00e9e appliquait des lignes de conduite discriminatoire \u00e0 son endroit et \u00e0 l'endroit d'autres personnes comme lui sur la base de sa religion (Alliance chr\u00e9tienne et missionnaire\/\u00c9glise de Dieu au Canada), en violation de l'article 10 de la Loi.\n[6] Le 11 juin 2003, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal qu'elle ne renvoyait que la partie de la plainte portant sur l'article 10 devant Tribunal, car elle avait jug\u00e9 que la partie portant sur l'article 7 devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Le 27 juin 2003, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audience sur le fond de la plainte.\n[7] Le 7 juillet 2003, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision prise par la Commission de rejeter la partie de la plainte portant sur l'article 7. \u00c0 la demande du plaignant et de la partie intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que l'audience sur la partie renvoy\u00e9e de la plainte soit report\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e cette demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[8] Les documents qui accompagnaient la plainte quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal montraient que l'adresse postale du plaignant se situait \u00e0 Castlegar, en Colombie-Britannique. Cependant, \u00e0 un certain moment par la suite, le plaignant a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Swift Current, en Saskatchewan. Il n'a pas inform\u00e9 le greffe du Tribunal de ce d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Au contraire, le Tribunal n'a appris le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement qu'en constatant qu'une nouvelle adresse figurait \u00e0 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du plaignant, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise au Tribunal par la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[9] Le plaignant semble avoir abandonn\u00e9 sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire en f\u00e9vrier 2004. Le 6 mai 2004, il a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de ce d\u00e9sistement, en ajoutant qu'il [traduction] attendait une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la [traduction] conclusion de sa plainte contre la partie intim\u00e9e. Comme le fait le Tribunal pour toutes les plaintes, il a offert aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter volontairement \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation organis\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Il a envoy\u00e9 un questionnaire de m\u00e9diation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aux parties le 28 mai 2004. Les parties devaient y r\u00e9pondre au plus tard le 18 juin 2004. \u00c0 la demande de la partie intim\u00e9e, le d\u00e9lai a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9 au 26 juillet 2004. La partie intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle voulait participer \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation et a fait conna\u00eetre ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9.\n[10] Malheureusement, le plaignant n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal, pas m\u00eame avant le d\u00e9lai prorog\u00e9 du 26 juillet. Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2004, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 au plaignant un message par courrier \u00e9lectronique pour lui rappeler la proc\u00e9dure et lui expliquer qu'il pouvait r\u00e9pondre soit par \u00e9crit, soit par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il a r\u00e9pondu par courrier \u00e9lectronique le 10 ao\u00fbt 2004 et il a fait savoir qu'il voulait assister \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. Il a pr\u00e9tendu avoir r\u00e9pondu plus t\u00f4t, mais que son courrier \u00e9lectronique [traduction] n'a pas d\u00fb se rendre.\n[11] Le 30 novembre 2004, le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d'instance entre les parties lors de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de d\u00e9poser un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9crit des questions en litige et des redressements demand\u00e9s. L'avocat de la partie intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal, par une lettre de suivi dat\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 2004, qu'il tentait de communiquer avec le plaignant afin de tenter de r\u00e9soudre l'affaire avant la m\u00e9diation, mais que le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du plaignant n'\u00e9tait plus en service. Ni la partie intim\u00e9e ni le Tribunal n'avaient re\u00e7u de nouvelles coordonn\u00e9es de la part du plaignant.\n[12] Le 17 janvier 2005, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9crit aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal. Il a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 que sa nouvelle adresse se trouvait maintenant \u00e0 Surrey, en Colombie-Britannique. Le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2005, la partie intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse.\n[13] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour faire savoir qu'il habitait maintenant \u00e0 une nouvelle adresse \u00e0 Swift Current, en Saskatchewan. Il a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'un avocat de Vancouver, David Mossop, allait dor\u00e9navant le repr\u00e9senter dans le cadre de la plainte. \u00c0 la demande de M. Mossop, le Tribunal lui a donn\u00e9 jusqu'au 21 avril 2005 pour apprendre \u00e0 conna\u00eetre le dossier et pour apporter des pr\u00e9cisions au r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du plaignant s'il le jugeait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[14] Le 4 mai 2005, le Tribunal a tenu une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas au cours de laquelle les parties se sont engag\u00e9es \u00e0 discuter et \u00e0 informer le Tribunal si elles d\u00e9siraient toujours poursuivre le processus de m\u00e9diation. Un calendrier pour la divulgation de la preuve a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Le plaignant devait d\u00e9poser son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et terminer la divulgation de sa preuve documentaire au plus tard le 29 juillet 2005 et la partie intim\u00e9e, le 26 ao\u00fbt 2005. En date du 13 mai 2005, les deux parties avaient inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elles souhaitaient participer \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation organis\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[15] Cependant, le 17 mai 2005, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au Tribunal pour faire savoir que son avocat [traduction] s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9sist\u00e9 du dossier. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la plainte par m\u00e9diation. Le Tribunal a donc interrog\u00e9 les parties pour fixer une date et un lieu pour la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. Les parties se sont entendues pour que la s\u00e9ance ait lieu \u00e0 Vancouver (puisque le plaignant avait semble-t-il red\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 en Colombie-Britannique) le 22 juillet 2005. Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 le plaignant de la date, de l'heure et de l'endroit o\u00f9 devait se tenir la s\u00e9ance, par lettre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par service de messagerie ainsi que par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'adresse de courrier \u00e9lectronique du plaignant.\n[16] Le vendredi 22 juillet 2005, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, qui devait pr\u00e9sider la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation, ainsi que l'avocat de la partie intim\u00e9e et quatre de ses repr\u00e9sentants se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au lieu et \u00e0 l'heure pr\u00e9vus pour la s\u00e9ance. Le plaignant n'a pas comparu. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par les personnes pr\u00e9sentes de mettre fin \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation. Selon l'affidavit de Mme Komodowski, le plaignant a communiqu\u00e9 avec l'avocat de la partie intim\u00e9e plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0 et a fait savoir qu'il \u00e9tait maintenant disponible pour assister \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. Toutefois, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal ainsi qu'un certain nombre des repr\u00e9sentants de la partie intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en route vers l'a\u00e9roport, pour rentrer chez eux. L'avocat de la partie intim\u00e9e et certains de ses repr\u00e9sentants, qui n'\u00e9taient pas encore \u00e0 bord de leur avion, ont accept\u00e9 de modifier leur programme de voyage et de rester jusqu'au lendemain pour rencontrer le plaignant, [traduction] dans le but de faire avancer cette affaire. Les parties se sont bel et bien rencontr\u00e9es le samedi 23 juillet 2005, mais elles n'ont pu en venir \u00e0 une entente.\n[17] Parce que l'affaire n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 le plaignant le 26 juillet 2005 que l'audition de la plainte commencerait le 24 octobre 2005. En outre, une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour le 1er septembre 2005. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par courrier \u00e9lectronique et a demand\u00e9 que la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique soit devanc\u00e9e, pour qu'elle ait lieu entre le 1er et le 5 ao\u00fbt 2005, entre 8 h et 12 h, [traduction] heure d'Ottawa. Il a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il ne serait pas disponible en octobre pour l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a organis\u00e9 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 4 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 11 h, heure de l'Est. Cependant, \u00e0 l'heure donn\u00e9e, le plaignant n'a pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour participer \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence, bien que le Tribunal lui e\u00fbt fourni des instructions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es peu avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[18] Le 10 ao\u00fbt 2005, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au plaignant pour l'informer que son d\u00e9lai pour soumettre son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et divulguer sa preuve documentaire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9 au 16 septembre 2005. En raison de la non-disponibilit\u00e9 du plaignant en octobre, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de fournir ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9 au plus tard le 26 ao\u00fbt 2005.\n[19] Le 1er septembre 2005, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au Tribunal dans lequel il affirmait qu'il [traduction] voudrait savoir o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait rendue la proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 l'audience. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quel lieu lui conviendrait pour l'audience. Par contre, il n'a mentionn\u00e9 aucune date de disponibilit\u00e9.\n[20] En outre, en date du 16 septembre 2005, le plaignant n'avait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni aucun autre document, comme le Tribunal le lui avait demand\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 10 ao\u00fbt 2005.\n[21] En fait, apr\u00e8s le courrier \u00e9lectronique du 1er septembre 2005, le Tribunal n'a pas re\u00e7u de nouvelles du plaignant avant le 16 octobre 2006, soit 14 mois plus tard, lorsqu'il a envoy\u00e9 un court message par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 l'agent du greffe du Tribunal assign\u00e9 \u00e0 son dossier. Il d\u00e9clarait dans ce courrier qu'il n'y avait [traduction] jamais eu de suivi \u00e0 sa derni\u00e8re communication avec le Tribunal. Il n'a fait aucune mention de son omission de fournir, depuis plus d'un an, son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les documents qu'il devait divulguer ou ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9.\n[22] En r\u00e9ponse au courrier \u00e9lectronique du plaignant, le Tribunal a pris contact avec toutes les parties pour organiser une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Le 2 novembre 2006, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit un courrier \u00e9lectronique au plaignant pour lui demander de choisir une date parmi celles propos\u00e9es sur une liste pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par courrier \u00e9lectronique le 13 novembre 2006. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 une date \u00e0 laquelle il serait disponible et il a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son nouveau num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et de sa nouvelle adresse \u00e0 Taber, en Alberta. Le Tribunal lui a r\u00e9pondu par courrier \u00e9lectronique le jour m\u00eame pour l'informer que la partie intim\u00e9e ne serait pas disponible \u00e0 la date qu'il avait choisie. Une nouvelle liste de dates lui a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 au plaignant de confirmer sa disponibilit\u00e9 au plus tard le 14 novembre 2006.\n[23] Le plaignant n'avait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette date. Le 19 novembre 2006, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au plaignant pour lui souligner qu'il n'avait toujours pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse. Il n'y a pas r\u00e9pondu. Le 21 novembre, le gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations du greffe du Tribunal a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au dernier num\u00e9ro fourni par le plaignant. Personne n'a r\u00e9pondu. Le Tribunal a appel\u00e9 de nouveau le 22 novembre. Une femme a r\u00e9pondu et expliqu\u00e9 que le plaignant rappellerait plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0. Le plaignant n'a jamais rappel\u00e9.\n[24] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2006, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au plaignant pour lui rappeler qu'il n'avait toujours pas fait part de ses disponibilit\u00e9s pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Il lui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 de communiquer avec le Tribunal par courrier \u00e9lectronique ou par appel \u00e0 frais vir\u00e9s, afin de confirmer sa disponibilit\u00e9. Encore une fois, personne n'a r\u00e9pondu.\n[25] Le 9 janvier 2007, l'agent du greffe du Tribunal a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone du plaignant et son \u00e9pouse a r\u00e9pondu. Le plaignant n'\u00e9tait pas disponible, alors l'agent a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9pouse du plaignant de dire \u00e0 ce dernier qu'il devait r\u00e9pondre au courrier \u00e9lectronique du Tribunal dat\u00e9 du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Le plaignant n'a jamais r\u00e9pondu. L'agent du greffe a donc t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au plaignant encore une fois le 4 avril 2007. L'\u00e9pouse de ce dernier a r\u00e9pondu. Elle a dit qu'elle avait transmis le message pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent au plaignant. Le Tribunal lui a demand\u00e9 de transmettre le message une fois de plus au plaignant. Il n'a toujours pas r\u00e9pondu.\n[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 15 mai 2007, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au plaignant, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e par huissier \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence et signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse le 19 mai 2007. La lettre relevait les tentatives faites par le Tribunal pour entrer en contact avec le plaignant, communications auxquelles il n'avait pas r\u00e9pondu. Il lui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9 de confirmer au plus tard le 31 mai 2007 les dates auxquelles il serait disponible pour une audience d'une semaine au cours des mois de septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2007. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que, en l'absence de confirmation de sa part quant \u00e0 sa disponibilit\u00e9, le Tribunal d\u00e9ciderait des dates de l'audience, qui se tiendrait \u00e0 l'automne 2007 \u00e0 Lethbridge, en Alberta.\n[27] Le plaignant n'a toujours pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal.\n[28] Le 28 juin 2007, la partie intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate dans laquelle elle demande le rejet de la plainte. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e au plaignant le 16 juillet 2007 et il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enjoint de d\u00e9poser ses observations au plus tard le 1er ao\u00fbt 2007. Le Tribunal n'a toujours pas re\u00e7u d'observations ou d'autres documents du plaignant \u00e0 ce jour et ce dernier n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 d'une autre fa\u00e7on avec le Tribunal.\nA. ANALYSE [29] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Seitz c. Canada, 2002 CFPI 456, au paragraphe 10, il existe deux approches en ce qui concerne le rejet pour cause de retard ou, ainsi qu'on l'appelle \u00e9galement, le rejet pour d\u00e9faut de poursuivre. La premi\u00e8re approche, parfois appel\u00e9e le crit\u00e8re classique, est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Nichols c. Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 567 (C.F. 1re inst.)(Q.L.). Il s'agit d'un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets : d'abord, \u00e9tablir s'il y a retard excessif; ensuite, d\u00e9terminer si le retard \u00e9tait inexcusable; finalement, \u00e9tablir si le d\u00e9fendeur est susceptible de subir un grave pr\u00e9judice en raison de ce retard.\n[30] La seconde approche est expos\u00e9e aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18 de la d\u00e9cision Seitz. Il est dit de cette approche qu'elle est applicable dans les cas o\u00f9 une partie ne tient absolument aucun compte des d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus dans les R\u00e8gles de la Cour, ce qui correspond, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le plaignant s'est comport\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il est soulign\u00e9 dans Seitz que ce d\u00e9faut doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9 non seulement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie, mais aussi du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la justice. Lorsqu'une action est laiss\u00e9e trop longtemps dormante, cela constitue un abus de la justice, ce qui est distinct du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par un retard excessif et inexcusable, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration dans le cadre du crit\u00e8re classique. Il est not\u00e9 dans Seitz que ce d\u00e9faut donne lieu \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure et constitue un motif de rejeter la demande. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale adopte dans la d\u00e9cision Seitz les conclusions tir\u00e9es par la Chambre des lords dans l'affaire Grovit and Others c. Doctor and Others, [1997]1 W.L.R. 640, o\u00f9 il est statu\u00e9 que :\n[traduction]\nLes tribunaux ont notamment pour r\u00f4le de permettre aux parties de faire r\u00e9soudre leurs diff\u00e9rends. Introduire et poursuivre une instance que l'on n'a pas l'intention de mener \u00e0 terme peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure. En pareil cas, la partie contre qui l'instance est introduite a le droit de demander la radiation de l'action et, si la justice le commande (ce qui est fr\u00e9quemment le cas), le tribunal rejette l'action.\nLes principes \u00e9tablis dans Grovit ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis dans la d\u00e9cision Trusthouse Forte California Inc. c. Gateway Soap and Chemical Co., 1998 CanLII 8897, au paragraphe 9 (C.F.).\n[31] Au m\u00eame titre que les tribunaux judiciaires, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a le droit d'emp\u00eacher un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 15, conf. par Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363, qu'il appara\u00eet \u00e9vident que l'on ne peut affirmer que le Tribunal [canadien des droits de la personne] est ma\u00eetre chez lui s'il ne peut pr\u00e9munir sa propre proc\u00e9dure contre les abus.\n[32] En de nombreuses occasions, le plaignant a omis de se conformer aux \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et aux dates fix\u00e9es par le Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce, m\u00eame quand le Tribunal avait prorog\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais. Je note au passage que le paragraphe 1(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que tous les d\u00e9lais et toutes les dates fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal sont imp\u00e9ratifs, sauf sur ordonnance contraire du Tribunal. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant ne s'est pas conform\u00e9 dans les cas suivants :\nIl a r\u00e9pondu en retard \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re offre de m\u00e9diation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Tribunal, lequel a re\u00e7u sa r\u00e9ponse le 5 ao\u00fbt 2004, soit une semaine apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du d\u00e9lai prorog\u00e9 pour sa r\u00e9ponse; Il n'a pas comparu \u00e0 la date et \u00e0 l'heure fix\u00e9es pour la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation en Colombie-Britannique; Il n'a pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour se joindre \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e au 4 ao\u00fbt 2005 \u00e0 sa demande; Sans fournir de raison, il n'a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni ses documents pour divulgation, ce qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait depuis le 16 septembre 2005, soit il y a plus de deux ans; Il n'a pas inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9 pour l'audience, ce qu'il devait faire au plus tard le 26 ao\u00fbt 2005, soit il y a plus de deux ans; Il n'a pas confirm\u00e9, ce qu'il devait faire au plus tard le 14 novembre 2006, ses disponibilit\u00e9s pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 sa demande, selon moi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de but en blanc, sollicitant un [traduction] suivi du Tribunal, demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 environ 14 mois apr\u00e8s sa derni\u00e8re communication avec le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e0 plus d'une reprise fait fi des ordonnances pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal; Il n'a pas r\u00e9pondu, ce qu'il devait faire au plus tard le 31 mai 2007, \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 15 mai 2007 au sujet de ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9 pour l'audience; Il n'a pas r\u00e9pondu aux instructions du Tribunal lui demandant de d\u00e9poser ses observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate au plus tard le 1er ao\u00fbt 2007.\n[33] Le plaignant a donc fait fi de nombreux d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce ou a omis de s'y conformer. Compte tenu de la preuve dont je suis saisi, aucune excuse raisonnable ne peut expliquer que le plaignant retarde ou omette ainsi de se conformer \u00e0 toutes ces directives du Tribunal. Je ne peux que conclure que le plaignant ne d\u00e9sire plus poursuivre l'instruction de sa plainte.\n[34] Le Tribunal a le droit de se prot\u00e9ger contre l'abus de proc\u00e9dure caus\u00e9 par ce genre de m\u00e9pris total des d\u00e9lais, qui a fait en sorte que la proc\u00e9dure est demeur\u00e9e dormante pendant au moins deux ans, une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9raisonnablement longue. J'accueille donc la requ\u00eate de la partie intim\u00e9e. La plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Tim Day est ing\u00e9nieur \u00e9lectronicien agr\u00e9\u00e9. Il travaille chez la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes depuis 19 ans. En 1994, il est tomb\u00e9 malade et on a diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez lui une d\u00e9pression, des troubles d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et une personnalit\u00e9 obsessionnelle-compulsive. Il est retourn\u00e9 au travail en 1995. Depuis ce temps, la relation d\u2019emploi entre Postes Canada et M. Day est tendue. Il croit que Postes Canada n\u2019a jamais accept\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience psychique et le traite diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] M. Day soul\u00e8ve dix all\u00e9gations de discrimination, laquelle se serait produite entre avril 2001 et ao\u00fbt 2006. Les all\u00e9gations portent sur l\u2019aptitude psychologique de M. Day \u00e0 travailler, sur l\u2019obligation que lui impose Postes Canada de travailler de nuit, sur la cessation de son emploi ainsi que sur diverses instances de traitement discriminatoire et de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[3] M. Day invoque les articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019article 7 \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser. L\u2019article 14 dispose que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu.\n[4] Des dix all\u00e9gations de discrimination soulev\u00e9es par M. Day, une seule est \u00e9tay\u00e9e. Postes Canada a trait\u00e9 M. Day diff\u00e9remment des employ\u00e9s non handicap\u00e9s quand elle l\u2019a mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie et l\u2019a expuls\u00e9 du lieu de travail en novembre 2001. Bien que la preuve soutient la d\u00e9cision de Postes Canada de lui faire quitter le lieu de travail, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 M. Day avec dignit\u00e9 et respect au cours du processus d\u2019accommodement. Les autres all\u00e9gations de M. Day ne sont pas fond\u00e9es.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s un bref expos\u00e9 des faits ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte, je pr\u00e9senterai les all\u00e9gations de M. Day et je me pencherai sur elles tour \u00e0 tour. Finalement, j\u2019exposerai les motifs du redressement que j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9.\nII. Quels sont les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte ? [6] En avril 1986, Postes Canada a embauch\u00e9 M. Day \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien aux Services techniques du Centre de traitement du courrier de Glanford (CTCG) \u00e0 Victoria. En 1992, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au niveau EL5, un poste de technicien sp\u00e9cialiste au sein des Services techniques. Les EL5 accomplissent les t\u00e2ches les plus difficiles de r\u00e9paration et d\u2019entretien des machines chez Postes Canada. Ils doivent aussi superviser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 vingt employ\u00e9s.\n[7] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 1995, M. Day a souffert d\u2019une grave d\u00e9pression. Il a d\u00fb prendre cong\u00e9 pendant dix mois. Il est retourn\u00e9 au travail graduellement, mais sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration ne s\u2019est pas d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sans heurts. Il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes avec la direction de Postes Canada sur un certain nombres de question relatives au milieu travail.\n[8] Une de ces questions est l\u2019obligation de porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier. La r\u00e9paration et l\u2019entretien de machinerie peuvent \u00eatre dangereux. Pour cette raison, Postes Canada exige que les employ\u00e9s des Services techniques portent toujours des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier. M. Day ne peut pas le faire en raison d\u2019un trouble au pied. Bien que Postes Canada ait pris une mesure d\u2019accommodement relativement \u00e0 son trouble au pied, M. Day a estim\u00e9 que Postes Canada a g\u00e9r\u00e9 le processus de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire.\n[9] Un autre diff\u00e9rend entre M. Day et Postes Canada concernait l\u2019obligation de travailler selon des quarts chez Postes Canada. Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au niveau EL5 en 1992, M. Day ne travaillait que l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi, de 15 h \u00e0 23 h.\n[10] En 1997, Postes Canada a instaur\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me de quarts de travail par roulement. \u00c0 partir de cette date, tous les EL5, sauf ceux d\u00e9tenant un poste d\u2019[traduction]\u00e9lectronicien sp\u00e9cialiste, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de respecter l\u2019horaire des quarts de travail suivants en cycles de 12 semaines :\nle quart de jour, appel\u00e9 le premier quart, de 7 h \u00e0 15 h; le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, appel\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me quart, de 15 h \u00e0 23 h; le quart de nuit, appel\u00e9 le troisi\u00e8me quart, de 23 h \u00e0 7 h.\n[11] M. Day \u00e9prouvait des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler pendant les quarts de nuit chez Postes Canada. De 1996 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2001, M. Day et ses m\u00e9decins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le travail de nuit aggravait ses sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, Postes Canada a dispens\u00e9 M. Day de l\u2019obligation de travailler de nuit lorsqu\u2019il produisait une note de son m\u00e9decin attestant qu\u2019il ne pouvait travailler de nuit. Il l\u2019a fait chaque fois qu\u2019il devait travailler de nuit au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, bien qu\u2019il ait tent\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises de travailler quelques fois la nuit.\n[12] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2001, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que M. Day amorce un nouveau cycle de quarts de nuit. Comme il l\u2019avait fait auparavant, il a produit une note de son m\u00e9decin faisant \u00e9tat de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de nuit. Cette fois, cependant, Postes Canada a mis en doute le fait que M. Day ait en permanence besoin d\u2019\u00eatre dispens\u00e9 du quart de nuit. Postes Canada a, de mani\u00e8re temporaire, permis \u00e0 M. Day de travailler l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi, mais elle a envoy\u00e9 la note \u00e0 Medisys, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019experts\u2011conseils en soins de sant\u00e9 qui s\u2019occupe de toutes les questions de sant\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail chez Postes Canada, pour un examen plus approfondi.\n[13] Medisys a demand\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires. M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 chez le Dr Miller, un psychiatre de Victoria, pour subir un examen m\u00e9dical ind\u00e9pendant (EMI). Dans son rapport dat\u00e9 du 11 octobre 2001, le Dr Miller a fait savoir que M. Day souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9pression r\u00e9cidivante majeure dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement gu\u00e9ri. Il a recommand\u00e9 un changement dans sa m\u00e9dication ainsi qu\u2019une th\u00e9rapie cognitivo\u2011comportementale. Le Dr Miller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait pour M. Day de travailler selon des quarts rotatifs aggraverait son \u00e9tat mental. Il a \u00e9galement fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes relativement \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail si les diff\u00e9rends de M. Day avec la direction n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9solus rapidement.\n[14] Le 16 novembre 2001, Postes Canada a cru que la sant\u00e9 psychologique de M. Day s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e au point o\u00f9 M. Day repr\u00e9sentait une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du milieu de travail. M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 chez lui \u00e0 la fin de son quart avec une lettre d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte au travail et serait mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[15] M. Day est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 21 novembre 2001, avec une note du m\u00e9decin attestant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait apte au travail. Postes Canada n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 la note et M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 du lieu de travail. Son superviseur, M. Bob Ormerod, l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait obtenir de son m\u00e9decin une note confirmant qu\u2019il respectait les recommandations de traitement du Dr Miller et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[16] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2001, le m\u00e9decin de M. Day a confirm\u00e9 que ce dernier suivait le traitement recommand\u00e9 par le Dr Miller et que son \u00e9tat s\u2019am\u00e9liorait gr\u00e2ce au traitement. Cependant, il a affirm\u00e9 que M. Day ne devrait travailler que de jour.\n[17] Le Dr Hamm, le m\u00e9decin de Medisys, ne convenait pas avec le m\u00e9decin de M. Day qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de rendre permanente l\u2019exemption des quarts de nuit. Le Dr Hamm croyait que l\u2019\u00e9tat de M. Day allait selon toute probabilit\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la nouvelle m\u00e9dication. Sa d\u00e9pression serait en r\u00e9mission et il serait en mesure d\u2019effectuer les trois quarts de travail, y compris le quart de nuit. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son opinion \u00e0 Postes Canada dans un rapport d\u2019examen dat\u00e9 du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2001.\n[18] M. Day est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2001. Son horaire ne pr\u00e9voyait pas de quarts de nuit avant avril 2002. Toutefois, avant cette date, plusieurs incidents se sont produits, lesquels ont pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 M. Day.\n[19] Le 16 janvier 2002, Postes Canada a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day un pr\u00e9avis d\u2019entrevue de 24 heures o\u00f9 il allait \u00eatre discut\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas appliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante le syst\u00e8me d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif. La machinerie de Postes Canada fait l\u2019objet d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif afin qu\u2019elle demeure en \u00e9tat de marche. M. Day devait fournir des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement de cette t\u00e2che. Il a refus\u00e9 de le faire et a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence.\n[20] \u00c9galement en janvier 2002, M. Day a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada la permission d\u2019\u00e9changer son bloc de douze semaines de quarts d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi avec le bloc d\u2019un coll\u00e8gue EL5 qui devait passer aux quarts de jour. Postes Canada a refus\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa demande.\n[21] Vers le 10 avril 2001, M. Day a fourni \u00e0 Postes Canada une note de son m\u00e9decin attestant que, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, il ne devait pas travailler la nuit. M. Ormerod, le chef des Services techniques et de l\u2019Ing\u00e9nierie \u00e0 Victoria, l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que la note du m\u00e9decin ne suffirait pas \u00e0 l\u2019exempter des quarts de nuit. Il a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que les plus r\u00e9cents renseignements m\u00e9dicaux faisaient \u00e9tat de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler la nuit et qu\u2019on s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il le fasse.\n[22] M. Day a travaill\u00e9 pendant une partie des quarts de nuits \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Puis, le 25 avril 2002, il est parti avant la fin de son quart et s\u2019est absent\u00e9 pour cause de maladie le lendemain. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans salaire pendant trois jours pour avoir refus\u00e9 de travailler de nuit.\n[23] Le 27 mai 2002, Postes Canada a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day. Pour justifier son cong\u00e9diement, Postes Canada a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019omission de M. Day de se pr\u00e9senter au travail ou d\u2019expliquer de fa\u00e7on acceptable son absence.\n[24] M. Day a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief relativement \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement. Les parties en sont venues \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement selon lequel M. Day retournerait progressivement au travail \u00e0 partir du 16 mai 2003. Il ne travaillait que de jour.\n[25] En 2004, Postes Canada a jug\u00e9 que les Services techniques avaient deux employ\u00e9s en trop. Le 23 septembre 2004, Postes Canada a inform\u00e9 le syndicat que deux postes EL5 seraient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires. Cette situation entra\u00eenerait l\u2019\u00e9limination du poste de M. Day.\n[26] M. Day \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9 par l\u2019id\u00e9e de prouver que son poste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait une d\u00e9ficience. Ses sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 se sont accentu\u00e9s. Il est parti en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 nouveau le 27 octobre 2004.\n[27] Le 1er novembre 2004, le poste de M. Day ainsi que celui d\u2019un autre EL5 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s surnum\u00e9raires. M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de PO4, soit un poste de trieur de courrier au Centre de traitement du courrier de Glanford \u00e0 Victoria. M. Day n\u2019a jamais occup\u00e9 cette fonction depuis le d\u00e9but de son cong\u00e9 de maladie le 27 octobre 2004.\n[28] En mars 2005, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, M. Day a postul\u00e9 un poste vacant de MAM11 aux Services techniques de Victoria. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un poste de m\u00e9canicien. M. Sarbjit Sangha, le directeur des Services techniques de Vancouver, a par la suite inform\u00e9 M. Day et son syndicat que le poste de MAM11 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Day n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible au poste de MAM11.\n[29] En mai 2006, M. Day a postul\u00e9 un poste de facteur \u00e0 Victoria. Bien qu\u2019il ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019itin\u00e9raire qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9, il l\u2019a plus tard perdu en raison d\u2019une r\u00e9organisation des itin\u00e9raires. En fin de compte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de facteur de rel\u00e8ve, un poste qui ne lui plaisait pas.\n[30] M. Day consulte un psychiatre, le Dr David Swan, \u00e0 Victoria depuis septembre 2002. Le Dr Swan a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, apr\u00e8s avoir essay\u00e9 un certain nombre de m\u00e9dicaments, il a conclu que le trouble d\u00e9pressif de M. Day ne pourrait se r\u00e9gler enti\u00e8rement par m\u00e9dication. M. Day continue d\u2019\u00e9prouver des sympt\u00f4mes qui ne dispara\u00eetront pas compl\u00e8tement. Cependant, le Dr Swan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Day \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail, de jour, depuis novembre 2004.\n[31] La personnalit\u00e9 obsessive-compulsive de M. Day se traduit par des attentes tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9es envers lui-m\u00eame et envers les autres. Quand son rendement ou celui d\u2019une autre personne ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 ces attentes, cela peut engendrer de la frustration, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9pression. M. Day a tendance \u00e0 ressasser les questions qui le pr\u00e9occupent. Toutefois, cette maladie n\u2019affecte pas la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e0 agir de mani\u00e8re responsable au travail. Elle n\u2019affecte pas non plus sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir ses fonctions.\nIII. Quels sont les questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ? [32] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faut r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\nPostes Canada a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire contre M. Day en exigeant le port de bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier en avril 2001? Postes Canada a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire contre M. Day quand elle l\u2019a mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie et l\u2019a expuls\u00e9 du lieu de travail en novembre 2001? Postes Canada a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire contre M. Day dans ses rapports sur l\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif en janvier 2002? \u00c9tait-il discriminatoire de refuser \u00e0 M. Day l\u2019autorisation d\u2019\u00e9changer ses quarts avec un coll\u00e8gue en janvier 2002? \u00c9tait-il discriminatoire d\u2019exiger que M. Day travaille de nuit en avril 2002? \u00c9tait\u2011il discriminatoire de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day chez Postes Canada en mai 2002? Postes Canada a\u2011t\u2011elle commis un acte discriminatoire contre M. Day en novembre 2004 quand elle a supprim\u00e9 son poste d\u2019EL5? \u00c9tait\u2011il discriminatoire de supprimer le poste de MAM11 en mars 2005? \u00c9tait\u2011il discriminatoire d\u2019affecter M. Day \u00e0 un poste de facteur de rel\u00e8ve en 2006? M. Day a\u2011t\u2011il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience?\nA. Quels sont les crit\u00e8res juridiques applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce? [33] Lorsqu\u2019il y a all\u00e9gation de discrimination, le plaignant doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir prima facie qu\u2019il y a discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et al. c. La municipalit\u00e9 d\u2019Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202). Il y a preuve prima facie quand le plaignant pr\u00e9sente une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536).\n[34] Quand la discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie prima facie, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une explication raisonnable qui d\u00e9montre que l\u2019acte ne s\u2019est pas produit tel qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire (Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 26). Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournit une explication raisonnable, il incombe au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que cette explication n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 la discrimination (Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38474 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[35] L\u2019acte peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 non discriminatoire si l\u2019employeur montre qu\u2019il d\u00e9coule d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. L\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e est une r\u00e8gle ou une ligne de conduite \u00e9tablie de bonne foi parce qu\u2019elle est jug\u00e9e n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019atteinte d\u2019un objectif de travail valable. Une exigence professionnelle ne sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant justifi\u00e9e que si l\u2019employeur prouve que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne constituent une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de co\u00fbts (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[36] Pour \u00e9tablir si l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LCDP, le Tribunal doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans les arr\u00eats Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), et Colombie\u2011Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer).\nB. Analyse des questions en litige (i) Postes Canada a-t-elle r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question du port obligatoire de bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire? La preuve prima facie\n[37] En 1993, M. Day a fourni une note d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, laquelle faisait \u00e9tat d\u2019un trouble au pied l\u2019emp\u00eachant de porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier de mani\u00e8re continue. Il avait pris l\u2019habitude de porter des chaussures de sport qu\u2019il changeait pour des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier uniquement dans les aires o\u00f9 il y avait risque de blessure.\n[38] En janvier 2001, M. Steve Clark, le coordonnateur des Services techniques, a diffus\u00e9 une note de service \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s des Services techniques, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient tenus de porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier en tout temps dans le secteur des Services techniques.\n[39] Apr\u00e8s la diffusion de la note de service, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day de fournir une nouvelle note de m\u00e9decin. Postes Canada lui a donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue o\u00f9 il serait question de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que M. Day ne pouvait porter de mani\u00e8re continue rien qui rempla\u00e7ait ad\u00e9quatement les bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier, il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 permis de continuer \u00e0 porter des chaussures de sport dans le centre.\n[40] M. Day n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la solution au probl\u00e8me. Par contre, il s\u2019est plaint du processus qui l\u2019a oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir une nouvelle note du m\u00e9decin, \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une entrevue avec Postes Canada et \u00e0 avoir \u00e0 chercher d\u2019autres bottes, ce qui constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u00e9gative fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. Il a eu l\u2019impression que Postes Canada s\u2019est servie du port obligatoire de bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier comme pr\u00e9texte pour le traiter de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative parce qu\u2019il est handicap\u00e9.\n[41] M. Iroume, un coll\u00e8gue de M. Day, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s portaient parfois des chaussures de sport dans le Centre. Ils n\u2019ont pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une entrevue \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[42] M. Day a \u00e9tabli prima facie que le pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue sur son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u00e9gative fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il pourrait faire l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires s\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de porter des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de chercher des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier qu\u2019il aurait pu porter de fa\u00e7on continue alors qu\u2019il semble que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s ne portaient pas toujours de bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[43] Je suis persuad\u00e9 que les actes de Postes Canada relativement au port obligatoire de bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier n\u2019\u00e9taient fond\u00e9s que sur des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La r\u00e9paration et l\u2019entretien de grosses machines chez Postes Canada exposent les travailleurs \u00e0 un risque de blessures. Les bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier prot\u00e8gent contre les blessures. M. Clark avait re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre du comit\u00e9 national de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer vigoureusement l\u2019exigence. Il devait \u00e9tablir si, huit ans apr\u00e8s les derniers renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, M. Day avait encore un trouble au pied. M. Clark devait \u00e9galement \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existait d\u2019autre chaussures de protection que M. Day aurait pu porter de mani\u00e8re continue.\n[44] \u00c0 mon sens, le fait que les besoins de M. Day aient \u00e9t\u00e9 clarifi\u00e9s en lui donnant un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures ne fait pas du processus un traitement diff\u00e9rent d\u00e9favorable. M. Clark a expliqu\u00e9 que, chez Postes Canada, les pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue ne constituent pas une mesure disciplinaire. Au contraire, ils fournissent \u00e0 Postes Canada une occasion de faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant syndical, l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9occupations. Si, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019entrevue, on parvient \u00e0 une r\u00e9solution satisfaisante du probl\u00e8me, il ne s\u2019ensuit aucune sanction disciplinaire et le pr\u00e9avis n\u2019est pas consign\u00e9 au dossier de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Dans le cas de M. Day, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante aux pr\u00e9occupations de Postes Canada. Des mesures d\u2019accommodement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour M. Day.\n[45] Bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre vrai, comme l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 M. Iroume, que les employ\u00e9s des Services techniques ne portent pas toujours leurs bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier, M. Day et M. Clark ont fourni une preuve selon laquelle M. Day \u00e9tait le seul employ\u00e9 des Services techniques qui avait l\u2019habitude de toujours porter des chaussures de sport qu\u2019il changeait pour des bottes \u00e0 embout d\u2019acier dans certains secteurs du Centre.\n[46] J\u2019accepte l\u2019explication de M. Clark voulant que ce soit l\u2019habitude de M. Day de porter des chaussures de sport qui l\u2019ait emmen\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander s\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre fait quelque chose pour que M. Day porte des chaussures protectrices plus souvent. Il n\u2019a pas vis\u00e9 M. Day et ne l\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Il avait des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes an mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et il devait aborder la question avec M. Day.\n[47] Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada a fourni une explication satisfaisante \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation de M. Day.\n(ii) Postes Canada a\u2011t\u2011elle commis un acte discriminatoire contre M. Day quand elle l\u2019a mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie et l\u2019a expuls\u00e9 du lieu de travail en novembre 2001? La preuve prima facie\n[48] Le 16 novembre 2001, M. Day devait se rendre \u00e0 une entrevue sur des questions de rendement au travail qu\u2019avait soulev\u00e9es Postes Canada dans un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures. L\u2019entrevue a plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e avant m\u00eame son d\u00e9but. M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 chez lui \u00e0 la fin de son quart avec une lettre annon\u00e7ant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[49] M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 stup\u00e9fi\u00e9 d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Il ne se sentait pas malade. Il croyait que cet acte faisait partie du plan de Postes Canada visant \u00e0 le chasser parce qu\u2019il est handicap\u00e9.\n[50] Le 21 novembre 2001, M. Day est revenu au travail avec une note de son m\u00e9decin attestant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] bien et apte \u00e0 travailler. Il a fait sa journ\u00e9e de travail, puis, \u00e0 la fin, M. Ormerod a cri\u00e9 son nom depuis l\u2019autre bout du plancher. Quand M. Ormerod s\u2019est approch\u00e9 de M. Day, il lui a dit qu\u2019il ne devait pas travailler, que la note de son m\u00e9decin ne suffisait pas et qu\u2019il devait quitter les lieux imm\u00e9diatement. M. Ormerod l\u2019a ensuite escort\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la sortie du b\u00e2timent. M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cet incident l\u2019avait beaucoup embarrass\u00e9.\n[51] M. Day a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une des parties les plus vexantes de cette s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents \u00e9tait le fait qu\u2019il ne comprenait pas pourquoi il \u00e9tait envoy\u00e9 chez lui. La lettre qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7ue le 16 novembre 2001 mentionnait que Postes Canada \u00e9prouvait des inqui\u00e9tudes de bonne foi concernant son aptitude au travail \u00e0 la suite d\u2019observations et de l\u2019avis professionnel du Dr Hamm.\n[52] La lettre que Postes Canada a remise \u00e0 M. Day le 21 novembre 2001, le jour o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 escort\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la sortie du b\u00e2timent, faisait savoir qu\u2019il ne lui serait pas permis de revenir au travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait une preuve m\u00e9dicale montrant qu\u2019il suivait le traitement recommand\u00e9 par le Dr Miller dans son rapport d\u2019EMI.\n[53] Cependant, ni M. Day ni son m\u00e9decin n\u2019ont re\u00e7u le rapport d\u2019EMI du Dr Miller avant le 23 novembre 2001 et ce n\u2019est pas avant que ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux aient rencontr\u00e9 Postes Canada le 28 novembre 2001 que M. Day a appris que Postes Canada estimait qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail.\n[54] M. Day a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 violent envers lui\u2011m\u00eame ou envers d\u2019autres personnes au travail. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, s\u2019il avait vraiment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un risque, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, bien que l\u2019entrevue du 16 novembre 2001 l\u2019ait contrari\u00e9, son comportement \u00e9tait lent plut\u00f4t qu\u2019agit\u00e9, car il avait pris des m\u00e9dicaments contre l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 pour se calmer. Il a jug\u00e9 que Postes Canada n\u2019avait aucun motif de le mettre en cong\u00e9 de maladie ou de l\u2019expulser du lieu de travail en novembre 2001.\n[55] J\u2019estime que M. Day a \u00e9tabli prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, soit qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Postes Canada a jug\u00e9 que M. Day repr\u00e9sentait un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e9tait inapte \u00e0 travailler alors que le propre m\u00e9decin de M. Day \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait en fait apte \u00e0 travailler. On lui a refus\u00e9 le droit de retourner au travail, bien qu\u2019il ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve de son aptitude \u00e0 travailler. Il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une humiliante expulsion de son lieu de travail, en pr\u00e9sence de ses coll\u00e8gues. Ni lui ni son m\u00e9decin n\u2019avaient re\u00e7u les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019expulsion de M. Day par Postes Canada.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[56] Postes Canada a soutenu que, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en cause, la preuve montrait que M. Day repr\u00e9sentait un risque s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 celle des autres travailleurs. Il aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive de lui permettre de demeurer sur les lieux ou de l\u2019avoir inform\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail des motifs de son expulsion. Par cons\u00e9quent, mettre M. Day en cong\u00e9 de maladie et lui interdire de revenir au travail en novembre 2001 constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, selon Postes Canada.\n[57] Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, l\u2019expulsion du plaignant de son lieu de travail ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e sauf si l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tablit que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Day auraient constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[58] Le risque est un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer si une mesure d\u2019accommodement constitue une contrainte excessive (Colombie\u2011Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Council of Human Rights) (Grismer), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, au paragraphe 30). Quand il est question de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tant l\u2019importance du risque que l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ceux qui y sont expos\u00e9s constituent des facteurs pertinents (Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Human Rights Comm.) (1990), 12 C.H.R.R. D\/417, au paragraphe 62).\n[59] J\u2019estime que la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tablit que, le 16 novembre 2001, tant la gravit\u00e9 et l\u2019importance du risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Day ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres travailleurs \u00e9taient telles que Postes Canada n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019envoyer M. Day chez lui.\n[60] Le rapport du Dr Miller indique que l\u2019\u00e9tat psychologique de M. Day \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s instable \u00e0 ce moment. Il craignait que M. Day puisse devenir violent si ses griefs au travail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9solus.\n[61] Un jour avant d\u2019envoyer M. Day chez lui en cong\u00e9 de maladie, Postes Canada lui avait donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue, pr\u00e9avis dans lequel \u00e9taient \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s les aspects de son rendement au travail qui \u00e9taient source de pr\u00e9occupation. Mme Jenica Epp, une infirmi\u00e8re de Medisys, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Day \u00e9tait venu la voir avant son entrevue du 16 novembre 2001. Il lui a sembl\u00e9 tendu, anxieux et troubl\u00e9. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait des tics nerveux \u00e9vidents \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il et au visage. Elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise en sa pr\u00e9sence et elle avait peur.\n[62] M. Clark a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que, au cours des semaines pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le 16 novembre 2001, il a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Day \u00e9tait plus agit\u00e9 et tendu qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019habitude. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 de la stabilit\u00e9 psychologique de M. Day \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[63] J\u2019accepte que Postes Canada a l\u2019obligation d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le bien-\u00eatre de tous ses employ\u00e9s au lieu de travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, les employ\u00e9s qui repr\u00e9sentent un risque \u00e0 leur propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 celle des autres doivent quitter le lieu de travail et ne peuvent y revenir avant d\u2019avoir \u00e9tabli, au moyen d\u2019une preuve m\u00e9dicale acceptable, qu\u2019ils ne repr\u00e9sentent plus une telle menace. Les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Day au travail auraient constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive, car elles auraient expos\u00e9 M. Day ou les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9s.\n[64] Avant d\u2019autoriser le retour au travail de M. Day, Postes Canada devait avoir du m\u00e9decin de M. Day l\u2019assurance que ce dernier suivait le traitement recommand\u00e9 par le Dr Miller et qu\u2019il ne repr\u00e9sentait plus un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Aucune des notes produites par M. Day ne fournissait cette assurance. Encore une fois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019importance et la gravit\u00e9 du risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des travailleurs en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus qu\u2019il aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive de permettre \u00e0 M. Day de revenir au travail le 21 novembre 2001.\n[65] Cependant, l\u2019examen visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement ne s\u2019arr\u00eate pas ici. Cette obligation comprend un aspect qui a trait \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure et un aspect qui a trait \u00e0 la teneur (Meiorin, au paragraphe 66). La Cour supr\u00eame a statu\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l\u2019accommodement doit \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration ind\u00e9pendamment de la teneur lorsqu\u2019il faut \u00e9tablir s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait ou non \u00e0 l\u2019obligation.\n[66] L\u2019omission de satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019un des deux aspects n\u2019entra\u00eene pas n\u00e9cessairement une violation de la Loi. Tant la proc\u00e9dure appliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019examen et les r\u00e9sultats tangibles de cet examen doivent \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour \u00e9tablir si l\u2019employeur a satisfait \u00e0 ses obligations pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi (Meiorin, au paragraphe 66; Datt c. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Canada Ltd., 2007 BCHRT 324; Gordy c. Painter's Lodge (no 2), 2004 BCHRT 225).\n[67] Dans Irvine c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 432, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait savoir que l\u2019aspect proc\u00e9dural compris dans l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u00e9cessitait une \u00e9valuation juste de la preuve m\u00e9dicale disponible relativement \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant d\u2019accomplir ses t\u00e2ches.\n[68] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans le processus d\u2019accommodement ne se limite pas \u00e0 un examen juste de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 accomplir ses t\u00e2ches. La notion d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 comprend plut\u00f4t toutes les facettes du processus d\u2019accommodement. Elle n\u00e9cessite le respect de la valeur et de la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de l\u2019individu tout au long du processus, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne cause aucune contrainte excessive (Meiorin, au paragraphe 62).\n[69] La question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement dans l\u2019application de la norme en question ci\u2011dessus, soit le renvoi du lieu de travail lorsqu\u2019il y a risque de violence ou de comportement dangereux. Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement.\n1. Ni M. Day ni son m\u00e9decin n\u2019ont re\u00e7u en temps opportun une copie du rapport d\u2019EMI \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019envoyer M. Day chez lui.\n[70] Le psychiatre ayant effectu\u00e9 l\u2019EMI, le Dr Miller, a examin\u00e9 M. Day le 11 octobre 2001. \u00c0 plusieurs reprises au d\u00e9but novembre, M. Day a demand\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019EMI tant \u00e0 Postes Canada qu\u2019\u00e0 Medisys. Ses demandes sont demeur\u00e9es sans r\u00e9ponse, le rapport n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin de M. Day que le 20 novembre 2001.\n[71] M. Ormerod affirme que le rapport d\u2019EMI a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin de M. Day le 20 novembre 2001. En raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me avec le t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur du m\u00e9decin de M. Day, celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u le rapport avant le 23 novembre 2001. Cependant, rien n\u2019explique pourquoi le rapport n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin de M. Day avant le 20 novembre 2001.\n[72] En raison de l\u2019omission de remettre le rapport d\u2019EMI \u00e0 temps, M. Day n\u2019a pas su avant le 23 novembre 2001, quand son m\u00e9decin a re\u00e7u le rapport, que le Dr Miller croyait qu\u2019il ne recevait pas le bon traitement pour sa d\u00e9pression et qu\u2019il existait des inqui\u00e9tudes relativement \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris compl\u00e8tement par surprise par l\u2019avis lui annon\u00e7ant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 travailler.\n[73] \u00c9galement en raison de l\u2019omission de Postes Canada de fournir \u00e0 temps \u00e0 M. Day les renseignements dont il avait besoin, M. Day a d\u00fb subir l\u2019humiliation d\u2019\u00eatre escort\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la sortie du b\u00e2timent le 21 novembre 2001, parce que la note de son m\u00e9decin ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux inqui\u00e9tudes de Postes Canada. Encore une fois, M. Day n\u2019avait aucune id\u00e9e de ce que voulait Postes Canada, car son m\u00e9decin n\u2019avait pas encore re\u00e7u le rapport d\u2019EMI.\n[74] Il ne peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9 en toute certitude que, si le rapport d\u2019EMI avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 temps au m\u00e9decin de M. Day, les r\u00e9sultats auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, compte tenu de l\u2019affirmation de M. Day selon laquelle il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre le traitement recommand\u00e9 par le Dr Miller imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport et compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin selon lequel M. Day r\u00e9pondait bien \u00e0 la m\u00e9dication, il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que les incidents de novembre aient pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9s si le rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 d\u00e8s sa remise par Medisys.\n2. Le m\u00e9decin de M. Day n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que M. Day avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie le 16 novembre 2001.\n[75] M. Ormerod et M. Clark, les superviseurs de M. Day, ont soutenu que M. Day n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des craintes de l\u2019entreprise relativement \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019avaient pas laiss\u00e9 prendre part \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019envoyer chez lui le 16 novembre 2001 parce qu\u2019ils craignaient que cela ne le perturbe davantage. M. Clark a affirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir rien dit \u00e0 M. Day parce que [Traduction] personne n\u2019aime se faire dire qu\u2019il constitue un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Je conviens que, le 16 novembre 2001, Postes Canada \u00e9tait dans une situation critique et devait prendre une d\u00e9cision difficile \u00e0 propos des renseignements \u00e0 communiquer \u00e0 M. Day. Par cons\u00e9quent, la d\u00e9cision de ne pas informer M. Day de tous les motifs \u00e0 l\u2019origine de son expulsion peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e.\n[76] Cependant, Postes Canada n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante pourquoi le m\u00e9decin de M. Day n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait des inqui\u00e9tudes s\u00e9rieuses \u00e0 propos de la sant\u00e9 mentale de M. Day et que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme repr\u00e9sentant un danger pour lui\u2011m\u00eame et les autres le 16 novembre 2001. M. Ormerod a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les renseignements concernant la sant\u00e9 mentale et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s ne devaient pas \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s directement \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 par son employeur, mais par une personne du domaine de la sant\u00e9.\n[77] Pourquoi alors les graves inqui\u00e9tudes de Postes Canada relativement \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 mentale de M. Day n\u2019ont\u2011elles pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es imm\u00e9diatement au m\u00e9decin de M. Day?\n[78] Le Dr Hamm a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir pas inform\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin de M. Day de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit le 16 novembre 2001 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une urgence. Il croyait simplement que M. Day devait rentrer chez lui o\u00f9 il pouvait retrouver son calme. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon sens, si la situation \u00e9tait suffisamment urgente pour envoyer M. Day chez lui sans l\u2019en informer de tous les motifs, la situation \u00e9tait suffisamment urgente pour alerter le m\u00e9decin de M. Day. Apr\u00e8s tout, la propre sant\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e9tait \u00e0 risque. Le rapport du Dr Miller est assez vague pour ce qui est du potentiel de violence de M. Day. Il est tr\u00e8s possible de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il signifie que M. Day puisse \u00eatre violent envers lui\u2011m\u00eame. L\u2019omission d\u2019informer le m\u00e9decin de M. Day que ce dernier \u00e9tait envoy\u00e9 chez lui parce qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e8le, selon moi, un manque de consid\u00e9ration assez insensible envers le bien\u2011\u00eatre de M. Day.\n[79] En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime que Postes Canada n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 M. Day \u00e9quitablement en novembre 2001. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 comme un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que comme un \u00eatre humain ayant besoin d\u2019\u00eatre inform\u00e9 et soutenu. Bien qu\u2019il ne f\u00fbt pas possible de prendre des mesures pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Day au travail \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait, Postes Canada n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante pourquoi il n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 temps le rapport d\u2019EMI et le rapport d\u2019examen \u00e0 M. Day et \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin. De m\u00eame, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que de communiquer au m\u00e9decin de M. Day les inqui\u00e9tudes de Postes Canada au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Day aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[80] Par cons\u00e9quent, Postes Canada n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 l\u2019aspect proc\u00e9dural de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Bien que le manquement \u00e0 cet aspect de l\u2019obligation ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement une violation de la Loi, je suis d\u2019avis que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les r\u00e9percussions du manquement, tant pour ce qui est du r\u00e9sultat des incidents de novembre 2001 que de ses cons\u00e9quences sur la dignit\u00e9 et l\u2019estime de soi de M. Day, justifient une telle cons\u00e9quence. Postes Canada n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a pris, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, les mesures pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Day, sans qu\u2019il en constitue une contrainte excessive. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de M. Day au sujet des incidents de novembre est donc \u00e9tay\u00e9e.\n(iii) L\u2019obligation pour les EL5 de remettre un formulaire sur l\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif chaque vendredi \u00e9tait\u2011elle discriminatoire? La preuve prima facie\n[81] En tant qu\u2019EL5, M. Day devait attribuer et superviser les t\u00e2ches relatives \u00e0 l\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif (EP) effectu\u00e9 pendant le quart de jour. Le travail \u00e9tait assign\u00e9 le lundi. Il devait \u00eatre termin\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la semaine, sauf s\u2019il y avait beaucoup de travail ou si le Centre \u00e9tait occup\u00e9. Les rapports sur l\u2019\u00e9tat du travail (les formulaires d\u2019EP) \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s dans un syst\u00e8me informatis\u00e9, lequel surveillait le travail d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif effectu\u00e9 sur toutes les machines au Canada. L\u2019EL5 recueillait les formulaires d\u2019EP des employ\u00e9s sous sa supervision pendant le quart de jour et les remettait en m\u00eame temps que le sien.\n[82] De 1999 \u00e0 2001, l\u2019EL5 pouvait remettre les formulaires d\u2019EP \u00e0 la direction pour leur entr\u00e9e dans le syst\u00e8me informatique le lundi suivant, apr\u00e8s l\u2019attribution du travail. Cette politique a chang\u00e9 en 2001. En janvier 2002, date \u00e0 laquelle M. Day a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pendant les quarts de jour, la direction s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que l\u2019EL5 soumette les formulaires d\u2019EP le vendredi de la semaine o\u00f9 le travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9.\n[83] M. Day n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 le changement de politique. Il n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 non plus la fa\u00e7on dont le changement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre. Il croyait que cela faisait partie de la campagne de Postes Canada visant \u00e0 le traiter diff\u00e9remment parce qu\u2019il est handicap\u00e9.\n[84] M. Day n\u2019a pas remis les formulaires d\u2019EP de ses subalternes le vendredi 11 janvier 2002, comme il le devait. Il a remis uniquement le sien. En cons\u00e9quence, Postes Canada a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue pour discuter de son omission d\u2019appliquer correctement le syst\u00e8me d\u2019EP.\n[85] \u00c0 l\u2019entrevue, on a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9 personnellement : tous les EL5 sont tenus de remettre leur propre formulaire d\u2019EP ainsi que ceux de leurs subalternes le vendredi. M. Day a continu\u00e9 de ne remettre que le sien. En cons\u00e9quence, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans salaire pendant trois jours.\n[86] M. Iroume a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en faveur de M. Day. Il a affirm\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de jour en avril 2002, il n\u2019a pas non plus remis ses formulaires d\u2019EP le vendredi. Il a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue et il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 de remettre les formulaires d\u2019EP \u00e0 temps. M. Iroume a affirm\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9 aux exigences de Postes Canada apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue. Cependant, il a soutenu que Postes Canada lui avait donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures et l\u2019avait questionn\u00e9 seulement pour faire para\u00eetre l\u00e9gitimes les actes de Postes Canada envers M. Day.\n[87] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Iroume \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible. Il reconna\u00eet ne pas s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exigence avant l\u2019entrevue : il ne remettait qu\u2019environ 15 % des formulaires d\u2019EP pour son quart de travail. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, quand Postes Canada lui a clairement ordonn\u00e9 de remettre les formulaires d\u2019EP, ce chiffre a grimp\u00e9 \u00e0 60 ou 70 %. M. Day, quant \u00e0 lui, ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la directive de Postes Canada. En cons\u00e9quence, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9.\n[88] Aucune preuve cr\u00e9dible n\u2019\u00e9taye l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres employ\u00e9s en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience relativement au syst\u00e8me d\u2019entretien pr\u00e9ventif. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Day n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli prima facie qu\u2019il y avait discrimination.\n(iv) \u00c9tait\u2011il discriminatoire de refuser \u00e0 M. Day l\u2019autorisation d\u2019\u00e9changer ses quarts avec M. Iroume? La preuve prima facie\n[89] En janvier 2002, M. Day a tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9changer son bloc de douze semaines de quarts d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi contre le bloc de M. Guido Iroume, un coll\u00e8gue EL5 qui devait travailler de jour. M. Iroume pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi et M. Day pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait le quart de jour pour des raisons de famille et de sant\u00e9. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e.\n[90] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Day a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9changer un bloc entier de douze semaines \u00e9tait une pratique courante chez Postes Canada. M. Iroume a affirm\u00e9 que, bien que les \u00e9changes de quarts fussent courants, la fr\u00e9quence de cette pratique a diminu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision rendue par l\u2019arbitre Blasina en avril 2002. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, l\u2019arbitre Blasina a conclu que l\u2019entreprise \u00e9tait tenue de faire travailler les EL5 selon les trois quarts de travail par roulement.\n[91] M. Day a soutenu que le refus de Postes Canada d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa demande visant \u00e0 \u00e9changer des quarts de travail constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. Cependant, ni M. Day ni M. Iroume n\u2019ont pu citer en exemple des personnes qui ont \u00e9chang\u00e9 un bloc entier. En outre, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Iroume laisse fortement entendre que, si cette pratique a d\u00e9j\u00e0 exist\u00e9, elle a chang\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avril 2002. \u00c0 ce moment, ni M. Day ni ses coll\u00e8gues n\u2019ont eu l\u2019autorisation d\u2019\u00e9changer un bloc entier de quarts de travail. Rien ne laisse croire que la demande de changement de quarts a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e en raison de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day.\n[92] L\u2019avocat de M. Day a soutenu que le refus d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande de changement de quarts constitue de la discrimination ayant un effet d\u00e9favorable, car M. Day est incapable, en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, de travailler pendant le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi.\n[93] Cependant, M. Day a affirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pendant le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que, \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0, il tentait d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 travailler pendant le quart de nuit, et non le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que M. Day n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli prima facie que le refus d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa demande de changement de quart, ou le fait qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de travailler pendant le quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi en janvier 2002, constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(v) \u00c9tait-il discriminatoire d\u2019exiger que M. Day travaille de nuit en avril 2002? La preuve prima facie\n[94] De 1997 \u00e0 avril 2002, M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de travailler de nuit chez Postes Canada d\u00e8s qu\u2019il produisait une note d\u2019un m\u00e9decin attestant que sa d\u00e9ficience l\u2019emp\u00eachait de le faire. Cependant, en avril 2002, Postes Canada a insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il travaille de nuit, car, selon l\u2019entreprise, la preuve m\u00e9dicale la plus r\u00e9cente n\u2019attestait pas que sa d\u00e9ficience l\u2019emp\u00eachait de travailler de nuit.\n[95] M. Day n\u2019estimait pas \u00eatre capable de travailler la nuit. Il croyait que la preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9tablissait clairement que le travail de nuit le rendait malade. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 de nuit comme on l\u2019exigeait en avril et mai 2002. En cons\u00e9quence, Postes Canada lui a impos\u00e9 une suspension de trois jours.\n[96] M. Day a soutenu que l\u2019obligation que lui imposait Postes Canada de travailler de nuit et la mesure disciplinaire appliqu\u00e9e en raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de nuit constituaient une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[97] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve qui suit, j\u2019estime que M. Day a \u00e9tabli prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable pour ce qui est de la pr\u00e9sente all\u00e9gation.\n[98] Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve m\u00e9dicale appuient l\u2019affirmation de M. Day selon laquelle les quarts de nuit aggravent ses sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans le rapport d\u2019EMI du 11 octobre 2001, le Dr Miller a \u00e9crit que le travail par quart risquait de faire empirer l\u2019\u00e9tat psychologique de M. Day plut\u00f4t que de l\u2019am\u00e9liorer. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9pression de M. Day n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en r\u00e9mission et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e ad\u00e9quatement.\n[99] Dans un rapport d\u2019examen dat\u00e9 du 30 octobre 2001, le Dr Hamm de Medisys a affirm\u00e9 que M. Day devait \u00e9viter le travail de nuit. Il y d\u00e9clarait \u00e9galement que M. Day devait suivre les recommandations de traitement du Dr Miller.\n[100] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2001, le m\u00e9decin de M. Day faisait savoir que, bien que M. Day r\u00e9pond\u00eet bien \u00e0 la nouvelle m\u00e9dication et f\u00fbt en mesure de retourner au travail, il ne devait travailler que de jour. Contrairement, semble\u2011t\u2011il, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il \u00e9crivait dans son rapport d\u2019examen du 30 octobre 2001, le Dr Hamm n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019appuyait pas la mesure d\u2019accommodement permanente permettant \u00e0 M. Day de ne travailler que de jour.\n[101] En janvier 2002, M. Day a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consulter un nouveau m\u00e9decin de famille, le Dr Cook, parce que son m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent avait quitt\u00e9 le pays. Le 10 avril 2002, le Dr Cook a fourni \u00e0 son patient une note o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit : [traduction] Il est recommand\u00e9 que ce patient ne travaille pas la nuit pour des raisons de sant\u00e9. M. Day et Mme Andrew, l\u2019agente des griefs du STTP, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la note avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copie \u00e0 Postes Canada le 15 avril 2002 \u00e0 partir du bureau du syndicat.\n[102] M. Ormerod a ni\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u cette note. Cependant, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Clark \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est plus convaincant. Il a soutenu que ni M. Ormerod ni lui n\u2019ont re\u00e7u cette note et que, s\u2019il l\u2019avait re\u00e7ue, il l\u2019aurait transmise \u00e0 M. Ormerod.\n[103] De plus, le 15 avril 2002, M. Ormerod a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Day pour lui dire que la note de son m\u00e9decin dat\u00e9e du 15 avril 2002 ne suffirait pas \u00e0 l\u2019exempter du quart de nuit. Il est peu probable que M. Ormerod ait fait une telle d\u00e9claration sans avoir re\u00e7u la note. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que M. Ormerod a re\u00e7u une note du m\u00e9decin de M. Day, laquelle faisait savoir que, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, il \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 que M. Day ne travaille pas de nuit.\n[104] M. Day a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada une preuve m\u00e9dicale attestant son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de nuit en avril 2002 en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Postes Canada a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter la note de son m\u00e9decin et a plut\u00f4t insist\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il continue \u00e0 travailler la nuit. La preuve produite par M. Day laisse entendre qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 puni parce qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas travailler de nuit. Pour ces motifs, j\u2019estime que M. Day a \u00e9tabli prima facie qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[105] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 soigneusement la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que Postes Canada n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019acte discriminatoire envers M. Day en lui imposant une suspension de trois jours pour avoir refus\u00e9 de travailler de nuit. Postes Canada disposait d\u2019une preuve m\u00e9dicale solide attestant que M. Day pouvait en fait travailler de nuit. Cependant, tout en accordant \u00e0 M. Day le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de tout doute qui pourrait subsister \u00e0 ce sujet, j\u2019estime que Postes Canada lui a offert un certain nombre de mesures raisonnables d\u2019accommodement. M. Day a choisi de refuser ces offres. Si Postes Canada avait l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement envers M. Day (et je ne suis pas convaincu que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas), elle s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de cette obligation.\ni) M. Day n\u2019avait pas besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement\n[106] Bien que, jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2001, la preuve m\u00e9dicale sugg\u00e9r\u00e2t que M. Day ne f\u00fbt pas en mesure de travailler de nuit, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve m\u00e9dicale provenant du Dr Hamm et du nouveau m\u00e9decin de M. Day, le Dr Cook, indiquent toutes que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e0 travailler de nuit d\u00e9coulait probablement du fait que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment, sa d\u00e9pression n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e ad\u00e9quatement. Toutefois, en avril 2002, la preuve attestait que M. Day r\u00e9pondait bien \u00e0 la nouvelle m\u00e9dication recommand\u00e9e par le Dr Miller et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler de nuit. Je me pencherai maintenant sur cette preuve.\n[107] Dans son rapport d\u2019EMI d\u2019octobre 2001, le Dr Miller a affirm\u00e9 que les rem\u00e8des \u00e0 base de plantes m\u00e9dicinales que prenait M. Day selon la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le Dr Rozwadowski, \u00e9taient inefficaces. Il a non seulement prescrit un nouveau traitement pharmacologique, mais \u00e9galement une th\u00e9rapie cognitivo\u2011comportementale visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ses probl\u00e8mes persistants au travail.\n[108] Le Dr Hamm a re\u00e7u la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert en m\u00e9decine du travail \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience avec des patients souffrant de d\u00e9pression. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience, ces patients n\u2019ont aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler par quarts, y compris de nuit, s\u2019ils sont trait\u00e9s correctement et si leurs sympt\u00f4mes sont en r\u00e9mission.\n[109] En raison d\u2019une clause du contrat entre Medisys et Postes Canada, le Dr Hamm n\u2019a pas eu la permission de rencontrer M. Day. Cependant, il a effectu\u00e9 un examen minutieux du dossier de M. Day et il a communiqu\u00e9 avec les m\u00e9decins de M. Day.\n[110] En d\u00e9cembre 2001, le Dr Hamm a consult\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin de M. Day \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que M. Day r\u00e9pondait bien \u00e0 la m\u00e9dication recommand\u00e9e par le Dr Miller, que son \u00e9tat s\u2019\u00e9tait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 au travail.\n[111] \u00c0 partir de ces renseignements, le Dr Hamm a conclu en d\u00e9cembre 2001 que, compte tenu de l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019\u00e9tat psychologique de M. Day, celui-ci devrait \u00eatre capable de travailler de nuit en avril 2002. C\u2019est pour cette raison que le Dr Hamm a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada dans son rapport d\u2019examen du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2001 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en faveur d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement permanente permettant \u00e0 M. Day de ne travailler que le jour.\n[112] Dans une lettre envoy\u00e9e au syndicat le 18 avril 2002, le Dr Hamm a expliqu\u00e9 la disparit\u00e9 apparente entre sa recommandation \u00e0 M. Day d\u2019\u00e9viter les quarts de nuit dans son rapport d\u2019examen d\u2019octobre 2001 et sa recommandation \u00e0 M. Day de maintenir ses t\u00e2ches habituelles, y compris les quarts de nuit, formul\u00e9e dans son rapport d\u2019examen de d\u00e9cembre 2001. Dans la lettre, le Dr Hamm affirme que, en octobre 2001, il \u00e9tait en faveur de permettre temp orairement \u00e0 M. Day de ne travailler que le jour afin de permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 sa nouvelle m\u00e9dication et de permettre aux sympt\u00f4mes de se r\u00e9sorber. Cependant, il n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 ce moment l\u2019intention de recommander \u00e0 Postes Canada de rendre permanente cette mesure d\u2019accommodement. Apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin de M. Day en d\u00e9cembre 2001, le Dr Hamm a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que M. Day faisait de beaux progr\u00e8s et devrait \u00eatre en mesure de travailler de nuit, comme beaucoup d\u2019autres de ses patients d\u00e9pressifs avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 le faire.\n[113] Le Dr Cook, que M. Day a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 consulter en janvier 2002, a fourni un t\u00e9moignage important \u00e0 l\u2019audience quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e0 travailler de nuit entre janvier 2002 et le 29 mai 2002. Le Dr Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait et avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que M. Day \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement capable de travailler de nuit \u00e0 condition que sa sant\u00e9 soit surveill\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment. Il croyait que les probl\u00e8mes de M. Day n\u2019\u00e9taient pas de nature m\u00e9dicale, qu\u2019ils relevaient plut\u00f4t des diff\u00e9rends constants avec Postes Canada. Le Dr Cook \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que M. Day avait besoin d\u2019un m\u00e9diateur ou d\u2019un conseiller sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans les conflits au travail, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019un m\u00e9decin ou d\u2019un psychiatre.\n[114] Le Dr Cook a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, d\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re rencontre avec M. Day en janvier 2002, il \u00e9tait clair que M. Day ne voulait de lui rien de plus qu\u2019un avis m\u00e9dical attestant qu\u2019il ne pouvait travailler de nuit. Cette situation mettait le Dr Cook mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise. Comme le Dr Hamm, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il suivait de nombreux patients d\u00e9pressifs qui pouvaient travailler de nuit dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s ad\u00e9quatement et suivis par un m\u00e9decin.\n[115] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 18 mars 2002, M. Day a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Postes Canada que le Dr Cook lui avait conseill\u00e9 de ne pas travailler de nuit en raison de sa sant\u00e9. Cependant, le Dr Cook a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas donn\u00e9 ce conseil parce qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas. Quand M. Day lui a demand\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en mars 2002 de lui donner une note attestant qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas travailler de nuit, il a refus\u00e9 de le faire, car il s\u2019agissait selon lui d\u2019un conflit au travail plut\u00f4t que d\u2019une question m\u00e9dicale.\n[116] N\u00e9anmoins, le 10 avril 2002, le Dr Cook a fourni \u00e0 M. Day une note attestant qu\u2019il lui conseillait de ne pas travailler de nuit pour des raisons de sant\u00e9. Le Dr Cook a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il ne savait pas pourquoi il avait fourni une note \u00e0 M. Day. Il a convenu avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en contre\u2011interrogatoire qu\u2019il l\u2019avait fait pour [traduction] se d\u00e9barrasser de M. Day. Le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Cook laisse fortement entendre que la note ne constituait pas une expression authentique de son avis m\u00e9dical, mais plut\u00f4t une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pression intense exerc\u00e9e par M. Day qui demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9 du travail de nuit.\n[117] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Day est venu \u00e9tayer l\u2019affirmation du Dr Cook selon laquelle M. Day ne souhaitait que voir appuy\u00e9e son opinion selon laquelle il ne pouvait pas travailler de nuit. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait toujours eu des difficult\u00e9s avec le Dr Cook parce que ce m\u00e9decin ne semblait pas comprendre sa situation. M. Day a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu par ses m\u00e9decins et que le Dr Cook n\u2019agissait pas de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Il ressortait clairement du t\u00e9moignage de M. Day qu\u2019il acceptait difficilement le fait que le Dr Cook n\u2019appuyait pas inconditionnellement sa volont\u00e9 de ne pas travailler de nuit.\n[118] En cons\u00e9quence, en mai 2002, M. Day a chang\u00e9 de m\u00e9decin, passant du Dr Cook au Dr Cooper. Ce dernier a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas fallu obliger M. Day \u00e0 travailler de nuit en avril 2002. Selon le Dr Cooper, le travail de nuit exacerbait les sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression de M. Day. Cependant, le Dr Cooper n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le m\u00e9decin de M. Day pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente pour la pr\u00e9sente all\u00e9gation. Il a convenu que le Dr Cook \u00e9tait en meilleure position pour juger de la sant\u00e9 psychologique de M. Day \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[119] Comment Postes Canada a\u2011t\u2011elle expliqu\u00e9 le fait que la note dat\u00e9e du 10 avril 2002 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Day n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e comme preuve \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019il ne pouvait travailler la nuit? M. Ormerod a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Postes Canada avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les notes m\u00e9dicales provenant de carnets d\u2019ordonnances ne suffiraient plus \u00e0 exempter M. Day des quarts de nuit. Il fallait plus de renseignements pour \u00e9tablir pourquoi le traitement recommand\u00e9 par le Dr Miller ne fonctionnait pas. Cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Day et au syndicat lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union le 22 avril 2002.\n[120] M. Ormerod a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Day avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 d\u00e8s le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2002 que Postes Canada s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que les m\u00e9dicaments qu\u2019il prenait le rendent apte \u00e0 travailler de nuit. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Day a eu amplement le temps d\u2019obtenir un avis m\u00e9dical contraire, si les circonstances le justifiaient. Il n\u2019a pas fourni de tel renseignement m\u00e9dical. Une note provenant d\u2019un carnet d\u2019ordonnance ne constituerait pas une preuve suffisante de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de nuit, car elle ne contient pas assez de renseignements.\n[121] \u00c0 mon avis, la position adopt\u00e9e par Postes Canada \u00e9tait raisonnable. Elle ne rendait pas injuste l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019aptitude de M. Day. Ce dernier connaissait la position de l\u2019entreprise relativement \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 travailler de nuit. Il savait \u00e9galement que, depuis l\u2019automne 2001, Postes Canada avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019accepter les notes m\u00e9dicales provenant d\u2019un carnet d\u2019ordonnances pour l\u2019exempter des quarts de nuit. Le fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de fournir plus de renseignements de la part de son m\u00e9decin quant \u00e0 son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de nuit t\u00e9moigne, \u00e0 mon avis, du fait que son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 ce moment croyait qu\u2019il pouvait travailler de nuit, ind\u00e9pendamment de la note \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire qu\u2019il a produite.\n[122] Je conviens avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e que, si la note dat\u00e9e du 10 avril du Dr Cook avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 Medisys, le Dr Hamm aurait probablement communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Cook et aurait appris que ce dernier s\u2019\u00e9tait senti press\u00e9 par M. Day de fournir la note. En fait, le Dr Hamm a bel et bien communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Cook, le 25 avril 2002, pour discuter de la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e0 travailler de nuit. Selon le Dr Hamm, le Dr Cook lui a dit que M. Day \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 travailler de nuit. Le Dr Hamm a fait part de ce renseignement \u00e0 Postes Canada.\n[123] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 25 avril 2002, M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu trois jours sans salaire pour absence non justifi\u00e9e. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve m\u00e9dicale dont disposait Postes Canada au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day \u00e0 travailler de nuit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, j\u2019estime que la mesure disciplinaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable \u00e0 la preuve prima facie soumise par M. Day. Une preuve m\u00e9dicale solide \u00e9tablissait que M. Day \u00e9tait capable de travailler de nuit en avril 2002. Les trois jours de suspension n\u2019\u00e9taient attribuables qu\u2019au refus de M. Day de travailler de nuit, et non \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\nii) Si M. Day avait besoin d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement, Postes Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des offres raisonnables d\u2019accommodement\n[124] Cependant, s\u2019il subsiste un doute quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day de travailler de nuit, je suis convaincu que Postes Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day des offres raisonnables d\u2019accommodement.\n[125] La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les accommodements sont une responsabilit\u00e9 relevant de plusieurs parties. Le plaignant doit faire sa part pour faciliter le processus d\u2019accommodement. Quand un employeur est \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une proposition qui est raisonnable et qui, si elle \u00e9tait mise en \u0153uvre, satisferait \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, le plaignant a l\u2019obligation d\u2019accepter cette proposition (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, aux paragraphes 43 et 44).\n[126] Le 22 avril 2002, M. Ormerod a offert trois options \u00e0 M. Day. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait de lui permettre de prendre un cong\u00e9 sans solde ou un cong\u00e9 annuel pour la dur\u00e9e de son bloc de quarts de nuit, mais sans la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler pendant une partie d\u2019un cycle et de prendre cong\u00e9 pour le reste. Les deux autres options auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 de permettre \u00e0 M. Day de travailler de nuit selon le quart r\u00e9gulier ou de travailler selon des heures modifi\u00e9es, de 18 h \u00e0 2 h, \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019il ait obtenu un rendez\u2011vous avec un psychiatre avant 15 h le 26 avril 2002.\n[127] M. Day a refus\u00e9 toutes les options pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Postes Canada. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le quart de 18 h \u00e0 2 h ne constituait pas une proposition raisonnable, car l\u2019offre \u00e9tait conditionnelle \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il obtienne un rendez\u2011vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste avant le 26 avril 2002. Selon M. Day, c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la p\u00e9nurie de m\u00e9decins sp\u00e9cialistes en sant\u00e9 mentale \u00e0 Victoria. Dans un esprit de collaboration, M. Day aurait tr\u00e8s bien pu faire l\u2019effort d\u2019obtenir un rendez\u2011vous et ensuite informer Postes Canada s\u2019il ne pouvait respecter l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. M. Ormerod a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019un effort semblable pour obtenir un rendez\u2011vous en avril aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 acceptable. \u00c0 la place, M. Day n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir de rendez\u2011vous avec un psychiatre avant la mi\u2011mai, ce qui \u00e9tait bien apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance.\n[128] M. Day a soutenu que la suggestion formul\u00e9e par son m\u00e9decin le 25 avril 2002 de se rendre \u00e0 un centre du sommeil \u00e0 Vancouver constituait un effort pour coop\u00e9rer avec les tentatives d\u2019accommodement de Postes Canada. Selon M. Day, le refus qu\u2019a oppos\u00e9 Postes Canada \u00e0 cette suggestion montre un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, sans qu\u2019elles ne constituent des contraintes excessives.\n[129] Le Dr Hamm a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pench\u00e9 sur la suggestion de consulter un centre du sommeil et l\u2019avait finalement rejet\u00e9e, car aucun des nombreux m\u00e9decins de M. Day n\u2019avait jamais diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez lui un trouble du sommeil primaire. Ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 dormir constituaient plut\u00f4t un sympt\u00f4me de sa d\u00e9pression chronique. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Dr Hamm a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que rien ne justifiait de d\u00e9penser du temps et de l\u2019argent sur la question de savoir si M. Day souffrait ou non d\u2019un trouble du sommeil. Compte tenu de la preuve, je conviens qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une option raisonnable.\n[130] M. Day a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Dr Cook lui avait conseill\u00e9 de ne pas travailler selon un quart de 18 h \u00e0 2 h, car cela mettrait sa sant\u00e9 en danger. Cependant, le Dr Cook n\u2019a pas corrobor\u00e9 cette affirmation. Le Dr Cook a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant que Postes Canada avait offert \u00e0 M. Day un quart de travail modifi\u00e9. Si M. Day le lui avait demand\u00e9, il lui aurait conseiller de l\u2019essayer. M. Day a essay\u00e9 une fois le quart modifi\u00e9 et l\u2019a rejet\u00e9.\n[131] Ces faits ressemblent \u00e0 ceux dans Jeffrey c. Dofasco Inc. (No. 4) 2004 HRTO 5; conf. par 2007 CanLII 41275 (ON S.C.D.C). Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario a conclu que la plaignante, qui souffrait de douleurs myo\u2011fasciales et avait certains sympt\u00f4mes de fibromyalgie, aurait pu tenter d\u2019obtenir un poste de standardiste. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que, bien qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt pu ressentir certaines douleurs pendant qu\u2019elle testait le poste de standardiste, elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en danger en effectuant ce travail. Ses douleurs chroniques ne la handicapaient pas au point de l\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019essayer l\u2019emploi. Elle n\u2019a pas essay\u00e9 l\u2019emploi non pas parce qu\u2019elle en \u00e9tait incapable, mais parce qu\u2019elle avait choisi de ne pas le faire. Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune raison m\u00e9dicale de ne pas avoir essay\u00e9 le poste de standardiste.\n[132] Je crois que les faits dans Jeffrey sont analogues \u00e0 ceux en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Aucune raison de sant\u00e9 n\u2019explique pourquoi M. Day n\u2019aurait pas pu essayer le quart de 18 h \u00e0 2 h plus que l\u2019unique fois o\u00f9 il l\u2019a fait. En effet, M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il travaillait en apr\u00e8s\u2011midi de 15 h \u00e0 23 h, il lui arrivait souvent de travailler en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires jusqu\u2019\u00e0 1 h ou 2 h. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait toutefois s\u2019adapter au quart d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime que le quart de travail de 18 h \u00e0 2 h constituait une offre raisonnable d\u2019accommodement. Je reconnais que l\u2019offre \u00e9tait conditionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019un rendez\u2011vous avec un psychiatre, mais aucune raison ne justifie que M. Day ait attendu la mi\u2011mai avant de faire des efforts en ce sens.\n[133] Finalement, le quart de 18 h \u00e0 2 h n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule option pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Postes Canada \u00e0 M. Day. S\u2019il ne croyait pas \u00eatre en mesure de travailler de 18 h \u00e0 2 h, il aurait pu choisir le cong\u00e9 sans solde ou le cong\u00e9 annuel pour les douze semaines du quart de nuit. Ainsi, il aurait eu amplement le temps d\u2019obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux d\u2019un sp\u00e9cialiste avant d\u2019avoir \u00e0 travailler de nuit \u00e0 nouveau. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait \u00e9galement d\u2019une proposition raisonnable d\u2019accommodement. M. Day n\u2019a accept\u00e9 ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre de ces options. Il ressortait clairement de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019accepterait aucune autre proposition que l\u2019exemption permanente du travail de nuit.\n[134] L\u2019avocat de M. Day a avanc\u00e9 que la personnalit\u00e9 obsessionnelle\u2011compulsive de M. Day a pu \u00eatre un facteur dans son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre favorablement aux efforts de Postes Canada pour offrir des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu que, pour cette raison, Postes Canada aurait d\u00fb prendre la mesure d\u2019accommodement consistant \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 M. Day ce qu\u2019il voulait : le quart de jour. Cependant, Postes Canada ne savait rien de la personnalit\u00e9 obsessionnelle\u2011compulsive de M. Day. Le Dr Hamm a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019avoir fourni aucun renseignement \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 Postes Canada, car il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience, le trouble de M. Day ne limitait pas sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler. Le propre psychiatre de M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le jugement et la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re responsable au travail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas affect\u00e9s par cette maladie.\n[135] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun fondement \u00e0 l\u2019argument selon lequel la personnalit\u00e9 obsessionnelle\u2011compulsive de M. Day l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant raisonnables les offres d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Postes Canada. Au contraire, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Day d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 les offres parce qu\u2019il croyait avoir juridiquement le droit d\u2019\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 en permanence de l\u2019obligation de travailler de nuit. Toutefois, le droit \u00e9tablit clairement qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019attendre la solution parfaite (arr\u00eat Renaud, \u00e0 la p. 995). M. Day avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019accepter une des propositions raisonnables avanc\u00e9es par Postes Canada, m\u00eame si elles ne correspondaient pas exactement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il recherchait. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, m\u00eame s\u2019il subsistait un doute quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Day de travailler de nuit, Postes Canada s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement envers M. Day.\n(vi) \u00c9tait-il discriminatoire de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day chez Postes Canada en mai 2002? La preuve prima facie\n[136] M. Day ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail pour le quart de nuit apr\u00e8s la fin de sa suspension de trois jours, il a plut\u00f4t pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie le 1er mai 2002. Il a consult\u00e9 le Dr Cook le 2 mai 2002, lequel lui a dit qu\u2019il t\u00e9l\u00e9phonerait au Dr Hamm plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00e9crire une note.\n[137] M. Day a re\u00e7u un pr\u00e9avis de 24 heures le convoquant \u00e0 une entrevue pour expliquer son absence du 1er mai 2002. L\u2019entrevue devait avoir lieu le 2 mai 2002. M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail ni \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait malade. Il en a inform\u00e9 Postes Canada le 2 mai 2002.\n[138] Le 14 mai 2002, M. Day a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Rob Taylor, le directeur des op\u00e9rations postales, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 voir son m\u00e9decin, que des ajustements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 sa m\u00e9dication et qu\u2019il attendait d\u2019\u00eatre dirig\u00e9 vers un psychiatre. M. Day a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son m\u00e9decin remplissait les formulaires d\u2019assurance\u2011invalidit\u00e9 et que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait en train d\u2019envoyer les documents \u00e0 M. Taylor.\n[139] Le 22 mai 2002, M. Day a re\u00e7u une lettre de M. Ormerod faisant savoir que, parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail et n\u2019avait pas expliqu\u00e9 son absence de fa\u00e7on acceptable, il recommandait que Postes Canada renvoie M. Day.\n[140] Le 27 mai 2002, M. Taylor a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day chez Postes Canada parce que celui\u2011ci ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas expliqu\u00e9 son absence de fa\u00e7on acceptable.\n[141] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu. M. Day a fait savoir \u00e0 Postes Canada qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Tout en sachant cela, Postes Canada a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day. Pour cette raison, j\u2019estime que M. Day a \u00e9tabli prima facie que Postes Canada a refus\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[142] Postes Canada a soutenu que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le cong\u00e9diement. Postes Canada a plut\u00f4t mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Day parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son quart de travail et parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fourni de preuve m\u00e9dicale attestant sa maladie.\n[143] La preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9taye l\u2019explication de Postes Canada. M. Day ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail comme il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu le 1er mai 2002. Il a vu le Dr Cook le 2 mai 2002 et a demand\u00e9 une note justifiant son absence au travail. Le Dr Cook a refus\u00e9 de fournir cette note.\n[144] Le Dr Cook a plut\u00f4t parl\u00e9 directement au Dr Hamm par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone le 7 mai 2002. Dans la note consign\u00e9e au dossier au sujet de cette conversation, le Dr Hamm a \u00e9crit que le Dr Cook l\u2019avait inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait augment\u00e9 la dose de m\u00e9dicament de M. Day. Il affirme que le Dr Cook se demandait si ce dernier devait \u00eatre mis en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme. Le Dr Hamm a conclu sa note en disant : [traduction] Je crois qu\u2019il sera en faveur de mettre M. Day en cong\u00e9 en raison de son diagnostic psychiatrique.\n[145] Le Dr Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, en fait, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en faveur d\u2019une absence pour M. Day. Pour cette raison, il n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de note ou de renseignement \u00e0 cet effet. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sans \u00e9quivoque, tant en interrogatoire principal qu\u2019en contre\u2011interrogatoire, qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que M. Day souffrait d\u2019un trouble psychiatrique n\u00e9cessitant qu\u2019il s\u2019absente du travail; il croyait que M. Day avait besoin de l\u2019aide d\u2019un conseiller ou d\u2019un m\u00e9diateur pour r\u00e9gler ses conflits au travail. Il n\u2019a jamais recommand\u00e9 que M. Day s\u2019absente et il n\u2019a pas appuy\u00e9 sa demande de cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 prolong\u00e9.\n[146] Le Dr Cook a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, au cours de sa conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le Dr Hamm le 7 mai 2002, le Dr Hamm et lui ont discut\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9es pouvant aider M. Day \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ses probl\u00e8mes non r\u00e9solus au travail. Le Dr Cook a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une des id\u00e9es dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question avec le Dr Hamm \u00e9tait de mettre M. Day en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 prolong\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que ce serait une bonne id\u00e9e. Il l\u2019a tout de m\u00eame prise en consid\u00e9ration parce qu\u2019il ressentait une certaine sympathie pour M. Day et parce que c\u2019est ce que M. Day semblait vouloir. Le Dr Cook a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait augment\u00e9 la dose de m\u00e9dicament de M. Day pour lui venir en aide. Par contre, il ne croyait pas que l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Day avait chang\u00e9 entre le moment o\u00f9 il l\u2019avait vu pour la premi\u00e8re fois, en janvier 2002, et le 29 mai 2002, date de sa derni\u00e8re visite. Pour cette raison, il a refus\u00e9 de fournir \u00e0 M. Day la preuve m\u00e9dicale qu\u2019il voulait pour justifier son absence.\n[147] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Postes Canada a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie de M. Day. Aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale ne soutient la d\u00e9claration de M. Day selon laquelle il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler le 1er mai 2002 en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Le cong\u00e9diement n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day, mais sur son refus de se pr\u00e9senter au travail ou de fournir une explication acceptable justifiant son absence.\n[148] M. Day a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief relativement \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement en mai 2002. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement survenue \u00e0 la suite du grief, il est retourn\u00e9 au travail en mai 2003.\n(vii) Postes Canada a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire en supprimant le poste d\u2019EL5 de M. Day? La preuve prima facie\n[149] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2004, Postes Canada a inform\u00e9 M. Day que deux des quatre postes d\u2019EL5 des Services techniques au Centre de Glanford seraient \u00e9limin\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019article 53 de la convention collective. Un examen de l\u2019effectif avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de travail au Centre de Glanford pour justifier le nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s au sein des Services techniques. L\u2019article 53 de la convention collective entre le STTP et Postes Canada pr\u00e9voit que les postes pour lesquels il n\u2019y a pas assez de travail peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires et \u00e9limin\u00e9s. M. Day et Eric Walry avaient le moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 parmi les quatre EL5. En cons\u00e9quence, en vertu de l\u2019article 53, leur poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9.\n[150] Eric Walry a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste d\u2019EL5 en Ontario. M. Day, quant \u00e0 lui, ne voulait pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nager de Victoria. Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective, sa seule possibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019accepter un poste de PO4 au Centre de Glanford. Bien qu\u2019il ait conserv\u00e9 son salaire d\u2019EL5, il s\u2019est senti diminu\u00e9 et frustr\u00e9 par cette nouvelle affectation puisque, en tant que trieur de courrier, il n\u2019aurait pas l\u2019occasion d\u2019utiliser ses comp\u00e9tences de technicien. Il a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019\u00e9limination de son poste en 2004 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 orchestr\u00e9e par Postes Canada dans le but de le chasser parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait handicap\u00e9.\n[151] M. Day fonde son all\u00e9gation sur une lettre dat\u00e9e du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2003 \u00e9crite par Steve Clark \u00e0 Joanne Purser, la directrice des op\u00e9rations postales de l\u2019\u00e9poque. Dans cette lettre, M. Clark faisait savoir qu\u2019il craignait que le fait de d\u00e9clarer les postes exc\u00e9dentaires \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une mani\u00e8re de chasser du service Tim Day, [traduction] un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 probl\u00e8mes qui \u00e9tait handicap\u00e9. M. Clark a plaid\u00e9 pour que ne soient pas \u00e9limin\u00e9s les postes d\u2019EL5 (y compris celui de M. Day) parce que cela pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme de la mauvais foi de la part de Postes Canada envers M. Day.\n[152] Je conclus que M. Day a prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. La lettre de M. Clark laisse entendre que le poste de M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 dans le but de le chasser des services techniques parce que sa d\u00e9ficience \u00e9tait source de [Traduction] probl\u00e8mes pour Postes Canada. Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve montre qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[153] L\u2019intim\u00e9e m\u2019a convaincu que les craintes de M. Clark ne d\u00e9coulaient pas du processus \u00e0 la suite duquel des postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires. L\u2019\u00e9limination du poste de M. Day n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec sa d\u00e9ficience. Je tire cette conclusion \u00e0 partir des conclusions de fait suivantes.\n[154] En 2002 et au d\u00e9but 2003, la direction de Postes Canada dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver et de Victoria a re\u00e7u un avis d\u2019Ottawa faisant savoir qu\u2019il y avait trop d\u2019employ\u00e9s au Centre de Victoria. Une \u00e9tude avait \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e et concluait que les Services techniques de Victoria avaient de quatre \u00e0 six postes en trop. La direction \u00e0 Victoria a eu la t\u00e2che d\u2019\u00e9laborer une strat\u00e9gie pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019exc\u00e9dent de personnel.\n[155] Mme Purser, la directrice des op\u00e9rations postales \u00e0 Victoria, a consult\u00e9 un certain nombre de personnes au Centre de Glanford afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la meilleure fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. Parmi les personnes consult\u00e9es par Mme Purser se trouvaient M. Ormerod et M. Clark.\n[156] M. Ormerod a avou\u00e9 franchement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en faveur de l\u2019\u00e9limination de postes d\u2019EL5, car il estimait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un moyen de se d\u00e9barrasser d\u2019un employ\u00e9 difficile, Tim Day. Cependant, quand on le lui a demand\u00e9, il a essay\u00e9 d\u2019en faire abstraction et de prendre en consid\u00e9ration uniquement ce qu\u2019il y avait de mieux pour le Centre, plut\u00f4t que de laisser ses sentiments envers M. Day influencer sa r\u00e9flexion. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun autre Centre n\u2019avait quatre EL5, que Victoria avait un surplus d\u2019EL5. Il y avait du nouvel \u00e9quipement plus facile \u00e0 entretenir, de sorte que c\u2019\u00e9tait logique de recommander que deux postes d\u2019EL5 soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires.\n[157] Steve Clark n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec M. Ormerod. Il recommandait que deux postes de MAM11 soient \u00e9limin\u00e9s. Mme Purser \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec M. Clark. Elle a recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 Tom Dixon, le directeur pour la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver et du nord de la Colombie\u2011Britannique (qui comprend Victoria), que deux postes de MAM11 soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires.\n[158] M. Dixon a re\u00e7u une lettre des travailleurs des services techniques de Victoria qui s\u2019objectaient \u00e0 ce que les postes soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exc\u00e9dentaires. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suspendre le processus jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019un examen plus approfondi de l\u2019effectif puisse \u00eatre men\u00e9, car il voulait \u00eatre s\u00fbr que la bonne d\u00e9cision soit prise.\n[159] Tom Dixon a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019administration centrale entreprenne un examen ou une v\u00e9rification de l\u2019effectif au Centre de traitement du courrier de Victoria. En juillet 2004, deux personnes de l\u2019administration centrale de Postes Canada sont venues pour effectuer cette v\u00e9rification. Les v\u00e9rificateurs ont inscrit dans leur rapport que, selon eux, le Centre de Victoria comptait deux postes en trop aux Services techniques du Centre de traitement du courrier de Glanford.\n[160] Quand il a re\u00e7u les r\u00e9sultats de la v\u00e9rification, M. Dixon a consult\u00e9 M. Sarbjit Sangha, le directeur des Services techniques pour Vancouver et Victoria. M. Sangha a affirm\u00e9 que le Centre de Vancouver, beaucoup plus gros, traitant un plus gros volume de courrier et ayant plus de machinerie, ne comptait que deux EL5 alors que le Centre de Victoria en comptait quatre. Il a estim\u00e9 que cela n\u2019avait aucun sens. Il a donn\u00e9 son opinion aux v\u00e9rificateurs apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9bauche du rapport de v\u00e9rification.\n[161] M. Sangha a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sans \u00e9quivoque que Tim Day n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans sa recommandation de supprimer deux postes d\u2019EL5 \u00e0 Victoria. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas qui \u00e9tait M. Day quand il a donn\u00e9 son avis. Rien ne prouve qu\u2019il a vu la lettre de M. Clark \u00e0 Mme Purser. Son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 en contre\u2011interrogatoire.\n[162] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport de v\u00e9rification et les recommandations de M. Sangha, M. Dixon a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9liminer deux postes d\u2019EL5. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec M. Day, qu\u2019elle faisait suite aux r\u00e9sultats de la v\u00e9rification et \u00e0 l\u2019avis de M. Sangha selon lequel il y avait deux postes d\u2019EL5 en trop \u00e0 Victoria. Il ne se rappelle pas avoir jamais vu la lettre envoy\u00e9e par M. Clark \u00e0 Mme Purser au sujet de M. Day.\n[163] M. Dixon n\u2019a pas discut\u00e9 avec M. Ormerod de sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019\u00e9liminer les postes d\u2019EL5. M. Ormerod a quitt\u00e9 les Services techniques en 2003. Son avis concernant la question de l\u2019effectif n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut fait part de son opinion \u00e0 Mme Purser en 2002.\n[164] Les personnes qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour Postes Canada \u00e0 propos de cette question \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles et ne se contredisaient pas. J\u2019accepte l\u2019explication selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision d\u2019\u00e9liminer les postes d\u2019EL5 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le but de chasser M. Day des Services techniques en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Postes Canada a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie de discrimination relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente all\u00e9gation en montrant que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day.\n(viii) \u00c9tait\u2011il discriminatoire de supprimer le poste de MAM11? La preuve prima facie\n[165] M. Day a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au poste de PO4, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste de m\u00e9canicien, le poste de MAM11 B\u20112. Il savait que ce poste serait disponible puisque son titulaire prenait sa retraite.\n[166] Le 4 avril 2005, Mme Andrew, la repr\u00e9sentante syndicale, a demand\u00e9 que le poste vacant de MAM11 B\u20112 soit attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Day. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Day \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Le m\u00e9decin de celui\u2011ci souhaitait que, \u00e0 son retour au travail, il ait un poste [traduction] moins stressant que celui d\u2019EL5. Le poste de MAM11 r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re.\n[167] Mme Andrew a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, normalement, Postes Canada discutait avec le syndicat avant de supprimer un poste. Cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Plut\u00f4t, le m\u00eame jour o\u00f9 la candidature pour le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, le syndicat a re\u00e7u une note faisant savoir que le poste de MAM11 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9.\n[168] M. Day a soutenu que le poste de MAM11 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que sa candidature ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, dans le but de couper court \u00e0 sa tentative de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer les Services techniques. Le motif aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience et le refus des Services techniques de reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il avait besoin que des mesures d\u2019accommodement soient prises en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[169] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Day \u00e9taye son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Sangha a supprim\u00e9 le poste de MAM11 apr\u00e8s que M. Day eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa candidature. M. Sangha savait, par la lettre de Mme Andrew, que M. Day \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie et d\u00e9posait sa candidature pour le poste afin de diminuer le stress li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa r\u00e9int\u00e9gration au travail. La fa\u00e7on dont le processus s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 laisse croire que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de supprimer le poste de MAM11. M. Day a donc r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[170] M. Sangha a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019automne 2004 ou au d\u00e9but de l\u2019hiver 2005 de supprimer le poste de MAM11 quand son titulaire prendrait sa retraite en mars 2005. C\u2019\u00e9tait bien avant que M. Day d\u00e9pose sa candidature pour le poste. Cependant, il a oubli\u00e9 d\u2019informer le syndicat de sa d\u00e9cision par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019est senti mal quand il a re\u00e7u la lettre de Mme Andrew en avril 2005, car il s\u2019est alors rendu compte qu\u2019il avait omis d\u2019informer le syndicat de sa d\u00e9cision prise plus t\u00f4t.\n[171] Il a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019administration centrale \u00e0 Ottawa avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remplacer une vieille machine \u00e0 Victoria par une machine n\u00e9cessitant moins d\u2019entretien. En cons\u00e9quence, le travail \u00e0 faire ne suffisait plus \u00e0 occuper les quatorze employ\u00e9s des Services techniques de Victoria. Le syndicat a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le nombre de m\u00e9caniciens au sein du personnel du Centre de traitement du courrier \u00e0 Victoria serait r\u00e9duit parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus suffisamment de travail pour quatorze employ\u00e9s. Pour cette raison, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de supprimer le poste de MAM11.\n[172] M. Sangha \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Il a reconnu franchement l\u2019erreur qu\u2019il a commise en oubliant d\u2019informer le syndicat de sa d\u00e9cision de supprimer le poste de MAM11. Son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 en contre\u2011interrogatoire. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas produit de confirmation \u00e9crite de sa d\u00e9cision de supprimer le poste avant que M. Day ne d\u00e9pose sa candidature, son t\u00e9moignage me convainc n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun lien entre la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day et la d\u00e9cision de supprimer le poste de MAM11.\n[173] Je conclus donc que Postes Canada a prouv\u00e9 que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019\u00e9limination du poste de MAM11.\n[174] M. Day a soutenu, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que m\u00eame si sa d\u00e9ficience n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019\u00e9limination du poste, le refus par Postes Canada de maintenir le poste pour lui constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable. Cela le privait d\u2019une occasion de reprendre un poste qui aurait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[175] \u00c0 supposer que M. Day ait \u00e9tabli prima facie que l\u2019\u00e9limination du poste a eu un effet discriminatoire sur lui, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019obligation pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi ne va pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 exiger que soit maintenu ou cr\u00e9\u00e9 un poste pour lequel il n\u2019y a pas de travail \u00e0 faire. Au contraire, l\u2019obligation consiste \u00e0 mettre en place des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour permettre aux employ\u00e9s d\u2019effectuer un travail productif. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de travail pour justifier le maintien du poste de MAM11. Postes Canada n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de maintenir le poste pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Day.\n(ix) \u00c9tait-il discriminatoire d\u2019affecter M. Day \u00e0 un poste de facteur de rel\u00e8ve? La preuve prima facie\n[176] En mai 2006, M. Day a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa soumission pour un poste de facteur \u00e0 Victoria. Il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir et le poste et l\u2019itin\u00e9raire qu\u2019il voulait. Apr\u00e8s que sa soumission eut \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, il y a eu une r\u00e9organisation des itin\u00e9raires des facteurs. Les nouveaux itin\u00e9raires devaient \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s par un processus de soumissions. M. Day a pr\u00e9tendu que la personne responsable du processus de soumissions ne l\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 et n\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 le syndicat pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il puisse d\u00e9poser sa soumission pour un nouvel itin\u00e9raire. En cons\u00e9quence, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au poste de facteur de rel\u00e8ve. Ce poste est le moins aim\u00e9, car il n\u00e9cessite des changements fr\u00e9quents d\u2019itin\u00e9raire.\n[177] \u00c0 partir du t\u00e9moignage de M. Day, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que la pr\u00e9tendue omission d\u2019informer M. Day du processus de soumissions pour les nouveaux itin\u00e9raires pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie constituait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\nL\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[178] Selon M. Clark, M. Day a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre inform\u00e9 par son syndicat du processus de soumissions applicable \u00e0 la r\u00e9organisation des itin\u00e9raires. L\u2019arrangement \u00e0 ce moment \u00e9tait que toutes les communications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Day devaient passer par le syndicat. M. Clark a affirm\u00e9 que Barry Barter, qui \u00e9tait responsable de la r\u00e9organisation des itin\u00e9raires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, lui a dit qu\u2019il avait inform\u00e9 le syndicat du processus. M. Clark ne savait pas si le syndicat avait transmis les renseignements \u00e0 M. Day.\n[179] M. Patterson, le secr\u00e9taire\u2011tr\u00e9sorier de la section de Victoria du STTP \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, est le seul d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Il n\u2019a pu confirmer si le syndicat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 ou non du processus de soumissions pour la r\u00e9organisation des itin\u00e9raires.\n[180] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Clark selon lequel le syndicat a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du processus de soumissions pour la r\u00e9organisation. Il n\u2019est pas clair si le syndicat a inform\u00e9 ou non M. Day du processus. Cependant, je conviens que Postes Canada a fait ce qu\u2019elle devait faire en fournissant les renseignements pour que M. Day puisse poser sa soumission.\n[181] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que Postes Canada a fourni une explication raisonnable qui r\u00e9fute l\u2019all\u00e9gation de M. Day selon laquelle son affectation au poste de rel\u00e8ve \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n(x) M. Day a\u2011t\u2011il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience? [182] M. Day a soutenu que l\u2019ensemble des actes de Postes Canada en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce constitue du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) dispose que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu.\n[183] Le harc\u00e8lement dans le cadre de plaintes fond\u00e9es sur la d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini comme une conduite se manifestant par des paroles, des actes ou des gestes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, \u00e0 caract\u00e8re vexatoires, m\u00e9prisants ou insultants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une personne en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience (Bergeron c. T\u00e9l\u00e9bec Lt\u00e9e., 2004 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 260; conf. par 2005 CF 879). La gravit\u00e9 d\u2019un comportement pr\u00e9tendu harcelant doit \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e selon la perspective de la victime raisonnable (Dhanjal c. Air Canada (1996), 28 C.H.R.R. 367, aux paragraphes 216 et 217, conf. par [1997] A.C.F. no 1599).\n[184] La jurisprudence sur le harc\u00e8lement est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que la conduite \u00e0 l\u2019examen est, par sa nature, \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes et aux objectifs \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019employeur. Les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes ou les remises en question constantes et inutiles de la d\u00e9ficience qui sont humiliantes et vexatoires sont des exemples de conduites jug\u00e9es \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes dans un milieu de travail.\n[185] La jurisprudence fait \u00e9galement savoir que le harc\u00e8lement n\u00e9cessite habituellement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, bien que dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident puisse suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail hostile. Plus la conduite et ses cons\u00e9quences sont graves, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est n\u00e9cessaire. Inversement, moins la conduite est grave, plus il faudra d\u00e9montrer son caract\u00e8re persistent (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes) (re Franke), [1999] 3 C.F. 653 (1re inst.), aux paragraphes 43 et 45).\n[186] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la conduite reproch\u00e9e n\u2019a pas un aspect vexatoire ou humiliant \u00e9tranger aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes de Postes Canada. Au contraire, les actes de Postes Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans le cadre de la gestion des op\u00e9rations postales au Centre de Glanford. En outre, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019expulsion de M. Day de son lieu de travail en novembre 2001, j\u2019ai conclu que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Day n\u2019avait pas jou\u00e9 de r\u00f4le dans les actes commis par Postes Canada.\n[187] Je ne crois pas qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 handicap\u00e9 raisonnable consid\u00e9rerait que l\u2019expulsion de M. Day de son lieu de travail en novembre 2001, \u00e0 elle seule, constituait du harc\u00e8lement. Cet acte manquait de respect et de sensibilit\u00e9 envers M. Day en tant que personne handicap\u00e9e. Cependant, il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une conduite r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e et humiliante \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes de Postes Canada.\n[188] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de M. Day selon laquelle Postes Canada l\u2019a harcel\u00e9 en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience est sans fondement.\nIV. Quelle est le redressement appropri\u00e9? [189] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance contre une personne coupable d\u2019avoir commis un acte discriminatoire. J\u2019estime que Postes Canada a commis un acte discriminatoire quand elle a mis M. Day en cong\u00e9 de maladie et quand elle l\u2019a expuls\u00e9 du lieu de travail en novembre 2001.\nA. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [190] M. Day a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi par suite de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de Postes Canada. Le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e).\n[191] M. Day a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le fait de ne pas savoir pourquoi il \u00e9tait mis en cong\u00e9 de maladie lui a caus\u00e9 beaucoup d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de stress. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 humili\u00e9 quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 escort\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la sortie du Centre le 21 novembre 2001. Ces vexations r\u00e9sultent de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis par Postes Canada, qui n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 M. Day avec \u00e9quit\u00e9 dans le processus de prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement en novembre 2001.\n[192] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime qu\u2019une indemnisation de 6 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral est appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada de payer ce montant \u00e0 M. Day.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 pour conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [193] M. Day a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi. Cette disposition permet au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[194] J\u2019estime que, lorsqu\u2019elle a mis M. Day en cong\u00e9 de maladie et l\u2019a expuls\u00e9 du Centre en novembre 2001, Postes Canada a commis un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Postes Canada et Medisys savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir que les renseignements contenus dans le rapport du Dr Miller \u00e9taient extr\u00eamement importants et qu\u2019ils auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement au m\u00e9decin de M. Day. Elles savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir que M. Day tentait d\u2019obtenir ces renseignements. Finalement, si Postes Canada ou Medisys \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que M. Day \u00e9tait malade au point de constituer un risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ces renseignements auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s au m\u00e9decin de M. Day. L\u2019omission de ce faire d\u00e9montre un manque de respect injustifi\u00e9 envers les besoins de M. Day en tant que personne handicap\u00e9e. Dans les circonstances, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 000 $ en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\nC. Int\u00e9r\u00eats [195] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats s\u2019appliquent sur toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, en vertu du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle), conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles du proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats commencent \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Cependant, en aucun cas la somme totale payable en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne doit exc\u00e9der 20 000 $. De m\u00eame, la somme totale payable en vertu du paragraphe 53(3), y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ne peut exc\u00e9der 20 000 $.\nD. Frais juridiques [196] Dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a conclu que le poids de son autorit\u00e9 judiciaire \u00e9taye le pouvoir que conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi au Tribunal d\u2019adjuger des frais juridiques raisonnables (Mowat c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 49, au paragraphe 27). Je conviens que le Tribunal a le pouvoir en vertu de la Loi d\u2019adjuger des frais juridiques raisonnables.\n[197] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Postes Canada d\u2019indemniser M. Day pour les frais raisonnablement engag\u00e9s pour avoir retenu les services d\u2019un avocat avant et pendant l\u2019audience.\n[198] J\u2019encourage les parties \u00e0 conclure une entente quant au montant des d\u00e9pens raisonnables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je me r\u00e9serve comp\u00e9tence sur cet aspect de l\u2019adjudication au cas o\u00f9 les partie seraient incapables d\u2019en venir \u00e0 une entente. Les parties doivent informer le Tribunal dans les 60 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision si aucune entente n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

Jensen 2007 TCDP 44 2007\/10\/23\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\n[1] Raymond Thwaites travaille comme pilote chez Air Canada. En vertu du r\u00e9gime de retraite des pilotes de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, M. Thwaites et six autres pilotes doivent prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[2] Ceux-ci ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans lesquelles ils pr\u00e9tendent qu'ils sont victimes de discrimination de la part d'Air Canada et de l'Association des pilotes d'Air Canada (APAC) en raison de leur \u00e2ge, et ce, en violation des articles 7, 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les plaintes portent sur la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 60 ans chez Air Canada.\n[3] Le 1er octobre 2007, la Fly Past 60 Coalition (la Coalition) a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre constitu\u00e9e partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans le cadre des plaintes susmentionn\u00e9es. La Coalition est un groupe de personnes qui d\u00e9noncent la r\u00e8gle de la retraite obligatoire en vigueur chez Air Canada. Ces personnes travaillent actuellement comme pilotes chez Air Canada ou elles ont r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9es de prendre leur retraite en vertu de la r\u00e8gle relative \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la retraite. Les plaignants sont tous membres de la Coalition.\n[4] La Coalition demande \u00e0 \u00eatre constitu\u00e9e partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e pour les raisons suivantes :\nles int\u00e9r\u00eats des membres de la Coalition seront directement touch\u00e9s par l'issu des plaintes susmentionn\u00e9es; l'APAC ne repr\u00e9sente pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats des plaignants ou des membres de la Coalition dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Elle est plut\u00f4t intim\u00e9e dans le dossier des plaintes; la Coalition aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une d\u00e9cision juste et ad\u00e9quate quant aux affaires dont il est saisi en pr\u00e9sentant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations \u00e0 l'appui des plaintes; la Coalition est compos\u00e9e de membres qui ont directement particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la gestion et aux affaires des op\u00e9rations a\u00e9riennes d'Air Canada et de l'APAC, et ce, aux \u00e9chelons les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s; le coordonateur de la Coalition, M. Raymond Hall, conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien le droit relatif aux droits de la personne car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 membre de la Commission des droits de la personne du Manitoba de 1991 \u00e0 1993; la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne participe pas \u00e0 l'instance et, par cons\u00e9quent, la participation de la Coalition est n\u00e9cessaire afin de corriger le d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre \u00e9conomique qui existe entre les plaignants et les intim\u00e9es.\n[5] Les intim\u00e9es s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent contre la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne participera pas \u00e0 l'audition des plaintes par le Tribunal.\n[6] L'article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. C'est au demandeur qu'il incombe de d\u00e9montrer en quoi son expertise aidera \u00e0 trancher les questions en litige. Le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne sera pas accord\u00e9 s'il ne contribue pas de fa\u00e7on importante aux positions juridiques des parties all\u00e9guant un point de vue semblable : Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. no 14, au paragraphe 6 (T.C.D.P.) (QL); Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2002] C.H.R.D. no 15, au paragraphe 22 (T.C.D.P.)(QL); Warman c. Lemire 2006 TCDP 8.\n[7] Rien dans la demande de la Coalition ne donne \u00e0 penser que, au cours de l'instance, elle fournira de l'aide ou de l'expertise qui ne pourrait pas \u00eatre fournie par les plaignants. En effet, la Coalition d\u00e9clare qu'elle partage les m\u00eames points de vue et qu'elle a les m\u00eames int\u00e9r\u00eats que les plaignants; elle ne veut qu'aider les plaignants.\n[8] En tant que membres de la Coalition, les plaignants peuvent avoir le droit de faire appel aux ressources de cette derni\u00e8re pour les aider dans leurs plaintes. En fait, M. Hall, le coordonnateur de la Coalition, a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il repr\u00e9sentait un certain nombre, sinon l'ensemble des plaignants dans les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes. En tant que repr\u00e9sentant d'un plaignant, M. Hall a la possibilit\u00e9 d'appeler des membres de la Coalition \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 propos des questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes et d'offrir son expertise en droit et en politiques en ce qui touche les droits de la personne au cours des observations qu'il formulera au Tribunal.\n[9] Pour ces motifs, la demande de la Coalition visant \u00e0 \u00eatre constitu\u00e9e partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nKaren A.

Introduction [1] Le plaignant, Guy Willoughby, soutient que son employeur, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (SCP), a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences, tant physiques que mentales, en contravention avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) et\/ou 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP). Il soutient que la SCP a commis des actes discriminatoires, d\u2019abord en l\u2019affectant \u00e0 un quart de travail de 3 h 30 \u00e0 11 h 30 vers le 12 mars 2002, malgr\u00e9 la directive m\u00e9dicale selon laquelle il devait travailler pendant un quart r\u00e9gulier de jour. Il ajoute que la SCP a commis un autre acte discriminatoire en refusant de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer vers le 12 avril 2002 et vers le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2003 en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences.\n[2] L\u2019audience a dur\u00e9 5 jours en mai 2007. Tant le plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des conseillers juridiques. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9.\nII. Les questions en litige [3] Les questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les suivantes :\nLe plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que la SCP a commis un acte discriminatoire en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 respecter le quart de travail de 3 h 30 \u00e0 11 h 30 qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019une des mises en garde m\u00e9dicales \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es par son m\u00e9decin portait sur le fait qu\u2019il ne devait travailler que pendant un quart de travail r\u00e9gulier de jour? Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que la SCP a commis un acte discriminatoire en refusant de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer vers le 12 avril 2002 en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences? Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que la SCP a commis un acte discriminatoire en refusant de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer vers le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2003 en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences? Si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie au sujet de la discrimination pour l\u2019une ou pour la totalit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la ou les d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9coulaient d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP? S\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019une ou plus d\u2019une des plaintes \u00e9taient bien des actes discriminatoires qui contreviennent \u00e0 la LCDP, quelles sont les mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es?\nIII. La preuve A. La preuve du plaignant [4] M. Willoughby a commenc\u00e9 son emploi au sein de la SCP en avril 1977. Il \u00e9tait livreur de service postal pendant environ 13 ans et, en 1990, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au poste de surveillant des facteurs. Il a cess\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 la SCP le 15 avril 2002.\n[5] \u00c0 l\u2019automne 1997, M. Willoughby travaillait comme surveillant des facteurs au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11 et on l\u2019a affect\u00e9 au quart de travail qui d\u00e9butait \u00e0 3 h 30 et se terminait \u00e0 11 h 30. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer son travail et il est all\u00e9 voir son m\u00e9decin pour obtenir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. Le m\u00e9decin de M. Willoughby a avis\u00e9 la SCP que son patient souffrait d\u2019une blessure aux genoux et que, pour cette raison, M. Willoughby ne devait pas marcher, se tenir debout ou soulever des choses de fa\u00e7on excessive. Le m\u00e9decin a aussi avis\u00e9 que M. Willoughby souffrait d\u2019un trouble du sommeil et qu\u2019il devait travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re pendant la journ\u00e9e et ne devait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 au quart de travail de 3 h 30.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s quelques semaines, la SCP a respect\u00e9 les restrictions m\u00e9dicales de M. Willoughby. On lui a donn\u00e9 un quart de travail de jour \u00e0 titre de surveillant d\u2019\u00e9quipe dans le Centre de r\u00e9exp\u00e9dition du courrier (CRC). Plusieurs t\u00e9moins de la SCP ont d\u00e9crit le CRC comme une unit\u00e9 de r\u00e9habilitation puisque tous les employ\u00e9s qui y travaillaient avaient des restrictions de travail permanentes et avaient besoin de mesures d\u2019accommodement. Les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 traitaient et triaient le courrier qui devait \u00eatre r\u00e9achemin\u00e9 pour les clients qui avaient envoy\u00e9 un avis de changement d\u2019adresse. Les emplois au CRC \u00e9taient principalement s\u00e9dentaires, ce qui convenait aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite. Le poste de M. Willoughby dans cette unit\u00e9 \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme permanent.\n[7] Au printemps 2000, le CRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissolu. Les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 qui n\u2019avaient pas des postes de surveillant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9s aux d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et ont poursuivi leurs t\u00e2ches dans ces d\u00e9p\u00f4ts plut\u00f4t que dans un lieu central. Comme ces employ\u00e9s relevaient des surveillants qui travaillaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, le poste de surveillant de M. Willoughby est devenu exc\u00e9dentaire.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s la dissolution du CRC, M. Willoughby a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un projet administratif pendant quelques semaines, pour lequel il travaillait de jour. \u00c0 la fin de ce projet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 au bureau de la formation, toujours pendant un quart de travail de jour. Ses t\u00e2ches au bureau de la formation consistaient \u00e0 affecter des employ\u00e9s aux postes \u00e0 doter. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les postes \u00e0 doter \u00e9taient affich\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de la SCP et tout employ\u00e9 qui souhaitait obtenir un poste particulier pr\u00e9sentait sa candidature. Les postes \u00e9taient dot\u00e9s en fonction de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et M. Willoughby avait pour t\u00e2che de doter les postes en y affectant le candidat qui avait le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[9] M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne l\u2019avait pas consult\u00e9 avant de lui donner ce poste. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il trouvait le travail difficile et qu\u2019il ne convenait ni \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience ni \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s. Il a reconnu qu\u2019il avait fait de nombreuses erreurs. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa charge de travail \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement lourde et qu\u2019il devait travailler de longues heures. M. Willoughby a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait avis\u00e9 ses sup\u00e9rieurs qu\u2019il croyait que son pi\u00e8tre rendement de travail \u00e9tait caus\u00e9 par de la dyslexie. Un grand nombre de ses erreurs d\u00e9coulait du fait qu\u2019il transposait les chiffres des dates d\u2019entr\u00e9e en fonction, dates qui d\u00e9finissaient l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. M. Willoughby n\u2019a jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un diagnostic de dyslexie, mais le trouble \u00e9tait commun chez les membres de sa famille. La dyslexie est un trouble d\u2019apprentissage qui se manifeste habituellement, chez des personnes qui ont une intelligence au moins moyenne, par des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire.\n[10] Le superviseur du bureau de la formation a rendu une \u00e9valuation n\u00e9gative au sujet du rendement de travail de M. Willoughby en avril 2001. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Willoughby de subir une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale. Il a consult\u00e9 le Dr Dodd, son m\u00e9decin de famille g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 avril 2001, le Dr Dodd a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Willoughby souffrait peut-\u00eatre de dyslexie et a recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit examin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Glenrose \u00e0 Edmonton (Alberta).\n[11] Le Dr Dodd a \u00e9crit une autre lettre \u00e0 la SCP le 19 juillet 2001. Le docteur d\u00e9clarait que M. Willoughby n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Glenrose, en partie en raison des co\u00fbts d\u2019un tel examen et en partie parce que M. Willoughby lui avait dit que ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement \u00e9taient r\u00e9solus. Il lui avait aussi expliqu\u00e9 que ces probl\u00e8mes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par le stress et la fatigue d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019apprentissage d\u2019une nouvelle fonction, et non par la dyslexie.\n[12] En juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2001, on a retir\u00e9 M. Willoughby de son poste au bureau de la formation et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste de surveillant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au quart de travail de 3 h 30 \u00e0 11 h 30, soit le quart de travail qu\u2019il avait avant que la directive m\u00e9dicale soit rendue en 1997, selon laquelle ce quart de travail ne convenait pas \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il savait que ce poste ne respectait pas ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales, il croyait que s\u2019il n\u2019acceptait pas ce poste, il perdrait son travail.\n[13] Presque imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 son retour au poste au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11, le rendement de travail de M. Willoughby est devenu tr\u00e8s faible. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les exigences physiques de son poste et que le retour au quart de travail de nuit avaient caus\u00e9 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration rapide de sa sant\u00e9, tant mentale que physique, et que par cons\u00e9quent, son rendement de travail en avait souffert. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu une r\u00e9union avec sa superviseure, Mme Sample, en janvier 2002. Mme Sample avait sollicit\u00e9 la rencontre afin de discuter de ses inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet du rendement de M. Willoughby. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait alors expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa superviseure qu\u2019il consultait un psychologue et qu\u2019il avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un diagnostic de syndrome de stress post-traumatique (SSPT). Il croyait que ce syndrome pouvait causer des probl\u00e8mes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son rendement. La SCP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Willoughby d\u2019obtenir un nouveau rapport m\u00e9dical.\n[14] La psychologue de M. Willoughby, Mme Aprile Flickenger, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la SCP en janvier 2002. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que M. Willoughby souffrait du SSPT et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il faisait des progr\u00e8s gr\u00e2ce aux traitements qu\u2019il suivait aupr\u00e8s d\u2019elle. La psychologue a soutenu que les sympt\u00f4mes dont M. Willoughby souffrait rendaient difficile sa routine quotidienne. En particulier, M. Willoughby souffrait de cauchemars et d\u2019autres troubles du sommeil. Il avait aussi des flashbacks au sujet d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements traumatisants qu\u2019il avait v\u00e9cus. La psychologue a expliqu\u00e9 que M. Willoughby souffrait aussi, entre autres, de sentiments d\u2019isolement, d\u2019une faible estime de lui-m\u00eame et parfois, de parano\u00efa. Mme Flickenger a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ces sympt\u00f4mes \u00e9taient aggrav\u00e9s par le quart de travail auquel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9, soit le quart de travail de 3 h 30, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un quart de travail de jour.\n[15] Le Dr Dodd a aussi \u00e9crit \u00e0 la SCP en janvier 2002. Il a confirm\u00e9 que M. Willoughby consultait une psychologue agr\u00e9\u00e9e pour le traitement de son SSPT et a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que, pour sa part, il n\u2019imposait pas de restrictions m\u00e9dicales au sujet de M. Willhoughby.\n[16] M. Willoughby est rest\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au quart de travail de 3 h 30 apr\u00e8s que la SCP a re\u00e7u les renseignements de la psychologue.\n[17] Le Dr Dodd a \u00e9crit une autre lettre \u00e0 la SCP le 5 mars 2002, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une lettre de la SCP qui l\u2019avisait que sa lettre de janvier 2002 semblait contredire une lettre re\u00e7ue le m\u00eame mois de la part de Mme Flickenger. La SCP \u00e9crivait que Mme Flickenger avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Willoughby avait des restrictions m\u00e9dicales, alors que la lettre du Dr Dodd donnait \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune restriction. La SCP a demand\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au Dr Dodd. Dans sa lettre du 5 mars, le Dr Dodd a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il appuyait le diagnostic et les restrictions m\u00e9dicales que la psychologue imposait.\n[18] Le Dr Esmail, du service de sant\u00e9 au travail de la SCP, a \u00e9crit une note le 12 mars 2002, dans laquelle il expliquait qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la derni\u00e8re lettre du Dr Dodd, l\u2019exigence au sujet du quart de travail de jour semblait \u00eatre raisonnable compte tenu des circonstances. Le Dr Esmail a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la SCP fasse un suivi aupr\u00e8s de la psychologue apr\u00e8s un mois pour d\u00e9terminer si les restrictions \u00e9taient toujours n\u00e9cessaires.\n[19] Le 19 mars 2002, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la note du Dr Esmail, Bill Stevenson, le chef de zone de la SCP, a avis\u00e9 le Dr Esmail que M. Willoughby resterait affect\u00e9 au quart de travail de 3 h 30.\n[20] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 avril 2002, le Dr Dodd a de nouveau avis\u00e9 la SCP que M. Willoughby devait travailler de jour seulement.\n[21] Vers le 15 avril 2002, M. Willoughby a rencontr\u00e9 Tom Duncan, un agent des relations du travail de la SCP. M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Duncan lui avait dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste \u00e0 la SCP qui satisfaisait \u00e0 ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales et qu\u2019il devrait prendre un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. M. Willoughby a pris un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de 95 jours, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s de maladie soient \u00e9puis\u00e9s. Il a alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Sun Life Financial (Sun Life), le fournisseur de prestations m\u00e9dicales et de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la SCP, et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir des prestations. Dans sa demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, M. Willoughby a r\u00e9pondu de la fa\u00e7on suivante \u00e0 la question lui demandant pourquoi il ne pouvait pas retourner au travail : [Traduction] J\u2019aurais continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler. Mon docteur et le docteur de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes soutiennent que je dois travailler pendant un quart de travail normal de jour, mais la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun poste, pendant le quart de travail de jour, qui convient \u00e0 mes limites physiques.\n[22] M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en avril 2002, de nombreux postes \u00e0 la SCP auraient convenu \u00e0 ses restrictions et qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019y faire un bon travail. Il soutient que s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un quart de travail de jour dans un des plus grands d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de la SCP, certaines des t\u00e2ches administratives s\u00e9dentaires auraient pu \u00eatre regroup\u00e9es pour constituer un poste productif qu\u2019on aurait pu lui offrir. Il ajoute que les postes de surveillants pendant le quart de jour sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus s\u00e9dentaires puisque les facteurs quittent l\u2019immeuble relativement t\u00f4t pendant ce quart de travail. Ainsi, les t\u00e2ches qui exigent que le surveillant marche beaucoup, comme la supervision de la livraison, le traitement du courrier et la surveillance de la pr\u00e9sence et du travail des employ\u00e9s, se terminent t\u00f4t dans le quart de travail.\n[23] M. Willoughby a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait pu faire le m\u00eame travail que les anciens employ\u00e9s du CRC qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9s aux diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9p\u00f4ts. Ces t\u00e2ches \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es par des membres du Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes (STTP). Le syndicat de M. Willoughby \u00e9tait l\u2019Association des officiers des postes du Canada (AOPC). Il a ajout\u00e9 que certains postes \u00e9taient occup\u00e9s par des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (AFPC); ces employ\u00e9s s\u2019occupaient principalement des t\u00e2ches administratives. Il a soutenu qu\u2019on aurait pu lui donner un poste au sein de cette unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation.\n[24] M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il a appris que la SCP \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle ne pouvait adapter de poste \u00e0 ses besoins, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 atterr\u00e9. Il s\u2019est senti abandonn\u00e9 par la SCP. Il s\u2019est senti trahi lorsqu\u2019il a su qu\u2019apr\u00e8s 24 ans de service au sein de la compagnie, celle-ci ne trouvait pas de moyen de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer et de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 ses restrictions. M. Willoughby a soutenu qu\u2019il est devenu extr\u00eamement d\u00e9prim\u00e9 et que ses sympt\u00f4mes psychologiques d\u00e9crits auparavant par la psychologue, qui \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s par le SSPT, se sont aggrav\u00e9s. Il \u00e9tait incapable de dormir, mangeait peu et quittait rarement la maison. Il se sentait m\u00e9prisable, n\u2019avait aucune estime de lui-m\u00eame et s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses futurs besoins financiers. Il a continu\u00e9 son traitement aupr\u00e8s de sa psychologue.\n[25] En octobre ou en novembre 2002, M. Willoughby a rencontr\u00e9 Sun Life pour discuter d\u2019un plan de retour au travail graduel. M. Willoughby t\u00e9moigne qu\u2019il avait h\u00e2te de retourner au travail. Sun Life avait recueilli des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour aupr\u00e8s du m\u00e9decin et de la psychologue de M. Willoughby avant de pr\u00e9parer le plan de retour au travail. Sa psychologue, Mme Flickenger, avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son \u00e9tat s\u2019am\u00e9liorait et que son pronostic \u00e9tait bon. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait tout de m\u00eame travailler de jour et qu\u2019il ne devrait pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de supervision pour le moment. Le m\u00e9decin de famille de M. Willoughby, le Dr Dodd, a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne devait travailler que pendant des quarts de travail de jour r\u00e9guliers et qu\u2019il ne devait pas marcher ou se tenir debout trop longtemps, ni soulever des charges de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive. Le plan que Sun Life a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et fait parvenir \u00e0 la SCP en novembre 2002 \u00e9tait le suivant :\n[Traduction]\n\u2022 M. Willoughby doit reprendre le travail par une affectation \u00e0 des quarts de travail de quatre heures par jour, cinq jours par semaine;\n\u2022 Il doit avoir un quart de travail de jour;\n\u2022 Il doit \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste ne comportant pas de t\u00e2ches de supervision, du moins pour le moment;\n\u2022 Il doit \u00e9viter de marcher, de se tenir debout et de soulever des choses de fa\u00e7on excessive.\n[26] M. Willoughby a soutenu que ni Sun Life, ni la SCP n\u2019ont communiqu\u00e9 avec lui en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette proposition. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la SCP et a demand\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une r\u00e9union pour qu\u2019ils puissent discuter du plan de retour au travail. Une r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2003. M. Willoughby, M. Duncan, un employ\u00e9 du service de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la SCP, un repr\u00e9sentant du service de sant\u00e9 au travail de la SCP et un repr\u00e9sentant de Sun Life \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Duncan lui a annonc\u00e9 lors de la r\u00e9union qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste qui convenait \u00e0 ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales. M. Willoughby n\u2019a jamais repris le travail \u00e0 la SCP.\n[27] M. Willoughby a obtenu un emploi chez un concessionnaire automobile en juillet 2004 et a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de la SCP. Il soutient qu\u2019il a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de chercher un travail en raison du trouble \u00e9motionnel et psychologique dont il souffrait, trouble caus\u00e9 par le comportement de la SCP. Il ajoute que lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de chercher un emploi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d\u2019en trouver un. M. Willoughby utilisait une canne \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque et il croit que cela a caus\u00e9 une r\u00e9ticence chez les employeurs potentiels.\nB. La preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [28] Au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue, M. Duncan \u00e9tait agent des relations de travail pour la SCP depuis environ 10 ans. Il a confirm\u00e9 que la SCP avait affect\u00e9 M. Willoughby \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 du CRC au poste de surveillant pendant le quart de jour en 1997 pour respecter ses restrictions physiques et la directive m\u00e9dicale selon laquelle il ne devait travailler que pendant un quart de travail r\u00e9gulier de jour.\n[29] M. Duncan a aussi confirm\u00e9 que lorsque le CRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissolu, la SCP a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter les besoins de M. Willoughby en l\u2019affectant d\u2019abord \u00e0 un projet administratif \u00e0 court terme et ensuite au bureau de la formation.\n[30] M. Duncan ne savait pas pourquoi M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11 et au quart de travail de 3 h 30 en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2001. Il a soutenu que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le chef de zone, M. Bill Stevenson. Il n\u2019a jamais discut\u00e9 de la question avec M. Stevenson. Ce dernier est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 vers 2003. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 aussi que M. Stevenson avait gard\u00e9 un dossier au sujet de M. Willoughby qui d\u00e9taillait les mesures que la SCP avait prises pour s\u2019adapter \u00e0 ses besoins depuis 1997. M. Duncan ne l\u2019a jamais lu et le dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu avant que l\u2019audience ne d\u00e9bute. M. Duncan a cependant suppos\u00e9 que le quart de travail de 3 h 30 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11 \u00e9tait le seul poste \u00e0 combler \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n[31] La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune autre preuve expliquant pourquoi M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au quart de travail de 3 h 30 et n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve justifiant le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un quart de travail de jour apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux en janvier et en mars 2002.\n[32] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vers le 15 avril 2002, il a rencontr\u00e9 M. Willoughby et que lors de cette r\u00e9union, M. Willoughby lui avait expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il se sentait incapable d\u2019occuper un emploi, quel qu\u2019il soit, au sein de la SCP. Il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Duncan de l\u2019aider \u00e0 obtenir des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. M. Duncan a ni\u00e9 avoir avis\u00e9 M. Willoughby qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste qui convenait \u00e0 ses besoins et qu\u2019il devait donc prendre un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, comme M. Willoughby l\u2019a soutenu.\n[33] M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame si M. Willoughby avait souhait\u00e9 continuer \u00e0 travailler pour la SCP, il n\u2019y avait aucun poste convenable en avril 2002. Il a soutenu qu\u2019en ce qui a trait aux postes \u00e0 doter dans son unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, l\u2019AOPC, l\u2019employ\u00e9 devait soit marcher ou rester debout pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes, ce que M. Willoughby ne pouvait pas faire, soit porter une grande attention aux d\u00e9tails et\/ou poss\u00e9der des comp\u00e9tences en informatique. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait convaincu que M. Willoughby ne pouvait pas ex\u00e9cuter ces t\u00e2ches plus s\u00e9dentaires en partie parce que, \u00e0 sa connaissance, M. Willoughby avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9, depuis sa promotion au poste de surveillant en 1990, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives et d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches plus s\u00e9dentaires et qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e9dait pas de comp\u00e9tences informatiques ad\u00e9quates. De plus, M. Duncan a soutenu que le pi\u00e8tre rendement de travail de M. Willoughby au bureau de la formation d\u00e9montrait \u00e9galement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives de fa\u00e7on acceptable.\n[34] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d\u2019apprendre en 1990 que M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 promu au poste de surveillant des facteurs. Il avait travaill\u00e9 avec M. Willoughby avant 1990 comme facteur et il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la comp\u00e9tence de M. Willoughby pour le poste \u00e9tait discutable. En 1993 ou en 1994, M. Duncan et M. Willoughby travaillaient ensemble dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9p\u00f4t. M. Duncan \u00e9tait le directeur et le sup\u00e9rieur de M. Willoughby, qui \u00e9tait surveillant. M. Duncan a soutenu que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait incapable de comprendre les concepts les plus simples, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9gligent dans ses t\u00e2ches, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019entretenir les relations n\u00e9cessaires avec les employ\u00e9s sous sa responsabilit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il commettait de nombreuses erreurs administratives. Par exemple, il avait fait de nombreuses erreurs dans le calendrier des vacances et il avait souvent omis d\u2019offrir des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires aux employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019ordre pr\u00e9vu par la convention collective. En vertu de la convention collective, si un employ\u00e9 ne se fait pas offrir des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires lorsque son tour arrive, la SCP doit tout de m\u00eame payer l\u2019employ\u00e9. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pris le contr\u00f4le de certaines t\u00e2ches administratives qui revenaient \u00e0 M. Willoughby en raison des nombreuses erreurs qu\u2019il avait commises.\n[35] M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tristement c\u00e9l\u00e8bre pour avoir endommag\u00e9 et effac\u00e9 d\u2019importants logiciels informatiques en tentant de les modifier ou de les am\u00e9liorer. Il a racont\u00e9 que lorsque M. Willoughby et lui travaillaient dans des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts voisins, M. Willoughby entrait souvent dans son bureau en grande d\u00e9tresse parce qu\u2019il avait effac\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me ou un logiciel important. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait constamment avoir recours \u00e0 de l\u2019aide technique afin de r\u00e9parer des ordinateurs endommag\u00e9s par M. Willoughby. Il a soutenu que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] irr\u00e9sistiblement attir\u00e9 par les ordinateurs. Il a d\u00e9crit un incident qui a eu lieu en 1993 ou en 1994, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le directeur de M. Willoughby. M. Duncan avait re\u00e7u un nouvel ordinateur portable de la SCP pour son usage au travail. M. Duncan a soutenu qu\u2019il avait un jour [TRADUCTION] suppli\u00e9 M Willoughby de ne pas toucher \u00e0 son ordinateur, avant de quitter le d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il est revenu, [TRADUCTION] l\u2019ordinateur \u00e9tait noir et n\u2019a plus jamais fonctionn\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00c0 ce jour, il est toujours noir .\n[36] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il savait aussi que M. Willoughby avait eu un pi\u00e8tre rendement de travail au bureau de la formation en 2001. Il a soutenu que M. Willoughby venait souvent le voir dans son bureau pour lui expliquer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de plus en plus angoiss\u00e9 et inquiet du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 effectuer ses t\u00e2ches ad\u00e9quatement au bureau de la formation.\n[37] Mme Gavin, une des chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe du bureau de la formation \u00e0 la SPC, a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s de rendement de M. Willoughby au bureau de la formation. Elle a soutenu que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait facilement distrait et qu\u2019il avait fait de nombreuses erreurs alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en poste au bureau. Mme Gavin a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle-m\u00eame et Mme Acton, la gestionnaire du bureau de formation de la SCP, avaient rencontr\u00e9 M. Willoughby au d\u00e9but du mois d\u2019avril 2001 afin de discuter avec lui de leurs inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 son rendement. Mme Acton a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle a soutenu que pendant cette rencontre, M. Willoughby avait reconnu que son rendement laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de donner une raison ad\u00e9quate pour expliquer ses nombreuses erreurs. M. Willoughby a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il souffrait de probl\u00e8mes personnels depuis longtemps, mais il n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail la nature de ces probl\u00e8mes. Mme Gavin et Mme Acton n\u2019ont aucun souvenir d\u2019un moment o\u00f9 M. Willoughby leur aurait dit qu\u2019il croyait souffrir de dyslexie.\n[38] Mme Gavin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette rencontre, Mme Acton et elle ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Willoughby devait subir un examen m\u00e9dical et elles ont appris par la suite que la SCP avait re\u00e7u des renseignements selon lesquels les difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pi\u00e8tre rendement de M. Willoughby avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solues. \u00c0 son avis, elle n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que de demander le transfert de M. Willoughby, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune explication m\u00e9dicale pour son pi\u00e8tre rendement.\n[39] M. Duncan a soutenu qu\u2019il savait que M. Willoughby avait un pi\u00e8tre rendement, longtemps apr\u00e8s son retour au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11, au quart de travail de 3 h 30, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2001. M. Willoughby a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 passer le voir \u00e0 son bureau r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et il lui a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de satisfaire aux exigences du poste.\n[40] Mme Sample, la directrice du d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11 lorsque M. Willoughby y a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affect\u00e9 en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2001, a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des probl\u00e8mes de rendement de M. Willoughby au d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Elle a soutenu que son rendement \u00e9tait beaucoup plus faible que la norme requise, presque aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s son affectation au d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Mme Sample a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait presque enti\u00e8rement incapable de marcher et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait incapable de superviser ad\u00e9quatement les employ\u00e9s et il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 superviser ad\u00e9quatement la livraison et le traitement du courrier. De plus, il continuait de commettre de nombreuses erreurs dans les t\u00e2ches administratives du poste.\n[41] M. Duncan a soutenu qu\u2019en raison du pi\u00e8tre rendement de travail de M. Willoughby et de ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales, il n\u2019y avait aucun poste \u00e0 la SCP pouvant r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins. M. Duncan a examin\u00e9 de nombreux postes \u00e0 la SCP, mais n\u2019en a trouv\u00e9 aucun pour lequel M. Willoughby aurait eu un rendement ad\u00e9quat. Il ne pouvait pas continuer comme surveillant des facteurs parce que le poste exigeait qu\u2019il marche dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t pendant environ 90 p. 100 du quart de travail de huit heures. M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de regrouper les t\u00e2ches administratives des autres surveillants afin de cr\u00e9er un poste adapt\u00e9 pour M. Willoughby puisque les surveillants effectuaient peu de t\u00e2ches administratives. Ces t\u00e2ches regroup\u00e9es n\u2019auraient pas suffi \u00e0 occuper une pleine journ\u00e9e de travail.\n[42] M. Duncan a soutenu que les postes au bureau des ventes de la SCP exigeaient aussi que l\u2019employ\u00e9 marche beaucoup. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les postes d\u2019adjoint dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, postes qu\u2019il a d\u2019abord d\u00e9crits comme des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour les employ\u00e9s bless\u00e9s ou \u00e2g\u00e9s, ne conviendraient pas \u00e0 M. Willoughby puisqu\u2019il aurait eu \u00e0 marcher beaucoup et \u00e0 soulever de nombreuses choses : [TRADUCTION] Ils [les adjoints dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts] travaillent plus que vous et moi ensemble. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019AOPC qui effectuent de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de donn\u00e9es et d\u2019autres fonctions administratives, telles que les t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es dans les bureaux de gestion des routes et de contr\u00f4le des codes postaux, sont hautement qualifi\u00e9s et occupent des postes qui n\u00e9cessitent une tr\u00e8s grande attention aux d\u00e9tails. M. Duncan et d\u2019autres personnes ont soutenu que M. Willoughby a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de porter une attention ad\u00e9quate aux d\u00e9tails et qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas effectuer ces t\u00e2ches administratives correctement.\n[43] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la SCP n\u2019avait pas officiellement examin\u00e9 tous les postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre ouverts dans les autres unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation. Certains des postes \u00e0 la SCP \u00e9taient occup\u00e9s par des employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient membres de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation du STTP. Par exemple, l\u2019unit\u00e9 de triage des longues et des courtes lettres \u00e9tait d\u00e9crite comme un poste s\u00e9dentaire auquel les employ\u00e9s bless\u00e9s \u00e9taient assign\u00e9s. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 que la SCP n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019affecter M. Willoughby \u00e0 l\u2019un des postes du STTP puisqu\u2019il y aurait eu de graves cons\u00e9quences pour les membres du STTP si M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 parachut\u00e9 dans l\u2019un de ces postes. M. Duncan a soutenu que si M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans un poste qui ne relevait pas de sa convention collective, quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] mis \u00e0 la rue , s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019autres postes \u00e0 doter dans la m\u00eame unit\u00e9. Si le nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 \u00e9tait complet, la seule solution aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un poste pour M. Willoughby et M. Duncan a fait valoir que cela d\u00e9passe toute obligation d\u2019un employeur de s\u2019adapter aux besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Il ne savait pas s\u2019il y avait, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, des postes \u00e0 doter dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 du STTP qui aurait convenu \u00e0 M. Willoughby. Il n\u2019avait pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9.\n[44] M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il y avait cinq employ\u00e9s en surplus dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AFPC. Les membres de cette unit\u00e9 occupaient principalement des fonctions administratives, dont un grand nombre \u00e9taient s\u00e9dentaires. Les postes qui \u00e9taient alors occup\u00e9s par les employ\u00e9s en surplus sont devenus exc\u00e9dentaires lorsque la SCP s\u2019est mise \u00e0 informatiser de plus en plus ses op\u00e9rations. En vertu de la convention collective, la SCP avait accept\u00e9 de garder ces employ\u00e9s sur sa liste de paye. M. Duncan a expliqu\u00e9 que ces employ\u00e9s travaillaient alors \u00e0 des [TRADUCTION] projets visant \u00e0 les garder occup\u00e9s , comme l\u2019entr\u00e9e de donn\u00e9es. Ces employ\u00e9s servaient aussi \u00e0 doter des postes lorsqu\u2019un poste se lib\u00e9rait. M. Kordoban a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la SCP avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 annul\u00e9 un contrat avec une compagnie de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 afin de donner ces t\u00e2ches \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019AFPC qui \u00e9taient en surplus. M. Duncan a soutenu que, comme il y avait encore des employ\u00e9s en surplus \u00e0 la SCP, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste \u00e0 doter au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AFPC.\n[45] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en avril 2002, lorsqu\u2019il a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Willoughby, il n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui se trouvaient dans son dossier d\u2019emploi. Son estimation des restrictions m\u00e9dicales de M. Willoughby d\u00e9coulait de ses observations et de ses conversations avec M. Willoughby. M. Duncan a d\u00e9duit de ces observations et conversations que la seule restriction m\u00e9dicale de M. Willoughby \u00e9tait qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas marcher ou se tenir debout longtemps. Il ne savait pas que M. Willoughby souffrait d\u2019un trouble du sommeil, qu\u2019il avait ensuite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un diagnostic de SSPT, ni que son m\u00e9decin lui avait dit de ne travailler que pendant un quart de jour r\u00e9gulier.\n[46] M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019avant sa rencontre avec M. Willoughby en f\u00e9vrier 2003, dix mois apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils se sont vus pour la derni\u00e8re fois, il n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019emploi de M. Willoughby, ni les rapports m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 son sujet. Il ne savait pas que Sun Life avait envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la SCP en novembre 2002 qui r\u00e9sumait les restrictions m\u00e9dicales de M. Willoughby et qui pr\u00e9sentait une proposition pour le retour au travail de M. Willoughby. Il a soutenu qu\u2019il croyait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun changement dans les restrictions de M. Willoughby en raison des commentaires que l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re de la SCP avait formul\u00e9s lors de la rencontre.\n[47] M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas fait de recherches pr\u00e9cises, ni avant, ni apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union de f\u00e9vrier 2003, au sujet d\u2019ouvertures de poste \u00e0 la SCP qui pouvaient r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Willoughby. Il a soutenu que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il a compris des commentaires de l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re de la SCP selon lesquels les restrictions de M. Willoughby n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9, le point de vue de la SCP n\u2019avait pas chang\u00e9 : il n\u2019y avait aucun poste pour M. Willoughby.\nIV. Analyse [48] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le fait de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) pr\u00e9voit que le fait de d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi un employ\u00e9, par des moyens directs ou indirects, constitue un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. La d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite au sens de l\u2019article 3 et l\u2019article 25 pr\u00e9voit que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale est illicite.\n[49] Le plaignant a d\u2019abord le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination.\nA. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que la SCP a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience? [50] Une preuve prima facie de discrimination est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9. Le d\u00e9cideur n\u2019a pas \u00e0 tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9termine si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie (O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985], 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28; voir aussi Dhanjal c. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6, et Moore c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses des postes, 2007 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 85). Un plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver que la discrimination \u00e9tait le seul facteur qui a influenc\u00e9 le comportement qui fait l\u2019objet de la plainte. Il suffit que le plaignant \u00e9tablisse une preuve prima facie que la discrimination est l\u2019un de ces facteurs. (Voir Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029.)\n[51] Les all\u00e9gations de M. Willoughby au sujet de la discrimination sont les suivantes : premi\u00e8rement, vers le 12 mars 2002, la SCP a continu\u00e9 son affectation au quart de travail de 3 h 30 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u une lettre de son m\u00e9decin dans laquelle il \u00e9tait expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait travailler de jour, et deuxi\u00e8mement, la SCP a refus\u00e9 de continuer son emploi en avril 2002 et en f\u00e9vrier 2003 en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences.\n(i) Une preuve prima facie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sujet de la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation : le fait d\u2019avoir continu\u00e9 l\u2019affectation de M. Willoughby au quart de travail de 3 h 30 en mars 2002? [52] M. Willoughby a soutenu que lorsque la SCP a re\u00e7u la lettre du Dr Dodd en mars 2002, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait prescrit qu\u2019il devait travailler de jour, la d\u00e9cision de la SCP de continuer son affectation au quart de travail de 3 h 30 constituait un acte discriminatoire. Cette all\u00e9gation met en cause l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit que le fait de d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi un employ\u00e9, par des moyens directs ou indirects, constitue un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[53] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Environnement), [2003] A.C.F. no 439 (C.A.F.), le juge Pelletier, qui \u00e9crivait pour le coll\u00e8ge de trois membres de la Cour, explique que lorsqu\u2019il est question d\u2019une plainte de discrimination qui d\u00e9coule d\u2019une ligne de conduite entre un employeur et un employ\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019une politique d\u2019emploi distincte et coh\u00e9rente, la question la plus pertinente lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) consiste \u00e0 savoir si les rapports entre les parties, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur ensemble, entra\u00eenent un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite (voir paragraphes 75 et 76). Il n\u2019y a aucun crit\u00e8re ou analyse pr\u00e9cis qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019examen visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b). Le Tribunal doit \u00eatre souple et ne doit pas \u00eatre l\u00e9galiste lorsqu\u2019il vise \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019un des objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la LCDP, soit l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination au travail (Morris c. Les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [2005] C.A.F. 154, aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 30). Les analyses portant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) doivent \u00eatre faites au cas par cas et de fa\u00e7on adapt\u00e9e au contexte factuel.\n[54] Je conclus que M. Willoughby a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La SCP s\u2019\u00e9tait adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales de fa\u00e7on continue depuis 1997, y compris l\u2019obligation de travailler de jour. Puis, subitement, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2001, la SCP a r\u00e9affect\u00e9 M. Willoughby au quart de travail de 3 h 30. En mars 2002, lorsque la SCP a re\u00e7u les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui pr\u00e9cisaient que M. Willoughby ne pouvait travailler que pendant les quarts de jour, la SCP a continu\u00e9 son affectation au quart de travail de 3 h 30. Il ne fait aucun doute que la ligne de conduite de la SCP a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable pour M. Willoughby par rapport \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience : la d\u00e9cision de la SCP \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait contraire \u00e0 la directive du m\u00e9decin de M. Willoughby et elle a aggrav\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Je conclus aussi que M. Willoughby a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu\u2019il a non seulement fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable, mais aussi d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rent en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment remarqu\u00e9 dans Moore c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 31 (paragraphe 86), la LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit aucun droit distinct \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement. Cependant, je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Willoughby selon lequel son employeur avait re\u00e7u une directive m\u00e9dicale qui mentionnait une restriction de travail, et que cette restriction n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e, \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu une diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Je conclus que M. Willoughby a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable et diff\u00e9rente par la SCP en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences.\n(ii) Une preuve prima facie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sujet de la deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation : la d\u00e9cision de la SCP, en avril 2002, de ne pas continuer d\u2019employer M. Willoughby? [55] M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en avril 2002, M. Duncan l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de poste \u00e0 doter adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins et qu\u2019il devrait pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\n[56] Je conclus qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sujet de cette deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Willoughby, s\u2019il est retenu, prouverait que le refus de la SCP de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer le 12 avril 2002 d\u00e9coulait, du moins en partie, de ses d\u00e9ficiences, en contravention avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCPD, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la SCP.\n(iii) Une preuve prima facie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sujet de la deuxi\u00e8me all\u00e9gation : la d\u00e9cision de la SCP, en f\u00e9vrier 2003, de ne pas continuer d\u2019employer M. Willoughby? [57] Sun Life a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la SCP en novembre 2002 pour l\u2019aviser que M. Willoughby \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail et pour proposer un plan de retour au travail graduel qui comprenait une liste distincte de restrictions de travail. M. Willoughby a soutenu qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2003, on l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste \u00e0 doter \u00e0 la SCP qui pouvait \u00eatre adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses restrictions.\n[58] Je conclus qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Willoughby, s\u2019il est retenu, prouverait que le refus de la SCP de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2003 d\u00e9coulait de ses d\u00e9ficiences, en contravention avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la SCP.\nB. La SCP peut-elle justifier les actes discriminatoires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis prima facie? [59] Le paragraphe 15(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que lorsque la d\u00e9cision ou la ligne de conduite d\u2019un employeur d\u00e9coule d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, la d\u00e9cision ne constitue pas un acte de discrimination.\n[60] Le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que, pour qu\u2019une ligne de conduite ou une d\u00e9cision soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, l\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9 constituent pour lui une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[61] L\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie\u2011Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, (plainte Meiorin) [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada expose l\u2019analyse qui permet d\u2019\u00e9valuer si l\u2019exigence professionnelle est justifi\u00e9e.\n[62] Pour \u00e9tablir que sa conduite \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, ou que la conduite d\u00e9coulait d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, l\u2019employeur doit prouver :\nque la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e ou qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans un but raisonnablement li\u00e9 aux exigences objectives l\u00e9gitimes du travail (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 58); que la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e ou qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation des exigences objectives (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60); que la norme a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e ou qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise parce qu\u2019elle est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019employeur puisse atteindre l\u2019objet vis\u00e9 (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62).\n(i) La SCP est-elle capable de justifier sa d\u00e9cision de continuer \u00e0 affecter M. Willoughby au quart de travail de 3 h 30 en mars 2002. [63] La SCP n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve directe qui explique pourquoi M. Stevenson a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de continuer l\u2019affectation de M. Willoughby au quart de travail de 3 h 30 apr\u00e8s que la SCP a re\u00e7u des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux selon lesquels il devait travailler de jour. M. Stevenson est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avant la tenue de l\u2019audience et le dossier d\u2019employ\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait gard\u00e9 au sujet de M. Willoughby n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre retrac\u00e9. M. Duncan a suppos\u00e9 que le quart de travail de 3 h 30 \u00e9tait le seul poste disponible \u00e0 la SCP.\n[64] Lorsqu\u2019un plaignant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau de la preuve, l\u2019employeur doit alors s\u2019acquitter du sien : l\u2019employeur doit pr\u00e9senter des preuves qui r\u00e9pondent, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse Meiorin. La SCP est incapable de s\u2019acquitter de son fardeau de la preuve pour chacun des trois volets du crit\u00e8re Meiorin. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Duncan a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des suppositions quant aux raisons qui auraient pu motiver la d\u00e9cision de M. Stevenson de continuer \u00e0 affecter M. Willoughby au quart de travail de 3 h 30. Un employeur ne peut pas s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de la preuve pr\u00e9vu dans Meiorin en pr\u00e9sentant des suppositions (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] A.C.S. no 73, au paragraphe 41). Je conclus que la SCP ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de la preuve au sujet de cette all\u00e9gation.\n(ii) La SCP est-elle capable de justifier sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas continuer \u00e0 employer M. Willoughby en avril 2002? [65] La preuve de la SCP au sujet de cette all\u00e9gation donne lieu \u00e0 un examen pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la conduite \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, comme le pr\u00e9voit le crit\u00e8re Meiorin. M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Willoughby avait demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et que M. Duncan avait simplement facilit\u00e9 cette demande en aidant M. Willoughby \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer sa demande de prestations. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a eu aucun refus de continuer \u00e0 employer M. Willoughby. Bien entendu, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Duncan contredit celui de M. Willoughby, qui soutient qu\u2019on lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de poste disponible \u00e0 la SCP et que son seul recours \u00e9tait de pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Willoughby est plus cr\u00e9dible et je le pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 celui de M. Duncan. En tirant cette conclusion, je note que, dans le formulaire de demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, M. Willoughby a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] J\u2019aurais continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler. Mon m\u00e9decin et le m\u00e9decin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes soutiennent que je dois travailler pendant un quart normal de jour, mais la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes dit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun poste, pendant le quart de travail de jour, qui convient \u00e0 mes limites physiques. De plus, une conversation par courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La SCP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Duncan en 2003 de r\u00e9sumer la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019adaptation aux besoins de M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, M. Duncan n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 que M. Willoughby avait demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. On s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 ce que, si M. Willoughby avait demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, si M. Duncan avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 leur discussion de cette fa\u00e7on, ces renseignements soient mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport de M. Duncan en 2003. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[66] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que M. Willoughby n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, j\u2019examinerai la preuve subsidiaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la SCP, soit qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste disponible \u00e0 la SCP qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adapt\u00e9 aux besoins de M. Willoughby.\n[67] En ce qui a trait au premier volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Meiorin, la SCP a-t-elle \u00e9tabli que sa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans un but raisonnablement li\u00e9 aux exigences objectives du travail? La SCP a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la combinaison des restrictions m\u00e9dicales de M. Willoughby et de ses difficult\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de rendement de travail l\u2019ont port\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste qui lui convenait dans sa propre unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. De plus, elle a soutenu qu\u2019affecter M. Willoughby \u00e0 un poste dans une autre unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation constituerait une contrainte excessive puisqu\u2019elle aurait \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un poste pour lui. Il semble que le but de la SCP \u00e9tait de maintenir l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de ses op\u00e9rations. Je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de la SCP a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans un but raisonnablement li\u00e9 aux exigences objectives du travail.\n[68] En ce qui a trait au deuxi\u00e8me volet de l\u2019analyse, la SCP a-t-elle \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle a pris sa d\u00e9cision en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation des exigences objectives? Je suis d\u2019avis que la SCP n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 ce deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re. Je conclus que la SCP savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 correctement la question de savoir si sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire compte tenu des circonstances.\n[69] M. Duncan a pris la d\u00e9cision finale quant au refus de la SCP de continuer \u00e0 employer M. Willoughby. M. Duncan \u00e9tait un agent des relations de travail exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 au sein de la SCP. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en ce qui a trait aux questions d\u2019accommodement, \u00e0 l\u2019interaction avec les employ\u00e9s et \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de la compagnie dans le cadre d\u2019arbitrages. Je conclus que M. Duncan avait ou aurait d\u00fb avoir une compr\u00e9hension consid\u00e9rable des crit\u00e8res applicables \u00e0 la question de savoir si une d\u00e9cision de refuser l\u2019emploi \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a examin\u00e9 dans Meiorin, et qu\u2019il avait une compr\u00e9hension consid\u00e9rable des exigences en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure impos\u00e9es aux employeurs lorsqu\u2019ils examinent s\u2019ils peuvent r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Je traiterai des \u00e9l\u00e9ments portant sur la proc\u00e9dure et sur le fond du troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Meiorin sous peu, mais je noterai en tirant une conclusion \u00e0 ce sujet que M. Duncan a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de conclure que la SCP ne pouvait pas accommoder M. Willoughby, il n\u2019avait m\u00eame pas examin\u00e9 son dossier ni les rapports m\u00e9dicaux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. Si M. Duncan avait examin\u00e9 le dossier, il aurait remarqu\u00e9 que M. Willoughby avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un quart de travail qui ne respectait pas ses exigences m\u00e9dicales. Il se serait alors rendu compte que les difficult\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de rendement de travail de M. Willoughby au d\u00e9p\u00f4t 11 d\u00e9coulaient peut-\u00eatre, du moins en partie, de cette affectation. Comme je l\u2019examinerai plus en d\u00e9tail sous peu, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape essentielle pour un employeur, lorsqu\u2019il examine les besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9 auxquels il doit s\u2019adapter, est d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019employ\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on individuelle. Un agent des relations de travail exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 ne pouvait pas, \u00e0 mon avis, croire sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019il respectait les crit\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires d\u2019une analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le refus de continuer \u00e0 employer une personne \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas entrepris l\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire fondamentale.\n[70] Le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Meiorin demande si l\u2019employeur a \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019il puisse atteindre l\u2019objet qu\u2019elle vise. La d\u00e9cision sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire si l\u2019employeur est capable de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas satisfaire aux besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9 sans subir de contrainte excessive (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62; voir aussi Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 20, et Hutchinson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 70).\n[71] La SCP a conclu qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas offrir de poste \u00e0 M. Willoughby en avril 2002. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin? Je conclus que ce n\u2019est pas le cas.\n[72] Pour le troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re, je dois d\u2019abord examiner le processus ou la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019employeur a adopt\u00e9 afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer la question de l\u2019accommodement et je dois ensuite examiner le fond de la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 66).\n[73] Un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que le processus ou la proc\u00e9dure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer la question de l\u2019accommodement \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9. Un employeur doit \u00eatre sensible et respectueux envers les habilet\u00e9s, les capacit\u00e9s et les contributions possibles d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui a besoin d\u2019accommodement (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 64), il doit examiner d\u2019autres approches qui seraient moins discriminatoires et doit d\u00e9montrer que toutes les autres approches examin\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es seulement pour des raisons appropri\u00e9es (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 65). Un employeur doit innover et agir de fa\u00e7on pratique lorsqu\u2019il examine des questions d\u2019accommodement.\n(a) La SCP \u00e9tait-elle sensible aux habilet\u00e9s, aux capacit\u00e9s et aux contributions possibles de M. Willoughby? [74] Je conclus que la SCP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sensible ni respectueuse envers les habilet\u00e9s, les capacit\u00e9s et les contributions possibles de M. Willoughby. Il ne peut \u00eatre satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence proc\u00e9durale que si l\u2019employeur peut \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour garantir qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et appropri\u00e9e les habilet\u00e9s, les capacit\u00e9s et les contributions possibles de l\u2019employ\u00e9. La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 une telle analyse avant d\u2019examiner les besoins de M. Willoughby en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement.\n[75] La SCP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves au sujet des difficult\u00e9s de rendement de M. Willoughby. Je conclus cependant que la preuve de la SCP au sujet de ces difficult\u00e9s \u00e9tait exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Un comportement tel que M. Duncan a d\u00e9crit serait certainement examin\u00e9 en profondeur par l\u2019employeur. La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune autre \u00e9valuation de rendement n\u00e9gative que celle de 2001, alors que M. Willoughby travaillait au bureau de la formation. La SCP a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune mesure disciplinaire n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre M. Willoughby. Si M. Willoughby ruinait constamment, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019ordres pr\u00e9cis, des ordinateurs et des logiciels importants de la SCP, s\u2019il \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement n\u00e9gligent et incomp\u00e9tent par rapport \u00e0 ses t\u00e2ches de surveillant, cela aurait certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans une \u00e9valuation de rendement. Il est aussi difficile de croire qu\u2019aucune mesure disciplinaire n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise si la mauvaise conduite de M. Willoughby \u00e9tait aussi grave et inlassable qu\u2019on le pr\u00e9tend.\n[76] De plus, bien que la SCP ait eu en sa possession des rapports m\u00e9dicaux au sujet de M. Willoughby, M. Duncan ne les a pas examin\u00e9s avant de prendre sa d\u00e9cision. Certainement, le fait de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019examiner \u00e9quitablement et correctement les limites d\u2019un employ\u00e9 est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du devoir de l\u2019employeur de se montrer respectueux et sensible aux capacit\u00e9s et aux circonstances uniques de chaque employ\u00e9 et un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de l\u2019exigence proc\u00e9durale.\n[77] La d\u00e9cision de ne pas continuer \u00e0 employer M. Willoughby en avril 2002 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que s\u2019\u00e9tait form\u00e9e M. Duncan de l\u2019\u00e9tat de M. Willoughby \u00e0 la suite de leurs rencontres. L\u2019impression de M. Duncan \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant du diagnostic de SSPT ni du besoin de M. Willoughby de travailler pendant un quart de travail r\u00e9gulier de jour. Sans renseignements pr\u00e9liminaires exacts, un employeur ne peut pas raisonnablement r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Cette \u00e9tape de cueillette de renseignements est cruciale au processus d\u2019accommodement et la SCP n\u2019en a pas tenu compte.\n(b) La SCP a-t-elle examin\u00e9 attentivement d\u2019autres approches en mati\u00e8re d\u2019adaptation aux besoins de M. Willoughby? [78] La SCP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreuses preuves au sujet de la nature des autres postes disponibles qui auraient pu convenir \u00e0 M. Willoughby au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AOPC. Je conclus que la SCP a exag\u00e9r\u00e9 la rigueur d\u2019au moins quelques-uns de ces postes. Je conclus que M. Duncan n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible pour ce qui est de d\u00e9crire justement les exigences d\u2019au moins certains des diff\u00e9rents postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre offerts \u00e0 M. Willoughby. Son t\u00e9moignage au sujet des rigueurs des postes d\u2019adjoint dans les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il les eut d\u00e9crits comme des postes servant \u00e0 accommoder les employ\u00e9s \u00e2g\u00e9s ou atteints d\u2019incapacit\u00e9s, \u00e9tait moins que cr\u00e9dible. De plus, son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 parfois contredit par d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. Par exemple, M. Kordoban, gestionnaire au service de la production, du contr\u00f4le et des d\u00e9clarations de la SCP, a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Son service \u00e9tait charg\u00e9, entre autres, de la dotation et du budget. M. Kordoban a expliqu\u00e9 que les postes dans les bureaux de gestion des routes et de contr\u00f4le des codes postaux servaient souvent \u00e0 accommoder de fa\u00e7on temporaire les employ\u00e9s bless\u00e9s et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que ces employ\u00e9s soient hautement qualifi\u00e9s; ils apprenaient sur place.\n(c) La SCP a-t-elle cherch\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate un emploi de substitution? [79] Je conclus que la SCP n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait examin\u00e9 attentivement d\u2019autres approches \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement pour M. Willoughby avant de d\u00e9cider en avril 2002 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas lui offrir de poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins. La SCP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves selon lesquelles M. Willoughby aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de faire le travail requis pour les postes disponibles dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AOPC. Le poste de surveillant des facteurs exigeait que M. Willoughby marche trop. D\u2019autres postes au sein de l\u2019AOPC, par exemple l\u2019entr\u00e9e de donn\u00e9es au bureau de gestion des routes ou de contr\u00f4le des codes postaux, n\u00e9cessitaient une attention extr\u00eame aux d\u00e9tails. J\u2019ai conclu plus t\u00f4t que la SCP avait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 les rigueurs de nombreux postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre offerts \u00e0 M. Willoughby dans sa propre unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. J\u2019ai aussi conclu que la SCP avait exag\u00e9r\u00e9 les lacunes de M. Willoughby dans son poste de surveillant. Je conclus que la SCP n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun poste au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AOPC qui aurait pu convenir \u00e0 M. Willoughby.\n[80] De plus, la SCP n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait fait les recherches n\u00e9cessaires en ce qui a trait aux postes qui auraient pu \u00eatre disponibles dans d\u2019autres unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation. Premi\u00e8rement, la SCP, par l\u2019entremise de son agent des relations de travail, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas entrepris de recherches attentives quant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il y avait des postes \u00e0 doter au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation du STTP. Il semble que M. Duncan ait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que, si M. Willoughby obtenait un poste dans cette unit\u00e9, un employ\u00e9 du STTP serait mis \u00e0 la rue . Cette preuve, qui rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019impression, ne satisfait tout simplement pas \u00e0 l\u2019obligation proc\u00e9durale de l\u2019employeur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019accommodement. M. Duncan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, comme il y avait des employ\u00e9s en surplus dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AFPC, il \u00e9tait impossible qu\u2019il y ait des postes \u00e0 doter. Ce n\u2019est pas une enqu\u00eate ad\u00e9quate. La simple existence d\u2019employ\u00e9s en surplus au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation de l\u2019AFPC n\u2019am\u00e8ne pas forc\u00e9ment \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019aucun poste ne pouvait \u00eatre offert \u00e0 M. Willoughby. Il y avait peut-\u00eatre un poste, ou des postes, auquel les employ\u00e9s en surplus ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9s, mais qui aurait convenu \u00e0 M. Willoughby. La SCP ne s\u2019est pas renseign\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[81] De plus, les syndicats ont un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer lorsqu\u2019un employeur cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Un syndicat a l\u2019obligation de prendre part aux questions d\u2019accommodement lorsque c\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre l\u2019accommodement possible, s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune autre solution raisonnable possible pour l\u2019employeur (Renaud c. Central Okanagan School District no 23 (1992), 95 D.L.R. 4th 577 (C.S.C.)). Bien que l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud traite de l\u2019obligation d\u2019un syndicat de coop\u00e9rer avec un employeur au sujet d\u2019un de ses membres, je ne vois pas de raison de principe pour laquelle, lorsque l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un employeur comprend plus d\u2019un syndicat, l\u2019obligation de coop\u00e9ration ne s\u2019\u00e9tendrait pas aux autres unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation si une telle coop\u00e9ration est le seul moyen d\u2019offrir une mesure d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 un employ\u00e9. Si la SCP avait trouv\u00e9 un poste qui convenait \u00e0 M. Willoughby, elle aurait pu demander au syndicat de coop\u00e9rer. Je conclus que la SCP aurait d\u00fb examiner les postes au sein du STTP et de l\u2019AFPC afin de chercher attentivement un poste r\u00e9pondant aux besoins de M. Willoughby, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait.\n(d) La SCP a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment souple et cr\u00e9ative? [82] Les employeurs doivent faire preuve d\u2019innovation lorsqu\u2019ils cherchent \u00e0 accommoder un employ\u00e9. Ils doivent \u00eatre souples et cr\u00e9atifs. La SCP n\u2019a pas fait preuve d\u2019innovation, de souplesse ni de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9. La SCP a rejet\u00e9 d\u2019embl\u00e9e toute possibilit\u00e9 de fusion de diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches pour cr\u00e9er un poste adapt\u00e9 aux besoins de M. Willoughby. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves selon lesquelles les surveillants d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t n\u2019avaient pas suffisamment de t\u00e2ches administratives pour cr\u00e9er un poste complet pour M. Willoughby. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle avait examin\u00e9 son exploitation de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de d\u00e9terminer si d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches pouvaient \u00eatre fusionn\u00e9es afin de cr\u00e9er un poste adapt\u00e9 pour M. Willoughby.\n[83] Je trouve int\u00e9ressante la d\u00e9cision Saunders c. Kentville (Town), [2004] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. no 9. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a examin\u00e9 une plainte d\u2019une polici\u00e8re qui soutenait que son d\u00e9tachement de police n\u2019avait pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de son sexe et du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Le commissaire Deveau a effectu\u00e9 une analyse fond\u00e9e sur le crit\u00e8re Meiorin dans le contexte d\u2019un petit service de police en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse. Il a conclu que, m\u00eame dans ce petit service constitu\u00e9 de 12 \u00e0 14 policiers, m\u00eame si l\u2019accommodement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 incommode et inconv\u00e9nient, l\u2019employeur ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d\u2019accommodement puisqu\u2019il avait fait peu d\u2019efforts pour r\u00e9unir des t\u00e2ches et des fonctions, de fa\u00e7on temporaire, afin d\u2019adapter un poste aux besoins de la plaignante. Il a conclu que l\u2019employeur avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019examiner en profondeur les possibilit\u00e9s de service r\u00e9duit dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'imposait aucune contrainte excessive. L\u2019employeur n\u2019avait pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019avait fait.\n[84] La SCP est une exploitation beaucoup plus vaste qui a des centaines d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Edmonton qui effectuent un large \u00e9ventail de t\u00e2ches. Je conclus que la SCP, si elle avait raisonnablement fait preuve d\u2019innovation et de souplesse, aurait pu tenter de cr\u00e9er, de modifier ou de r\u00e9organiser une ou plusieurs de ces t\u00e2ches afin d\u2019offrir un poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Willoughby. La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle avait fait de telles recherches.\n(e) La SCP a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019offrir un accommodement \u00e0 M. Willoughby aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive? [85] Laissant l\u00e0 le processus de la SCP lors de son examen de l\u2019accommodement pour M. Willoughby, j\u2019examinerai maintenant le fond de sa d\u00e9cision. Je conclus qu\u2019il est clair que la SCP n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que ses d\u00e9cisions \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin. La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve qui donne \u00e0 penser que r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Willoughby lui aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[86] La SCP \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la seule mesure d\u2019accommodement pour M. Willoughby aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er un poste pour lui et que la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un poste constitue toujours une contrainte excessive. Premi\u00e8rement, j\u2019ai conclu que la SCP n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un poste \u00e9tait la seule mesure d\u2019accommodement pour M. Willoughby. Cependant, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, une telle n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ne constituerait pas automatiquement une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019employeur.\n[87] La LCDP pr\u00e9voit, au paragraphe 15(2), que la contrainte est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e excessive en fonction de la sant\u00e9, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des co\u00fbts. Cette disposition ne pr\u00e9voit pas qu\u2019il y a contrainte excessive si l\u2019employeur doit cr\u00e9er un poste adapt\u00e9 pour un employ\u00e9 et, \u00e0 mon avis, ce paragraphe ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de la sorte. Il faut d\u00e9terminer au cas par cas si une action qui pouvait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019accommoder un employ\u00e9 cr\u00e9erait une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts. La SCP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve selon laquelle, compte tenu de sa situation financi\u00e8re, la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un poste cr\u00e9erait pour elle une contrainte excessive en raison des co\u00fbts qui seraient entra\u00een\u00e9s.\n[88] Je conclus que la SCP ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau de la preuve par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) : elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui serait impossible de s\u2019adapter aux restrictions de M. Willoughby sans subir de contrainte excessive.\n(iii) La SCP a-t-elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision de refuser de continuer \u00e0 employer M. Willoughby en f\u00e9vrier 2003 \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e? [89] En f\u00e9vrier 2003, M. Willoughby s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la SCP pour une r\u00e9union pendant laquelle ils ont discut\u00e9 de son retour au travail. Apr\u00e8s avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Willoughby, son m\u00e9decin et sa psychologue, Sun Life a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une proposition de retour au travail. Cette proposition mentionnait quatre restrictions. La SCP a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas prendre de mesures d\u2019accommodement pour M. Willoughby. Les raisons de la SCP \u00e9taient les m\u00eames qui l\u2019avaient port\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas accommoder M. Willoughby par le pass\u00e9.\n[90] En ce qui a trait au premier volet du crit\u00e8re Meiorin, je conclus de nouveau que la d\u00e9cision de la SCP \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019efficacit\u00e9, que ce fondement d\u00e9coulait d\u2019exigences objectives l\u00e9gitimes du travail et que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 ces exigences.\n[91] Quant au deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Meiorin, je conclus que la SCP ne croyait pas sinc\u00e8rement que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire. Quand la r\u00e9union a eu lieu en f\u00e9vrier 2003, M. Willoughby \u00e9tait sans travail depuis plusieurs mois. M. Duncan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux au sujet de M. Willoughby avant la tenue de la r\u00e9union. Il ne savait pas qu\u2019un plan de retour au travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 afin de faciliter le retour de M. Willoughby. Il n\u2019avait pas officiellement fait de recherche parmi les postes \u00e0 doter afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019un d\u2019eux convenait \u00e0 M. Willoughby. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait compris que les restrictions de M. Willoughby n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019avis de la SCP n\u2019avait pas chang\u00e9. Il n\u2019y avait aucun poste pour M. Willoughby. La d\u00e9marche que M. Duncan a entreprise avant de d\u00e9cider que la SCP cesserait d\u2019employer M. Willoughby n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du tout ad\u00e9quate. Compte tenu des circonstances, je conclus que la SCP ne croyait pas sinc\u00e8rement que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\n[92] En ce qui a trait au troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Meiorin, la SCP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour cette partie de l\u2019analyse la m\u00eame preuve pour la d\u00e9cision de f\u00e9vrier 2003 que pour la d\u00e9cision d\u2019avril 2002. Par cons\u00e9quent, mon analyse quant \u00e0 savoir si la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire est la m\u00eame pour les deux d\u00e9cisions. Je r\u00e9p\u00e8te l\u2019analyse que j\u2019ai effectu\u00e9e au sujet de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019avril 2002 et je conclus que la SCP n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision de cesser d\u2019employer M. Willoughby en f\u00e9vrier 2003 \u00e9tait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\n(iv) La conclusion au sujet des actes discriminatoires [93] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que la plainte de M. Willoughby selon laquelle il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur ses d\u00e9ficiences, en contravention avec les alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la LCDP, est fond\u00e9e.\nV. Redressements A. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire [94] M. Willoughby a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Cet alin\u00e9a donne au Tribunal qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e le pouvoir d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire.\n[95] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment examin\u00e9 l\u2019analyse appropri\u00e9e quant au calcul des indemnit\u00e9s pour pertes de salaire. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 1134, le juge Pelletier, s\u2019exprimant au nom de la Cour, pr\u00e9cise que la principale chose \u00e0 examiner dans un tel cas est la question de savoir s\u2019il existe un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre les pertes de salaire et les actes de discrimination. Les principes qui limitent le recouvrement de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats dans les proc\u00e8s civils, comme l\u2019\u00e9loignement ou la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9, ne s\u2019appliquent pas. On peut exiger de l\u2019auteur du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il indemnise sa victime pour les pertes que sa conduite a caus\u00e9es, m\u00eame si ces pertes avaient pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9vues. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire au Tribunal. Il pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un Tribunal peut ordonner une indemnisation de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire. L\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 des principes (Chopra, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 37). De plus, bien qu\u2019un Tribunal puisse examiner si la victime a pris des mesures pour limiter ses pertes, il n\u2019est pas obligatoire de tenir compte d\u2019une telle limitation. Le Tribunal peut tenir compte de la limitation s\u2019il d\u00e9termine que c\u2019est appropri\u00e9 compte tenu des circonstances.\n[96] M. Willoughby n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de se trouver un emploi qu\u2019en juillet 2004. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019abord \u00e9motionnellement atterr\u00e9 par le comportement de la SCP et qu\u2019il a eu par la suite de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se trouver un emploi en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences. Je conclus que M. Willoughby a raisonnablement tent\u00e9 de limiter ses pertes en se cherchant un autre emploi. Je conclus aussi que les actes discriminatoires de la SCP \u00e9taient la cause de la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle M. Willoughby a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans emploi. Si la SCP n\u2019avait pas refus\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer, M. Willoughby aurait toujours eu un emploi. M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 un nouvel emploi en juillet 2004. Je crois qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour les pertes de salaire \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 il a cess\u00e9 de travailler pour la SCP en avril 2002 jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Mill Woods Suzuki en juillet 2004 est appropri\u00e9e.\n[97] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la SCP d\u2019indemniser M. Willoughby pour le salaire qu\u2019il a perdu en raison de sa perte d\u2019emploi, le 15 avril 2002, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler en juillet 2004. Toute prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ou autre prestation et tout revenu d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u pendant cette p\u00e9riode seront d\u00e9duits de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ou seront rembours\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9metteur. De plus, la SCP paiera \u00e0 M. Willoughby tout avantage reli\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb recevoir pendant cette p\u00e9riode, y compris le montant que la SCP aurait vers\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime de pension de M. Willoughby, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[98] M. Willoughby a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour les 95 jours de prestation de maladie qu\u2019il a perdus. On ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve selon laquelle les employ\u00e9s de la SCP ont droit, lorsqu\u2019ils quittent leur emploi au sein de la SCP, \u00e0 une compensation financi\u00e8re pour les jours de cong\u00e9 de maladie qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas utilis\u00e9s et, par cons\u00e9quent, je ne rendrai pas une telle ordonnance.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [99] M. Willoughby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le refus de la SCP de l\u2019affecter \u00e0 un quart de travail de jour en mars 2002, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u une lettre de son m\u00e9decin qui pr\u00e9cisait cette restriction, a eu un effet tel que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, tant mental que physique, a continu\u00e9 de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer.\n[100] M. Willoughby a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 des r\u00e9percussions \u00e9motionnelles qu\u2019il a subies lorsque la SCP a refus\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer, d\u2019abord en avril 2002 et de nouveau en f\u00e9vrier 2003. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait senti atterr\u00e9, trahi par son employeur, qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait cru sans valeur et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9prim\u00e9. Il a soutenu que ses sympt\u00f4mes psychologiques s\u2019\u00e9taient aggrav\u00e9s. Les tribunaux ont reconnu que l\u2019emploi est une composante essentielle du sens de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la personne, de sa valorisation et de son bien-\u00eatre sur le plan \u00e9motionnel (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alb.), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 313, \u00e0 la page 368). Je conclus que le comportement de la SCP a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral important \u00e0 M. Willoughby.\n[101] J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la SCP de payer \u00e0 M. Willoughby une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour son pr\u00e9judice moral.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [102] Le plaignant demande une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. En vertu de la LCDP, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 (paragraphe 53(3)). J\u2019ai conclu que la SCP savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas trait\u00e9 la question de l\u2019accommodement de M. Willoughby de la fa\u00e7on prescrite par le principe \u00e9tabli dans Meiorin. Le comportement de la SCP \u00e9tait soit d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, soit inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je conclus qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale est justifi\u00e9e et j\u2019accorde 10 000 $.\nD. Frais juridiques [103] Le plaignant me demande d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer les frais juridiques qu\u2019il a engag\u00e9s au cours de la proc\u00e9dure. Les alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) et 53(2)d) donnent tous les deux au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner, entre autres, l\u2019indemnisation de la victime de la totalit\u00e9 [\u2026] des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte , s\u2019il juge la plainte fond\u00e9e.\n[104] Le membre Sinclair a r\u00e9cemment examin\u00e9 attentivement la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce sujet (Mowat c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 49). Il a conclu qu\u2019il ressort de la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'adjuger des frais juridiques en vertu du paragraphe 53(2).\n[105] Je souscris \u00e0 cette conclusion et je suis de plus persuad\u00e9 que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger des frais juridiques, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish (maintenant juge \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) dans la d\u00e9cision Nkwazi c. Canada (Services correctionnels), [2001] T.C.D.P. no 29. La pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish a not\u00e9 que, compte tenu de son statut fondamental et quasi-constitutionnel, il faut donner \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale conforme \u00e0 son but, non seulement en ce qui a trait aux droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu de cette l\u00e9gislation, mais aussi en ce qui a trait aux pouvoirs qu\u2019elle accorde en mati\u00e8re de redressement (Nkwazi, au paragraphe 13; voir aussi Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, \u00e0 la page 1136; Robichaud c. La Reine, [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84).\n[106] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Chopra ne traite pas express\u00e9ment de la question des frais juridiques. Cependant, la d\u00e9cision examine l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation appropri\u00e9e de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), qui est l\u2019une des parties de la LCDP qui donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger des frais juridiques. Le juge Pelletier pr\u00e9cise que la principale question \u00e0 examiner dans le cadre de cet alin\u00e9a est celle de savoir s\u2019il existe un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es et l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Les questions telles que l\u2019\u00e9loignement ou la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019appliquent pas. On peut examiner la question de la limitation, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, mais il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment obligatoire de l\u2019analyse.\n[107] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019ai conclu que chacune des trois all\u00e9gations \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. Je conclus que les actes discriminatoires de la SCP ont entra\u00een\u00e9 des frais juridiques pour M. Willoughby pour la poursuite de sa plainte. Je conclus que, compte tenu des circonstances, il convient de rembourser les frais juridiques raisonnables de M. Willoughby li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa plainte et je rends une ordonnance en ce sens.\nE.

Je n\u2019accorde pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les frais juridiques parce que je conclus, en me fondant sur la d\u00e9cision du membre Sinclair, que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9pense au sens du paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP.

Par un geste de la main, le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019interrompre son interrogatoire du Dr. Dufour. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a pu alors observer pendant 20 minutes Me Montreuil dormir, la t\u00eate inclin\u00e9e sur sa poitrine. Durant cette p\u00e9riode de 20 minutes, aucune des personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans la salle d\u2019audience, soit le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, le greffier, les deux procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la procureure de la Commission et le t\u00e9moin n\u2019ont fait le moindre bruit, observant un silence complet. Ce n\u2019est que vers 10.55 heures que Me Montreuil est finalement sortie de son sommeil.\n[2] [2] Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a alors fait savoir \u00e0 Me Montreuil qu\u2019elle avait dormi pendant une p\u00e9riode de 20 minutes et que durant tout ce temps, le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal ainsi que les autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans la salle d\u2019audience avaient pu observer ce fait. Du reste, l\u2019enregistrement audio qui ne fut pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 durant cette p\u00e9riode de 20 minutes d\u00e9montre qu\u2019aucune parole ne fut prononc\u00e9e durant cette p\u00e9riode de temps dans la salle d\u2019audience. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a, par ailleurs, indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Me Montreuil qu\u2019elle ne serait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 contre-interroger le Dr. Dufour, son absence mentale durant l\u2019interrogatoire de celle-ci ne lui permettant pas de suivre ad\u00e9quatement le t\u00e9moignage de cette derni\u00e8re et de mener un contre-interrogatoire efficace. Le Tribunal a alors indiqu\u00e9 aux parties qu\u2019il motiverait sa d\u00e9cision.\n[3] Quelques vingt minutes apr\u00e8s la reprise de l\u2019audience, le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a not\u00e9 que Me Montreuil somnolait. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a de nouveau interrompu le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Dufour pour signifier \u00e0 Me Montreuil qu\u2019elle avait un comportement inacceptable. Me Montreuil a alors expliqu\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de torpeur par le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas dormi depuis pr\u00e8s de 28 heures, ayant \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer des documents pour la pr\u00e9sente instance, des examens pour ses \u00e9tudiants, etc. En outre, Me Montreuil a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la voix excessivement douce du t\u00e9moin avait sur elle un effet soporiphique.\n[4] Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a alors rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Me Montreuil que la salle d\u2019audience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un dortoir et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inacceptable pour un procureur de ne pas \u00eatre attentif aux d\u00e9bats qui ont cours dans une salle d\u2019audience et \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin qu\u2019elle est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 contre-interroger. Le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a alors exig\u00e9 de Me Montreuil qu\u2019elle choisisse entre \u00eatre totalement pr\u00e9sente devant le Tribunal ou s\u2019excuser pour aller se reposer \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d\u2019audience. Me Montreuil a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter la salle d\u2019audience.\n[5] Dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi du 17 octobre, le Tribunal a pu observer que Me Montreuil n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la reprise de l\u2019audience pour la poursuite de l\u2019interrogatoire du Dr. Dufour. Me Montreuil \u00e9tait toutefois pr\u00e9sente lors de la reprise de l\u2019audience apr\u00e8s la pause de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi.\n[6] Il va sans dire que, dans le cadre d\u2019une audience, tant la pr\u00e9sence physique que la pr\u00e9sence en esprit d\u2019un procureur, est requise si celui-ci est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au contre-interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin. Le fait pour un procureur, qui est \u00e9galement une partie, de dormir en cours d\u2019audience est une conduite irrespectueuse tant en ce qui concerne le Tribunal qu\u2019en ce qui concerne le t\u00e9moin, les confr\u00e8res, leur client et l\u2019administration de la justice. Il est, en fait, inacceptable qu\u2019un membre du Barreau ait un comportement aussi d\u00e9sobligeant et irrespectueux que celui qu\u2019a eu Me Montreuil.\n[7] En tant que membre du Barreau, Me Montreuil doit conna\u00eetre le d\u00e9corum qu\u2019il importe de maintenir devant un Tribunal, quel qu\u2019il soit. Les raisons formul\u00e9es ex post facto par Me Montreuil pour expliquer sa conduite ne tiennent pas la route. Ses multiples activit\u00e9s professionnelles ne peuvent d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on justifier une conduite aussi irr\u00e9v\u00e9rencieuse et irrespectueuse que celle qu\u2019elle a eue devant le Tribunal. La conduite qu\u2019elle a eue, dans la matin\u00e9e du 17 octobre 2007, a, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal, compromis son habilet\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer ses fonctions d\u2019avocat, du moins en ce qui a trait au contre-interrogatoire du Dr. Dufour.\n[8] En cons\u00e9quence, consid\u00e9rant que Me Montreuil n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que lors de l\u2019audience du 17 octobre 2007 en matin\u00e9e, elle suivait de fa\u00e7on attentive le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Dufour, t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir, en temps opportun, mener un contre-interrogatoire pertinent et efficace mais qu\u2019au contraire, elle \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait, \u00e0 toute fin utile, de suivre le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Dufour et d\u2019en saisir la teneur, le Tribunal retire \u00e0 Me Montreuil son droit de contre-interroger le Dr. Dufour. Seule la procureure de la Commission est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 contre-interroger le Dr. Dufour.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 25 octobre 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1047\/2805\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Par sa demande, Me Montreuil demande, en outre, que Me Lamb soit exclu du Tribunal (sic) pour le reste des auditions.\n[2] \u00c0 cette demande est jointe une autre demande visant \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les Forces canadiennes, de payer \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 336.10$ en remboursement de frais encourus pour un d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al en mai 2006 pour y \u00eatre interview\u00e9e par les Dr. Assalian, Wilcheschy et Dufour.\n[3] S\u00e9ance tenante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate verbale en irrecevabilit\u00e9 des demandes formul\u00e9es par la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque deux motifs quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et un motif quant au versement de la somme de 336.10$.\n[4] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient d\u2019abord que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur cette mati\u00e8re et qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres instances pour traiter des questions soulev\u00e9es par la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient ensuite que la demande de la plaignante est une proc\u00e9dure abusive qui n\u2019a aucun fondement en droit.\n[5] En ce qui a trait au versement de la somme de 336.10$, repr\u00e9sentant le montant des frais encourus par la plaignante lors de son d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour y \u00eatre interview\u00e9e par les Dr. Assalian, Wilchesky et Dufour, l\u2019intim\u00e9e plaide que cette question devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ult\u00e9rieurement, soit lors des d\u00e9bats sur les redressements.\n[6] Le Tribunal a, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les procureurs, rendu jugement s\u00e9ance tenante. Le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate verbale en irrecevabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, motifs \u00e0 suivre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re demande de la plaignante. Le Tribunal a report\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur la somme de 336.10$ apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il aura entendu les parties sur la question des redressements.\n[7] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision fait \u00e9tat des motifs qui ont amen\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 rejeter la premi\u00e8re demande de la plaignante relative \u00e0 la conduite de Me Lamb.\n[8] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante demande au Tribunal de trouver Me Lamb coupable de non-respect de ses obligations professionnelles et \u00e9thiques de m\u00eame que d\u2019avoir agi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de mani\u00e8re sournoise et malhonn\u00eate pour tromper la plaignante. Elle demande l\u2019exclusion de Me Lamb pour le reste des audiences.\n[9] La plaignante, qui est procureur, doit savoir que les manquements \u00e0 la d\u00e9ontologie professionnelle, car c\u2019est de cela dont il s\u2019agit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sont du ressort du syndic du Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec et non d\u2019un Tribunal comme le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal. Si la plaignante croit que Me Lamb a agi de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations professionnelles, la plaignante n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 porter plainte aupr\u00e8s du syndic du Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec. Le Tribunal n\u2019a aucune comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9clarer un procureur coupable d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 la d\u00e9ontologie professionnelle. (Emphase mise)\n[10] Par ailleurs, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9sente demande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019un des procureurs des Forces canadiennes constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal n\u2019a aucune autorit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9clarer un procureur coupable de non respect de ses obligations professionnelles et \u00e9thiques ou d\u2019avoir agi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de mani\u00e8re sournoise et malhonn\u00eate pour tromper la plaignante. Ceci impliquerait la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une preuve de la part de la plaignante, ainsi que d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de la part de Me Lamb. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le Tribunal ne poss\u00e8de pas la comp\u00e9tence pour pr\u00e9sider une telle audition.\n[11] Cela dit, la demande d\u2019exclure Me Lamb du Tribunal pour le reste des auditions n\u2019a aucun fondement juridique, aucune base l\u00e9gale et ne fait aucun sens. Elle constitue de la part de Me Montreuil une demande tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9raisonnable et t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une m\u00e9connaisance totale des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et du droit applicable.\n[12] Une partie ne peut, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, pr\u00e9senter des proc\u00e9dures intempestives et demander des ordonnances \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re. C\u2019est ce que fait Me Montreuil en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les conclusions recherch\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par celle-ci constituent un non sequitur par rapport aux all\u00e9gations.\n[13] Plut\u00f4t que de pr\u00e9senter des demandes de la nature de la demande visant Me Lamb, Me Montreuil aurait tout avantage \u00e0 se concentrer sur les aspects plus fondamentaux de sa plainte. En ce faisant, elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e0 travailler jour et nuit et serait en mesure d\u2019offrir une pr\u00e9sence de qualit\u00e9 lors des audiences.\n[14] Par ailleurs, si Me Montreuil croit qu\u2019une entente est intervenue entre elle et le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en ce qui concerne son d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour rencontrer les Dr. Assalian, Wilchesky et Dufour et que l\u2019entente n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9e, elle n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 plaider l\u2019existence d\u2019une entente m\u00eame verbale et son non respect en temps opportun. Le Tribunal pourra alors d\u00e9terminer si une telle entente existe et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der au remboursement des frais r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\n[15] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate en irrecevabilit\u00e9 du procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est accueillie et la demande de Me Montreuil de d\u00e9clarer Me Guy Lamb, l\u2019un des procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, coupable de non respet de ses obligations professionnelles et \u00e9thiques, d\u2019avoir agi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de mani\u00e8re sournoise et malhonn\u00eate pour tromper la plaignante et de l\u2019exclure des auditions est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 25 octobre 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1047\/2805\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Grant Sinclair\nDate : Le 25 octobre 2007\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2007 TCDP 48\nAir Canada\u2019s Motion [1] Air Canada d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate demandant au Tribunal de suspendre en permanence l\u2019audition de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u2019Eddy Morten, qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP) le 19 septembre 2005. La CCDP a soumis cette plainte au Tribunal le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007.\nM. Morten et sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne [2] Dans sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne, M. Morten soutient qu\u2019Air Canada l\u2019oblige \u00e0 voyager avec un accompagnateur, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019obligations de ce genre pour les personnes non d\u00e9ficientes. Il fait valoir qu\u2019en agissant ainsi, Air Canada pose des actes discriminatoires contre lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\n[3] M. Morten se d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un homme de 43 ans qui est sourd et aveugle. Il a une certaine vision tubulaire et il vit de fa\u00e7on tout \u00e0 fait ind\u00e9pendante, sans soins \u00e0 domicile. En ao\u00fbt 2004, M. Morten a achet\u00e9 un billet d\u2019avion d\u2019Air Canada par l\u2019entremise de son agence de voyage pour se rendre de Vancouver \u00e0 San Francisco. Il s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu seul en Europe deux fois, et aux \u00c9tats-Unis de nombreuses fois \u00e0 bord d\u2019Air Canada et d\u2019autres transporteurs a\u00e9riens.\n[4] Environ deux semaines apr\u00e8s sa r\u00e9servation de vol, son agence de voyage l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada ne lui permettait pas de prendre le vol pour San Francisco s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019accompagnateur. Il n\u2019a pas fait son voyage.\n[5] M. Morten n\u2019a pas d\u2019accompagnateur et n\u2019a pas les moyens de payer des frais d\u2019accompagnateur. Qui plus est, il croit fermement qu\u2019il est tout \u00e0 fait capable de prendre l\u2019avion seul et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019un accompagnateur.\nLa d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Office des transports du Canada [6] En f\u00e9vrier 2005, M. Morten a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 l\u2019Office des transports du Canada (l\u2019Office) en vertu de la Loi sur les transports du Canada (LTC). Il soutenait que l\u2019exigence d\u2019Air Canada selon laquelle il devait voyager avec un accompagnateur constituait un obstacle abusif \u00e0 ses d\u00e9placements.\n[7] L\u2019Office a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 8 juillet 2005. Il a convenu que l\u2019exigence d\u2019Air Canada constituait un obstacle aux d\u00e9placements de M. Morten. Mais l\u2019Office a aussi conclu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un obstacle abusif. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019Office n\u2019a pris aucune mesure au sujet de la demande de M. Morten.\n[8] Air Canada soutient que les questions que M. Morten soul\u00e8ve dans sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne sont les m\u00eames qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par l\u2019Office et qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas \u00eatre remises en litige. Air Canada fait valoir qu\u2019il y a pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige, contestation parall\u00e8le et abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[9] M. Morten a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 l\u2019Office en vertu de la partie V de la LTC. L\u2019article 172 pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019Office, sur demande, peut d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un obstacle abusif aux possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9placement des personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience qui utilisent le r\u00e9seau de transports de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Si l\u2019Office conclut que c\u2019est le cas, il peut exiger la prise de mesures correctives indiqu\u00e9es ou le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 destin\u00e9e \u00e0 couvrir les frais support\u00e9s par une personne ayant une d\u00e9ficience en raison de l\u2019obstacle en cause, ou les deux.\n[10] La partie V de la LTC doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e conjointement avec l\u2019article 5 de la LTC, qui \u00e9nonce la politique nationale des transports du Canada. En particulier, le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 5g)(ii) pr\u00e9voit que les liaisons assur\u00e9es par chaque transporteur ou mode de transport s\u2019effectuent, dans la mesure du possible, selon des modalit\u00e9s qui ne constituent pas un obstacle abusif \u00e0 la circulation des personnes, y compris les personnes ayant une d\u00e9ficience.\n[11] Tant M. Morten qu\u2019Air Canada ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e0 l\u2019Office au sujet de l\u2019exigence d\u2019Air Canada selon laquelle il devait voyager avec un accompagnateur. Avant d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision, l\u2019Office a not\u00e9 qu\u2019Air Canada avait consult\u00e9 l\u2019agence de voyage et le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Morten au sujet de sa d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 la suite de ces consultations, Air Canada a conclu que M. Morten n\u2019\u00e9tait pas [Traduction] autonome et qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019un accompagnateur. Selon le tarif applicable d\u2019Air Canada, une personne [Traduction] non autonome est une personne qui n\u2019est pas ind\u00e9pendante et n\u2019est pas capable de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins lors d\u2019un vol ou lors d\u2019une \u00e9vacuation ou d\u2019une d\u00e9compression d\u2019urgence, et qui requiert une aide sp\u00e9ciale ou inhabituelle autrement que pour monter dans l\u2019avion ou en descendre.\n[12] Quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019exigence d\u2019Air Canada constituait un obstacle abusif , l\u2019Office a accept\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019Air Canada au sujet des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui pourraient survenir dans le cas d\u2019une \u00e9vacuation ou d\u2019une d\u00e9compression d\u2019urgence. Air Canada est d\u2019avis que, dans une telle situation, M. Morten pourrait nuire non seulement \u00e0 sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9, mais \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de tous les passagers. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 collective des passagers et de l\u2019\u00e9quipage doit avoir priorit\u00e9 sur les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles d\u2019un passager.\nL\u2019Office et les principes des droits de la personne [13] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CCD c. Via Rail, rendu en 2007, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tabli que le crit\u00e8re permettant de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a obstacle abusif au d\u00e9placement, au sens de la LTC, est le m\u00eame que le crit\u00e8re permettant de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a contrainte excessive au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP. Afin de d\u00e9finir et de cibler les obstacles abusifs dans le contexte des transports, l\u2019Office doit appliquer les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP (Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficience c. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2007 CSC 15, au paragraphe 115).\n[14] Lorsqu\u2019un employeur ou un fournisseur de services tente de justifier, au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la LCDP, une politique ou une pratique qui, autrement, serait discriminatoire, il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles qui ne lui causent pas de contrainte excessive.\n[15] La Cour supr\u00eame a examin\u00e9 dans plusieurs arr\u00eats les principes des droits de la personne au sujet de ce qui constitue une contrainte excessive. Ces arr\u00eats se r\u00e9sument comme suit. Lorsqu\u2019il y a obstacle au d\u00e9placement d\u2019une personne, l\u2019obstacle ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9 que s\u2019il est impossible d\u2019adapter la situation pour cette personne sans causer de contrainte excessive \u00e0 la personne qui a impos\u00e9 l\u2019obstacle. Il y a contrainte excessive lorsque toutes les possibilit\u00e9s raisonnables d\u2019accommodement sont \u00e9puis\u00e9es et qu\u2019il ne reste que des options d\u00e9raisonnables ou impraticables d\u2019accommodement (Via Rail, aux paragraphes 129 et 130).\n[16] Pour que l\u2019Office puisse conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019obstacle abusif au d\u00e9placement d\u2019une personne d\u00e9ficiente, il doit \u00eatre convaincu qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune autre solution raisonnable que celle de cr\u00e9er un obstacle \u00e0 cette personne. La personne qui a impos\u00e9 l\u2019obstacle a le fardeau de convaincre l\u2019Office.\nLa pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige [17] Le contexte \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, je me pencherai donc sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige afin de d\u00e9terminer si elle s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Pour qu\u2019il y ait pr\u00e9clusion, il faut satisfaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 trois conditions :\nla m\u00eame question est en litige dans les deux instances; la d\u00e9cision juridique qui cr\u00e9e la pr\u00e9clusion est d\u00e9finitive; les parties ou les ayants droit sont les m\u00eames dans les deux instances.\n[18] Cependant, m\u00eame s\u2019il est satisfait \u00e0 ces conditions, une cour ou un tribunal doit d\u00e9cider, de fa\u00e7on discr\u00e9tionnaire, si la pr\u00e9clusion doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire (Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 CSC 44, aux paragraphes 25 et 33).\n[19] Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me condition. Les parties dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Office \u00e9taient M. Morten et Air Canada. Les parties au litige relatif aux droits de la personne sont M. Morten, Air Canada et la CCDP. Les parties sont donc diff\u00e9rentes.\n[20] La CCDP ne peut, en aucun cas, \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019ayant droit de M. Morten. L\u2019article 51 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit clairement que lorsque la CCDP compara\u00eet lors d\u2019une audience, elle repr\u00e9sente l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et non le plaignant.\n[21] En effet, \u00e0 ce sujet, Air Canada fait simplement valoir que [Traduction] bien que la Commission ait maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal, \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, nous soutenons qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 ce volet du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige . L\u2019observation d\u2019Air Canada reconna\u00eet le r\u00f4le de la CCDP comme repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et admet, de fa\u00e7on implicite, que les parties ne sont pas les m\u00eames. C\u2019est tout ce que cette observation apporte \u00e0 la question.\n[22] La seconde \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, soit l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, n\u2019entre en jeu que lorsqu\u2019il est satisfait \u00e0 toutes les conditions de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape. Comme les parties sont diff\u00e9rentes dans les deux instances, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 examiner la question de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige.\nL\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure [23] L\u2019objectif de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est de pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus juridictionnel par la promotion de certains principes : \u00e9conomie des ressources juridictionnelles, de m\u00eame que coh\u00e9rence et caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions. Une nouvelle instance peut avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables. Rien ne garantit qu\u2019elle permettra d\u2019arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat plus correct qu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re fois. Elle peut arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat contradictoire et \u00e0 un gaspillage des ressources, de m\u00eame qu\u2019entra\u00eener des d\u00e9penses inutiles pour les parties (Toronto c. S.C.F.P., 2003 CSC 63, aux paragraphes 37 et 51).\n[24] Cependant, dans certaines affaires, l\u2019interdiction d\u2019engager une nouvelle instance pourrait entra\u00eener une iniquit\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9er une injustice. Dans de tels cas, cela l\u2019emporterait sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'il y a \u00e0 maintenir l'irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision initiale (Toronto c. S.C.F.P., au paragraphe 63).\n[25] Deux motifs imp\u00e9rieux militent contre \u00e0 l\u2019application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et la suspension de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Premi\u00e8rement, la CCDP participe \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure au sujet de la plainte de M. Morten. La loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019elle a le droit de pr\u00e9senter des preuves et de repr\u00e9senter l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vention et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination (articles 2 et 51 de la LCDP).\n[26] La CCDP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de l\u2019Office et n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de promouvoir l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9fini dans l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019Office a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans la participation de la CCDP.\n[27] Deuxi\u00e8mement, il ressort clairement de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Office que son analyse de la plainte de M. Morten est loin de satisfaire aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Via Rail. La plainte de M. Morten au sujet des services, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, est actuelle et attaque une politique d\u2019Air Canada qui est toujours en place.\n[28] Il serait injuste de priver M. Morten et la CCDP de l\u2019occasion d\u2019imposer \u00e0 Air Canada le fardeau de prouver son argument selon lequel r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de M. Morten ou de personnes qui ont des besoins semblables causerait \u00e0 la compagnie une contrainte excessive au sens de la LCDP.\nLa contestation parall\u00e8le [29] La r\u00e8gle interdisant la contestation parall\u00e8le existe pour que soit \u00e9vit\u00e9e une contestation, lors d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure ult\u00e9rieure, de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance judiciaire rendue par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent. Cette r\u00e8gle porte sur la contestation de l\u2019ordonnance m\u00eame et de son effet juridique (Toronto c. S.C.F.P., aux paragraphes 33 et 34; Danyluk, au paragraphe 20). Ce n\u2019est pas le cas en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte relative aux droits de la personne de M. Morten. La plainte ne vise pas \u00e0 contester, devant le Tribunal, la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Office.\nConclusion [30] Air Canada n\u2019a pas satisfait aux trois conditions d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9clusion pour m\u00eame question en litige. Le fait de poursuive l\u2019\u00e9tude de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne de M. Morten ne constitue pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La r\u00e8gle interdisant la contestation parall\u00e8le ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[31] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Introduction [1] Le plaignant, Richard Warman, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte le 6 janvier 2005, dans laquelle il soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Jessica Beaumont, a commis des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, ou la d\u00e9ficience contre une personne ou un groupe de personnes, en communiquant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e des messages sur un site Web. Il soutient que ces messages sont susceptibles d\u2019exposer [Traduction] \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les Ras-Tafaris, les Juifs, les homosexuels et les lesbiennes, les Chinois, les Hispaniques, les noirs, les Autochtones et autres personnes de couleur , en contravention de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat. M. Warman et Mme Beaumont \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des avocats, mais Mme Beaumont avait l\u2019aide d\u2019un agent, Paul Fromm, qui n\u2019est pas avocat. M. Fromm a expliqu\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour lui offrir une certaine aide , puisqu\u2019il avait particip\u00e9 comme intervenant dans un certain nombre de cas portant sur l\u2019article 13 de la Loi. M. Fromm a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas offrir \u00e0 Mme Beaumont de [Traduction] conseils juridiques ad\u00e9quats . \u00c0 titre d\u2019agent, il a fait une d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire, a interrog\u00e9 et contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 les t\u00e9moins et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations finales au nom de Mme Beaumont.\nII. Analyse A. L\u2019article 13 de la Loi [3] Afin de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination au sens du paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi, il faut \u00e9tablir qu\u2019une personne ou un groupe de personnes agissant d\u2019un commun accord a utilis\u00e9 ou fait utiliser un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en recourant ou en faisant recourir aux services d'une entreprise de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement pour aborder ou faire aborder des questions susceptibles d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d\u2019un motif de discrimination illicite.\n[4] Le paragraphe 13(2) pr\u00e9cise que le paragraphe 13(1) s'applique \u00e0 l'utilisation d'Internet.\nB. Quels sont les messages contest\u00e9s que Mme Beaumont aurait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment communiqu\u00e9s? [5] M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de janvier 2004, il a lu la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e propagande haineuse principalement sur un site Web am\u00e9ricain du nom de Stormfront.org . Ce site Web est constitu\u00e9 principalement d\u2019un babillard \u00e9lectronique sur lequel des personnes affichent des messages qui peuvent \u00eatre lus par tous sur Internet. Ce site est divis\u00e9 en un certain nombre de sections, qui sont elles-m\u00eames divis\u00e9es en de nombreux niveaux de sous-sections (aussi connus sous les noms de sous\u2011forums, de fils de discussions, de th\u00e8mes ou de discussions). L\u2019une des sections du babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org est d\u00e9di\u00e9e aux questions canadiennes et s\u2019intitule Stormfront Canada .\n[6] Les personnes qui souhaitent afficher des messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org doivent d\u2019abord s\u2019inscrire en tant que membres. Elles peuvent alors \u00e9crire des messages sur tous les sous-forums. Elles peuvent m\u00eame cr\u00e9er de nouveaux sous\u2011forums sur lesquels elles \u00e9crivent un premier message qui peut alors \u00eatre lu par tous sur Internet. D\u2019autres membres du babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org peuvent ensuite afficher leur propre message sur le sous-forum.\n[7] Les membres ont le choix d\u2019afficher leur v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs messages ou d\u2019utiliser plut\u00f4t des pseudonymes. Mme Beaumont a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle affichait des messages sur Stormfront.org sous le pseudonyme Jessy Destruction . Les notes en marge des messages indiquent habituellement la date \u00e0 laquelle le membre s\u2019est inscrit au groupe de discussions et le nombre de messages qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit \u00e0 ce jour. Pour Mme Beaumont, la date d\u2019inscription affich\u00e9e est en octobre 2003. Un des messages d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 5 mai 2006. Les notes en marge de ce message indiquent qu\u2019elle avait affich\u00e9 1 023 messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org \u00e0 ce moment.\n[8] Habituellement, les notes en marge affichent aussi le lieu o\u00f9 se trouve le membre, qu\u2019il choisit lui-m\u00eame. Dans une grande partie de ses messages, Mme Beaumont a inscrit comme lieu [Traduction] au pays des blancs endoctrin\u00e9s . Dans d\u2019autres messages, le lieu est simplement Coquitlam, C.-B., Canada .\n[9] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, M. Warman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve des copies imprim\u00e9es des messages contest\u00e9s, affich\u00e9s par Jessy Destruction . Je r\u00e9sumerai la plupart d\u2019entre-eux ci-dessous. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Beaumont a reconnu qu\u2019elle avait affich\u00e9 presque tous ces messages, sauf deux qu\u2019elle ne se rappelle pas avoir affich\u00e9s. Il y avait quelques erreurs d\u2019orthographe ou de typographie dans la plupart des messages. Plut\u00f4t que de mentionner chaque erreur, j\u2019ai simplement reproduit les textes tels qu\u2019ils apparaissaient sur les copies imprim\u00e9es produites en preuve.\nLe 1er message \u2013 24 janvier 2004\n[10] Ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Les bandes : deux poids, deux mesures . Le membre qui a lanc\u00e9 ce sujet soutenait que le terme [Traduction] raciste \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 des [Traduction] bandes compos\u00e9es de [Traduction] personnes blanches , mais non \u00e0 celles compos\u00e9es de [Traduction] non blancs . Un autre membre partie \u00e0 la discussion avait mentionn\u00e9 un incident lors duquel son [Traduction] clan et lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9s d\u2019un bar parce qu\u2019ils portaient [Traduction] des bottes et des blousons d'aviateurs qui arboraient des croix gamm\u00e9es . Il semble que Mme Beaumont se trouvait sur place lors de l\u2019incident puisque, dans le message qu\u2019elle a affich\u00e9, elle se plaignait du fait que [Traduction] si nous \u00e9tions des n\u00e8gres, alors nous aurions seulement \u00e9t\u00e9 des noirs qui fl\u00e2nent et qui mangent .\nLe 2e message \u2013 25 janvier 2004\n[11] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un des messages que Mme Beaumont ne se rappelle pas avoir affich\u00e9s. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Les Noirs dans l\u2019Ouest canadien? . La discussion portait sur une comparaison entre les concentrations de Noirs dans l\u2019Ouest canadien par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario. La note en marge indiquait que ce message avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 par Jessy Destruction. Le message dit : [Traduction] \u00c7a pourrait \u00eatre pire. Croisons-nous les doigts et esp\u00e9rons qu\u2019ils meurent tous du SIDA.\nLe 3e message \u2013 28 janvier 2004\n[12] Il s\u2019agit du deuxi\u00e8me message que Mme Beaumont ne se rappelle pas avoir affich\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum au sujet des relations de couple interraciales. Un des participants au sous-forum a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres comment ils r\u00e9agiraient si un de leurs proches commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter une personne de couleur . Un des messages en r\u00e9ponse, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 par Jessy Destruction, disait : [Traduction] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit \u00e0 ma s\u0153ur que je le tuerais et que je la battrais, elle sait aussi que je le ferais\u2026 mais elle dit que les noirs ont un dr\u00f4le d\u2019air, alors je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 m\u2019inqui\u00e9ter.\nLe 4e message \u2013 20 mai 2004\n[13] Ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Au sujet de Calgary (Alberta) . Il y \u00e9tait \u00e9crit :\n[Traduction]\nAaah Marcus, le seul n\u00e8gre qui allait aux concerts punks.

Je ne vais plus aux concerts, \u00e0 moins que ce soit a) un TR\u00c8S TR\u00c8S bon groupe ou b) que la bi\u00e8re ne soit pas ch\u00e8re.\nLe contexte du message n\u2019est pas clair, puisque le message affich\u00e9 avant celui de Mme Beaumont n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve. Cependant, Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a grandi \u00e0 Calgary. Elle a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 en Colombie-Britannique pendant quelques ann\u00e9es avant de revenir \u00e0 Calgary en 2006.\nLe 5e message \u2013 10 juin 2004\n[14] Dans un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Site Web Britkids , il y avait une discussion au sujet d\u2019un site Web portant sur les jeunes en Grande-Bretagne. Le membre qui a lanc\u00e9 le sous-forum a expliqu\u00e9 que, des neufs jeunes en vedette sur le site Web, un seul \u00e9tait de [Traduction] descendance europ\u00e9enne blanche . Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 un message qui faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un extrait de ce site Web dans lequel un de ces jeunes Britanniques d\u00e9clarait \u00eatre un Ras-Tafari. Mme Beaumont a ajout\u00e9 le commentaire suivant :\n[Traduction]\nC\u2019est au sujet de la religion de ce petit n\u00e8gre. Le site est d\u00e9go\u00fbtant, \u00e7a m\u2019inqui\u00e8te vraiment, surtout avec ce qu\u2019on essaie de faire avaler \u00e0 mes s\u0153urs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.\nLe 6e message \u2013 24 juin 2004\n[15] Ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Mes frustrations au sujet de la semaine de la fiert\u00e9 gai \u00e0 TO . Le membre qui a lanc\u00e9 le sous\u2011forum critiquait la tenue de la semaine de la fiert\u00e9 gai \u00e0 Toronto. Dans son message sur ce sous-forum, Mme Beaumont a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[Traduction]\nJe crois que nous pouvons tous te comprendre \u00e0 ce sujet, il y a eu une semaine comme \u00e7a \u00e0 Calgary, je suis rest\u00e9e chez moi toute la semaine. Mais environ une semaine plus tard, je me suis rendue en ville et il y avait encore des banni\u00e8res de tapettes accroch\u00e9es partout en ville.\nLe 7e message \u2013 14 ao\u00fbt 2004\n[16] Ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Laissez les musulmanes porter leurs hijabs . La discussion portait sur une nouvelle selon laquelle le Premier ministre de l\u2019\u00e9poque, Paul Martin, croyait qu\u2019il fallait cesser la pratique en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport de Montr\u00e9al qui exigeait que les femmes musulmanes retirent leur voile pour le contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.

Le membre qui a lanc\u00e9 cette discussion \u00e9tait, semble-t-il, un \u00e9tudiant universitaire. Il se plaignait du fait qu\u2019il y avait, parmi les \u0153uvres d\u2019un artiste invit\u00e9 qui \u00e9taient affich\u00e9es \u00e0 son universit\u00e9, des photos de l\u2019artiste qui faisait une fellation \u00e0 un autre homme. Un autre membre du babillard \u00e9lectronique, dont le pseudonyme \u00e9tait Der Totenkopf , a r\u00e9pondu par un message dans lequel il disait que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de l\u2019art, mais plut\u00f4t [Traduction] une esp\u00e8ce de tapette arri\u00e9r\u00e9e mentale qui se pla\u00eet \u00e0 savoir que vous \u00eates oblig\u00e9s de regarder \u00e7a .\n[20] Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 son propre commentaire en r\u00e9ponse, mais il convient de noter que cette fois, elle a choisi de citer la remarque de l\u2019autre membre avant d\u2019ajouter la sienne.

Les quartiers am\u00e9ricains enti\u00e8rement blancs du pass\u00e9 \u00e9taient manifestement plus s\u00fbrs et il y avait beaucoup moins de crimes que dans les quartiers mixtes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui.

Toutes les grandes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du pass\u00e9, qui \u00e9taient blanches lorsqu\u2019elles ont gagn\u00e9 le pouvoir, ont d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on permanente lorsqu\u2019elles sont pass\u00e9es de cultures \u00e0 dominance blanche, \u00e0 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance mixte (p. ex. l\u2019\u00c9gypte, la Gr\u00e8ce, Rome, l\u2019Espagne, le Portugal).

Il est clair, hors de tout doute, que le fait de modifier la composition raciale des \u00c9tats-Unis, qui \u00e9tait domin\u00e9e par les blancs lorsque le pays est devenu puissant, pour que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 devienne mixte et plus diversifi\u00e9e sur le plan racial, sera catastrophique. Cela plongera la grande nation des \u00c9tats-Unis dans le m\u00eame gouffre o\u00f9 les autres grandes nations blanches du pass\u00e9 sont tomb\u00e9es. Compte tenu du vaste historique de la race noire, il est clair qu\u2019elle est incapable de cr\u00e9er ou de maintenir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019a jamais cr\u00e9\u00e9 de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e en Afrique. Dans tous les cas (comme Ha\u00efti) o\u00f9 on lui a donn\u00e9 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 florissante, elle l\u2019a tu\u00e9e, la repoussant au m\u00eame \u00e9tat primitif que son peuple a toujours connu, dans son Afrique d\u2019origine. (Quiconque est assez insens\u00e9 pour douter de l\u2019histoire, nous avons le triste spectacle de l\u2019Afrique du Sud qui se d\u00e9roule devant nous, qui devrait effacer tout doute.) L\u2019histoire nous a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la race noire ne peut pas cr\u00e9er ni maintenir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e par elle-m\u00eame. Ses membres, en tant que peuple, ne peuvent donc pas s\u2019int\u00e9grer \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e comme \u00eatres \u00e9gaux, habitant et travaillant aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de ceux qui non seulement sont capables de b\u00e2tir une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e, mais qui ont aussi b\u00e2ti de nombreuses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s du genre dans tous les climats et tous les types de terre. L\u2019histoire nous a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les peuples hispaniques sont aussi incapables de cr\u00e9er des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s avanc\u00e9es comme celles que les Blancs ont souvent cr\u00e9\u00e9es. Bien qu\u2019ils aient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 des capacit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures aux Noirs, en cr\u00e9ant leur propre langue \u00e9crite et quelques soci\u00e9t\u00e9s quelque peu avanc\u00e9es, ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capables de prendre les importantes ressources naturelles du continent sud-am\u00e9ricain et d\u2019en faire grand\u2011chose. L\u2019Espagne et le Portugal ont envoy\u00e9 des soldats dans les terres au sud du Rio Grande pour conqu\u00e9rir et s\u2019approprier la richesse de l\u2019endroit. Au lieu d\u2019envoyer des familles pour coloniser, les Espagnols ont \u00e9pous\u00e9 des femmes aborig\u00e8nes. La composition raciale des terres au sud du Rio Grande est faite d\u2019Am\u00e9rindiens, de Noirs, de m\u00e9tis et d\u2019un petit pourcentage de Blancs. Ces terres n\u2019ont jamais prosp\u00e9r\u00e9 comme celles des nations du Nord, que les Blancs ont colonis\u00e9es et o\u00f9 ils ont gard\u00e9 leur race intacte, se m\u00ealant rarement aux autres races. En c\u00e9l\u00e9brant la diversit\u00e9 , nous laissons entrer les Hispaniques et les Asiatiques en Am\u00e9rique blanche et nous laissons l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord devenir comme le continent sud-am\u00e9ricain. La grande richesse et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 stable des \u00c9tats-Unis blancs seront remplac\u00e9es par la pauvret\u00e9 et l\u2019instabilit\u00e9 des pays d\u00e9chir\u00e9s par la r\u00e9volution qui se trouvent au sud de notre fronti\u00e8re. M\u00eame si toutes les races \u00e9taient exactement pareilles, s\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence, le fait que les Blancs aient cr\u00e9\u00e9 les \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique signifie que nous avons tout \u00e0 fait le droit de restreindre l\u2019entr\u00e9e dans notre pays. Nous pouvons honorablement ne permettre qu\u2019aux immigrants blancs d\u2019y entrer ou m\u00eame aucun immigrant du tout. Le nombre de Blancs, en tant que pourcentage de la population mondiale, est tomb\u00e9 \u00e0 un seul chiffre et il d\u00e9gringole rapidement. Presque toutes les grandes nations blanches de la Terre acceptent maintenant de grands nombres d\u2019immigrants de couleur. La seule des trois grandes races de la Terre qui soit en v\u00e9ritable danger de devenir une minorit\u00e9 raciale dans sa propre demeure raciale est la race blanche. Cela pourrait facilement entra\u00eener l\u2019extermination de la race blanche. Ceux qui appuient la diversit\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine, l\u2019immigration de gens de couleur, le m\u00e9tissage, l\u2019int\u00e9gration et\/ou l\u2019action affirmative : 1) ignorent les faits importants susmentionn\u00e9s ou 2) sont de flagrants propagateurs de haine envers la race blanche et cherchent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9liminer de la surface de la plan\u00e8te.\n[28] Dans son deuxi\u00e8me message, qu\u2019elle a affich\u00e9 le lendemain sur le m\u00eame sous\u2011forum, Mme Beaumont a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [Traduction] aime aussi celui-ci .

Mais si c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment de la haine raciste, je ne comprends pas pourquoi quelqu\u2019un s\u2019attaquerait \u00e0 de pauvres chiens sans d\u00e9fense [plut\u00f4t] qu\u2019attaquer ces sales animaux juifs directement.\nLe 28e message \u2013 5 f\u00e9vrier 2006\n[42] Ce message a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 sur un sous-forum qui traitait apparemment d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 13, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Warman contre une autre personne. Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 le message suivant :\n[Traduction]\nJe suis contente d\u2019apprendre que tu vas mieux.

Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait membre de ce babillard \u00e9lectronique et qu\u2019elle y avait affich\u00e9 des messages. La Jessy Destruction qui affichait des messages sur BloodandHonour.com avait inscrit le m\u00eame lieu que Mme Beaumont avait inscrit sur Stormfront.org, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire Coquitlam, C.-B.\n[44] Ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur un sous-forum intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Winnicki \u00e9cope de 9 mois . Tomasz Winnicki avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 dans une autre plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 13 que M. Warman avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. La Commission avait obtenu une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle il devait cesser d\u2019afficher des messages sur Internet en attendant la d\u00e9cision finale du Tribunal au sujet de la plainte. M. Winnicki a viol\u00e9 cette ordonnance et la Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019outrage. Dans son premier message sur ce sous-forum au sujet de la d\u00e9claration d\u2019outrage, Mme Beaumont a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[Traduction]\nC\u2019est dommage pour Tom. C\u2019est idiot qu\u2019ils (la CCDP) puissent m\u00eame penser \u00e0 lui faire servir une peine en prison parce qu\u2019il s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 (dans un pays suppos\u00e9ment libre ).\nLa peine devrait servir d\u2019avertissement aux autres personnes qui pr\u00f4nent la supr\u00e9macie blanche et qui se servent d\u2019Internet pour r\u00e9pandre la haine, d\u00e9clare Warman.\nNon, \u00e7a ne m\u2019arr\u00eate pas.

Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ils croient que le fait d\u2019enfermer Tom pendant 9 mois le fera changer d\u2019id\u00e9e et l\u2019encouragera \u00e0 aimer les n\u00e8gres et les Juifs.\n[45] Un autre membre du babillard a r\u00e9pondu au message de Mme Beaumont et elle a ensuite affich\u00e9 le message suivant :\n[Traduction]\nHa ha. Comme j\u2019appr\u00e9cierais 3 repas et un bon lit chaud (sans avoir \u00e0 supporter les ronflements de Ciaran) mdr [mort de rire].

Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, elle a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 automatiquement cette citation dans son message en cliquant sur l\u2019ic\u00f4ne [Traduction] Citer au lieu de l\u2019ic\u00f4ne [Traduction] R\u00e9pondre .\nC. Mme Beaumont a-t-elle abord\u00e9 ou fait aborder les questions en cause, au sens de l\u2019article 13, en utilisant Internet? [47] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, Mme Beaumont a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait affich\u00e9 des messages en utilisant le pseudonyme Jessy Destruction . Elle a m\u00eame reconnu avoir affich\u00e9 presque tous les messages contest\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des messages 2 et 3 qu\u2019elle ne se rappelle pas avoir affich\u00e9s.\n[48] Ces deux messages font partie des messages les plus anciens qu\u2019elle ait affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org. Elle s\u2019est inscrite en octobre 2003 et les deux messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s en janvier 2004. Mme Beaumont a contribu\u00e9 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment au babillard; elle a affich\u00e9 plus de 1 000 messages entre octobre 2003 et mai 2006. Compte tenu des circonstances, il n\u2019est pas surprenant qu\u2019elle ne soit pas capable de se souvenir de chacun de ses messages.\n[49] Les notes en marge et les blocs de signature pour les messages 2 et 3 sont identiques aux autres messages que Mme Beaumont a reconnu avoir affich\u00e9s. De plus, les opinions exprim\u00e9s dans les messages 2 et 3 au sujet des Noirs et des relations interraciales correspondent \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019elle a exprim\u00e9s dans ses autres messages. Si, comme Mme Beaumont l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre avait utilis\u00e9 son compte pour afficher les deux messages en question sans qu\u2019elle le sache, elle aurait pu les effacer par la suite. Elle a cependant reconnu pendant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019effacer ces messages. Par cons\u00e9quent, je d\u00e9duis de cette situation que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, Mme Beaumont a aussi affich\u00e9 les messages 2 et 3.\n[50] Je suis donc convaincu que Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 tous les messages contest\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle a par cons\u00e9quent abord\u00e9 ou fait aborder les questions en utilisant Internet, au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi.\nD. Les communications ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi? [51] Le Tribunal a conclu par le pass\u00e9 que les communications faites sur Internet sont faites de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es en raison des caract\u00e9ristiques inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 ce mode de communication, particuli\u00e8rement lorsque aucun obstacle n\u2019est en place pour emp\u00eacher quiconque est branch\u00e9 sur Internet de surfer et de trouver un site Web et de lire les messages (voir les d\u00e9cisions Warman c. Harrison, 2006 TCDP 30, au paragraphe 44; Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 62; Warman c. Tremaine, 2007 TCDP 2, aux paragraphes 116 \u00e0 119). M. Warman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que n\u2019importe qui peut avoir acc\u00e8s au babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org et peut lire les messages que les membres ont affich\u00e9s. Aucun mot de passe, code ou inscription pr\u00e9alable n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire.\n[52] M. Fromm a soutenu que les communications de Mme Beaumont n\u2019\u00e9taient pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es parce que chacun de ses messages comptait comme communication distincte. En fait, elle prenait part \u00e0 une conversation avec d\u2019autres personnes [Traduction] du m\u00eame avis qui participaient aussi au babillard \u00e9lectronique. M. Fromm a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, \u00e0 la page 938, dans laquelle la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLe paragraphe 13(1) est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 restreindre l'utilisation du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone aux fins que je viens de mentionner, parce que, dans le contexte de ce paragraphe, le mot r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e doit comporter la condition qu'il y ait une s\u00e9rie de messages. De plus, parce qu'il faut que le Tribunal soit convaincu que les messages sont susceptibles d'exposer des personnes \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, il se pourrait que m\u00eame une s\u00e9rie d'appels personnels (c'est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire de communications avec des amis ou des connaissances) qui fomente la propagande haineuse ne soit pas une pratique discriminatoire au sens de cette disposition. Je crois qu'il est fallacieux d'embrouiller la discussion au point de ne voir dans le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qu'un outil de communications priv\u00e9es et d'en conclure \u00e0 tort que le par. 13(1) interdit des messages qui contribuent peu \u00e0 causer les maux qui r\u00e9sultent de la propagande haineuse.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nBien entendu, l\u2019arr\u00eat Taylor portait sur des messages t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s sur un r\u00e9pondeur automatique. Le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 Internet n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore utilis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e9tendue dans le monde entier.\n[53] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument de M. Fromm selon lequel les messages que Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org pouvaient \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s \u00e0 des conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques [Traduction] personnelles avec [Traduction] des amis et des connaissances . Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a not\u00e9 au paragraphe 119 de la d\u00e9cision Tremaine, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, [l]'un des objets vis\u00e9s par l'insertion de messages sur un site Web est de rendre accessible le message pour transmission et affichage par un utilisateur qui le demande . La d\u00e9cision Tremaine portait aussi sur des messages qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org. Les utilisateurs de babillards \u00e9lectroniques comme celui-ci savent que tout ce qu\u2019ils affichent sur le babillard peut \u00eatre lu par d\u2019autres personnes qui ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et non seulement par [Traduction] des amis et des connaissances . L\u2019Internet, lorsqu\u2019il est utilis\u00e9 ainsi, devient un moyen peu co\u00fbteux de distribution massive de renseignements (Tremaine, ibid).\n[54] \u00c0 mon avis, Mme Beaumont \u00e9tait parfaitement consciente de ce fait. Dans le 12e message, elle a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord avec le participant pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent au sujet du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des amis [Traduction] non blancs . Elle a invit\u00e9 ce participant \u00e0 d\u00e9battre de la question plus en profondeur par message priv\u00e9 (MP). Dans le 13e message, Mme Beaumont a invit\u00e9 un autre membre du babillard \u00e0 communiquer avec elle par MP s\u2019il voulait discuter plus amplement de Calgary.\n[55] Mme Beaumont a ainsi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle connaissait la distinction entre la nature publique de l\u2019affichage sur un babillard et la nature confidentielle des messages priv\u00e9s. En effet, lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire pourquoi elle avait affich\u00e9 sur le babillard les passages intitul\u00e9s [Traduction] Faits importants que vos enfants n\u2019apprendront pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole et [Traduction] D\u00e9claration des droits des races (15e et 16e messages), elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle les avait affich\u00e9s [Traduction] pour que d\u2019autres personnes les lisent . Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle trouvait ces textes [Traduction] int\u00e9ressants et que [Traduction] quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre aimerait peut-\u00eatre les lire . Elle a ajout\u00e9 que [Traduction] \u00e7a ne [la] d\u00e9rangeait pas de savoir que les textes pouvaient avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur certaines personnes et qu\u2019elle ne voyait pas pourquoi de telles personnes visiteraient un site Web comme Stormfront.org de toute fa\u00e7on.\n[56] Cependant, peu importe les intentions de Mme Beaumont ou la question de savoir si une personne d\u2019un groupe pr\u00e9cis a r\u00e9ellement lu ses messages, le fait est que la communication de ces messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org a entra\u00een\u00e9 une large diffusion publique, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une simple communication priv\u00e9e (voir Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 15, aux paragraphes 25 et 26). L\u2019analogie avec la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique entre amis et connaissances ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\nE. La communication est-elle susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base de motifs de distinction illicites, au sens du paragraphe 13(1)? [58] Dans Nealy c. Johnson (1989), 10 C.H.R.R. D\/6450, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a conclu que l\u2019expression haine connote un ensemble de sentiments comportant une malice extr\u00eame envers une autre personne ou un autre groupe de personnes. Quand on dit qu\u2019on hait quelqu\u2019un, c\u2019est que l\u2019on ne trouve aucune qualit\u00e9 qui rach\u00e8te ses d\u00e9fauts. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 que m\u00e9pris sugg\u00e8re le processus mental consistant \u00e0 regarder quelqu\u2019un de haut ou \u00e0 le traiter comme inf\u00e9rieur. Les termes ne se chevauchent pas n\u00e9cessairement compl\u00e8tement, car la haine est, en certains cas, le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019envie de qualit\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures, telles que l\u2019intelligence, la richesse et le pouvoir, ce que le m\u00e9pris ne peut \u00eatre par d\u00e9finition.\n[59] Dans Nealy, le Tribunal a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019utilisation du terme susceptible au paragraphe 13(1) signifie qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que ceux qui entendront les messages dirigeront leur haine ou leur m\u00e9pris envers d\u2019autres personnes et encore moins que quelqu\u2019un est en fait devenu victime de tels actes.\n[60] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 ces conclusions dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que les termes haine [ou] m\u00e9pris ne visent que des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation se traduisant par des calomnies et la diffamation.\n[61] Je conclus que la plupart des messages que Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org abordaient des questions susceptibles d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable, au sens du paragraphe 13(1), comme l\u2019entend la jurisprudence.\n[62] Premi\u00e8rement, Mme Beaumont a utilis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e un langage incendiaire et m\u00e9prisant au sujet de plusieurs groupes, en fonction de leur religion, de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, ou de leur orientation sexuelle. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, au paragraphe 67, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que la jurisprudence a conclu que l\u2019utilisation d\u2019\u00e9pith\u00e8tes visant \u00e0 d\u00e9crire un groupe identifiable contribue \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que les groupes identifiables soient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Beaumont utilise pour parler des Noirs le terme [Traduction] n\u00e8gre ou un quelconque d\u00e9riv\u00e9 de ce terme (en anglais niggers , negroid , nignog et nigs ) dans les messages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 44, l\u2019utilisation de ce terme avec ses connotations quant \u00e0 l'esclavage, \u00e0 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation et au racisme, d\u00e9montre en soi de la haine et du m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes de race noire. Ailleurs dans ses messages, Mme Beaumont qualifie les homosexuels de [Traduction] tapettes (en anglais fags ou faggots ), les Chinois de [Traduction] chinetoques (en anglais chinks ) et les Autochtones de [Traduction] sauvages (en anglais chugs ).\n[63] M. Fromm a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas rare d\u2019entendre certains de ces termes en public de nos jours. Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle parlait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de cette fa\u00e7on avec ses pairs. Par exemple, dans ses conversations de tous les jours, elle parle souvent des Autochtones en utilisant le terme [Traduction] sauvages (un terme utilis\u00e9 dans le 11e message) et elle n\u2019y voit rien de mal. Elle a reconnu que c\u2019est un terme m\u00e9prisant, mais qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019utilise que lorsqu\u2019elle parle \u00e0 des amis et jamais en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un Autochtone.\n[64] Cependant, que les \u00e9pith\u00e8tes fassent partie ou non d\u2019un langage de tous les jours au sein du cercle d\u2019amis avec qui Mme Beaumont discute, ou m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on plus large au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, ce n\u2019est pas la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019article 13 de la Loi traite d\u2019un type pr\u00e9cis d\u2019\u00e9change, qui est fait de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, en ayant recours \u00e0 un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ce qui comprend aussi l\u2019Internet. Dans ces cas, des r\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes s\u2019appliquent et les messages qui contiennent des questions susceptibles d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable ne devraient pas \u00eatre v\u00e9hicul\u00e9s, peu importe le fait qu\u2019ils soient utilis\u00e9s commun\u00e9ment dans des conversations courantes.\n[65] Cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il y a violation de l\u2019article 13 chaque fois qu\u2019une telle \u00e9pith\u00e8te est utilis\u00e9e. Par exemple, la Commission a tent\u00e9 de faire valoir que le 14e message, qui portait sur un tableau de Norman Rockwell, \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019exposer les Noirs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris en raison de la mention du mot [Traduction] n\u00e8gre . Cette interpr\u00e9tation est totalement hors contexte. Il est \u00e9vident que Mme Beaumont contestait l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par une autre personne dans un message pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, selon lequel Rockwell \u00e9tait un raciste insensible. Son message semble d\u00e9crire de fa\u00e7on juste le tableau, que l\u2019artiste avait peint \u00e0 titre de commentaire social au sujet des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles le mouvement pour la d\u00e9fense des droits civiques faisait face aux \u00c9tats-Unis dans les ann\u00e9es 1960. Sa description de la peinture n\u2019\u00e9tait pas susceptible d\u2019exposer les Noirs \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[66] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission a tent\u00e9 de faire valoir que chaque utilisation du terme [Traduction] retard\u00e9 dans les messages de Mme Beaumont \u00e9tait une \u00e9pith\u00e8te contre les handicap\u00e9s par un retard de d\u00e9veloppement. Cependant, dans des messages comme le 25e message, dans lequel elle se plaignait au sujet des [Traduction] accusations retard\u00e9es qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre elle dans la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, elle n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 le terme dans ce contexte, mais plut\u00f4t comme synonyme ou comme euph\u00e9misme pour absurde , insignifiant ou un autre qualificatif semblable. Bien que son utilisation intempestive du terme manque de respect envers la dignit\u00e9 des personnes handicap\u00e9es par un retard de d\u00e9veloppement, elle ne les expose pas \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris.\n[67] Cependant, la notion de contexte fonctionne dans les deux sens. Pour la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes que Mme Beaumont a utilis\u00e9es, le contexte en \u00e9tait un qui exposait les membres de groupes identifiables au ridicule et \u00e0 l\u2019hostilit\u00e9, par exemple :\n[Traduction]\nAs-tu d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu un n\u00e8gre noir comme du goudron et un chinetoque? C\u2019est assez r\u00e9voltant \/ dr\u00f4le.\nLes tapettes sont dans le tort, ils sont inf\u00e2mes et pleins de maladies et ce sont de sales pervers.\n[68] En plus de la simple utilisation d\u2019\u00e9pith\u00e8tes, Mme Beaumont insinue dans ses messages que les membres des groupes identifiables n\u2019ont aucune qualit\u00e9 qui les rach\u00e8te et elle fait preuve d\u2019une malice extr\u00eame envers eux. Elle qualifie les homosexuels de [Traduction] d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s et exprime le souhait qu\u2019ils [Traduction] meurent tous du SIDA . Elle d\u00e9crit les Juifs comme \u00e9tant [Traduction] litt\u00e9ralement les enfants de Satan lui\u2011m\u00eame . Mme Beaumont a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pendant son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait fond\u00e9 son commentaire sur son interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un passage de la Bible. Elle a ensuite ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui importait peu que les Juifs puissent \u00eatre offens\u00e9s par ses id\u00e9es. Cependant, que cela lui importe ou non, l\u2019article 13 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que la communication r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e par Internet d\u2019une question susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable constitue un acte discriminatoire. Que la personne qui a communiqu\u00e9 la question en soit l\u2019auteure ou non n\u2019est pas pertinent. Le simple fait d\u2019aborder ou de faire aborder la question engage une responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi.\n[69] L\u2019une des m\u00e9thodes d\u2019expression du m\u00e9pris et de la diffamation extr\u00eame contre un groupe identifiable est la comparaison de ses membres \u00e0 des groupes d\u2019animaux et de vermine (voir Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 62 et 63). Dans son message affich\u00e9 le 3 janvier 2006 (le 27e message), Mme Beaumont fait ce genre de comparaison en laissant sous-entendre que les Juifs valaient moins que des chiens et en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle ne comprenait pas pourquoi quelqu\u2019un [Traduction] s\u2019attaquerait \u00e0 de pauvres chiens sans d\u00e9fense plut\u00f4t [Traduction] qu\u2019attaquer ces sales animaux juifs .\n[70] Le Tribunal a conclu dans des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes que les th\u00e8mes qui reviennent souvent, en termes de communications susceptibles d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des groupes identifiables, comprennent l\u2019utilisation d\u2019histoires suppos\u00e9ment vraies servant \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative le groupe identifiable, ainsi que la repr\u00e9sentation du groupe comme cause des probl\u00e8mes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 48). Ces th\u00e8mes sont pr\u00e9sents dans certains des messages que Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9s sur Stormfront.org, en particulier le 15e message, qui est la liste des 16 [Traduction] faits importants que les enfants n\u2019apprennent pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. La liste annonce que [Traduction] l\u2019histoire [\u2026] a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les peuples noirs et hispaniques \u00e9taient incapables de cr\u00e9er et de maintenir [Traduction] une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e , comme celles [Traduction] que les Blancs ont souvent cr\u00e9\u00e9es . Par cons\u00e9quent, on y fait valoir que les membres de ces groupes sont incapables de [Traduction] s\u2019int\u00e9grer en tant qu\u2019\u00e9gaux dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e. Un autre point de la liste donne \u00e0 penser que les quartiers [Traduction] enti\u00e8rement blancs du pass\u00e9, aux \u00c9tats-Unis, \u00e9taient plus s\u00fbrs et qu\u2019il y avait moins de crime que dans les quartiers mixtes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui. Cette d\u00e9claration sous-entend que la pr\u00e9sence de personnes de couleur est la cause des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au crime. On bl\u00e2me aussi l\u2019int\u00e9gration des personnes de couleur pour la suppos\u00e9e diminution de la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019enseignement dans les \u00e9coles.\n[71] Dans son 22e message, lorsqu\u2019on l\u2019a avis\u00e9e que le mariage entre un enfant et un adulte \u00e9tait suppos\u00e9ment l\u00e9gal au Canada, Mme Beaumont a automatiquement d\u00e9clar\u00e9, sans raison apparente, que c\u2019\u00e9taient [Traduction] les Juifs qui avaient [Traduction] fait cette loi . Plus t\u00f4t, dans son 8e message, Mme Beaumont avait mentionn\u00e9 les [Traduction] pions sans t\u00eate des sales Juifs [Juden ] qui croyaient au m\u00e9lange des races. Juden est, bien entendu, le mot allemand pour Juifs, un terme qui est devenu tr\u00e8s connu en raison de la pers\u00e9cution des Juifs en Allemagne nazie. Comme il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 dans Kouba, aux paragraphes 24 et 25, l\u2019une des principales caract\u00e9ristiques des communications qui violent l\u2019article 13 est la qualification du groupe identifiable comme constituant une puissante menace qui prend le contr\u00f4le des institutions importantes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui prive les autres membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de leur mode de vie, de leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de leur libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de leur bien-\u00eatre en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le 8e message laisse entendre que les Juifs contr\u00f4lent la fa\u00e7on dont les gens pensent et s\u2019expriment au sujet du [Traduction] m\u00e9lange des races et le 22e message repr\u00e9sente les Juifs comme une puissante menace qui force les l\u00e9gislateurs \u00e0 adopter des lois qui minent les valeurs sociales acceptables.\n[72] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nealy, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 45 668 \u00e0 45 670, le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les messages qui pr\u00e9conisent l\u2019expulsion forc\u00e9e ou la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation des personnes de couleur \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris les membres des groupes identifiables en pr\u00f4nant la violence comme moyen proactif de d\u00e9fense contre quiconque est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un ennemi de la puret\u00e9 raciale . Le th\u00e8me de base de la liste des [Traduction] faits importants du 15e message est que la pr\u00e9sence et l\u2019int\u00e9gration des personnes de couleur dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine sont ind\u00e9sirables. La [Traduction] D\u00e9claration des droits des races du 16e message est encore plus explicite en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle les Blancs devraient avoir le droit [Traduction] de garder et de d\u00e9fendre leurs propres terres contre l\u2019immigration ou l\u2019habitation par des membres d\u2019autres races , ce qui comprend le droit d\u2019habiter dans des quartiers r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux Blancs et d\u2019envoyer leurs enfants dans des \u00e9coles exclusivement blanches, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le droit de pratiquer la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation.\n[73] Les blocs de signature des messages plus r\u00e9cents de Mme Beaumont (\u00e0 partir du 25e message) comprennent la phrase [Traduction] l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme est une maladie \u2013 transmise par les Juifs . Cette phrase pr\u00e9sente la notion selon laquelle les Juifs sont les auteurs de l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme. Il est donc suppos\u00e9 que ceux qui propagent l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme ne doivent pas \u00eatre bl\u00e2m\u00e9s, puisque la faute revient aux Juifs. En fait, les victimes sont bl\u00e2m\u00e9es pour la discrimination dont elles font l\u2019objet et ainsi, le message minimise les effets de cette discrimination. Il banalise les trag\u00e9dies du pass\u00e9 et d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, ce qui cr\u00e9e un climat de d\u00e9rision et de m\u00e9pris qui est susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 ces \u00e9motions les membres du groupe vis\u00e9 (Kouba, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 72-75).\n[74] En somme, je conclus que, pour la plupart des messages en cause, Mme Beaumont a abord\u00e9 des questions susceptibles d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base de motifs de distinction illicite (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la race, la religion, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, et l\u2019orientation sexuelle). J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que Mme Beaumont a communiqu\u00e9 tous ses messages sur Internet et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e. Le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9.\nIII. Les redressements A. Une ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire (alin\u00e9a 54(1)a)) [75] En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)a), le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire et peut prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[76] M. Warman a demand\u00e9 [Traduction] une ordonnance permanente exigeant que Mme Beaumont cesse d\u2019agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire en faisant de la propagande haineuse par Internet ou par tout autre service de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement . La Commission souscrit \u00e0 cette demande. M. Fromm a soutenu que le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance [Traduction] permanente serait une [Traduction] peine [\u2026] \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 . Il a fait valoir que Mme Beaumont aurait \u00e0 faire attention, pour le reste de ses jours, \u00e0 ne pas exprimer de point de vue politiques ou religieux sur Internet de peur de violer l\u2019ordonnance, de se voir accus\u00e9e d\u2019outrage au tribunal et de possiblement se retrouver en prison. Elle serait sensiblement r\u00e9duite au silence en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019affichage de d\u00e9clarations politiques ou religieuses sur Internet. Il a donc sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la port\u00e9e d\u2019une telle ordonnance soit limit\u00e9e \u00e0 un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es, peut-\u00eatre cinq ans.\n[77] Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Au fond, une ordonnance de cesser et de s\u2019abstenir avise l\u2019intim\u00e9 que les messages comme ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment violent la Loi et qu\u2019il devrait s\u2019abstenir d\u2019en communiquer d\u2019autres. Ainsi, l\u2019ordonnance ne fait que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ce que la Loi a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9nonc\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le fait que la communication de messages au sens de l\u2019article 13 constitue un acte de discrimination. L\u2019observation de M. Fromm pr\u00e9suppose que la Loi est ambigu\u00eb et que Mme Beaumont pourrait inconsciemment tomber dans un pi\u00e8ge qui entra\u00eenerait la pr\u00e9sentation contre elle d\u2019accusations d\u2019outrage au tribunal. Ces pr\u00e9occupations sont sans fondement. Selon l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Taylor, il n\u2019y a aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 et les nombreuses d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues au sujet de cette disposition devraient servir \u00e0 guider Mme Beaumont pour qu\u2019elle puisse d\u00e9terminer quels types de messages elle peut afficher sur Internet sans violer l\u2019article 13. De plus, elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur ses propres messages affich\u00e9s sur Internet pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 g\u00e9rer ses futures communications.\n[78] De plus, une ordonnance de cesser et de s\u2019abstenir ne constituerait pas une peine \u00e9crasante et omnipr\u00e9sente pour Mme Beaumont, comme M. Fromm le laisse entendre. Pour qu\u2019il y ait outrage au tribunal, il faut \u00e9tablir hors de tout doute raisonnable (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire la norme de preuve applicable en mati\u00e8re criminelle) que Mme Beaumont a viol\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance en faisant \u00e0 nouveau de la propagande haineuse au sens de l\u2019article 13, comme il l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9. La norme de preuve serait donc plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que ce qui est requis pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il faut qu\u2019il soit \u00e9tabli que l\u2019activit\u00e9 qui, pr\u00e9tend-on, constitue l'outrage doit de toute \u00e9vidence \u00eatre vis\u00e9e par l'interdiction mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019ordonnance (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. French, [1996] A.C.F. no 384 (C.F. 1re inst.) (QL).\n[79] De plus, il semble que l\u2019outrage au tribunal ne soit pas une offense absolue et les tribunaux h\u00e9sitent \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il y a eu outrage lorsque la personne a pris des mesures objectivement raisonnables pour respecter l\u2019ordonnance (voir R.W. McCauley & J.L.H. Spragg, Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals, \u00e9dition \u00e0 feuilles mobiles, vol. X, (Toronto : Thomson, 2004), au paragraphe 29A.9(c)). D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intention de poser un acte discriminatoire n\u2019est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire (Taylor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 931). Par cons\u00e9quent, si Mme Beaumont communiquait par inadvertance des questions qui violent l\u2019article 13, elle risquerait plus probablement de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 13 et d\u2019\u00eatre soumise \u00e0 une nouvelle mesure de redressement pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 54, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019outrage au tribunal au sujet de l\u2019ordonnance de cesser et de s\u2019abstenir pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n[80] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois aucune raison de refuser l\u2019ordonnance. J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Mme Beaumont de cesser et de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019aborder ou de faire aborder, par les moyens d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 de la Loi, et particuli\u00e8rement par Internet, toute question du type apparaissant dans les messages en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui est susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base des motifs de distinction illicite.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (alin\u00e9a 54(1)b)) [81] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que lorsque la victime est identifi\u00e9e dans la communication constituant l\u2019acte discriminatoire, le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. M. Warman demande que Mme Beaumont paye cette indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, au montant de 10 000 $.\n[82] Un certain nombre de communications a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve, dans lesquelles Mme Beaumont parle de M. Warman. Elles comprennent une photographie qu\u2019elle a affich\u00e9e sur ses pages , qu\u2019elle avait cr\u00e9\u00e9es sur les sites Web EveryonesSpace.com et MySpace.com. Il s\u2019agit de sites Web de r\u00e9seautage personnel sur lesquels les utilisateurs affichent leur profil personnel et interagissent avec un r\u00e9seau d\u2019amis, avec qui ils peuvent partager de la musique, des vid\u00e9os, etc. Dans sa liste d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, affich\u00e9e sur son profil sur EveryonesSpace.com, Mme Beaumont a plac\u00e9 une image qui semble modifi\u00e9e d\u2019une affiche d\u2019une \u00e9glise catholique plac\u00e9e en bordure d\u2019une rue. Trois croix gamm\u00e9es avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es par ordinateur sur l\u2019image de l\u2019affiche. Sur la partie inf\u00e9rieure de l\u2019affiche, o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9glise \u00e9crirait normalement ses annonces, le texte suivant appara\u00eet, \u00e9crit exactement comme suit :\n[Traduction]\n\u00c9GLISE DE LA SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9\nDU WARMAN D\u00c9C\u00c9D\u00c9\nCEUX QUI HA\u00cfSSENT WARMAN\nSONT TOUJOURS BIENVENUS\nMme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 la m\u00eame image le 5 avril 2006 sur le babillard de sa page sur MySpace.com. Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cette image \u00e9tait une blague entre elle et un ami, une variation sur le titre d\u2019un film paru il y a quelques ann\u00e9es : La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s .\n[83] De plus, dans le 28e message, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2006, Mme Beaumont a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord envers les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre elle et d\u2019autres personnes. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des [Traduction] gens ont perdu leur famille, leur emploi et leurs sites Web en r\u00e9action \u00e0 ces plaintes. Elle a ensuite ajout\u00e9 que tout cela \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00e0 cause de ce Juif retard\u00e9 de Warman et que [Traduction] [n]ous savons tous qu\u2019il fait \u00e7a parce qu\u2019il est un ignoble animal honteux .\n[84] M. Warman n\u2019est pas Juif, comme il l\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans Warman c. Kyburz, (2003), 46 T.C.D.P. 425, au paragraphe 90, mais il est \u00e9vident que Mme Beaumont le percevait comme tel. Une personne qui est per\u00e7ue comme ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une personne vis\u00e9e par l\u2019un des motifs de distinction illicite peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019actes discriminatoires m\u00eame si elle ne poss\u00e8de par r\u00e9ellement ces caract\u00e9ristiques (District No. 44 (North Vancouver) c. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201, au paragraphe 41, demande de pourvoi \u00e0 la CSC refus\u00e9e; voir aussi Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 665).\n[85] M. Warman \u00e9tait-il la victime identifi\u00e9e dans la communication constituant l\u2019acte discriminatoire ? M. Fromm a soutenu que l\u2019utilisation du mot Juif pour parler de M. Warman servait seulement de terme descriptif, compte tenu de la perception erron\u00e9e de Mme Beaumont au sujet de la religion de M. Warman. Ce ne serait pas diff\u00e9rent si elle avait dit [Traduction] cet homme retard\u00e9 de Warman . M. Fromm a ajout\u00e9 que le terme [Traduction] retard\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas utilis\u00e9 dans le but de d\u00e9nigrer les personnes handicap\u00e9es par un retard de d\u00e9veloppement, mais simplement pour utiliser un adjectif peu \u00e9logieux pour d\u00e9crire M. Warman, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que j\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 mon avis, bien que Mme Beaumont n\u2019ait pu avoir que la simple intention d\u2019insulter M. Warman de fa\u00e7on juv\u00e9nile en utilisant le mot [Traduction] retard\u00e9 , compte tenu du contexte de ses messages, y compris celui-ci, sa fa\u00e7on de parler de M. Warman en utilisant [Traduction] ce [\u2026] Juif avait une connotation totalement diff\u00e9rente.\n[86] Premi\u00e8rement, le bloc de signature de ce message comprend la phrase que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t [Traduction] l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme est une maladie \u2013 transmise par les Juifs qui, comme je l\u2019ai conclu, est une communication qui correspond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de propagande haineuse au sens de l\u2019article 13.\n[87] De plus, les commentaires de Mme Beaumont devraient \u00eatre pris dans le contexte de ses autres d\u00e9clarations. Elle a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle croit au national\u2011socialisme. Elle s\u2019est d\u00e9crite dans ses messages comme \u00e9tant une nazie [Traduction] \u00e0 plein temps . Les membres du babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org pouvaient annexer des logos ou des avatars \u00e0 leurs messages, qui apparaissaient sous leur nom ou leur pseudonyme dans les notes en marge. Mme Beaumont avait choisi comme avatar une caricature d\u2019une femme avec une croix gamm\u00e9e en arri\u00e8re plan. Certains de ses autres messages \u00e9taient accompagn\u00e9s d\u2019un avatar qui comportait une croix gamm\u00e9e et une t\u00eate de mort, symboles qui sont associ\u00e9s aux forces nazies de la Seconde Guerre mondiale (voir Warman c. Kulbashian, 2006 TCDP 11).\n[88] En outre, M. Warman et la Commission ont mentionn\u00e9 que, dans le 30e message, bien que Mme Beaumont n\u2019ait pas mentionn\u00e9 le nom de M. Warman dans les trois phrases qu\u2019elle a \u00e9crites, elle a choisi de s\u00e9lectionner l\u2019ic\u00f4ne [Traduction] Citer au lieu de [Traduction] R\u00e9pondre et qu\u2019elle a ainsi cit\u00e9 le message d\u2019un autre membre du sous-forum. Cette citation se termine par la d\u00e9claration suivante : [Traduction] Je te HAIS Warman et j\u2019esp\u00e8re seulement vivre assez longtemps pour pisser sur ton insignifiante tombe, sale youpin. Cette utilisation du terme p\u00e9joratif [Traduction] youpin au sujet de M. Warman, qui est per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant juif, est une question qui, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t dans ma d\u00e9cision, est susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes de la foi juive.\n[89] Cependant, on soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si Mme Beaumont a communiqu\u00e9 ce message. Elle ne l\u2019a pas compos\u00e9, elle l\u2019a simplement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 en choisissant l\u2019ic\u00f4ne [Traduction] Citer . \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une fausse distinction. Elle avait le choix de citer ou non le message pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Comme le d\u00e9montrent ses autres messages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve, elle avait l\u2019habitude de seulement r\u00e9pondre aux messages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et ne les citait que rarement. De plus, dans certains cas, la citation n\u2019affichait que des parties des messages pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, ce qui indique que Mme Beaumont effa\u00e7ait certaines parties avant de les afficher dans ses propres messages. \u00c0 mon avis, ces faits d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019utiliser l\u2019option de citation du babillard lorsqu\u2019elle souhaitait r\u00e9p\u00e9ter le message. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fait par inadvertance.\n[90] Dans le contexte, il est \u00e9vident que Mme Beaumont ne faisait pas que d\u00e9crire M. Warman comme \u00e9tant un Juif, dans le 28e message, mais qu\u2019elle le d\u00e9nigrait. D\u2019autant plus qu\u2019elle l\u2019a ensuite qualifi\u00e9 [Traduction] d\u2019animal honteux , qui nous ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 un message qu\u2019elle avait affich\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans lequel elle donnait \u00e0 une famille juive les attributs des chiens.\n[91] Je suis par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019avis que Mme Beaumont a fait ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 M. Warman de fa\u00e7on intentionnelle dans ses messages. Elle a commis cet acte de discrimination d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment. Le nom de M. Warman n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 que trois fois, mais elles comprennent une description de lui comme \u00e9tant [Traduction] d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 , ce terme ayant une importance particuli\u00e8re compte tenu des croix gamm\u00e9es qui apparaissent sur l\u2019image et du fait que Mme Beaumont le percevait comme un Juif (voir Kulbashian, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 138).\n[92] Il ne s\u2019agit pas de la premi\u00e8re plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 13 de M. Warman. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu des d\u00e9cisions finales dans au moins neuf plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 13 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par M. Warman. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 168 \u00e0 172, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Warman avait beaucop d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s engag\u00e9 dans des activit\u00e9s organis\u00e9es visant la lutte contre la propagande haineuse. Le Tribunal a conclu que M. Warman semble \u00eatre un homme tr\u00e8s fort qui est plut\u00f4t insensible aux menaces et aux insultes . M. Fromm a soutenu que compte tenu du r\u00f4le de [Traduction] joueur de M. Warman en ce qui a trait aux plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 13, il n\u2019est pas une victime r\u00e9elle au sens de l\u2019article 54 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne devrait pas avoir droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\n[93] Cependant, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) ne fait aucune distinction entre les types de victimes. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que M. Fromm a soulev\u00e9s au sujet de M. Warman pourraient th\u00e9oriquement \u00eatre des facteurs d\u2019\u00e9valuation du pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime par l\u2019acte de discrimination, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), dans les cas d\u2019actes de discrimination autres que ceux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 13. Cependant, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) renvoit explicitement le Tribunal au paragraphe 53(3) en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation de la victime. Le paragraphe 53(3) vise le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 pour une conduite discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e sans \u00e9gard aux effets qu'elle peut avoir sur la victime (voir Winnicki, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 180).\n[94] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la pertinence d\u2019une telle ordonnance, les seuls messages dont il faut tenir compte sont ceux qui mentionnent M. Warman et non tous les messages qui ont viol\u00e9 l\u2019article 13. Mme Beaumont savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que les termes qu\u2019elle utilisait pour attaquer et ridiculiser M. Warman \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019exposer ce dernier \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris parce qu\u2019elle le d\u00e9signait comme \u00e9tant un Juif. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la [Traduction] Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Warman d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 , accompagn\u00e9e des images de croix gamm\u00e9es est particuli\u00e8rement troublante. On ne peut pas prendre \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re des mots qui donnent \u00e0 penser que du tort pourrait \u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne, m\u00eame si ces mots sont dits \u00e0 la blague. D\u2019autres personnes qui trouvent ces documents sur Internet pourraient ne pas le voir de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on et prendre le message au s\u00e9rieux. M. Warman a ajout\u00e9 aussi que le 30e message, par exemple, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Beaumont. Par cons\u00e9quent, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019arr\u00eater d\u2019afficher sa propagande haineuse, elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mentionner le nom de M. Warman.\n[95] Compte tenu des circonstances, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Mme Beaumont de payer un montant de 3 000 $ comme indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b) de la Loi.\nC. Sanction (alin\u00e9a 54(1)c)) [96] Le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 un intim\u00e9 qui a commis un acte de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire d\u2019au plus 10 000 $, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)c). Le paragraphe 54(1.1) \u00e9num\u00e8re plusieurs facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9cide de rendre une telle ordonnance :\nla nature et la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte discriminatoire ainsi que les circonstances l\u2019entourant; la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l\u2019acte, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents discriminatoires de son auteur et sa capacit\u00e9 de payer.\nLa Commission et M. Warman ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019examiner l\u2019imposition d\u2019une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 7 500 $.\n[97] J\u2019ai conclu que la plupart des messages en cause sont susceptible d\u2019exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris un certain nombre de groupes identifiables. Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne se souciait pas de l\u2019effet que ses messages pouvaient avoir sur les membres de ces groupes ou sur la collectivit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[98] Par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres propagandes haineuses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal par le pass\u00e9, je conclus que la propagande de Mme Beaumont n\u2019a pas la m\u00eame gravit\u00e9 . Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que ses messages contiennent des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes n\u00e9gatives au sujet de certains groupes identifiables, ces termes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s aussi fr\u00e9quemment que dans d\u2019autres cas. Mme Beaumont ne s\u2019est pas lanc\u00e9e dans des descriptions explicites de violence contre les groupes identifiables. Sa propagande \u00e9tait pour la majeure partie faite sous forme de messages relativement courts affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique. Elle n\u2019a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 un site Web entier d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la propagande haineuse, ou qui en regorge, comme nous l\u2019avons vu dans d\u2019autres cas.\n[99] La Commission a mentionn\u00e9 que Mme Beaumont avait affich\u00e9 au moins 1 000 messages sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique Stormfront.org, en plus de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, si je ne les examine pas, je ne peux pas supposer que ces autres messages violent l\u2019article 13. En effet, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision, ce ne sont pas tous les messages en cause pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve qui constituaient de la propagande haineuse au sens de la Loi.\n[100] Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas [Traduction] \u00e9t\u00e9 sur Stormfront.org depuis juillet 2006 et que ses pages sur EveryonesSpace.com et MySpace avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es. Cependant, M. Warman a fait remarquer qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre elle, Mme Beaumont a affich\u00e9 d\u2019autres messages de propagande haineuse qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[101] Mme Beaumont a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que peu importe la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, elle ne changerait pas ses opinions ni ses id\u00e9es. Cependant, elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [Traduction] cesserait d\u2019utiliser l\u2019Internet si le Tribunal le lui ordonnait.\n[102] Au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019audience a eu lieu, Mme Beaumont n\u2019habitait plus en Colombie\u2011Britannique; elle \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 Calgary. Elle a 21 ans et elle habite chez ses parents. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle payait un loyer \u00e0 ses parents, bien qu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des talons de ch\u00e8que de paye qui d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019elle travaille comme vendeuse dans un magasin de d\u00e9tail et qu\u2019elle a un salaire horaire de 10,50 $.\n[103] On ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve selon laquelle elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commis des actes de discrimination auparavant. En d\u00e9cembre 2005, M. Warman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte au criminel \u00e0 la British Columbia Hate Team dans laquelle il soutenait que Mme Beaumont avait fait de la propagande haineuse d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, au sens de l\u2019article 319 du Code Criminel. En juillet 2006, en partie en fonction de ces renseignements, le service de police de Vancouver a obtenu un mandat et a saisi l\u2019ordinateur de Mme Beaumont. Cependant, elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9e formellement d\u2019un crime \u00e0 ce sujet. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux pas conclure qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commis un acte de discrimination auparavant.\n[104] Compte tenu de tous ces facteurs, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 Mme Beaumont de payer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire de 1 500 $. Le paiement de la sanction doit \u00eatre fait par ch\u00e8que certifi\u00e9 ou par mandat poste \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du receveur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et le Tribunal doit recevoir le paiement dans les 120 jours suivant la signification de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 Mme Beaumont.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 est-elle discriminatoire au point d'\u00e9tablir une distinction entre les participants et les non participants?\nIII. LA D\u00c9CISION\n[1] Yvonne Sugimoto est la plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, dat\u00e9e du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2002, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP). Elle pr\u00e9tend que la Banque Royale du Canada (BRC), dans les dispositions de son r\u00e9gime de retraite, a fait montre de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en lui imposant un traitement diff\u00e9rent pr\u00e9judiciable en raison de son sexe, et ce, en contravention des articles 7, 10 et 21 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\n[2] La diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dont Mme Sugimoto se plaint est la suivante : en vertu du r\u00e9gime de retraite de la BRC, un homme qui a le m\u00eame \u00e2ge que Mme Sugimoto et qui poss\u00e8de la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience de travail \u00e0 la BRC peut prendre sa retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 56 ans, et ce, avec pleine pension. Si Mme Sugimoto d\u00e9sirait prendre sa retraite au m\u00eame \u00e2ge, le montant de pension annuelle qu'elle recevrait serait 35 p. 100 moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui re\u00e7u par son coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin. Afin de recevoir, comme son coll\u00e8gue masculin, le plein montant de pension, Mme Sugimoto devrait travailler 70 mois de plus. Cette situation est due au fait que Mme Sugimoto n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 alors que la BRC a autoris\u00e9 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin \u00e0 y participer.\n[3] Afin de comprendre l'incidence que cette situation a eue sur Mme Sugimoto, il faut d'abord comprendre comment fonctionne le r\u00e9gime de retraite de la BRC et voir comment il a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au cours des 30 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[4] Avant de prendre sa retraite, Mme Sugimoto participait au r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es de la BRC. En vertu de ce r\u00e9gime, un employ\u00e9 pouvait participer comme contributeur ou comme non-contributeur. Dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite contributif, le montant de prestation de retraite annuel est \u00e9gal \u00e0 1,3 p. 100 x le salaire moyen de fin de carri\u00e8re x le nombre d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension pendant lesquelles le participant a contribu\u00e9. Dans le r\u00e9gime non contributif, le pourcentage est de 0,9 plut\u00f4t que de 1,3 et les participants ne contribuent pas.\n[5] Un participant peut accumuler des ann\u00e9es de contribution ou des ann\u00e9es de non-contribution ou une combinaison des deux. Le participant contribue 4 ou 6 p. 100 de son salaire selon \u00e9chelle salariale. La BRC s'occupe du financement de la valeur actuarielle ainsi que du financement des frais d'administration du r\u00e9gime.\n[6] Mme Sugimoto a conclu une entente de continuation du salaire et a quitt\u00e9 son emploi \u00e0 la BRC en mars 2002. La BRC lui a vers\u00e9 un salaire jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle prenne une retraite anticip\u00e9e le 4 octobre 2006.\nI. LES FAITS A. L'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite avant le 1er mai 1974 [7] Mme Sugimoto est n\u00e9e le 4 octobre 1951 et elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la BRC le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1970. Elle \u00e9tait alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 ans. Avant le 1er mai 1974, c'est \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 21 ans que le personnel de sexe masculin de la BRC pouvait commencer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime contributif. Or, ce n'\u00e9tait qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 24 ans que le personnel de sexe f\u00e9minin pouvait commencer \u00e0 participer \u00e0 ce m\u00eame r\u00e9gime.\nB. La modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de retraite le 1er mai 1974 [8] Le 1er mai 1974, le r\u00e9gime de retraite a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 en vue de porter \u00e0 30 ans l'\u00e2ge auquel les employ\u00e9s, hommes et femmes, pouvaient commencer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime. Les employ\u00e9s qui participaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 au r\u00e9gime, mais qui n'avaient pas 30 ans, se sont vu offrir le choix de continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime comme contributeur ou de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans. S'ils sursoyaient \u00e0 leur participation, ils n'accumulaient aucune ann\u00e9e de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension avant de recommencer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans.\n[9] Les participants au r\u00e9gime qui avaient plus de 30 ans le 1er mai 1974 pouvaient choisir de continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime comme contributeurs ou comme non-contributeurs. La modification du 1er mai 1974 n'a eu aucune incidence sur la situation de Mme Sugimoto. Elle avait 22 ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.\nC. La modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1980 [10] Le 1er mars 1978, la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Cette loi pr\u00e9voyait un d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de deux ans afin de permettre l'harmonisation, avec ses dispositions, des r\u00e9gimes de retraite r\u00e9glement\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[11] Le 1er septembre 1980, la BRC a modifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime de retraite et a fix\u00e9 la date \u00e0 laquelle un employ\u00e9 pouvait commencer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime au premier en date des \u00e9v\u00e9nements suivants : date \u00e0 laquelle l'employ\u00e9 atteignait l'\u00e2ge de 25 ans ou date \u00e0 laquelle il travaillait \u00e0 la BRC depuis cinq ans sans interruption. En ce qui concerne les employ\u00e9s qui participaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 au r\u00e9gime, la date \u00e0 laquelle ils ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e r\u00e9troactivement au 1er mars 1980 (et ce, afin de respecter la fin du d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce).\n[12] Mme Sugimoto avait 26 ans et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 titre de contributeur le 1er mars 1980. Le 1er mars 1985, elle a choisi de devenir non-contributeur, ce qui \u00e9tait permis par le r\u00e9gime apr\u00e8s 5 ann\u00e9es de participation \u00e0 titre de contributeur.\nD. La modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1987 - la retraite anticip\u00e9e [13] Le 1er janvier 1987, le r\u00e9gime de retraite a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 afin de permettre aux participants au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 titre de contributeur ou de non-contributeur, comptant 35 ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, de prendre leur retraite apr\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans, et ce, avec pleine pension annuelle. Pour chaque ann\u00e9e en de\u00e7\u00e0 de 35 ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, la pension annuelle serait r\u00e9duite de 5 p. 100. L'\u00e2ge normal de la retraite \u00e9tait 65 ans.\nE. Le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996 (RASBS) (i) L'historique du RASBS [14] L'introduction en 1987 de la possibilit\u00e9 de pouvoir prendre une retraite anticip\u00e9e a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me important quant aux femmes qui participaient au r\u00e9gime de retraite et qui, avant 1974, ne pouvaient commencer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime que trois ans apr\u00e8s leurs coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Cette in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement avait des cons\u00e9quences quant \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e et quant \u00e0 la pleine pension et cela posait probl\u00e8me.\n(ii) Le rapport Mercer de f\u00e9vrier 1995 [15] En 1995, la BRC a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 explorer des fa\u00e7ons de corriger les cons\u00e9quences possibles des r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 en vigueur avant mai 1974. Elle a retenu les services de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 William Mercer afin de voir quelles strat\u00e9gies elle pourrait adopter et quelles incidences celles-ci pourraient avoir sur le r\u00e9gime.\n[16] Dans son rapport de f\u00e9vrier 1995 intitul\u00e9 Analysis of past discriminatory practices in Canadian Pension Plans, Mercer a soulign\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin de la BRC, comme Mme Sugimoto, qui n'avaient pas atteint l'\u00e2ge de 24 ans au 1er mai 1974, ne pouvaient accumuler aucune prestation de retraite quant aux trois ann\u00e9es de service comprises entre les \u00e2ges de 21 et de 24 ans. De plus, comme Mme Sugimoto n'\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime avant le 1er mars 1980, elle ne pouvait accumuler aucune prestation de retraite quant \u00e0 ses ann\u00e9es de service comprises entre le 1er mai 1974 et le 1er mars 1980.\n[17] Le rapport Mercer soulignait que certaines institutions financi\u00e8res canadiennes avaient \u00e9limin\u00e9 r\u00e9troactivement, de leurs r\u00e9gimes de retraite, toutes les pratiques discriminatoires ant\u00e9rieures; certaines avaient apport\u00e9 des rajustements r\u00e9troactifs qui avaient \u00e9limin\u00e9 en partie leurs pratiques discriminatoires ant\u00e9rieures; certaines institutions n'ont rien fait.\n[18] Le rapport Mercer soulignait que la BRC n'avait jamais apport\u00e9 aucune modification r\u00e9troactive \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime de retraite. Cependant, si la BRC d\u00e9sirait faire une exception quant \u00e0 cette politique, Mercer proposait deux solutions.\n[19] La BRC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'appliquer une troisi\u00e8me solution, \u00e0 savoir compter comme ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, sous le r\u00e9gime contributif, les ann\u00e9es de service d'un employ\u00e9 de sexe f\u00e9minin entre l'\u00e2ge de 21 ans et la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e entre la date \u00e0 laquelle l'employ\u00e9 de sexe f\u00e9minin a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime, la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a eu 24 ans et le 1er mai 1974.\n[20] Dans son rapport, Mercer ne recommandait pas de prendre en compte la p\u00e9riode comprise entre mai 1974 et mars 1980, et ce, pour deux raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, il serait tr\u00e8s conjectural de deviner ce qu'une personne qui a aujourd'hui entre 21 et 24 ans aurait fait en 1974, \u00e0 savoir si elle aurait choisi de continuer \u00e0 participer \u00e0 titre de contributeur ou aurait choisi de surseoir \u00e0 sa participation. Deuxi\u00e8mement, cette prise en compte aurait pour cons\u00e9quence d'accorder aux employ\u00e9s qui ne participaient pas au r\u00e9gime un avantage injuste par rapport aux employ\u00e9s qui participaient au r\u00e9gime en 1974 et qui avaient d\u00fb prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque et non pas 20 ans plus tard.\n(iii) La r\u00e9solution prise par le conseil d'administration le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1995. [21] La question a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par le comit\u00e9 des ressources humaines de la BRC qui a recommand\u00e9 que certaines modifications r\u00e9troactives soient apport\u00e9es au r\u00e9gime de retraite. Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1995, le conseil d'administration de la BRC a adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution autorisant le comit\u00e9 de gestion du r\u00e9gime de retraite [traduction] \u00e0 modifier le r\u00e9gime de retraite de la Banque Royale en vue de permettre aux femmes concern\u00e9es de racheter des prestations au titre de l'une ou l'autre des ann\u00e9es de service travaill\u00e9es. Dans sa r\u00e9solution, le comit\u00e9 a reconnu que les r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime en vigueur avant 1974 avaient emp\u00each\u00e9 les femmes de participer au r\u00e9gime au m\u00eame \u00e2ge que les hommes, une pratique qui est maintenant consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire.\n[22] La r\u00e9solution susmentionn\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en application gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce qu'on a appel\u00e9 le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service bas\u00e9 sur le sexe de 1996. Le RASBS \u00e9tait une offre unique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite aux employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime au plus tard le 1er mars 1980, et qui, avant le 1er mai 1974, avaient travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein sans interruption entre l'\u00e2ge de 21 et 24 ans. Les personnes admissibles pouvaient racheter jusqu'\u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es additionnelles de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension et ces ann\u00e9es \u00e9taient comprises dans la p\u00e9riode de temps situ\u00e9e entre la date la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e entre la date du 21e anniversaire de la personne admissible et la date \u00e0 laquelle celle-ci avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la banque, et la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e entre la date du 24e anniversaire de la personne admissible et le 1er mai 1974.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s que le RASBS fut entr\u00e9 en vigueur, Mercer, l'actuaire du r\u00e9gime, a calcul\u00e9 que l'augmentation nette de l'engagement actuariel de la BRC quant au RASBS \u00e9tait d'environ 13 millions de dollars, et ce, apr\u00e8s contributions des employ\u00e9s, lesquelles contributions se situaient entre 3 et 4 millions de dollars.\nF. La modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime du RASBS le 5 septembre 2003 [24] Les avantages additionnels accord\u00e9s en vertu du RASBS n\u00e9cessitaient une modification du r\u00e9gime de retraite. Fait int\u00e9ressant, ce n'est que le 5 septembre 2003 qu'une modification fut apport\u00e9e, avec date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 1er janvier 1996, plus de sept ans apr\u00e8s l'adoption de la r\u00e9solution du conseil de 1995. La modification a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par une r\u00e9solution du comit\u00e9 de gestion du r\u00e9gime de retraite, lequel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par le conseil \u00e0 apporter des modifications au r\u00e9gime.\n[25] La raison de ce retard (tel qu'expliqu\u00e9 par Gary Dobbie, premier vice-pr\u00e9sident BRC, R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avantages sociaux, dans la lettre du 25 mars 2003 qu'il a envoy\u00e9e au Bureau du surintendant des institutions financi\u00e8res) \u00e9tait que, apr\u00e8s 1996, les participants au r\u00e9gime de retraite ainsi que les anciens participants au r\u00e9gime de retraite s'\u00e9taient adress\u00e9s \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 la BRC afin de lui demander de leur accorder des avantages suppl\u00e9mentaires fond\u00e9s sur le RASBS. Afin de s'assurer que le RASBS soit offert de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et uniforme, la BRC a report\u00e9 la modification du r\u00e9gime jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'affaire soit pleinement examin\u00e9e et r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[26] Afin de comprendre comment la modification de 2003 fonctionne, celle-ci doit \u00eatre situ\u00e9e dans le contexte de la Section C (Canada) du r\u00e9gime de retraite de la Banque Royale, tel que modifi\u00e9 et reformul\u00e9 le 1er janvier 2002. Il s'agit de la plus r\u00e9cente modification apport\u00e9e au libell\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime remis par les parties au Tribunal.\n[27] Le paragraphe 2.01(6) d\u00e9finit [traduction] Date d'admission comme \u00e9tant la date \u00e0 laquelle une personne est admise \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime. Le mot [traduction] Participant est d\u00e9fini au paragraphe 2.01(38) comme \u00e9tant un employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime en vertu des r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 3 du r\u00e9gime et qui a toujours droit aux avantages pr\u00e9vus dans le r\u00e9gime. L'expression [traduction] Acquisition des droits aux prestations qui figure au paragraphe 2.01(71) signifie acquisition du droit \u00e0 une pension diff\u00e9r\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'accumulation d'un nombre pr\u00e9cis d'ann\u00e9es de service.\n[28] L'article 4 est intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Service et ce mot est d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l'article 4.05 comme \u00e9tant l'emploi continu d'un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la BRC. L'expression [traduction] Ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qui figure au paragraphe 4.04(1) est la p\u00e9riode de service qui commence \u00e0 la date d'admission du participant et qui se termine \u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e entre la date de la retraite, la date de cessation d'emploi, la date de d\u00e9c\u00e8s en cours d'emploi ou la date \u00e0 laquelle le participant compte 35 ann\u00e9es de service.\n[29] L'article 4.06 intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Inclusion d'ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures pr\u00e9voit que, lorsque, avant 1987, l'emploi d'un participant prend fin avant que celui-ci n'ait acquis le droit aux prestations et que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 par la BRC apr\u00e8s 1986, les ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures sont incluses dans les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du participant.\n[30] L'article 4.07 est intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Inclusion d'ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures au choix du participant. Le paragraphe 4.07(1) mentionne que le participant qui compte des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, \u00e0 titre de contributeur, avant 1987, dont l'emploi a pris fin avant qu'il n'ait acquis les droits d'acquisition aux prestations au titre de ces ann\u00e9es de service et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 avant le 1er janvier 1987, peut demander \u00e0 l'administrateur du r\u00e9gime d'inscrire la p\u00e9riode d'emploi ant\u00e9rieure comme ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\n[31] Le paragraphe 4.07(2) intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Choix fait par les participants de sexe f\u00e9minin quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d'emploi ant\u00e9rieure au 1er mai 1974 reproduit la modification du RASBS de 2003. Ce paragraphe \u00e9num\u00e8re les r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 au RASBS et pr\u00e9voit que les participants admissibles peuvent demander \u00e0 l'administrateur du r\u00e9gime d'inscrire leur p\u00e9riode d'emploi ant\u00e9rieure au 1er mai 1974, comprise entre l'\u00e2ge de 21 et 24 ans, dans les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\n[32] Le paragraphe 4.07(2) \u00e9num\u00e8re \u00e9galement les modalit\u00e9s de paiement quant au RASBS et pr\u00e9voit de plus que la p\u00e9riode d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du RASBS n'a aucune incidence sur la date d'admission du participant et que le participant n'est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 participant au cours cette p\u00e9riode.\n[33] Il est tr\u00e8s important de souligner que les libell\u00e9s de l'article 4.06, du paragraphe 4.07(1) et du paragraphe 4.07(2), indiquent qu'il s'agit d'exceptions \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qui figure \u00e0 l'article 4.04.\nG. Mme Sugimoto et le RASBS (i) Correspondance et consultation initiales [34] L'offre du RASBS a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise aux participants au r\u00e9gime admissibles gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un document interne de la BRC intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Entre nous. Ce document est dat\u00e9 du 24 janvier 1996 et son gros titre est ainsi libell\u00e9 : [traduction] La Banque Royale s'appr\u00eate \u00e0 corriger l'\u00e9cart qui existe dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite entre le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux hommes et le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux femmes.\n[35] Ce document mentionne que l'un des objets d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, \u00e0 la suite d'une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences tenues par la BRC un an auparavant, \u00e9tait de faire de la BRC un chef de file en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des sexes. Afin d'y arriver, la BRC apporterait, dans la mesure du possible, des modifications \u00e0 ses politiques ant\u00e9rieures qui ne concordaient pas avec ses politiques actuelles en mati\u00e8re de sexe. L'une des iniquit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9es \u00e9tait l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui existait entre les hommes et les femmes quant aux r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1974.\n[36] Afin de corriger cette iniquit\u00e9, les femmes qui avaient travaill\u00e9 sans interruption pour la BRC avant mai 1974, et qui avaient entre 21 et 24 ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, se verraient offrir une occasion unique de racheter jusqu'\u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 titre de contributeur.\n[37] Les employ\u00e9s int\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui d\u00e9siraient obtenir des renseignements additionnels ont re\u00e7u un document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] Pratiques discriminatoires ant\u00e9rieures fond\u00e9es sur le sexe de la Banque Royale. Ce document faisait \u00e9tat que les employ\u00e9s admissibles pouvaient racheter des prestations de retraite sous le r\u00e9gime contributif et fixait les modalit\u00e9s, les co\u00fbts, etc., de cette offre.\n[38] Le 17 mai 1996, le centre de services en ressources humaines a distribu\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s un autre document qui faisait suite \u00e0 la lettre d'information Entre nous. Ce document portait sur la politique sp\u00e9ciale, susmentionn\u00e9e, permettant aux employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin admissibles, qui travaillaient \u00e0 temps plein pour la BRC avant le 1er mai 1974 et qui avaient entre 21 et 24 ans, de racheter des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n[39] Mme Sugimoto \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par cette offre et elle a soumis un formulaire de demande de renseignements mentionnant qu'elle d\u00e9sirait racheter trois ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite et qu'elle \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de cette offre. Elle a re\u00e7u une [traduction] Demande de rachat d'ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite - Employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin - Choix de 1996 et elle l'a remplie.\n[40] La Demande faisait \u00e9tat des renseignements suivants : la date de naissance de Mme Sugimoto; le 4 octobre 1951, sa date d'entr\u00e9e en fonction ininterrompue; le 23 f\u00e9vrier 70, la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime; le 1er mars 80, les ann\u00e9es de service qu'elle d\u00e9sirait racheter; 1,5833 (19 mois) la date \u00e0 laquelle elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime de retraite; le 1er ao\u00fbt 78. Figurait \u00e9galement dans la Demande, une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle le rachat de prestations de retraite ne pr\u00e9voyait des ann\u00e9es de service additionnelles qu'aux fins du calcul des prestations et qu'aux fins de l'actualisation de la retraite anticip\u00e9e. Mme Sugimoto devait verser un montant de 4 835 $ au titre du rachat des ann\u00e9es de participation, ce qu'elle a fait.\n[41] Selon ce que Mme Sugimoto avait compris, du moins en ce qui avait trait au RASBS, la BRC avait tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart entre les sexes. Mais, selon elle, il existait toujours une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement entre les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin du m\u00eame \u00e2ge qui poss\u00e9dait la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience de travail.\n[42] Donc, le 12 juillet 1996, Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la coordinatrice RSVP. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que les participants de sexe masculin qui poss\u00e9daient la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience de travail qu'elle, qui avaient le m\u00eame \u00e2ge qu'elle et qui avaient choisi de continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 titre contributif plut\u00f4t que de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation, pourraient prendre leur retraite 72 mois plus t\u00f4t qu'elle. Mme Sugimoto a demand\u00e9 si la BRC faisait des efforts pour \u00e9liminer l'\u00e9cart qui existait toujours quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps comprise entre 1974 et 1980.\n[43] Susan Ormiston, la coordinatrice RSVP a r\u00e9pondu par lettre dat\u00e9e le 17 septembre 1996. Elle a \u00e9crit que, en introduisant le RASBS, la BRC reconnaissait que cette mesure ne pouvait pas r\u00e9gler et ne r\u00e9glait pas toutes les iniquit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures figurant dans le r\u00e9gime. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 d'autres motifs qui reprenaient ceux qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans le rapport Mercer du 8 f\u00e9vrier 1995.\n[44] La BRC avait song\u00e9 \u00e0 offrir un rachat quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 1974 et 1980, mais elle avait rejet\u00e9 cette id\u00e9e parce que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 injuste pour les employ\u00e9s qui avaient choisi de surseoir en 1974. Si ces employ\u00e9s avaient alors su qu'il y aurait une modification quant \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e, ils auraient pris une d\u00e9cision diff\u00e9rente.\n[45] De plus, si la BRC permettait aux employ\u00e9s qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9valus du RASBS de racheter les ann\u00e9es de service comprises dans la p\u00e9riode susmentionn\u00e9e, elle pourrait faire l'objet de demandes similaires de la part des nouveaux employ\u00e9s dont l'\u00e2ge de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait de 30 ans.\n[46] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u une lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 de la part de Brad Lambert, vice-pr\u00e9sident, Op\u00e9rations bancaires, Colombie-Britannique et Yukon. Dans cette lettre, que celui-ci a \u00e9crite en r\u00e9ponse aux demandes de rachat d'ann\u00e9es de participation \u00e0 la retraite quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 1974 et 1980, M. Lambert a soulign\u00e9 que, avec le recul, il \u00e9tait possible de pr\u00e9sumer qu'un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s auraient continu\u00e9 de participer au r\u00e9gime en 1974. La pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tait cependant que les personnes qui d\u00e9siraient racheter la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 1974 et 1980, auraient choisi de surseoir en 1974 s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 participants au r\u00e9gime. Cette pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que la majorit\u00e9 des personnes qui n'avaient \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque que quelques ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 leur actif avaient justement sursis \u00e0 leur participation. M. Lambert a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que le RASBS avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9liminer, dans une grande mesure, l'iniquit\u00e9 qui existait ant\u00e9rieurement entre le traitement des hommes et le traitement des femmes, mais n'avait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 tous les probl\u00e8mes.\n[47] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9galement fait part \u00e0 une personne qui travaillait au service des prestations de retraite du fait qu'elle d\u00e9sirait se pr\u00e9valoir du rachat. Elle affirme qu'on lui a dit que, lorsqu'elle avait \u00e9labor\u00e9 le RASBS, la BRC avait conclu que, parce que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 son groupe d'\u00e2ge avaient choisi de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime en mai 1974, les participants au RASBS auraient probablement choisi eux aussi de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation. Selon Mme Sugimoto, la BRC a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que, elle et les autres, avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 compter du 1er mai 1974.\n[48] \u00c0 ce stade, il ne restait qu'une chose que Mme Sugimoto ne comprenait pas. C'\u00e9tait la question de la date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime qu'elle avait vue pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans sa demande de RASBS.\n[49] Mme Sugimoto affirme qu'elle a appel\u00e9 la ligne d'aide Connections que la BRC avait install\u00e9e afin de pouvoir donner des renseignements aux employ\u00e9s quant au RASBS. Mme Sugimoto a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Carol Ann Clark et lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi on lui attribuait le 1er ao\u00fbt 1978 comme date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime et non pas la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974.\n[50] Selon Mme Sugimoto, Mme Clark lui a dit qu'on avait fait cela \u00e0 des fins administratives dans le but de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle avait particip\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on continue au r\u00e9gime de retraite et que, en fait, elle avait rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 titre contributif quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[51] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Evelyn Murphy, \u00e0 la ligne d'aide Connections, qui lui a dit que les expressions participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite\/prestations de r\u00e9gime de retraite\/ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e9taient interchangeables. Dans leurs t\u00e9moignages devant le Tribunal, Marianne Wilson et Gary Dobbie ont souscris \u00e0 cette affirmation.\n[52] Mme Sugimoto a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Murphy, lors de cette m\u00eame conversation, lui a dit que, en se pr\u00e9valant du RASBS, elle avait rachet\u00e9 une participation au r\u00e9gime quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974.\n[53] Mme Sugimoto \u00e9tait convaincue que, apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre pr\u00e9value du RASBS, elle \u00e9tait sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9, en ce qui avait trait aux prestations de retraite, avec ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin qui avaientt choisi en 1974 de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime. Elles et eux \u00e9taient admissibles \u00e0 une pension non r\u00e9duite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 61 ans et 10 mois. Il n'y avait plus de probl\u00e8me li\u00e9 au sexe et elle n'a pas pouss\u00e9 l'affaire plus loin en 1996.\n(ii) Les \u00e9tats r\u00e9capitulatifs des avantages personnels de Mme Sugimoto [54] L'\u00e9tat r\u00e9capitulatif d'avantages personnels est un rapport annuel, distribu\u00e9 par la BRC \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, dans lequel figurent les d\u00e9tails de l'ensemble des avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 leur emploi . En ce qui concerne les d\u00e9tails relatifs \u00e0 sa retraite, l'\u00e9tat r\u00e9capitulatif de Mme Sugimoto pour 1994 faisait \u00e9tat de sa date de naissance comme \u00e9tant le 4 octobre 1951, de sa date de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime comme \u00e9tant le 1er mars 1980, de ses ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sous le r\u00e9gime contributif comme \u00e9tant comprises entre le 1er mars 1980 et le 4 mars 1985. La date de d\u00e9but de sa retraite anticip\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s 35 ann\u00e9es port\u00e9es \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit comme participante au r\u00e9gime, \u00e9tait le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2015.\n[55] L'\u00e9tat r\u00e9capitulatif de Mme Sugimoto pour 1997, lequel \u00e9tait post\u00e9rieur au RASBS, faisait \u00e9tat des m\u00eames renseignements avec l'ajout des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sous le r\u00e9gime contributif, soit la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er ao\u00fbt 1978 et le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1980 et la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er mars 1980 et le 4 mars 1985. La date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de d\u00e9but de participation au plan, c'est-\u00e0-dire le 1er ao\u00fbt 1978, avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e. La date de retraite anticip\u00e9e avec 35 ann\u00e9es port\u00e9es au cr\u00e9dit de Mme Sugimoto comme participante au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait maintenant le 31 juillet 2013, ce qui \u00e9tait d\u00fb au rachat de 19 mois de service qu'elle avait fait en vertu du RASBS. Tous les \u00e9tats r\u00e9capitulatifs des avantages personnels subs\u00e9quents de Mme Sugimoto, jusqu'\u00e0 2001 inclusivement, comprenaient ces m\u00eames renseignements.\n(iii) Le syst\u00e8me de pension PD BenPlus [56] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9galement soumis un imprim\u00e9 d'ordinateur tir\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de pension PD BenPlus. Ce syst\u00e8me est un outil de mod\u00e9lisation de retraite g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par ordinateur que la BRC met, en ligne, \u00e0 la disposition des participants au r\u00e9gime. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit en octobre 2001 afin de permettre aux employ\u00e9s de faire des calculs quant \u00e0 leur retraite et d'\u00e9laborer des sc\u00e9narios de planification de retraite disponibles sur le r\u00e9seau Intranet de la BRC. L'employ\u00e9 entre un certain nombre de donn\u00e9es hypoth\u00e9tiques comme l'augmentation de salaire pr\u00e9vue et la prime ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, l'\u00e2ge de la retraite, etc. D'autres donn\u00e9es figurant sur l'imprim\u00e9 provenaient des dossiers de retraite de la BRC.\n[57] L'imprim\u00e9 est dat\u00e9 du 17 septembre 2001 et il comprend cinq pages. Sur la page no 2, il y a une case intitul\u00e9e [traduction] D\u00e9tails sur les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Cette case indique que Mme Sugimoto fait partie du r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et que sa p\u00e9riode d'ann\u00e9es de service va du 1er mars 1980 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui. Sa p\u00e9riode d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sous le r\u00e9gime contributif est indiqu\u00e9e comme allant du 1er mars 1980 au 4 mars 1985 et sa p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure d'ann\u00e9es ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sous le r\u00e9gime contributif est indiqu\u00e9e comme allant du 1er octobre 1972 au 1er mai 1974.\n[58] Une clause d'exon\u00e9ration figure sur la page no 4 de l'imprim\u00e9. Elle mentionne qu'il est possible que les renseignements figurant sur l'imprim\u00e9 ne soient pas justes, complets ou actuels. Elle mentionne \u00e9galement que les renseignements ne sont fournis qu'\u00e0 des fins d'estimations et que celles-ci sont fond\u00e9es sur des hypoth\u00e8ses entr\u00e9es par l'employ\u00e9, lesquelles hypoth\u00e8ses pourraient changer dans l'avenir. La clause d'exon\u00e9ration pr\u00e9voit ensuite que les v\u00e9ritables prestations de retraite seront fond\u00e9es sur les dispositions du r\u00e9gime et s'il y a incompatibilit\u00e9 entre l'imprim\u00e9 et le r\u00e9gime, c'est le r\u00e9gime qui l'emportera.\nH. La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 [59] La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 est une offre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par la BRC \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s en service et aux employ\u00e9s retrait\u00e9s, hommes et femmes, qui avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime entre le 1er mai 1974 et leur trenti\u00e8me anniversaire de naissance. En vertu de cette offre, les employ\u00e9s avaient la possibilit\u00e9 de faire traiter leur p\u00e9riode de sursis, dans le calcul de leurs prestations de retraite, comme une p\u00e9riode de participation non contributive.\n[60] La campagne de r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 a \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9e par un certain nombre de personnes qui remettaient en cause la d\u00e9cision qu'elles avaient prise le 1er mai 1974 en sursoyant \u00e0 leur participation. Apr\u00e8s trois ann\u00e9es de n\u00e9gociation avec la BRC, elles ont menac\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser un recours collectif si la BRC ne prenait aucune mesure corrective.\n[61] La BRC a retenu les services d'un certain nombre de cabinets d'avocat afin que ceux-ci examinent le libell\u00e9 de la modification du r\u00e9gime du 1er mai 1974. Ceux-ci ont affirm\u00e9 que la modification pouvait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme offrant trois choix aux participants qui n'avaient pas 30 ans. Le premier choix \u00e9tait de continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 titre de contributeur, le deuxi\u00e8me choix \u00e9tait de surseoir \u00e0 sa participation jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans, le troisi\u00e8me choix \u00e9tait de continuer \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime mais \u00e0 titre de non-contributeur. Aucune interpr\u00e9tation juridique n'exigeait que la BRC offre la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 aux autres participants au r\u00e9gime.\n[62] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 cet avis juridique, la BRC a exig\u00e9 que William Mercer \u00e9value les co\u00fbts comport\u00e9s par le troisi\u00e8me choix. Dans son \u00e9valuation des co\u00fbts, Mercer a tenu compte des deux groupes suivants :\nLe groupe A - Les participants au r\u00e9gime qui avaient choisi de surseoir \u00e0 leur participation le 1er mai 1974. Mercer a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le co\u00fbt de l'offre qui consistait \u00e0 leur accorder des ann\u00e9es additionnelles de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du 1er mai 1974 jusqu'\u00e0 la date la plus rapproch\u00e9e entre le 1er mars 1980 et l'\u00e2ge de 30 ans;\nLe groupe B - Les employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin qui avaient moins de 21 ans et les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin qui avaient moins de 24 ans au 1er mai 1974 et qui n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime. Mercer a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le co\u00fbt de l'offre qui consistait \u00e0 leur offrir des ann\u00e9es additionnelles de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e0 compter de la date la plus \u00e9loign\u00e9e entre le 1er mai 1974 et la date \u00e0 laquelle l'employ\u00e9 avait atteint l'\u00e2ge de 21 ans jusqu'au 1er mars 1980.\n[63] Mercer a soulign\u00e9 que, au 1er janvier 2001, le groupe A comptait 304 femmes et 290 hommes et que le groupe B comptait 885 femmes et 53 hommes. L'augmentation des co\u00fbts actuariels pour la BRC quant au groupe A a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 23 178 000 $. Pour le groupe B, l'augmentation a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 28 346 000 $.\n[64] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport Mercer, la BRC a song\u00e9 \u00e0 offrir la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 aux participants du groupe B. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire parce qu'elle aurait d\u00fb modifier le r\u00e9gime, ce qui eut \u00e9t\u00e9 on\u00e9reux. De plus, la BRC a estim\u00e9 qu'il ne convenait pas de faire cette offre au groupe B et de ne pas la faire aux autres cat\u00e9gories d'employ\u00e9s qui ne participaient pas au r\u00e9gime le 1er mai 1974.\n[65] Dans sa lettre du 26 septembre 2001, la BRC a offert aux employ\u00e9s du groupe A ainsi qu'aux employ\u00e9s retrait\u00e9s qui avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime le 1er mai 1974, la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 titre de non contributeur quant \u00e0 leur p\u00e9riode de sursis. On rapporte que 260 femmes et 250 hommes se sont pr\u00e9valus de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. Cette offre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto. La BRC n'a pas tenu compte que celle-ci \u00e9tait une participante au r\u00e9gime qui avait sursis \u00e0 sa participation au r\u00e9gime le 1er mai 1974.\n[66] La BRC a qualifi\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 comme \u00e9tant une nouvelle interpr\u00e9tation de la modification du r\u00e9gime de mai 1974. \u00c0 ce titre, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de modifier le r\u00e9gime afin de mettre en uvre la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. La BRC ne faisait qu'administrer le r\u00e9gime en conformit\u00e9 avec le libell\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime. Elle le faisait par le biais du processus administratif.\n[67] Il y avait toutefois une modification au r\u00e9gime qui avait trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. L'article 1.02 [traduction] Historique du r\u00e9gime fut modifi\u00e9 afin de fournir une explication quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, laquelle est appel\u00e9e, dans cette disposition, la [traduction] Correction de 2001.\nI. Mme Sugimoto et la plainte qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au BSIF [68] Lorsque Mme Sugimoto a entendu parler de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la BRC la raison pour laquelle cette offre ne lui avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. On lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'y avait pas droit parce qu'elle ne participait pas au r\u00e9gime le 1er mai 1974.\n[69] Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 outr\u00e9e et, selon elle, il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un cas de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge et le sexe. Elle croyait qu'avec le RASBS, elle \u00e9tait, \u00e0 tout le moins, trait\u00e9e sur le m\u00eame pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 que ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin qui avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime en 1974. Maintenant, avec la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin pouvaient prendre leur retraite avec pension non r\u00e9duite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 56 ans mais, elle, devait attendre jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 61 ans et 10 mois pour pouvoir recevoir les m\u00eames prestations de retraite.\n[70] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenace dans ses efforts visant \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ce qui, selon elle, \u00e9tait une autre in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement entre les sexes. Elle a \u00e9crit de nombreuses lettres et de nombreux courriels \u00e0 des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la BRC. Elle a eu de nombreuses conversations avec des repr\u00e9sentants de la BRC, mais cela n'a rien chang\u00e9.\n[71] Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9crit pour la premi\u00e8re fois au Bureau du surintendant des institutions financi\u00e8res (BSIF) le 4 septembre 2002, trois mois avant de d\u00e9poser sa plainte \u00e0 la CCDP. Le BSIF est notamment charg\u00e9 de superviser les r\u00e9gimes de retraite administr\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu de la Loi de 1985 sur les normes de prestation de pension (LNPP).\n[72] Dans sa lettre, Mme Sugimoto a relat\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e l'ensemble des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s entre 1974 et la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. Elle a demand\u00e9 l'aide et les conseils du BSIF concernant les effets du RASBS et plus particuli\u00e8rement concernant la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 qui, selon elle, \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge et le sexe.\n[73] Les pr\u00e9tentions de Mme Sugimoto refl\u00e9taient les observations qu'elle avait soumises \u00e0 la CCDP et le t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lors de l'audience devant le Tribunal. De plus, l'avocat de Mme Sugimoto a soumis un certain nombre d'observations \u00e9crites au BSIF et a rencontr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants du BSIF. Mme Sugimoto et son avocat ont soulev\u00e9 les points suivants dans leurs observations : premi\u00e8rement, ils ont parl\u00e9 de l'affirmation qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le BISF et selon laquelle la question de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement entre les sexes \u00e9tait une question de droits de la personne et ne rel\u00e8vait donc pas de la comp\u00e9tence du BSIF.\n[74] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la BRC a communiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on inad\u00e9quate les renseignements car ce n'\u00e9taient pas tous les employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin admissibles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement inform\u00e9s quant au RASBS et certains employ\u00e9s ont re\u00e7u des renseignements erron\u00e9s. De plus, les mots ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension et participation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s indiff\u00e9remment dans les communications \u00e9mises par la BRC et cela a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si les participants avaient rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de participation ou des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Enfin, il y a eu la question du d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif par la BRC, aupr\u00e8s du BSIF, de la modification du RASBS.\n[75] L'examen par le BSIF des questions soulev\u00e9es par Mme Sugimoto a dur\u00e9 plus de deux ans. Il a tir\u00e9 ses conclusions, puis il en a fait part dans la lettre du 14 d\u00e9cembre 2004 qu'il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Grosman, Grosman & Gale, les avocats de Mme Sugimoto. Il en a \u00e9galement fait part dans la lettre du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2004 qu'il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto, puis dans la lettre du 21 janvier 2004 qu'il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la BRC.\n[76] Quant \u00e0 la question de la communication inad\u00e9quate, le BSIF a conclu que la BRC s'\u00e9tait conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la LNPP en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la communication aux participants concern\u00e9s de l'offre de RASBS et de la modification du r\u00e9gime.\n[77] Le BSIF a critiqu\u00e9 la BRC quant au retard qu'il y a eu entre la r\u00e9solution du conseil de 1995 et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la modification du RASBS de 2003 et il a propos\u00e9 que la BRC revoit ses proc\u00e9dures afin de voir \u00e0 ce que la LNPP soit respect\u00e9e.\n[78] Le BSIF a \u00e9galement critiqu\u00e9 la BRC quant \u00e0 la confusion qu'a caus\u00e9e dans ses communications avec les participants l'utilisation des expressions rachat de trois ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime et rachat de prestations de retraite ou d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Le BSIF a soulign\u00e9 que si la modification apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de retraite avait suivi de pr\u00e8s la r\u00e9solution de 1995, cette confusion aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9e.\n[79] Sur la question du RASBS, des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension et de la participation au r\u00e9gime, la BSIF a \u00e9crit qu'il avait examin\u00e9 les communications \u00e9crites qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remises aux participants, notamment la lettre d'information Entre Nous, la demande de RASBS, le m\u00e9moire du 17 mai 1996 adress\u00e9 aux participants admissibles et les documents soumis par Mme Sugimoto, notamment ses rapports annuels d'avantages personnels. Le BSIF a conclu ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nNous avons remarqu\u00e9 que les communications adress\u00e9es aux participants renvoyaient au rachat d'avantages ant\u00e9rieurs comme \u00e9tant le rachat de trois ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 titre contributif, le rachat de prestations de retraite du r\u00e9gime contributif ainsi que le rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\nIl nous est impossible de faire quelque commentaire que ce soit quant aux conseils oraux re\u00e7us par les participants au r\u00e9gime de retraite de la part de membres du personnel de la Banque. Toutefois, il nous est impossible de conclure que, \u00e0 partir des documents soumis, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 promis aux participants que leur rachat de prestations de retraite aurait une incidence sur leur date de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime ou qu'ils seraient pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 participants durant la p\u00e9riode de rachat.\nCela est compatible avec le libell\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution de 1995 et la modification applicable d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du BSIF en octobre 2003.\n[80] Mme Sugimoto n'a pas vraiment accept\u00e9 la conclusion du BSIF. Le 20 juin 2005, elle a \u00e9crit au BSIF et a affirm\u00e9 qu'il lui semblait que ses conclusions \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des renseignements, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des documents incomplets et qu'il y avait un certain nombre de questions qu'il avait omis d'examiner. Dans sa lettre de 16 pages, Mme Sugimoto \u00e9num\u00e8re les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le BSIF devraient examiner. Elle a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit au BSIF le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2005 et a pr\u00e9tendu que celui-ci avait contrevenu \u00e0 la LNPP, puis elle a donn\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de n'a pas rapport avec la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[81] Le 22 juin 2006, le BSIF a r\u00e9pondu qu'il \u00e9tait en train d'examiner les questions soulev\u00e9es par Mme Sugimoto. Il n'a toujours pas r\u00e9pondu.\nII. L'ANALYSE A. Le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie et les questions \u00e0 trancher [82] Dans une cause en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne devant le Tribunal, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, c'est-\u00e0-dire si elles sont cr\u00e9dibles, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas comprendre la question de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Voir Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 2004; Dhanjal c. Air Canada, (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37, paragraphe 6)\n[83] Mme Sugimoto soul\u00e8ve trois arguments quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination :\npar le biais du RASBS, elle a rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1974 et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable par rapport \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin parce qu'elle s'est vu refuser l'occasion de participer \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. par ailleurs, si elle ne rachetait pas des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1974, le RASBS devenait alors s\u00e9lectif. Il visait, sans r\u00e9ussir, \u00e0 lui donner le m\u00eame statut que celui de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Elle pr\u00e9tend qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 \u00e9galement d'un cas de discrimination d\u00e9favorable. la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001\u00e9tait neutre en apparence et \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e s'appliquer \u00e0 tous les participants qui avaient sursis au r\u00e9gime en 1974. Toutefois, les femmes qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9values du RASBS et qui s'\u00e9taient fait dire qu'on rendait leur traitement \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui de leurs coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin, se sont vu refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. Les effets de cette r\u00e8gle apparemment neutre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciables aux femmes qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9values du RASBS.\nB. Mme Sugimoto a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite avant mai 1974? [84] Un certain nombre de faits appuient la preuve prima facie de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite avant 1974 et de l'existence d'un traitement d\u00e9favorable. Il y a eu l'annonce faite dans la lettre d'information Entre Nous selon laquelle la BRC [traduction] s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 corriger l'iniquit\u00e9 qui existait entre le traitement des hommes et le traitement des femmes quant au r\u00e9gime de retraite. Afin de corriger les iniquit\u00e9s pass\u00e9es figurant dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite, les personnes admissibles se sont vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de racheter jusqu'\u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite contributif.\n[85] D'autres documents remis aux employ\u00e9s, comme le bulletin des Ressources humaines du 17 mai 1996, qualifiaient le RASBS de rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Dans le formulaire de demande de renseignements, le RASBS a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant le rachat de [traduction] prestations du r\u00e9gime de retraite contributif.\n[86] Mme Sugimoto s'est fait dire par Evelyn Murphy lorsqu'elle a appel\u00e9 la ligne Connections que les expressions participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite\/prestations de r\u00e9gime de retraite\/ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es indiff\u00e9remment. Cette affirmation fut confirm\u00e9e par d'autres repr\u00e9sentants de la BRC (Gary Dobbie et Marianne Wilson).\n[87] Quant \u00e0 la date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime, Mme Sugimoto s'est fait dire par Carol Ann Clark de la ligne Connections qu'il s'agit d'une expression utilis\u00e9e par la BRC \u00e0 des fins administratives afin de d\u00e9montrer une participation continue au r\u00e9gime de retraite. Cette expression ne se retrouve cependant nulle part dans le libell\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n[88] Selon Mme Sugimoto, Mme Clark et Mme Murphy lui ont dit qu'elle avait rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 titre contributif quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974.\n[89] Il y a la lettre du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1996 \u00e0 Brad Lambert dans laquelle celui-ci parlait du postulat que les employ\u00e9s qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la situation de Mme Sugimoto auraient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1974. De plus, Mme Sugimoto s'est fait dire par le service des prestations de retraite que la BRC, en \u00e9laborant le RASBS, avait conclu que les participants au RASBS auraient vraisemblablement sursis \u00e0 leur participation et que la BRC avait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que Mme Sugimoto et les autres avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation en 1974. Si c'est le cas, alors, logiquement, la BRC a d\u00fb juger que Mme Sugimoto participait au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1974.\n[90] Enfin, il y a l'imprim\u00e9 BenPlus qui indique que la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension du r\u00e9gime contributif est la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974. Ces renseignements proviennent des dossiers de retraite de la BRC et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entr\u00e9s par elle dans le syst\u00e8me.\n[91] Il ne fait aucun doute que, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s qu'elle se fut pr\u00e9value du RASBS, Mme Sugimoto \u00e9tait sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin en ce sens qu'elle pouvait prendre sa retraite au m\u00eame \u00e2ge qu'eux et recevoir la m\u00eame pension qu'eux.\n[92] Si on accepte que la lettre d'information Entre Nous a inform\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s que la BRC s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 corriger la diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les sexes, que Mme Sugimoto s'est fait dire que, en participant au RASBS, elle avait rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de participation au r\u00e9gime contributif pour la p\u00e9riode pertinente, que cette derni\u00e8re expression est interchangeable avec ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension\/prestations de retraite; que la date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime n'est pas une expression utilis\u00e9e dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite, que la BRC a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que les femmes qui avaient particip\u00e9 au RASBS avaient sursis \u00e0 leur participation au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1974, laissant entendre par l\u00e0 qu'elles \u00e9taient participantes, que l'imprim\u00e9 BenPlus indiquait que sa p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sous le r\u00e9gime contributif PD \u00e9tait comprise entre le 10 octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974, il est raisonnable de conclure que Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'elle avait acquis le m\u00eame statut que ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle \u00e9tait une personne qui participait au r\u00e9gime de retraite avant 1974 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir sursis \u00e0 sa participation en 1974.\n[93] Il existe \u00e9galement une preuve prima facie que Mme Sugimoto n'\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, que ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin \u00e9taient admissibles, que la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 \u00e9tablissait une distinction entre elle et ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin et que cette distinction lui avait caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice dans le cours de son emploi.\n[94] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai conclu que Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de distinction illicite en rapport avec la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 \u00e0 la suite de la distinction faite entre la participation au r\u00e9gime avant 1974 de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin et sa propre participation avant 1974.\nC. L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination? [95] De nombreux aspects de la preuve prima facie n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9fut\u00e9s. L'inadmissibilit\u00e9 de Mme Sugimoto \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 et l'admissibilit\u00e9 de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin, le fait que l'initiative du RASBS s'adressait sp\u00e9cifiquement aux femmes, le fait que le RASBS \u00e9galisait de fa\u00e7on imm\u00e9diate les possibilit\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la retraite. La seule question contest\u00e9e est celle qui consiste \u00e0 savoir si, en vertu du RASBS, Mme Sugimoto obtenait le statut de participant au r\u00e9gime de retraite avant 1974.\n[96] La BRC souligne que rien dans la demande de Mme Sugimoto ne fait allusion \u00e0 une quelconque participation au r\u00e9gime avant le 1er mai 1974, ni qu'elle aurait sign\u00e9 une carte d'adh\u00e9sion qui lui accordait cens\u00e9ment une participation r\u00e9troactive au r\u00e9gime quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 1974. De plus, la demande de Mme Sugimoto \u00e9tablit clairement que le rachat de prestations de retraite n'accordent des ann\u00e9es de service additionnelles qu'aux fins du calcul des prestations et qu'aux fins de l'actualisation de la retraite anticip\u00e9e.\n[97] Les \u00e9tats r\u00e9capitulatifs des avantages personnels de Mme Sugimoto, de 1997 \u00e0 2001, indiquaient tous que sa date de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait le 1er mars 1980. Rien dans ces \u00e9tats r\u00e9capitulatifs n'indiquait que Mme Sugimoto avait particip\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime entre le 1er octobre 1972 et le 1er mai 1974.\n[98] Bernard Morency, actuaire chez William Mercer, \u00e9tait l'actuaire du r\u00e9gime et il a particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration du RASBS ainsi qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. Il a affirm\u00e9 que toute prestation de retraite qui peut revenir aux participants au r\u00e9gime doit \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e dans le libell\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime. Bien que la modification du RASBS n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e au libell\u00e9 qu'en 2003, les participants au r\u00e9gime et le fiduciaire du r\u00e9gime pouvaient se tourner vers la r\u00e9solution du conseil de 1995 pour d\u00e9finir les droits des participants en vertu du RASBS.\n[99] Selon M. Morency, le RASBS donnait aux employ\u00e9s admissibles la possibilit\u00e9 de faire une contribution afin de se faire cr\u00e9diter les ann\u00e9es de service admissibles consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Le RASBS, lorsque l'on y souscrivait, comptait pour des ann\u00e9es de contribution quant au montant de pension annuelle et comptait \u00e9galement quant aux 35 ann\u00e9es de service exig\u00e9es pour la retraite anticip\u00e9e. Pour M. Morency, le RASBS n'avait aucune incidence sur la date de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime. Il modifiait les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension ou ajoutait des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension.\n[100] Marianne Wilson \u00e9tait la gestionnaire, Administration du r\u00e9gime de retraite, au centre des Ressources humaines, de 1987 \u00e0 1998. Elle s'occupait de la gestion quotidienne du r\u00e9gime et voyait \u00e0 ce que tous les calculs de prestations des employ\u00e9s soient d\u00fbment faits. Elle r\u00e9pondait aux questions des employ\u00e9s, elle tenait \u00e0 jour les feuilles de paye aux fins de pension et elle s'occupait de l'administration des feuilles de paye des retrait\u00e9s. Elle s'est beaucoup occup\u00e9 de la mise en uvre du RASBS, notamment de l'\u00e9laboration des documents exig\u00e9s pour le RASBS.\n[101] Selon Mme Wilson, la date du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime des employ\u00e9s n'a jamais chang\u00e9. L'expression date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait la m\u00e9thode que la BRC utilisait pour inscrire les employ\u00e9s qui rachetaient des ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures. Cette m\u00e9thode permet de fixer une date \u00e0 laquelle les ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures comptent comme ann\u00e9es de service d\u00e9compt\u00e9es.\n[102] Mme Wilson appelait ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de de l'antidatation. Cette formule est semblable \u00e0 ce qui se faisait dans les libell\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurs du r\u00e9gime et la modification du RASBS suivait en principe les versions ant\u00e9rieures, sauf que la structure de la modification du RASBS est quelque peu diff\u00e9rente.\n[103] Mme Wilson a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 des libell\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurs du r\u00e9gime tels qu'ils \u00e9taient alors r\u00e9dig\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9montrer l'analogie historique quant \u00e0 la date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article C1.25 des r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de gestion de retraite, modifi\u00e9s en date du 1er mai 1974. Ainsi, un participant au r\u00e9gime qui n'\u00e9tait plus \u00e0 l'emploi de la BRC et qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 plus tard, \u00e9tait trait\u00e9 comme un nouvel employ\u00e9 et se voyait attribuer une nouvelle date d'admission au r\u00e9gime. Cette nouvelle date d'admission pouvait \u00eatre antidat\u00e9e afin de tenir compte des ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures de l'employ\u00e9. Dans le cadre de cette antidatation, l'employ\u00e9 ne se voyait accorder aucune participation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00e0 sa date initiale de d\u00e9but d'emploi. Ce traitement est analogue aux mesures administratives prises par la BRC lorsqu'elle a fix\u00e9 la date pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du d\u00e9but de la participation de Mme Sugimoto au r\u00e9gime.\n[104] Le 1er janvier 1981, les r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s ont report\u00e9 l'article C1.25 et ont ajout\u00e9 l'article C1.26, lequel permettait que les ann\u00e9es de service perdues en raison d'un conflit de travail soient pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es \u00eatre des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Soulignons qu'aucune mention de modification de la date d'admission ne figure dans cette disposition.\n[105] Les r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s de 1974 et de 1981 sont r\u00e9v\u00e9lateurs car ils montrent la relation qui existe dans le r\u00e9gime entre le rachat des ann\u00e9es de service et le rachat des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. En vertu de l'alin\u00e9a C1.12m) des r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s de 1974, les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension sont les ann\u00e9es comprises dans la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 la date d'admission au r\u00e9gime et se terminant \u00e0 la date de cessation d'emploi ou au 35e anniversaire de l'admission. Le participant est d\u00e9fini comme \u00e9tant un employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis au r\u00e9gime.\n[106] Les r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s de 1981 reportaient cette m\u00eame d\u00e9finition, sauf que la d\u00e9finition d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais assujettie \u00e0 l'application de l'article C1.25 et de l'article C1.26. Par cons\u00e9quent, aux fins de ces deux dispositions, la notion d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e9tait dissoci\u00e9e de la notion d'admission \u00e0 la participation. Elles n'\u00e9taient plus interchangeables.\n[107] M. Morency a donn\u00e9 un exemple de la fa\u00e7on selon laquelle l'article C1.25 fonctionnait. Un employ\u00e9 qui avait particip\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime entre 1974 et 1978, qui quittait la BRC et retournait y travailler en 1981, se voyait cr\u00e9diter quatre ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieur. Lorsque l'employ\u00e9 retournait travailler \u00e0 la BRC, sa date de d\u00e9but de participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e9tait 1981. L'article C1.25 permettait cependant que la date d'admission de l'employ\u00e9 soit antidat\u00e9e \u00e0 1977.\n[108] M. Dobbie a parl\u00e9 de l'imprim\u00e9 d'ordinateur BenPlus. Il a soulign\u00e9 l'existence de la clause d'exon\u00e9ration qui mentionnait que les renseignements n'\u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre pas complets, pr\u00e9cis ou justes et qu'ils \u00e9taient fournis \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes fins. Il s'agissait d'un nouveau syst\u00e8me; il ne servait qu'\u00e0 des fins de renseignements et il ne visait pas \u00e0 fournir des conseils pr\u00e9cis parce que le calcul \u00e9tait, dans une certaine mesure, effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de renseignements fournis par l'employ\u00e9. Il ne visait pas \u00e0 remplacer les \u00e9tats r\u00e9capitulatifs des avantages personnels.\n[109] Quant \u00e0 la partie de l'imprim\u00e9 intitul\u00e9e D\u00e9tails des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la banque Royale ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, p\u00e9riode de contribution au r\u00e9gime, 1er octobre 1972 au 1er mai 1974, elle ne fait qu'indiquer que Mme Sugimo a rachet\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode susmentionn\u00e9e. De ce point de vue, selon M. Dobbie, cela est semblable \u00e0 la date qui figurerait l\u00e0 dans le cas des employ\u00e9s qui ont un dossier de service interrompu.\n[110] Les droits ou avantages que Mme Sugimoto peut avoir acquis par le biais de son RASBS doivent \u00eatre transmis par la r\u00e9solution du conseil de 1995 et par la modification du r\u00e9gime du RASBS de 2003 qui entrait en vigueur le 1er janvier 1996. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce sont l\u00e0 les sources que je dois examiner.\n[111] J'inclus la modification du r\u00e9gime parce que le BSIF, l'autorit\u00e9 qui est charg\u00e9e de r\u00e9glementer les r\u00e9gimes de pension f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, a conclu que la modification du RASBS de 2003 \u00e9tait compatible avec la r\u00e9solution du conseil de 1995. L'id\u00e9e de Mme Sugimoto que le BSIF puisse changer sa position en raison des observations qu'elle a soumises le 20 juin 2005 est purement sp\u00e9culative.\n[112] Ce que Mme Sugimoto s'est fait dire ou promettre par les repr\u00e9sentants de la BRC ou ce que Mme Sugimoto a compris \u00e0 la lecture des divers documents ne peut pas constituer la source de ses droits. La pr\u00e9sente affaire dont est saisi le Tribunal n'est pas une affaire de contrat, ni une affaire de pr\u00e9clusion ou de fausse repr\u00e9sentation.\n[113] Selon ce que je comprends de la modification du RASBS de 2003, c'est qu'elle ajoute la p\u00e9riode du RASBS aux ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension au titre du r\u00e9gime contributif que Mme Sugimoto a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 accumuler lorsqu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime le 1er mars 1980.\n[114] Cela ressort clairement du paragraphe 4.07(2) de la modification de 2003 qui s'applique nonobstant la d\u00e9finition d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qui figure \u00e0 l'article 4.04. Tout comme l'alin\u00e9a C1.12m) des r\u00e8glements consolid\u00e9s de 1981 assujettissait la d\u00e9finition d'ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e0 l'article C1.25 et \u00e0 l'article C1.26.\n[115] De plus, il ressort clairement des derniers mots du paragraphe 4.07(2) que l'acquisition d'ann\u00e9es additionnelles de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension en vertu de cette disposition a une incidence sur la date d'admission du participant. Ceci est la cons\u00e9quence du RASBS et n'a pas conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto le statut de participant au r\u00e9gime avant 1974 ayant sursis \u00e0 sa participation. La date d'admission au r\u00e9gime de Mme Sugimoto est demeur\u00e9e le 1er mars 1980.\n[116] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ai conclu que l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la preuve prima facie et qu'il n'y avait aucune discrimination dans son refus de permettre \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto de participer \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. Comme le RASBS n'accordait pas \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto le statut de participant avant 1974, on ne pouvait pas comparer cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin.\nD. Le RASBS avait-il un caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif et \u00e9tait-il, par cons\u00e9quent, discriminatoire? [117] Hormis l'affirmation que le RASBS avait un caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif parce qu'il ne lui accordait pas ce qu'il \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 lui accorder, Mme Sugimoto a offert peu d'arguments ou peu de fondements juridiques \u00e0 l'appui de sa position. Toutefois, comme l'argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9, je vais l'examiner.\n[118] Dans Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a examin\u00e9 la notion de caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif et de discrimination en vertu du Code des droits de la personne du Manitoba.\n[119] Cette cause portait sur le r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective de Canada Safeway qui comportait dans ses avantages le versement de prestations, sauf pendant une p\u00e9riode de 17 semaines, durant la grossesse.\n[120] En traitant de la question de savoir si l'exclusion susmentionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce qu'elle avait un caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif, la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que la couverture s\u00e9lective constituait peut-\u00eatre un moyen d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 de permettre la discrimination. Il n'est pas moins discriminatoire de restreindre l'acc\u00e8s d'un groupe \u00e0 des avantages que de lui imposer une sanction ou un fardeau.\n[121] Dans l'arr\u00eat Brooks, Canada Safeway \u00e9tait tenue en vertu du Code des droits de la personne du Manitoba de ne pas refuser, en vertu du r\u00e9gime d'assurance collective, \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin des avantages \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux de ses employ\u00e9s de sexe masculin.\n[122] Le probl\u00e8me que pose l'application du principe de la s\u00e9lectivit\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce est que, en vertu de celui-ci, on pr\u00e9sume que la BRC \u00e9tait tenue par la LCDP de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination qui a eu lieu avant l'adoption de la LCDP. Ce n'est cependant pas le cas.\n[123] Il est contraire \u00e0 la logique de dire \u00e0 un employeur qu'il n'est pas tenu par la loi d'\u00e9liminer la discrimination qui existait avant l'adoption de la LCDP, mais que, s'il d\u00e9cide de le faire, il doit \u00e9liminer la discrimination dans son ensemble ou encourir sa responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP pour la partie de la discrimination \u00e0 laquelle il n'a pas rem\u00e9di\u00e9. Ou, exprim\u00e9 d'une autre mani\u00e8re, un geste \u00e0 titre gracieux pour tenir compte de la discrimination qui a eu lieu avant l'adoption de la LCDP n'encourra aucune responsabilit\u00e9 pour s\u00e9lectivit\u00e9.\n[124] Pour ces motifs, selon moi, Mme Sugimoto n'a pas prouv\u00e9 prima facie qu'il y avait eu discrimination en raison du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif du RASBS.\nE. La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 est-elle discriminatoire au point d'\u00e9tablir une distinction entre les participants et les non participants? [125] La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, quoique neutre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue (elle n'\u00e9tablit aucune distinction entre les hommes et les femmes - uniquement entre les participants et les non-participants), impose une restriction quant aux femmes qui se trouvent dans la situation de Mme Sugimoto en raison d'une caract\u00e9ristique particuli\u00e8re qu'elles ont en commun, \u00e0 savoir, l'inadmissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1974 en raison de leur \u00e2ge et de leur sexe. Cette caract\u00e9ristique particuli\u00e8re d\u00e9coule de l'application d'une r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re de retraite qui \u00e9tait en vigueur avant l'adoption de la LCDP. Des restrictions indirectes fond\u00e9es sur des caract\u00e9ristiques de ce genre sont qualifi\u00e9es de discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[126] La discrimination par suite d'un effet pr\u00e9judiciable a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par la Cour supr\u00eame dans O'Malley. La difficult\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, laquelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9e dans O'Malley, est celle de la r\u00e9trospectivit\u00e9.\n[127] Est-il discriminatoire que la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 \u00e9tablisse une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la participation ant\u00e9rieure, compte tenu que cette distinction existait avant l'adoption de la LCDP? Selon moi, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question par la n\u00e9gative dans la d\u00e9cision Gell c. Canadian Pacific Ltd., (1987) 10 C.H.R.R. D\/5494.\n[128] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gell, avant que la LCDP n'entre en vigueur, le r\u00e9gime de retraite de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comportait une r\u00e8gle relative \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge maximum (la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge) qui excluait du r\u00e9gime les personnes qui avaient 40 ans ou plus lorsqu'elles avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les plaignants, qui avaient tous les deux plus de 40 ans lorsqu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus du r\u00e9gime de retraite en vertu de la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge.\n[129] En 1978, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a modifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime de retraite afin de donner aux employ\u00e9s admissibles le droit de participer au r\u00e9gime s'ils avaient ant\u00e9rieurement choisi de ne pas participer ou s'ils avaient cess\u00e9 de participer. Les plaignants n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles en raison de la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge.\n[130] En 1979, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a modifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime \u00e0 nouveau afin de donner, \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au r\u00e9gime en vertu de la modification de 1978, la possibilit\u00e9 de racheter jusqu'\u00e0 10 ann\u00e9es de service ant\u00e9rieures ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Les plaignants n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles au rachat de 1979 parce qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admissibles \u00e0 profiter de la modification de 1978.\n[131] En 1980, la LCDP est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9gime de retraite. Cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a apport\u00e9 une autre modification au r\u00e9gime et celle-ci permettait aux employ\u00e9s, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement exclus du r\u00e9gime en raison de la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e2ge, de participer au r\u00e9gime. Les plaignants ont alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 participer.\n[132] En 1982, une autre modification a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime. Celle-ci visait exclusivement les employ\u00e9s qui avaient profit\u00e9 des modifications de 1978 et de 1979. La modification de 1982 permettait aux employ\u00e9s admissibles de racheter les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qu'ils n'avaient pas encore rachet\u00e9es. Les plaignants n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles \u00e0 profiter de la modification de 1982 en raison de leur inadmissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 profiter des modifications de 1978 et de 1979.\n[133] Les plaignants ont pr\u00e9tendu que leur exclusion de la modification du rachat de 1982 \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce que les r\u00e8gles d'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la modification incorporaient par renvoi une r\u00e8gle discriminatoire en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e2ge qui existait avant que les dispositions de la LCDP n'entrent en vigueur. Ils ont pr\u00e9tendu que, comme l'offre de rachat (\u00e0 laquelle la LCDP s'appliquait) tenait compte de consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires ant\u00e9rieures (auxquelles la LCDP ne s'appliquait pas), l'offre de rachat \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[134] La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a pas souscris \u00e0 cette opinion. Elle a d'abord soulign\u00e9 que l'offre de rachat \u00e9tait essentiellement neutre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue (elle n'\u00e9tablissait une distinction qu'en fonction de la participation au r\u00e9gime \u00e0 une date pr\u00e9cise). Elle a ensuite soulign\u00e9 que l'inadmissibilit\u00e9 des plaignants \u00e0 l'offre de rachat \u00e9tait imputable uniquement \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle discriminatoire qui existait avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP.\n[135] La Cour a conclu que la r\u00e8gle susmentionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait parfaitement l\u00e9gale \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et comme la LCDP n'exige pas son abolition r\u00e9troactive, il faut donc vivre avec les cons\u00e9quences de son application. Par cons\u00e9quent, suivant Gell, un fait ou une transaction neutre n'enclenche pas l'application de la LCDP du seul fait qu'il se fonde sur une situation discriminatoire ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la LCDP.\n[136] Mme Sugimoto pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9cision Gell doit \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente affaire parce qu'elle ne comportait pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important qui est pr\u00e9sent en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 savoir le RASBS. \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence de Gell, la BRC a pris l'initiative, apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP, de r\u00e9duire l'\u00e9cart qui existait entre le groupe de la plaignante et les groupes de comparaison (le degr\u00e9 de r\u00e9duction de l'\u00e9cart fait l'objet d'un litige, mais aucune partie ne nie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit, du moins en partie).\n[137] Mme Sugimoto affirme que l'initiative du RASBS constituait un engagement envers la pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'ensemble des femmes qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9values du RASBS, c'est-\u00e0-dire un engagement envers l'\u00e9limination de l'\u00e9cart cr\u00e9\u00e9 avant que la LCDP n'entre en vigueur. De plus, elle pr\u00e9tend que c'est ainsi que la BRC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le RASBS \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de sexe f\u00e9minin. En bout de ligne toutefois, selon Mme Sugimoto, la BRC n'a pas respect\u00e9 son engagement et le RASBS n'a pas eu l'effet escompt\u00e9 par celle-ci.\n[138] Mme Sugimoto souligne qu'aucune des circonstances susmentionn\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes dans Gell. Dans cette affaire, il n'\u00e9tait aucunement question d'une initiative visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l'\u00e9cart qui existait entre le plaignant et les groupes de comparaison. Il n'\u00e9tait aucunement question d'un engagement envers l'\u00e9limination de l'\u00e9cart qui existait entre les personnes ayant 40 ans et plus et les personnes ayant moins de 40 ans, ni d'aucune pr\u00e9tention voulant que cet \u00e9cart ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, on ne saurait affirmer que, dans Gell, on n'a pas respect\u00e9 de tels engagements.\n[139] Il est vrai qu'il y a des diff\u00e9rences factuelles entre Gell et la pr\u00e9sente affaire, notamment l'absence, dans Gell, de quelque chose d'analogue \u00e0 l'initiative du RASBS. Toutefois, cela ne suffit pas pour que l'on puisse \u00e9tablir une distinction entre cette d\u00e9cision et la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[140] Pour ce faire, il serait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que les diff\u00e9rences factuelles en question sont pertinentes au raisonnement de la Cour. Gell \u00e9nonce le principe qu'un fait ou une transaction neutre n'enclenche pas l'application de la LCDP du seul fait qu'il se fonde sur une situation discriminatoire ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la LCDP. La pr\u00e9sence du RASBS dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne rend pas ce principe moins valable.\n[141] J'ai conclu plus t\u00f4t que le RASBS n'avait pas modifi\u00e9 le statut de Mme Sugimoto au point de la mettre sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. Le RASBS a tout simplement r\u00e9duit l'\u00e9cart existant dans les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. J'ai \u00e9galement conclu qu'en r\u00e9duisant l'\u00e9cart -un \u00e9cart que la BRC n'\u00e9tait pas tenue d'\u00e9liminer au d\u00e9part-le RASBS ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant un caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif ou comme \u00e9tablissant une distinction d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto.\n[142] En fait, le RASBS accordait \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto une indemnisation partielle pour l'exclusion ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la LCDP. Mais, en ce qui concerne son statut, le RASBS ne l'a pas plac\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001, dans une meilleure position que celle dans laquelle se trouvaient les plaignants dans Gell au moment de la modification de 1982. Dans chaque affaire les personnes concern\u00e9es \u00e9taient \u00e9ventuellement devenues participantes au r\u00e9gime, mais elles \u00e9taient toujours inadmissibles \u00e0 l'offre neutre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue en mati\u00e8re de retraite en question parce que l'offre \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 d'anciennes r\u00e8gles de participation discriminatoires qui existaient avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP.\n[143] Dans Gell, le rachat contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait une offre qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au groupe de comparaison et qui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un certain statut dont jouissait ce groupe avant que la LCDP n'entre en vigueur (ce statut n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 aux plaignants \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque).\n[144] En outre, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e9ouverture, une offre faite aux membres du groupe de comparaison, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un certain statut dont jouissaient les membres de ce groupe avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP (un statut qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sugimoto \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qu'elle n'a jamais acquis r\u00e9troactivement, malgr\u00e9 le RASBS).\n[145] Dans Gell, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les diff\u00e9rences discriminatoires de statut ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la LCDP peuvent toujours \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que cette loi fut entr\u00e9e en vigueur, et ce, sans engagement de responsabilit\u00e9.\n[146] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00e9sultat ne peut pas \u00eatre diff\u00e9rent. L'existence du RASBS ne modifie pas la diff\u00e9rence discriminatoire de statut ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la LCDP qui s\u00e9pare Mme Sugimoto de ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin.\n[147] Dans ses observations, Mme Sugimoto s'est fond\u00e9e, dans une large mesure, sur le jugement dissident rendu par le juge Jackson dans la cause Anderson c. Saskatchewan Teachers Superannuation Commission (1995) 24 C.H.R.R. D\/177 (C.A. Sask.).\n[148] Dans Anderson, une commission scolaire avait une politique exigeant que les enseignantes d\u00e9missionnent afin de pouvoir prendre un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, puis fassent une nouvelle demande d'emploi. En vertu de cette politique, les enseignantes \u00e9taient incapables d'accumuler des ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension durant leurs absences au travail li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur grossesse. \u00c0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 50 et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 60, les enseignantes qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte avaient d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 pour des raisons de grossesse et d'accouchement, puis elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la fin de leur cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[149] \u00c0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 70, la province a adopt\u00e9 des lois qui interdisaient, en milieu de travail, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[150] En 1976, la commission scolaire a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 autoriser les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 officiels plut\u00f4t que d'exiger des d\u00e9missions. De plus, en 1976, une loi sur les pensions fut adopt\u00e9e et celle-ci permettait essentiellement aux femmes de racheter les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qu'elles avaient perdues pendant qu'elles \u00e9taient en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par la commission.\n[151] Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90, les plaignantes ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 racheter les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension qu'elles avaient perdues en raison de leurs grossesses. La commission des pensions a refus\u00e9 car les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s par la commission; les plaignantes avaient d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 pour prendre leur cong\u00e9.\n[152] Les plaignantes ont ensuite pr\u00e9tendu que le refus de la commission des pensions de leur permettre de racheter des ann\u00e9es de service en rapport avec leurs cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[153] Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d'appel de la Saskatchewan ont jug\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle de rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Compte tenu de leur conclusion, les juges majoritaires n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de tenir compte du fait que l'origine du conflit relatif au rachat, \u00e0 savoir les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 non autoris\u00e9s par la commission \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 50 et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 60, \u00e9tait ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi antidiscriminatoire applicable.\n[154] La juge Jackson, dissidente, a jug\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re de rachat d'ann\u00e9es de service \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Ce faisant, elle a d\u00fb tenir compte du fait que les d\u00e9missions pour grossesse des plaignantes se sont produites avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code des droits de la personne (le Code) et que celui-ci ne s'appliquait pas aux actes discriminatoires qui s'\u00e9taient produits avant son entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\n[155] Toutefois, selon la juge Jackson, l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour cette analyse n'\u00e9tait pas l'ancienne politique qui obligeait les femmes \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner pour prendre leur cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t la nouvelle loi, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'introduction d'une nouvelle r\u00e8gle de rachat de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 qui excluait les plaignantes (en raison de la discrimination ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code) parce qu'elles n'avaient pas pu prendre des cong\u00e9s autoris\u00e9s par la commission.\n[156] La nouvelle r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re de rachat n'\u00e9tait pas une cons\u00e9quence naturelle de l'ancienne politique ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est \u00e0 noter que la commission des pensions n'\u00e9tait pas tenue d'offrir des rachats.\n[157] Compte tenu qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas une cons\u00e9quence naturelle de la r\u00e8gle ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du Code, la nouvelle r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re de rachat ne pouvait pas \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le principe de l'application non r\u00e9troactive du Code.\n[158] En tirant sa conclusion, la juge Jackson a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Gell, laquelle, selon elle, sur le plan des faits, est semblable \u00e0 l'affaire Anderson. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Gell, la juge Jackson a conclu que Gell ne devrait pas \u00eatre suivie. Selon elle, d\u00e8s que l'intim\u00e9e dans l'affaire Gell eut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'offrir le rachat, elle ne pouvait plus se livrer \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge en s'appuyant sur une r\u00e8gle discriminatoire ant\u00e9rieure et donc se livrer, au moment pr\u00e9sent, \u00e0 des actes de discrimination.\n[159] Il ne fait aucun doute que, dans la d\u00e9cision Anderson, la juge Jackson a refus\u00e9 de suivre la d\u00e9cision Gell. Il ne fait \u00e9galement aucun doute que ce n'\u00e9tait pas parce que la d\u00e9cision Gell \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente sur le plan des faits.\n[160] La seule conclusion \u00e9quitable que l'on peut tirer des motifs de la juge Jackson est que, selon elle, la d\u00e9cision Gell, bien qu'elle eut trait \u00e0 des faits semblables \u00e0 ceux dont elle \u00e9tait saisie, ne devait pas \u00eatre suivie parce que, selon elle, elle \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\n[161] Toutefois, bien que la juge Jackson, en tant que juge de la Cour d'appel de la Saskatchewan, soit libre de ne pas souscrire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Gell de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Tribunal, lui, n'a pas cette libert\u00e9.\n[162] Mme Sugimoto n'a mentionn\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui renverse la d\u00e9cision Gell. Compte tenu de l'absence de diff\u00e9rences fondamentales entre la d\u00e9cision Gell et la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Tribunal est tenu de suivre la d\u00e9cision Gell.\n[163] M\u00eame si le Tribunal \u00e9tait libre d'adopter les motifs dissidents figurant dans la d\u00e9cision Anderson, ceux-ci ne seraient d'aucune utilit\u00e9. D'abord, dans ses motifs, la juge Jackson insiste beaucoup sur le fait que les personnes qui agissent en se fondant sur des pratiques discriminatoires ant\u00e9rieures commettent des agissements qui sont eux-m\u00eame discriminatoire. Un fort argument milite toutefois contre la qualification de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 comme \u00e9tant une nouvelle \u00e9tape. Les faits sont que la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 est une nouvelle interpr\u00e9tation d'une modification qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de retraite en 1974 et cette interpr\u00e9tation aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre offerte \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la modification.\n[164] De plus, compte tenu des d\u00e9clarations de la juge Jackson concernant la similitude sur le plan des faits entre l'affaire Anderson et l'affaire Gell, il ne convient pas que Mme Sugimoto pr\u00e9tende d'une part que la d\u00e9cision Gell est diff\u00e9rente sur le plan des faits et pr\u00e9tende d'autre part que la d\u00e9cision Anderson devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce. Si la d\u00e9cision Gell est diff\u00e9rente sur le plan des faits, alors la d\u00e9cision Anderson l'est \u00e9galement.\n[165] La r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 \u00e9tablit une distinction d\u00e9favorable entre Mme Sugimoto et ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin. La d\u00e9cision Gell nous oblige cependant \u00e0 envisager la distinction sous l'angle de la participation plut\u00f4t que sous l'angle du sexe et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'existe aucun lien entre cet effet pr\u00e9judiciable et un motif de distinction illicite. Mme Sugimoto n'a \u00e9tabli aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nIII. LA D\u00c9CISION [166] J'ai conclu que Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination quant \u00e0 la question de la participation au r\u00e9gime avant 1974 et de distinction illicite en raison du refus de la faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001. J'ai toutefois conclu que la BRC a offert une explication raisonnable quant \u00e0 la preuve prima facie, donc cette all\u00e9gation doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[167] En ce qui concerne l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le caract\u00e8re s\u00e9lectif du RASBS et l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'effet pr\u00e9judiciable de la r\u00e9ouverture de 2001 sur certains employ\u00e9s non-participants, j'ai conclu que Mme Sugimoto n'a \u00e9tabli aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[168] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Sugimoto contre la BRC en vertu de l'article 7 de la LCDP est rejet\u00e9e.\n[169] Dans sa plainte, Mme Sugimoto a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu que la BRC a contrevenu aux articles 10 et 21de la LCDP. Toutefois, elle n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve, ni aucun argument en rapport avec ces pr\u00e9tentions. Je pr\u00e9sume qu'elle les a laiss\u00e9s tomber. Sinon, le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces pr\u00e9tentions n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli et, pour ce motif, elles sont \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9es.\nJ.

Hadjis\nDate : Le 29 octobre 2007\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2007 TCDP 50\n[1] Je voulais examiner toute la preuve et j\u2019ai \u00e9crit ma d\u00e9cision concernant les questions que vous avez soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience ce matin, si vous m\u2019accordez un instant.\n[2] Le 5 septembre 2007, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant le rejet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, principalement au motif que la plaignante, Mme Kuhlmann, ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations de divulgation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa demande aujourd\u2019hui, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audience sur la plainte. En r\u00e9ponse, Mme Kuhlmann a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de produire sa preuve, ind\u00e9pendamment de son omission de la divulguer, ou \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e pour lui permettre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la divulgation de sa preuve.\n[3] Mme Kuhlmann a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 1er ao\u00fbt 2003. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal le 20 juillet 2006. Le 25 avril 2007, la Commission a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019elle ne compara\u00eetrait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur la plainte et qu\u2019elle n\u2019y produirait aucune preuve. Lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas men\u00e9e par le Tribunal le 10 mai 2007, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sente plainte serait entendue du 17 au 21 septembre 2007.\n[4] Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de la date avant laquelle chacune devait avoir divulgu\u00e9 sa preuve, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Une lettre subs\u00e9quente du Tribunal a expos\u00e9 clairement les renseignements que les parties devaient \u00e9changer dans le cadre de la divulgation, ce qui comprenait l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les redressements recherch\u00e9s, les listes de documents ainsi que les listes de t\u00e9moins et le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage, y compris celui des experts. Mme Kuhlmann devait divulguer ces renseignements au plus tard le 21 juin 2007 et l\u2019intim\u00e9, au plus tard le 5 juillet 2007.\n[5] Le 19 juin 2007, Mme Kuhlmann a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique demandant au Tribunal des renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019obtenir et de signifier une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ainsi que sur la fa\u00e7on de demander \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie de divulguer plus de renseignements. Le greffe du Tribunal lui a fourni les renseignements demand\u00e9s dans un courrier \u00e9lectronique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour.\n[6] Le 25 juin 2007, Mme Kuhlmann a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au Tribunal dans lequel elle demandait une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour divulguer ses documents, son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa liste de t\u00e9moins. Elle pr\u00e9tendait avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 retrouver un de ses t\u00e9moins potentiels. Elle y affirmait \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle faisait [Traduction] r\u00e9viser ses documents et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e0 produire de la jurisprudence. Elle ne savait pas comment chercher de la jurisprudence. Elle a donc demand\u00e9 que son d\u00e9lai soit report\u00e9 au 16 juillet 2007. Le Tribunal lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il lui accordait une prorogation de d\u00e9lai, mais seulement jusqu\u2019au 6 juillet 2007.\n[7] Le 10 juillet 2007, le greffe du Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann pour lui signaler que le d\u00e9lai prorog\u00e9 \u00e9tait expir\u00e9 depuis quatre jours et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait toujours pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal les documents qu\u2019elle devait divulguer. Le message lui faisait savoir qu\u2019aucune autre prorogation n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et que la [Traduction] responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019envoyer ces documents au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui incomb[ait] .\n[8] Le 16 juillet 2007, le greffe du Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre, ou plut\u00f4t un courrier \u00e9lectronique, \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann pour lui signaler qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait toujours pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les documents qu\u2019elle devait divulguer. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle r\u00e9ponde et qu\u2019elle soumette ses documents imm\u00e9diatement. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il lui avait affirm\u00e9 lorsque le d\u00e9lai pour la divulgation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prorog\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir que les dates d\u2019audience ne seraient pas chang\u00e9es en raison de la prorogation du d\u00e9lai. La plainte serait quand m\u00eame entendue le 17 septembre 2007.\n[9] Le 17 juillet 2007, Mme Kuhlmann a fait savoir au Tribunal par courrier \u00e9lectronique qu\u2019elle avait communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission [Traduction] pour obtenir des conseils , mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas encore re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse. Elle a joint \u00e0 son courrier \u00e9lectronique la lettre qu\u2019elle avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission, dans laquelle elle se disait d\u00e9\u00e7ue de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[10] Le lendemain, le 18 juillet 2007, le greffe du Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann par courrier \u00e9lectronique pour lui faire valoir que la Commission \u00e9tait une entit\u00e9 distincte du Tribunal et que ce dernier ne pouvait commenter les questions qu\u2019elle avait soulev\u00e9es au sujet de la Commission. Le Tribunal lui a rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait toujours pas divulgu\u00e9 sa preuve et a inclus dans son courrier \u00e9lectronique une copie des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal o\u00f9 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9es les dispositions pertinentes. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que les dates d\u2019audition de la plainte ne seraient pas chang\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de la prorogation du d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019au 6 juillet. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement attir\u00e9 son attention sur le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles, lequel pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une partie qui ne se conforme pas au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles relativement \u00e0 la divulgation ne peut ni soulever de question, ni faire t\u00e9moigner un t\u00e9moin, ni produire une preuve, ni demander de redressement \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[11] Ce matin, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audience et lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 des pr\u00e9sentes questions, Mme Kuhlmann a affirm\u00e9 avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Guy Gr\u00e9goire, le gestionnaire des activit\u00e9s du greffe du Tribunal, le 30 juillet 2007. Elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019avait inform\u00e9e qu\u2019elle devait fournir au Tribunal tous les documents \u00e0 sa disposition \u00e0 ce moment et demander que le Tribunal accepte que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces documents constitue sa divulgation. N\u00e9anmoins, Mme Kuhlmann n\u2019a par la suite fourni aucun document, ni au Tribunal, ni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[12] Le 27 ao\u00fbt 2007, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 des courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 toutes les parties pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de leur disponibilit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la tenue de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique o\u00f9 il serait discut\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Mme Kuhlmann n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ce message. Le 5 septembre 2007, le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann. Personne n\u2019a r\u00e9pondu, alors un message a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 sur son r\u00e9pondeur ou dans sa bo\u00eete vocale, lequel message lui demandait de rappeler. Si j\u2019ai bien compris, Mme Kuhlmann n\u2019a jamais rappel\u00e9 et la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique n\u2019a pas eu lieu. Je soulignerais ici qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de renseignements que je viens tout juste d\u2019obtenir en examinant le dossier du Tribunal. Mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que j\u2019ai compris, un message a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 cette date.\n[13] Le vendredi 14 septembre 2007, \u00e0 14 h 30, soit il y a trois jours, Mme Kuhlmann a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique au Tribunal o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9clarait avoir, \u00e0 son retour de vacances, [Traduction] finalement lu les nombreux courriers \u00e9lectroniques concernant la pr\u00e9sente affaire . Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pu trouver dans les courriers \u00e9lectroniques de renseignements concernant l\u2019heure et le lieu o\u00f9 se tiendrait l\u2019audience et a demand\u00e9 que ces renseignements lui soient communiqu\u00e9s. Le Tribunal lui a envoy\u00e9 ces renseignements dans les cinq minutes suivantes, bien que je constate \u00e0 la lecture du dossier que le Tribunal avait avis\u00e9 toutes les parties du lieu de l\u2019audience par courrier \u00e9lectronique le 10 ao\u00fbt 2007.\n[14] Dans les observations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es aujourd\u2019hui sur les questions en litige, Mme Kuhlmann a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre absent\u00e9e de sa maison \u00e0 plusieurs reprises pendant un certain nombre de semaines en ao\u00fbt et au d\u00e9but de septembre. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ordinateur pendant ce temps et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 ses messages t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Cependant, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019elle ait inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de son absence ou qu\u2019elle ait laiss\u00e9 une adresse o\u00f9 elle pouvait \u00eatre jointe.\n[15] Fait plus important, elle semblait disponible durant le mois de juillet et elle a bel et bien re\u00e7u le courrier que lui a envoy\u00e9 le Tribunal. Elle a elle-m\u00eame communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal en un certain nombre d\u2019occasions. Bien s\u00fbr, il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019elle savait qu\u2019elle devait divulguer sa preuve au plus tard le 6 juillet 2007. Pourtant, malgr\u00e9 les avis r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s du Tribunal selon lesquels elle ne se conformait pas aux directives, elle ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations de divulgation.\n[16] Dans la correspondance du Tribunal avec Mme Kuhlmann, il \u00e9tait explicitement mentionn\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient les cons\u00e9quences de ne pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la divulgation, telles qu\u2019elles sont pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles. Ces cons\u00e9quences sont \u00e9galement expos\u00e9es dans une brochure intitul\u00e9e Comment s\u2019y retrouver? Guide de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal , que le Tribunal envoie \u00e0 toutes les parties et que Mme Kuhlmann reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 la page 18 de ce guide, la paragraphe \u00e0 ce sujet est \u00e9crit en caract\u00e8re gras et est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 dans la marge d\u2019un symbole, une loupe, signifiant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un point \u00e0 ne pas oublier . Le paragraphe en question est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nSi vous omettez de divulguer un document, vous ne serez peut\u2011\u00eatre pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 le pr\u00e9senter en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Par ailleurs, vous ne serez peut\u2011\u00eatre pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 interroger des t\u00e9moins, \u00e0 soulever des questions de droit ou \u00e0 demander des redressements qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans le cadre de la divulgation. Il faut vraiment des circonstances exceptionnelles pour que le Tribunal autorise une partie \u00e0 se fonder sur des preuves non divulgu\u00e9es avant l\u2019audience.\n[17] Le paragraphe aborde ensuite la question de l\u2019obligation permanente de divulguer.\n[18] Mme Kuhlmann arrive aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 l\u2019audience sans avoir divulgu\u00e9 le moindre document et sans s\u2019\u00eatre conform\u00e9e \u00e0 aucune de ses obligations de divulgation. Existe\u2011t\u2011il des circonstances exceptionnelles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui justifieraient de lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter sa cause sans s\u2019\u00eatre acquitt\u00e9e de ses obligations de divulgation? Je n\u2019en vois aucune. Au contraire, comme le souligne l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce dernier se trouve dans [Traduction] une situation tout \u00e0 fait ind\u00e9fendable . Il doit retenir les services d\u2019experts et d\u00e9penser du temps et de l\u2019argent pour bien se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sans savoir ce qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9futer. En fait, il n\u2019a pas pu se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience aujourd\u2019hui. En outre, rien ne prouve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a omis de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Par exemple, compte tenu de l\u2019omission de la plaignante de divulguer sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal l\u2019autorisation d\u2019\u00eatre exempt\u00e9e de divulguer sa preuve \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019il le fasse.\n[19] La seule explication que Mme Kuhlmann semble apporter pour justifier son omission de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations de divulgation est son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante de la Commission relativement aux questions qu\u2019elle lui a pos\u00e9es. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un facteur pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Mme Kuhlmann sait au moins depuis avril 2007 que la Commission ne compara\u00eetra pas. Si elle voulait quand m\u00eame faire entendre sa plainte, il lui incombait de concentrer ses efforts sur la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. Elle ne l\u2019a pas fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois aucune raison de la d\u00e9charger se ses obligations de divulgation. En vertu du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles, et compte tenu de son omission totale de divulguer sa preuve, il est interdit \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann de produire des preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte, de soulever des questions de droit qui en d\u00e9coule, d\u2019assigner des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ou de demander tout redressement.\n[20] Je ne vois pas non plus de raison d\u2019ajourner la pr\u00e9sente affaire pour permettre \u00e0 Mme Kuhlmann de se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation. Elle a eu amplement l\u2019occasion de s\u2019y conformer au cours des deux derniers mois. Il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises qu\u2019elle devait satisfaire \u00e0 ces exigences et elle a choisi de ne pas le faire. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place pour assurer une ex\u00e9cution juste et diligente de la proc\u00e9dure applicable aux audiences devant le Tribunal. On ne peut les n\u00e9gliger ni les mettre cavali\u00e8rement de c\u00f4t\u00e9 simplement parce qu\u2019une partie a choisi de ne pas s\u2019y conformer. Toutes les parties sont tenues de respecter les R\u00e8gles et les directives du Tribunal, qu\u2019elles soient la partie intim\u00e9e ou plaignante.\n[21] J\u2019ajouterais \u00e9galement que, \u00e0 mon sens, il serait injuste pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente affaire soit report\u00e9e, laquelle affaire date d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2003, car elle serait s\u00fbrement report\u00e9e de nombreux mois, ce qui nous am\u00e8nerait probablement \u00e0 un certain moment en 2008.\n[22] La requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement de Mme Kuhlmann est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est interdit \u00e0 la plaignante de produire une preuve ou de soulever des questions devant moi \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, j\u2019estime que sa plainte n\u2019est pas \u00e9tay\u00e9e et elle est donc rejet\u00e9e. Merci. Je ne crois pas avoir autre chose \u00e0 ajouter, alors merci beaucoup.\nJe certifie par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9claration que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est une repr\u00e9sentation conforme et exacte de la d\u00e9cision que j\u2019ai prononc\u00e9e devant les parties le 17 septembre 2007.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Il est \u00e0 noter que, lors de leur t\u00e9moignage, les Dr. Assalian et Karmel ont comment\u00e9 les rapports du Dr. Beltrami mis en preuve.\n[2] La plaignante et la Commission s'opposent \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate au motif notamment que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut diviser sa preuve et que, de toute fa\u00e7on, ce serait conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e un avantage indu qui leur serait pr\u00e9judiciable s'il fallait que le Tribunal fasse droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[3] Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de ses proc\u00e9dures. En vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 instruire une plainte qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Commission. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il peut entendre des t\u00e9moins, tant ordinaires qu'experts. Cela dit, lors de l'audition d'une plainte, le Tribunal doit s'assurer du respect de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale afin d'\u00e9viter qu'une partie soit avantag\u00e9e au d\u00e9triment d'une autre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'administration de la preuve.\n[4] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire entendre les experts de l'intim\u00e9e, soit les Dr. Assalian, Dufour et Karmel avant l'expert de la Commission, le Dr. Beltrami. Le Dr. Assalian a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu tant quant \u00e0 ses rapports que quant aux rapports du Dr. Beltrami avant que le Dr. Beltrami ne t\u00e9moigne. Le Dr. Assalian a pu ainsi commenter les rapports du Dr. Beltrami, sans avoir pu toutefois entendre son t\u00e9moignage. De m\u00eame, le Dr. Karmel a pu commenter les parties du rapport du Dr. Beltrami portant sur le test MMPI-2, sans avoir pu entendre t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier.\n[5] Le Dr. Beltrami a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans la semaine du 22 octobre 2007. Dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage, qui a dur\u00e9 cinq jours, le Dr. Beltrami a comment\u00e9 ses rapports et a pu \u00e9galement commenter certains propos tenus par le Dr. Assalian lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Il a \u00e9galement fait allusion au rapport du Dr. Karmel. En outre, le Dr. Beltrami a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 nuancer certaines affirmations contenues dans son rapport.\n[6] En d'autres circonstances, le Dr. Beltrami aurait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avant le Dr. Assalian et le Dr. Karmel. Il aurait alors pu t\u00e9moigner en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses rapports, ainsi que commenter les rapports des Dr. Assalian et Karmel. Dans ce cas de figure, le Dr. Assalian et le Dr. Karmel n'ayant pas encore t\u00e9moign\u00e9, le Dr. Beltrami n'aurait pu commenter leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[7] Cela dit, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 des questions d'ordre m\u00e9dical que soul\u00e8ve le pr\u00e9sent dossier, il est plus que probable que la Commission aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le Dr. Beltrami soit r\u00e9entendu, une fois le t\u00e9moignage des experts de l'intim\u00e9e rendu, afin de pouvoir commenter leur t\u00e9moignage, demande qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieusement par le Tribunal compte tenu de la complexit\u00e9 des questions que soul\u00e8ve le pr\u00e9sent dossier et de l'importance pour le Tribunal de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'information la plus compl\u00e8te possible sur les questions d'ordre m\u00e9dical qu'il soul\u00e8ve.\n[8] Ce qui est en cause ici, c'est la r\u00e9audition de deux experts de l'intim\u00e9e qui n'ont pas eu l'occasion de commenter le t\u00e9moignage du m\u00e9decin expert de la Commission et non de deux t\u00e9moins ordinaires de l'intim\u00e9e pour que ceux-ci compl\u00e8tent leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[9] La r\u00e9audition d'un expert sur un \u00e9l\u00e9ment ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments particuliers ne peut se comparer \u00e0 la r\u00e9audition d'un t\u00e9moin de fait qui serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 venir ajouter \u00e0 sa version des faits apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les t\u00e9moins d'une autre partie et ainsi nuancer son t\u00e9moignage.\n[10] La r\u00e9audition des Dr. Assalian et Karmel, reconnus comme t\u00e9moins experts, vise \u00e0 procurer au Tribunal la compr\u00e9hension la plus compl\u00e8te possible des \u00e9l\u00e9ments m\u00e9dicaux qui sont en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. L'administration de la justice serait mal servie si le Tribunal devait se priver des commentaires de ces deux t\u00e9moins experts en ce qui concerne le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami.\n[11] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il importe que le Tribunal puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des connaissances des experts des parties afin d'\u00eatre en mesure de comprendre totalement les aspects m\u00e9dicaux particuliers au cur du pr\u00e9sent litige en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dysphorie du genre, aux troubles de l'identit\u00e9 sexuelle, au transsexualisme et au transgend\u00e9risme. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il importe que le Tribunal ait le point de vue des experts de l'intim\u00e9e quant au t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami sur ces questions et sur son \u00e9valuation de la plaignante, d'autant plus que, dans le cadre de son t\u00e9moignage, le Dr. Beltrami a nuanc\u00e9 certaines parties de ses rapports.\n[12] Le Tribunal se doit de rappeler aux parties que les experts qu'ils font t\u00e9moigner ont pour mission d'\u00e9clairer le Tribunal sur des points particuliers qui ne sont pas de connaissance judiciaire. En principe, ils ne sont pas l\u00e0 pour soutenir la th\u00e8se mise de l'avant par la partie qui les produit, mais pour fournir au Tribunal des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'information qui vont permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de trancher de fa\u00e7on \u00e9clair\u00e9e les questions qui lui sont soumises pour adjudication.\n[13] Pour qu'un expert que l'on veut faire r\u00e9entendre puisse \u00e9clairer pleinement le Tribunal sur les questions d'ordre technique ou scientifique au cur d'un litige, il faut que l'expert qu'une partie veut faire r\u00e9entendre pour une fin particuli\u00e8re ait entendu ou soit au fait du t\u00e9moignage du t\u00e9moin qu'il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 commenter.\n[14] Il appert des propos tenus \u00e0 l'audience du 26 octobre 2007 par le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e que le Dr. Assalian, bien qu'il n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent lors du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami dans la semaine du 22 octobre 2007, a n\u00e9anmoins re\u00e7u la transcription st\u00e9nographique du t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier. Le Dr. Assalian serait donc au fait du t\u00e9moignage rendu par le Dr. Beltrami dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[15] En ce qui a trait au Dr. Karmel, le Tribunal a pu noter que, lors de l'interrogatoire du Dr. Beltrami par la procureure de la Commission, le Dr. Karmel \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent dans la salle d'audience, soit les 22, 23 et 24 octobre 2007. En outre, le Dr. Karmel a pu, durant ces trois jours, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des services d'interpr\u00e8tes afin de faciliter sa compr\u00e9hension du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami, ce dernier ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais. Le Dr. Karmel n'\u00e9tait toutefois pas pr\u00e9sent lors du contre-interrogatoire du Dr. Beltrami, les 25 et 26 octobre 2007.\n[16] Compte tenu de la complexit\u00e9 des questions de nature m\u00e9dicale soumises au Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, le Tribunal est d'avis qu'il importe, pour que toute la lumi\u00e8re soit faite sur les questions m\u00e9dicales que le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher, que les Dr. Assalian et Karmel soient r\u00e9entendus \u00e0 la seule fin de commenter le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami.\n[17] Le Tribunal autorise donc que le Dr. Assalian, psychiatre, soit rappel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin expert pour la seule fin de commenter le t\u00e9moignage rendu par le Dr. Beltrami lors des audiences tenues dans la semaine du 22 octobre 2007 dans la mesure o\u00f9 il pourra attester qu'il a lu la transcription du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami et que son t\u00e9moignage ne porte que sur le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier.\n[18] Le Tribunal autorise \u00e9galement la r\u00e9audition du Dr. Karmel, psychologue, pour la seule fin de commenter le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami en ce qui concerne l'administration et l'interpr\u00e9tation du test MMPI-2 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par la plaignante. Le Dr. Karmel, qui n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent lors des journ\u00e9es d'audition des 25 et 26 octobre 2007 ne pourra, d'aucune fa\u00e7on, commenter le t\u00e9moignage rendu par le Dr. Beltrami durant ces deux jours.\n[19] Le Tribunal est d'avis qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucun pr\u00e9judice ne sera caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission ou \u00e0 la plaignante. La Commission est l\u00e0, comme l'a souvent rappel\u00e9 la procureure de la Commission, pour repr\u00e9senter l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public. En principe, la Commission n'a pas int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal soit, dans une instance comme celle-ci, priv\u00e9 de l'\u00e9clairage que peuvent apporter les experts reconnus comme tels par le Tribunal, quelle que soit la partie qui les a fait entendre.\n[20] Le Tribunal autorise donc la r\u00e9audition des Dr. Assalian et Karmel pour la seule fin de commenter, en tant qu'expert, le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami, dans leurs sph\u00e8res d'expertise respectives. La r\u00e9audition de ces deux t\u00e9moins aura lieu le 5 novembre 2007 \u00e0 compter de 9.30 heures. La Commission et la plaignante pourront contre-interroger, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les Dr. Assalian et Karmel.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 29 octobre 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Micheline Montreuil c.

Hadjis\nDate : Le 1er novembre 2007\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2007 TCDP 52\n[1] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant la modification de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte que sous le nom Drumsaremybeat et cette d\u00e9signation est, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, rest\u00e9e la m\u00eame dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause. La Commission demande que les noms de deux personnes, Heather Fleming et Ronald Fleming, soient substitu\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9signation.\n[2] La Commission a aussi demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une directive afin que l\u2019identit\u00e9 du plaignant ne soit pas divulgu\u00e9e publiquement, m\u00eame \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[3] L\u2019audition des deux requ\u00eates devant le Tribunal a eu lieu par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence le 1er octobre 2007. L\u2019avocat de la Commission et le plaignant ont comparus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais personne n\u2019a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 Drumsaremybeat et aucune observation \u00e9crite n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en son nom.\n[4] Le Tribunal avait envoy\u00e9 un avis \u00e0 M. et Mme Fleming les informant du fait qu\u2019ils pouvaient participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience en se pr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 une installation de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Edmonton, qui se trouve pr\u00e8s de leur r\u00e9sidence. Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ne se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, qui a dur\u00e9 quatre heures en tout. Le Tribunal n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune communication de leur part expliquant pourquoi ils ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. De plus, ils n\u2019ont soumis aucune observation \u00e9crite en r\u00e9ponse aux requ\u00eates de la Commission.\n[5] Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les seules parties \u00e0 produire des preuves et des observations au Tribunal au sujet des requ\u00eates.\nLa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause [6] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa plainte que, de d\u00e9cembre 2004 jusqu\u2019en mars 2005, il a vu un certain nombre de messages sur un bulletin \u00e9lectronique g\u00e9r\u00e9 par AOL Canada (AOL) qui, \u00e0 son avis, constituent de la propagande haineuse au sens de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par quelqu\u2019un qui utilisait Drumsaremybeat comme nom d\u2019utilisateur ou comme pseudonyme sur AOL.\n[7] Le plaignant ne connaissait pas la v\u00e9ritable identit\u00e9 de la personne qui affichait ces messages lorsqu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte le 15 juillet 2005. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 seulement sous le nom de Drumsaremybeat . Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006, AOL a avis\u00e9 la Commission que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses dossiers, le client d\u2019AOL qui utilisait Drumsaremybeat comme nom d\u2019utilisateur en 2005 \u00e9tait Heather Fleming. AOL a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission une fiche de renseignements au sujet de Mme Fleming, qui comprenait son adresse postale.\n[8] \u00c0 partir de ce moment, la Commission a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter l\u2019affaire en supposant que Mme Fleming \u00e9tait l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 6 mars 2006, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission charg\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Fleming dans laquelle il l\u2019avisait que la Commission avait re\u00e7u une plainte de beachesboy@aol.com, qui soutenait que [Traduction] drumsaremybeat a affich\u00e9 des messages sur un babillard \u00e9lectronique d\u2019AOL qui avaient un effet discriminatoire, fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019orientation sexuelle, envers le plaignant et d\u2019autres personnes. La lettre expliquait ensuite :\n[Traduction]\nJ\u2019aimerais donc recevoir, d\u2019ici le 27 mars 2006, votre point de vue au sujet des all\u00e9gations, notamment en r\u00e9ponse aux questions suivantes :\n(1) \u00cates-vous drumsaremybeat?\n(2) Avez-vous affich\u00e9 les messages mentionn\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte? Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quel \u00e9tait le but de l\u2019affichage de ces messages?\n(3) Quelle \u00e9tait l\u2019intention derri\u00e8re l\u2019affichage des renseignements ou des documents sur les sites Web?\n(4) Qui est votre fournisseur d\u2019acc\u00e8s Internet (FAI) actuel? O\u00f9 est-il situ\u00e9? Veuillez pr\u00e9senter une copie de l\u2019entente avec votre FAI.\nSi quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre vous repr\u00e9sentera en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, veuillez nous en aviser le plus t\u00f4t possible. Veuillez aussi noter qu\u2019on vous demande de conserver tout mat\u00e9riel li\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte, y compris des renseignements en format \u00e9lectronique, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[9] La Commission a re\u00e7u une lettre en r\u00e9ponse, dat\u00e9e du 15 mars 2006. Bien que la lettre semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par H. Fleming , son contenu donne \u00e0 penser que quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre l\u2019a \u00e9crite. Par exemple, dans le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe, l\u2019auteur a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 ma femme parce que le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone que j\u2019utilisais avec le FAI AOL, au moment o\u00f9 les messages offensants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s, \u00e9tait \u00e0 son nom. L\u2019auteur a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la propagande haineuse all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9e, son ordinateur \u00e9tait [Traduction] contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par un pirate informatique sans qu\u2019il ait donn\u00e9 son consentement. Il a ajout\u00e9 que personne [Traduction] \u00e0 cette adresse ne r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ce nom d\u2019utilisateur (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire Drumsaremybeat).\n[10] Au d\u00e9but juillet 2006, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate au sujet de la plainte. Sur la page couverture du rapport, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a inscrit [Traduction] Heather Fleming (alias Drumsaremybeat) comme intim\u00e9e. Le rapport indique que Mme Fleming a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la d\u00e9tentrice inscrite du compte AOL li\u00e9 au nom d\u2019utilisateur Drumsaremybeat, mais que c\u2019\u00e9tait en fait son conjoint qui utilisait le compte. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019y connaissait pas en fait d\u2019utilisation d\u2019ordinateurs et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait affich\u00e9 aucun message sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques d\u2019AOL. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la [Traduction] d\u00e9fense \u00e9crite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission par Drumsaremybeat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par M. Fleming. Le rapport expose cette [Traduction] d\u00e9fense , y compris l\u2019argument de M. Fleming selon lequel un [Traduction] pirate informatique avait utilis\u00e9 leur compte AOL et avait affich\u00e9 les messages en cause sous le nom d\u2019utilisateur Drumsaremybeat.\n[11] Le 10 juillet 2006, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Fleming dans laquelle elle l\u2019avisait que :\n[Traduction]\nL\u2019enqu\u00eate au sujet de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre vous est termin\u00e9e. Vous trouverez, pour votre r\u00e9vision, une copie du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate en annexe.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[12] La Commission a aussi envoy\u00e9 une copie du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate au plaignant, qui a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019envoyer une r\u00e9plique \u00e9crite. Le 27 juillet 2006, la Commission a fait parvenir cette r\u00e9plique \u00e0 Mme Fleming et a mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre d\u2019accompagnement que les observations du plaignant portaient sur la plainte [Traduction] pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Beachesboy contre vous .\n[13] En octobre 2006, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Fleming l\u2019avisant que la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte de [Traduction] Beachesboy@aol.com c. Drumsaremybeat au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[14] La Commission a re\u00e7u par la suite une lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 octobre 2006 qui portait cens\u00e9ment les signatures de Ronald Fleming et de H. Fleming . La lettre se termine par la d\u00e9claration suivante, \u00e9crite \u00e0 la machine :\n[Traduction]\nPitoyablement v\u00f4tre et en col\u00e8re\nRonald L. Fleming\nCitoyen canadien\nLa lettre r\u00e9p\u00e9tait l\u2019argument selon lequel Mme Fleming n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable du compte d\u2019utilisateur AOL en question, et ajoutait :\n[Traduction]\n\u00c0 partir de maintenant, si vous voulez communiquer avec la personne qui est suppos\u00e9ment responsable de cette accusation bidon en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, vous enverrez les enveloppes et tous les autres renseignements \u00e0 moi et seulement \u00e0 moi!\nM. Ronald Fleming, \u00e0 ladite adresse.\n[15] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission soutient que les renseignements qu\u2019AOL lui a fournis, que M. et Mme Fleming ont eux m\u00eame confirm\u00e9s, attestaient qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient responsables du compte d\u2019utilisateur AOL auquel le nom d\u2019utilisateur Drumsaremybeat \u00e9tait associ\u00e9.\n[16] La Commission soutient qu\u2019au d\u00e9but, la plainte ne nommait pas le membre d\u2019AOL qui utilisait le nom d\u2019utilisateur Drumsaremybeat puisque l\u2019identit\u00e9 du membre \u00e9tait alors inconnue. Je note cependant qu\u2019au 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006, la Commission avait appris le nom du membre d\u2019AOL (Mme Fleming) et qu\u2019il y avait une conclusion dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de juillet 2006 selon laquelle M. Fleming utilisait le compte AOL.\n[17] Cependant, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait ces renseignements, la Commission n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la plainte et a choisi de la renvoyer au Tribunal telle qu\u2019elle existait. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal que la Commission a demand\u00e9 la permission de modifier l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause. Il s\u2019agissait, selon la Commission, d\u2019un [Traduction] simple d\u00e9tail technique .\n[18] Je ne suis pas du m\u00eame avis. La modification de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un simple d\u00e9tail technique. Une telle action peut avoir d\u2019importantes cons\u00e9quences. Une personne qui jusqu\u2019alors ne faisait pas partie de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pourrait soudainement se trouver m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire qui aurait une incidence consid\u00e9rable sur elle. Elle aura \u00e0 consacrer du temps et des ressources pour r\u00e9futer la plainte. Si l\u2019on prouve le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte, des ordonnances de redressement peuvent \u00eatre prononc\u00e9es contre cette personne. Ce type de modification ne peut donc pas \u00eatre pris \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\n[19] Lorsque les circonstances le justifient, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019ajouter des parties \u00e0 une plainte, proc\u00e9dure qui est d\u00e9crite en d\u00e9tail \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi et au paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 30 (Telus), le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 une fois que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d\u2019instruire une plainte est appropri\u00e9e s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte et qu\u2019il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte .\n[20] Il convient d\u2019examiner attentivement cette derni\u00e8re condition en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. N\u2019\u00e9tait-il pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, depuis au moins f\u00e9vrier 2006, que Mme Fleming soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e? N\u2019\u00e9tait-il pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la Commission a publi\u00e9 son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, que M. Fleming soit aussi d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9?\n[21] \u00c0 mon avis, la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 se rapporte principalement \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il y ait pr\u00e9judice envers le nouvel intim\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il serait priv\u00e9 des avantages dont jouit habituellement la partie intim\u00e9e au cours du processus d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission, qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de le renvoi d\u2019une plainte au Tribunal (voir Brown c. Commission de la capitale nationale, 2003 TCDP 43, au paragraphe 46). Ces avantages comprennent la possibilit\u00e9 que la Commission d\u00e9cide de ne pas statuer sur la plainte (article 41 de la Loi), de la rejeter (alin\u00e9a 44(3)b)) ou de la renvoyer \u00e0 un conciliateur (article 47) (voir, \u00e0 ce sujet, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal rendue verbalement dans l\u2019affaire Desormeaux, cit\u00e9e dans Telus, aux paragraphes 25 \u00e0 27). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Parent c. Canada, 2006 CF 1313, aux paragraphes 40 et 41, que la question du pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 est le facteur pr\u00e9dominant dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte lorsqu\u2019il rend une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la modification d\u2019une plainte. Il convient cependant de mentionner que la d\u00e9cision Parent portait sur l\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gations factuelles \u00e0 une plainte, et non sur l\u2019adjonction de nouvelles parties.\n[22] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. et Mme Fleming ne seraient pas priv\u00e9s des avantages dont ils auraient joui s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9s d\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La Commission les a trait\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s longtemps avant que la plainte ne soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Les lettres envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Fleming soulignaient constamment qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e ([Traduction]vous ) dans la plainte. Qui plus est, tant Mme Fleming que M. Fleming ont r\u00e9pondu aux all\u00e9gations qui pesaient contre eux. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations \u00e0 la Commission avant que la plainte soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. En effet, leurs arguments de d\u00e9fense ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission. Ils ont non seulement eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, mais ils se sont en effet pr\u00e9valus de leur droit de le faire.\n[23] Je conclus aussi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait au deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Telus. La pr\u00e9sence de M. et Mme Fleming est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte, ne serait-ce que parce qu\u2019un nom d\u2019utilisateur sur Internet ne peut pas vraiment \u00eatre reconnu comme une personne capable de participer \u00e0 une audience et d\u2019\u00eatre tenue de se conformer \u00e0 toute ordonnance d\u00e9finitive. Sans leur pr\u00e9sence, il n\u2019y aurait en effet aucun intim\u00e9 dans la plainte et par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019aurait aucun litige \u00e0 trancher. Si, comme la Commission le soutient, le compte AOL associ\u00e9 au nom d\u2019utilisateur Drumsaremybeat appartenait bien \u00e0 M. et Mme Fleming, ils peuvent \u00eatre tenus responsables.\n[24] Compte tenu des circonstances, je conclus qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et permette la modification que la Commission a demand\u00e9e et qu\u2019il ajoute effectivement deux intim\u00e9s et en retire un. Par cons\u00e9quent, il convient peut-\u00eatre mieux de traiter la requ\u00eate de la Commission comme \u00e9tant une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 ajouter des parties plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier la plainte. Il est malheureux que les parties n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte avant qu\u2019elle soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, cela aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[25] J\u2019ordonne par cons\u00e9quent l\u2019adjonction de Ronald Fleming et de Heather Fleming \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en remplacement de Drumsaremybeat . J\u2019ordonne aussi la modification de l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause pour que M. et Mme Fleming y apparaissent comme seuls intim\u00e9s.\nLa requ\u00eate au sujet de la divulgation de l\u2019identit\u00e9 du plaignant\n[26] Sur la formule de plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 15 juillet 2005, le plaignant n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 son vrai nom. Il a plut\u00f4t sign\u00e9 le document en utilisant beachesboy@aol.com et a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9 son nom et ses coordonn\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Commission et que ces renseignements [Traduction] n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s au public pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 . Dans ses traitements subs\u00e9quents de la plainte, la Commission a respect\u00e9 cette demande et n\u2019a jamais divulgu\u00e9 le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es du plaignant \u00e0 M. et Mme Fleming.\n[27] Lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, la Commission a divulgu\u00e9 le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es du plaignant au Tribunal. Cependant, la Commission a aussi demand\u00e9 que ces renseignements ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s au public pour des raisons de [Traduction] s\u00e9curit\u00e9 . Le Tribunal n\u2019a donc jamais divulgu\u00e9 le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es du plaignant \u00e0 qui que ce soit.\n[28] Il convient de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que personne ne s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour contester la requ\u00eate de la Commission visant \u00e0 obtenir une directive du Tribunal pour que cette pratique soit maintenue de fa\u00e7on permanente.\n[29] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette requ\u00eate, la Commission a soulign\u00e9 certains des messages mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte. Ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s par une personne utilisant le pseudonyme Drumsaremybeat sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique d\u2019AOL. Ces messages, s\u2019ils sont authentiques, semblent comprendre l\u2019expression d\u2019agressivit\u00e9 et de violence envers les homosexuels en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et envers beachesboy@aol.com en particulier. Le plaignant n\u2019est pas nomm\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son identit\u00e9 sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique et a seulement particip\u00e9 en utilisant son nom d\u2019utilisateur. On utilise dans les messages un langage plut\u00f4t vulgaire pour illustrer la souffrance et la violence que l\u2019auteur souhaite infliger \u00e0 beachesboy@aol.com et \u00e0 tous les homosexuels. L\u2019auteur des messages se plaint du fait que la peine de mort n\u2019existe [Traduction] plus pour les homosexuels au Canada et il ou elle raconte fi\u00e8rement un incident lors duquel un de ses amis a frapp\u00e9 un homosexuel dans une rue \u00e0 Edmonton.\n[30] Cependant, tous ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s vers la fin 2004 ou au d\u00e9but 2005. On ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9claration ult\u00e9rieure de la m\u00eame nature. De plus, ces messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9s sur le babillard \u00e9lectronique d\u2019AOL par une personne qui utilisait un pseudonyme (Drumsaremybeat) et, pour le moment, on a simplement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les personnes responsables de l\u2019affichage des messages \u00e9taient M. et\/ou Mme Fleming. Cela n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9. Depuis la pr\u00e9sentation de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, M. et Mme Fleming ont envoy\u00e9 un certain nombre de lettres au plaignant, \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal. J\u2019en ai mentionn\u00e9 quelques-unes plus t\u00f4t. Bien que ces lettres expriment de la col\u00e8re au sujet des accusations cens\u00e9ment injustifi\u00e9es de la plainte, elles ne contiennent aucune menace ou expression de violence.\n[31] Le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 plusieurs autres plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 13 au sujet d\u2019autres personnes. Certaines de ces plaintes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019au moins une fois auparavant, il avait re\u00e7u un certain nombre de menaces \u00e0 la maison lorsque les m\u00e9dias avaient r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 certaines de ses d\u00e9clarations condamnant des actes de discrimination.\n[32] \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu du langage violent utilis\u00e9 dans les messages mentionn\u00e9s, dont certains visaient le plaignant, et compte tenu des inqui\u00e9tudes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du plaignant au sujet de la divulgation au public de son identit\u00e9, en plus du fait que la requ\u00eate de la Commission n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e, je ne vois aucune raison de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 l\u2019approche qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019on en sera \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire, il pourrait \u00eatre difficile de maintenir cette approche. Par exemple, comment le plaignant pourra-t-il t\u00e9moigner s\u2019il ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas son vrai nom lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00eatera serment ou fera une affirmation solennelle? S\u2019il est conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e et si le plaignant demande un redressement personnel que le Tribunal croit justifi\u00e9, le Tribunal pourrait avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger une ordonnance en faveur d\u2019une victime non identifi\u00e9e.\n[33] En gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ces pr\u00e9occupations, j\u2019ordonne tout de m\u00eame que l\u2019approche utilis\u00e9e par le greffe du Tribunal \u00e0 ce jour soit maintenue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audition de la plainte (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le plaignant sera d\u00e9sign\u00e9 publiquement comme \u00e9tant beachesboy@aol.com et que ses coordonn\u00e9es ne seront divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 personne, y compris les intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce). Le membre charg\u00e9 du traitement de la plainte pourra ensuite examiner la question.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Conclusion\nI. Introduction [1] Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2004, Micheline Montreuil a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R. (1985), ch. H-6 (la LCDP) contre le Comit\u00e9 des griefs des Forces canadiennes (le Comit\u00e9). La plaignante all\u00e8gue que le Comit\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (transgenre) et l\u2019origine ethnique (langue) contrairement aux articles 3 et 7 de la Loi.\n[2] Lors d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 7 avril 2006, avec le gestionnaire de cas charg\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le vice-pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, M. Athanasios D. Hadjis, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 que la plainte ne porterait que sur la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et qu\u2019elle ne poursuivrait pas sa plainte de discrimination sur l\u2019origine ethnique. Selon le compte rendu de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir une lettre au Tribunal confirmant cet engagement. Cette lettre ne fut jamais fournie.\n[3] Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins que la plaignante, qui est \u00e9galement avocate, a donn\u00e9 son engagement. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire qu\u2019elle voudrait aujourd\u2019hui revenir sur celui-ci. D\u2019ailleurs, tout au long de l\u2019audience elle a tenu \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que l\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur la langue ne servait qu\u2019\u00e0 appuyer sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Elle all\u00e8gue, en effet, que le motif linguistique n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte pour ne pas lui attribuer le poste convoit\u00e9 en raison de son sexe . Dans ces circonstances, la pr\u00e9sente affaire traitera uniquement de la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Toutefois, l\u2019argumentation de la plaignante fait en sorte que je n\u2019aurai d\u2019autres choix que d\u2019aborder dans mon raisonnement la dimension linguistique de son argumentaire.\nA. Les parties (i) La plaignante [4] Micheline Montreuil est avocate de formation. Elle d\u00e9tient, en plus de sa licence en droit, des dipl\u00f4mes universitaires en relations industrielles et en administration. Elle vient \u00e9galement d\u2019obtenir un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation et poursuit des \u00e9tudes de ma\u00eetrises en \u00e9thique. Elle est inscrite au barreau du Qu\u00e9bec depuis 1976. Depuis son admission au barreau, elle a pratiqu\u00e9 le droit et a \u00e9galement enseign\u00e9 dans deux coll\u00e8ges \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, soit les coll\u00e8ges de Limoilou et de Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau. Elle a \u00e9galement offert des cours \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval, et aux universit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi et \u00e0 Rimouski.\n[5] Lorsqu\u2019elle parle de discrimination bas\u00e9e sur le sexe, Me Montreuil fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 certaines caract\u00e9ristiques reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de genre ou \u00e0 l\u2019apparence qui font en sorte qu\u2019elle ne se trouve pas, selon ses propres mots, dans une situation qu\u2019on pourrait qualifier d\u2019usuelle. Entre ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit \u00eatre un homme ou une femme normal , se situe la mouvance transsexuelle ou transgenre. \u00c0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de cette mouvance, elle identifie trois grands groupes. Les travestis, qui sont des individus qui s\u2019habillent compl\u00e8tement ou partiellement avec des accessoires ou du linge de l\u2019autre sexe. Toutefois, elle pr\u00e9cise que ce choix ne sera que temporaire et le travesti apr\u00e8s un certain temps reviendra aux habits de son sexe. \u00c0 l\u2019autre bout de la mouvance, se trouve le groupe des transsexuels. Le choix des individus dans ce groupe est, par la voie d\u2019op\u00e9rations chirurgicales, de changer compl\u00e8tement de sexe. Entre les travestis et les transsexuels, Me Montreuil identifie les transgenres, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des personnes qui, comme elle, ont choisi de vivre la totalit\u00e9 du temps dans les v\u00eatements de l\u2019autre sexe. Les personnes de ce groupe peuvent \u00e9galement opter pour certaines op\u00e9rations chirurgicales mineures pour changer certaines parties de leur apparence, mais elles n\u2019iront pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une transformation chirurgicale compl\u00e8te.\n[6] D\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, l\u2019avocat du Comit\u00e9 a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que la condition particuli\u00e8re de Me Montreuil n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un objet en litige et qu\u2019elle pouvait donc all\u00e9guer avoir subi, en raison de cette condition particuli\u00e8re une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi.\n[7] Au moment de l\u2019audience, Me Montreuil travaillait comme charg\u00e9e de cours, \u00e0 temps partiel, au baccalaur\u00e9at en sciences infirmi\u00e8res de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, o\u00f9 elle offre un cours d\u2019\u00e9thique et de responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Elle travaillait \u00e9galement comme agente de recherche en droit au Conseil de la justice administrative du Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Son emploi au Conseil de la justice administrative devait se terminer le 27 avril 2007. Elle ajoute \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle pratique toujours le droit.\n(ii) Le Comit\u00e9 des griefs des forces canadiennes [8] Le Comit\u00e9 des griefs des forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes compte, en ce moment, environ une cinquantaine d\u2019employ\u00e9s. Il compte \u00e9galement six membres dont la pr\u00e9sidente et le vice-pr\u00e9sident qui sont tous les deux \u00e0 temps plein. Les quatre autres membres sont \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[9] Le Comit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans la foul\u00e9e d\u2019une r\u00e9forme de la justice militaire initi\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t, en 1995, du rapport Doshen (A Report on the Study of Mechanisms of Voice\/Complaint Resolution in the Canadian Armed Forces) qui portait sur la r\u00e9solution des griefs au sein des forces arm\u00e9es. En 1997, deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont venus conforter cette id\u00e9e de r\u00e9forme. Il y a eu tout d\u2019abord le d\u00e9p\u00f4t par le ministre de la D\u00e9fense d\u2019un rapport sur le leadership et l\u2019administration des Forces canadiennes (Rapport au premier ministre sur le leadership et l\u2019administration dans les Forces canadiennes) et, ensuite, la publication des conclusions de la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la Somalie qui r\u00e9it\u00e9rait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de modifier le syst\u00e8me de justice militaire.\n[10] Pour donner suite \u00e0 ces diff\u00e9rents rapports, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait lieu de modifier la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale afin de moderniser et renforcer le syst\u00e8me de justice militaire incluant la simplification du syst\u00e8me de processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs dans les Forces canadiennes. Le Comit\u00e9, un tribunal administratif autonome, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 1er mars 2002.\n[11] Le Comit\u00e9 des griefs est charg\u00e9, en conformit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, d\u2019examiner les griefs militaires d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les membres des forces canadiennes. Il examine notamment les griefs qui lui sont transmis par le chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-major de la d\u00e9fense. Pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis, le chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-major envoie au Comit\u00e9 les griefs reli\u00e9s aux \u2026mesures administratives qui \u00e9manent de la suppression ou des d\u00e9ductions de solde et d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, du retour \u00e0 un grade inf\u00e9rieur ou de la lib\u00e9ration des Forces canadiennes d\u2019un militaire, que ce soit pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou de comportement. Le Comit\u00e9 examine \u00e9galement des griefs sur l\u2019application et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des politiques des Forces canadiennes qui concernent l\u2019expression d\u2019opinions personnelles, [\u2026] les conflits d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats et les mesures r\u00e9gissant l\u2019apr\u00e8s mandat, le harc\u00e8lement ou la conduite raciste. (Voir \u2013 Chapitre 7.12 des Ordonnances et r\u00e8glements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes.)\n[12] \u00c0 l\u2019issue des examens de ces griefs, le Comit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente des recommandations impartiales et \u00e9quitables au chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-major et au plaignant.\n[13] Afin de l\u2019assister dans la r\u00e9alisation de son mandat, le Comit\u00e9 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des postes d\u2019agent de griefs. Les t\u00e2ches principales d\u2019un agent de griefs sont d\u2019analyser les dossiers, d\u2019enqu\u00eater et de prendre part \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction des constations et des recommandations du Comit\u00e9 au chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-major de la D\u00e9fense. L\u2019agent de griefs agit \u00e9galement comme sp\u00e9cialiste aupr\u00e8s du personnel et des membres du Comit\u00e9.\nB. Cadre juridique [14] L\u2019article 7 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que de refuser d\u2019employer un individu par des moyens directs ou indirects pour des raisons fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite dont notamment, le sexe ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, constitue un acte discriminatoire. (Voir \u00e9galement les articles 3 et 15 de la LCDP).\n[15] Le fardeau de preuve, dans une affaire comme la pr\u00e9sente, incombe tout d\u2019abord au plaignant qui doit \u00e9tablir un cas prima facie de discrimination. (Voir : Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, 1618; Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029; et, Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04).\n[16] Un cas prima facie est celui qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui sont faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, sont compl\u00e8tes et suffisantes pour justifier un verdict favorable au plaignant, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. (Ontario (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne) c. Etobicoke (Municipalit\u00e9), [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208; Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears Lt\u00e9e, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au par. 28.).\n[17] La question est donc de savoir s\u2019il y a une preuve qui est susceptible d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous n\u2019aurons pas \u00e0 nous attarder sur la question \u00e0 savoir si Me Montreuil poss\u00e8de le ou les traits distinctifs d\u2019un groupe contre lequel il est interdit en vertu de la LCDP d\u2019exercer une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas et admet qu\u2019une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le fait d\u2019\u00eatre une personne transgenre est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[18] Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, un cas prima facie est d\u00e9crit comme exigeant une preuve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui suivent :\nle plaignant avait les qualifications pour l\u2019emploi en cause; le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n\u2019avait pas le trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste. (Voir : Shakes c. Rex Pak Lt\u00e9e (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001, au paragraphe 8918)\n[19] Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin de l\u2019ajuster \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019est pas embauch\u00e9 et o\u00f9 la partie intim\u00e9e continue de chercher un candidat appropri\u00e9. Dans ce cas, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un cas prima facie exige la pr\u00e9sence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\ne) que le plaignant appartienne \u00e0 l\u2019un des groupes qui sont sujets \u00e0 la discrimination en vertu de la Loi;\nf) que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9sirait combler;\ng) que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9;\nh) que, par la suite, l\u2019employeur a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats poss\u00e9dant les qualifications du plaignant.\ni) (Voir : Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, \u00e0 la page 1618.)\n[20] Dans la d\u00e9cision Montreuil c. Banque Nationale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 7, au par. 44, le Tribunal s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur les diff\u00e9rences entre ces deux approches. Il a conclu que l\u2019approche dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Shakes s\u2019applique aux cas o\u00f9 un plaignant rivalise avec d\u2019autres candidats pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un poste particulier. Le Tribunal ajoute qu\u2019il ne semble pas qu\u2019elle puisse s\u2019appliquer aux situations permanentes de recrutement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que peu importe si les personnes embauch\u00e9es \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9sentent pas le trait distinctif du plaignant, il existe d\u2019autres postes \u00e0 pourvoir, pour lesquels le plaignant pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement embauch\u00e9. En revanche, il explique que l\u2019approche Israeli, compte tenu de son quatri\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, s\u2019applique aux situations o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur continue de chercher des candidats.\n[21] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la preuve n\u2019est pas aussi claire qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait dans l\u2019affaire Montreuil c. Banque Nationale. Me Montreuil a postul\u00e9 pour un poste particulier. Or, nous pourrions ainsi \u00eatre port\u00e9s \u00e0 conclure que l\u2019approche dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Shakes devrait \u00eatre retenue. Cependant l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondra qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas rejet\u00e9 la candidature puisque qu\u2019il a maintenu la plaignante sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 pour un poste d\u2019agent de griefs unilingue francophone pour une p\u00e9riode allant bien au-del\u00e0 de celle \u00e9tablie pour combler le poste pour lequel, Me Montreuil avait postul\u00e9. D\u2019autre part, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le renouvellement presque continu du personnel au Comit\u00e9, celui-ci a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats pour des postes d\u2019agent de griefs et a maintenu la plaignante sur une liste de disponibilit\u00e9 active. Il est donc clair que ni l\u2019une, ni l\u2019autre des approches dans Shakes et Israeli ne r\u00e9pondent sp\u00e9cifiquement au dilemme qui nous est pos\u00e9. Toutefois, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire un choix entre ces deux approches.\n[22] Dans Premakumar c. Air Canada, D.T. 03\/02, 2002\/02\/04, le Tribunal pr\u00e9cise que les crit\u00e8res des affaires Shakes et Israeli sont des guides utiles, mais qu\u2019aucun des deux ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 automatiquement d\u2019une mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire. Il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte des circonstances de chaque affaire pour \u00e9tablir si l\u2019application de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des crit\u00e8res, en tout ou en partie, est pertinente. En fin de compte, la question sera de savoir si la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire si on y ajoute foi, la preuve devant le Tribunal, est-elle compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Nous appliquerons donc cette approche flexible au cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en combinant, au besoin, les deux approches et en reformulant, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 appliquer.\n[23] Une fois cette preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie, le fardeau se d\u00e9place sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n[24] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver les all\u00e9gations de discrimination par moyen d\u2019une preuve directe. La discrimination se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rares sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. (Voir Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. D\/5038.) Il appartient donc au Tribunal de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. (Premakumar, par. 79.)\n[25] La norme de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, l\u2019on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible. (Premakumar, par. 81.) Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, cependant, que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient la seule raison des actes en cause pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accept\u00e9e. Ce sera suffisant si ces consid\u00e9rations sont des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher. (Premakumar, par. 82; Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au para. D\/15.)\n[26] En effet, la preuve de discrimination poss\u00e8de des difficult\u00e9s qui lui sont propres. La plus importante est, sans contredit, le fait que des circonstances semblables peuvent se pr\u00eater \u00e0 des interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes. Or, si l\u2019acte de discrimination r\u00e9side dans la diff\u00e9renciation, le probl\u00e8me est que cette diff\u00e9renciation n\u2019existe pas ind\u00e9pendamment des actions des parties. Elle doit \u00eatre inf\u00e9r\u00e9e. Il s\u2019ensuit que le membre du Tribunal appel\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher la question doit se servir de son jugement dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination.\nC. Analyse (i) La preuve prima facie (a) La plaignante poss\u00e8de-t-elle les comp\u00e9tences ou qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper le poste voulu? [27] Le r\u00f4le d\u2019un d\u2019agent principal de griefs est, entre autres, de fournir des avis et des conseils juridiques aux membres du Comit\u00e9 relatifs aux griefs qui lui sont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-major de la d\u00e9fense. Afin de pourvoir aux postes d\u2019agent de griefs, le Comit\u00e9 a tenu un premier concours interne en f\u00e9vrier 2002.\n[28] En avril 2002, un second concours ouvert \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la population est lanc\u00e9. Le Comit\u00e9 annonce \u00e0 ce moment dix (10) postes d\u2019agents de griefs d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de douze (12) mois ou plus. Selon l\u2019annonce, les candidats devaient d\u00e9tenir un grade universitaire en ressources humaines, en droit ou en relations industrielles ou de travail. L\u2019annonce \u00e9nonce \u00e9galement une s\u00e9rie d\u2019exp\u00e9riences requises et pr\u00e9voit que la majorit\u00e9 des postes est bilingue imp\u00e9ratif CCC , mais que certains sont unilingues anglais ou fran\u00e7ais.\n[29] Le 6 mai 2002, Me Montreuil postule pour l\u2019un des postes annonc\u00e9s dans le concours du mois d\u2019avril 2002. Elle envoie \u00e9galement ses r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examen de langue anglaise de la Commission canadienne de la fonction publique, qu\u2019elle avait pass\u00e9 le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2000. Elle avait alors obtenu le niveau E (Exempt\u00e9e), avec une note brute de 63 sur 65, en compr\u00e9hension \u00e9crite et un niveau B , avec une note brute de 43, \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00e9crite. La note requise pour avoir le niveau C est de 44. \u00c0 l\u2019interaction orale, la plaignante a obtenu le niveau C . La plaignante \u00e9tait donc cot\u00e9e, sur le plan linguistique, ECB . Le 26 novembre 2002, Me Montreuil a refait l\u2019examen de connaissance de l\u2019anglais expression \u00e9crite afin de rehausser son profil dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. En effet, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait Me Montreuil de continuer \u00e0 se perfectionner en ce qui concerne l\u2019expression \u00e9crite en anglais et de repasser le test de classification de langue de la fonction publique autant de fois qu\u2019elle le voulait. \u00c0 la suite de ce nouvel examen, le niveau de la plaignante en compr\u00e9hension \u00e9crite de l\u2019anglais est demeur\u00e9 inchang\u00e9 \u00e0 B .\n[30] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2002, Me Montreuil est invit\u00e9e \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la base militaire de Valcartier pour passer un examen \u00e9crit. Le 31 octobre 2002, on l\u2019informe qu\u2019elle a r\u00e9ussi son examen et qu\u2019elle sera bient\u00f4t invit\u00e9e \u00e0 une entrevue par le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection.\n[31] Le 15 novembre 2002, la plaignante est re\u00e7ue en entrevue \u00e0 Ottawa par Diane Laurin, Mireille Royer, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque conseill\u00e8re aux Ressources humaines, et Gary Wetzel, avocat au contentieux du Comit\u00e9. Me Diane Laurin, occupait alors le poste de vice-pr\u00e9sidente du Comit\u00e9. Elle deviendra pr\u00e9sidente en f\u00e9vrier 2004.\n[32] Selon une lettre du 14 juillet 2005, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par Me Jacques Shore, du bureau d\u2019avocats Gowling Lafleur Henderson, les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il semblerait que Me Laurin aurait, lors de l\u2019entrevue de Me Montreuil, pris des notes. Nous pouvons supposer que les autres membres du comit\u00e9 ont \u00e9galement pris des notes lors de l\u2019entrevue. Ces notes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ces notes sont souvent indicatives de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit des participants aux entrevues comme en font foi les d\u00e9cisions de ce tribunal dans Kasongo c. Financement Agricole Canada, 2005 TCDP 24 et Montreuil c. Banque Nationale, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Malheureusement, nous ne pourrons en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier dans le pr\u00e9sent cas.\n[33] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Me Laurin, l\u2019entrevue avec Me Montreuil s\u2019est bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Elle ajoute que l\u2019ambiance \u00e9tait comparable \u00e0 celle des entrevues avec les autres postulants. Lors de cette entrevue, Me Laurin rencontrait Me Montreuil pour la premi\u00e8re fois, mais elle savait qui elle \u00e9tait, car elle en avait entendu parler par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire des m\u00e9dias. Elle \u00e9tait au courant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait transgenre et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9battue devant plusieurs Cours de justice pour faire valoir ses droits. Me Laurin pr\u00e9cisera que le fait que la candidate \u00e9tait transgenre \u00e9tait \u00e9galement connu de madame Royer. Il se peut, selon elle, que monsieur Wetzel n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant et elle a donc cru bon de l\u2019en informer avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019entrevue. Elle ajoutera que le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection avait discut\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable de cette candidate comme il l\u2019avait fait pour tous les autres candidats. Me Laurin mentionne que le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a trouv\u00e9 int\u00e9ressant le curriculum vitae de Me Montreuil. Elle ajoute que le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019entrevue d\u00e9montre que la plaignante s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9brouill\u00e9e. . D\u2019ailleurs, selon le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019entrevue, la plaignante se serait class\u00e9e troisi\u00e8me sur les quatre candidats. En contre-interrogatoire, Me Laurin ajoute que les trois autres candidats, des unilingues anglophones, ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s par le comit\u00e9.\n[34] Me Laurin explique qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019entrevue les candidats sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s selon certains crit\u00e8res soit, la connaissance, la capacit\u00e9 et les comp\u00e9tences et les qualit\u00e9s personnelles. Les connaissances sont \u00e9tablies par une s\u00e9rie de questions qui sont pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et pos\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les candidats. La capacit\u00e9 et les comp\u00e9tences sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 partir du curriculum vitae de la personne. Finalement, les qualit\u00e9s personnelles sont examin\u00e9es lors de l\u2019entrevue et \u00e0 partir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournies par le candidat. Les capacit\u00e9s ou les connaissances linguistiques du candidat ne sont pas \u00e9valu\u00e9es ou consid\u00e9r\u00e9es lors de l\u2019entrevue. Me Laurin ajoute que si un candidat veut se qualifier pour un poste bilingue, il devra alors se conformer aux exigences de la Commission de la Fonction publique en mati\u00e8re de langue.\n[35] Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2002, Me Montreuil re\u00e7oit une lettre de Mireille Royer, consultante en ressources humaines, pour le Comit\u00e9, qui l\u2019informe que les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection ont termin\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats et qu\u2019elle s\u2019est qualifi\u00e9e dans le cadre du concours.\n[36] Consid\u00e9rant ces faits, je conclus que Me Montreuil poss\u00e9dait les comp\u00e9tences ou qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper un poste d\u2019agent de grief. Selon la lettre de Mireille Royer, dont nous avons fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ci-dessus, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e pour le poste dans le cadre du concours.\n(b) La candidature de la plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e? [37] La lettre de Madame Royer, dont il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence plus haut, mentionne \u00e9galement que Me Montreuil s\u2019\u00e9tant qualifi\u00e9 dans le cadre de concours, son nom est, d\u00e8s lors, plac\u00e9 sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui doit servir \u00e0 pourvoir les postes qui deviendraient vacants d\u2019ici au 30 mars 2003. La lettre fait mention des listes d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui sont jointes . Or, ces listes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produites \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[38] Dans les mois qui suivent la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, Me Montreuil communique \u00e0 quelques reprises avec le Comit\u00e9 pour savoir quand il embaucherait des agents de grief. On lui r\u00e9pond que le Comit\u00e9 attend que son budget soit augment\u00e9 avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 de nouvelles embauches. Me Montreuil ne doute aucunement de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de cette affirmation puisque, comme elle l\u2019admettra \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les autres candidats ont \u00e9galement d\u00fb attendre la confirmation du budget avant de se voir offrir un emploi.\n[39] Me Montreuil a par la suite une s\u00e9rie de conversations avec un individu du nom de Pierre Lacasse, un employ\u00e9 du Comit\u00e9, qui lui fournira certains renseignements sur le traitement de sa candidature pour le poste d\u2019agent de grief. M. Lacasse ne sera pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Tout au long de l\u2019audience, Me Montreuil s\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019information qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue de M. Lacasse ou encore \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019il a eue avec l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission des droits de la personne. Or, cette preuve constitue du ou\u00ef-dire et la question s\u2019est rapidement pos\u00e9e quant \u00e0 son admissibilit\u00e9.\n[40] Les tribunaux ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement refus\u00e9 d\u2019adopter une d\u00e9finition unique et exhaustive de la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef-dire. Ils craignaient qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9finition ne puisse circonscrire tous les cas o\u00f9 une d\u00e9claration extrajudiciaire pr\u00e9senterait un ou plusieurs des dangers traditionnels du ou\u00ef-dire soit l\u2019absence d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage fait sous serment, l\u2019absence de la possibilit\u00e9 pour la partie adverse de contre-interroger le t\u00e9moin et l\u2019absence d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 pour le tribunal de juger de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin. Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, plusieurs de ces dangers, sinon tous, sont pr\u00e9sents. Bien que le Tribunal soit, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, assez flexible dans son traitement de la preuve constituant du ou\u00ef-dire (voir, par exemple, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP.), il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aucune raison valable, autre que l\u2019engagement de la plaignante de ne pas appeler M. Lacasse comme t\u00e9moin, n\u2019explique son absence. Dans ces circonstances, il serait contraire aux principes de justices naturelles, codifi\u00e9s aux paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la LCDP, et in\u00e9quitable d\u2019admettre cette preuve. Je n\u2019en tiendrais donc pas compte dans ma d\u00e9cision.\n[41] En septembre 2003, le Comit\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande du ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale, \u00e9labore un plan op\u00e9rationnel afin d\u2019\u00e9liminer pour d\u00e9cembre 2004, un arr\u00e9rage d\u2019environ 349 dossiers de griefs. De ce nombre, 70 dossiers (20 %) sont en fran\u00e7ais. Afin de r\u00e9aliser ce mandat, le Comit\u00e9 se voit accorder des ressources additionnelles.\n[42] Vers la fin octobre 2003, presque un an apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, Me Montreuil communique \u00e0 nouveau avec le Comit\u00e9 pour savoir s\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 de nouvelles embauches d\u2019agents de griefs. On l\u2019informe que le Comit\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019embauche de trois agents de griefs unilingue anglais, que deux sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en poste et que le troisi\u00e8me entrera en fonction dans la semaine qui suivra. La plaignante demande alors si l\u2019intim\u00e9 va proc\u00e9der, dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019embauche de d\u2019autres personnes. On l\u2019informe que non.\n[43] Le 10 novembre 2003, Me Montreuil \u00e9crit \u00e0 Me Laurin demandant certaines pr\u00e9cisions concernant l\u2019embauche des agents de grief. Elle veut savoir, notamment, combien d\u2019agents de griefs anglophones, francophones et bilingues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9. Elle s\u2019enquiert \u00e9galement du nombre de dossiers que le Comit\u00e9 a \u00e0 traiter. Cette lettre est demeur\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse.\n[44] Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, elle demande \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 Me Laurin de donner suite \u00e0 sa lettre du 10 novembre. Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, Me Muriel Korngold-Wexler, directrice de la section Analyse des griefs et op\u00e9rations du Comit\u00e9, r\u00e9pond \u00e0 Me Montreuil. Me Korngold-Wexler explique qu\u2019en septembre 2003, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une entente avec le minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense, le Comit\u00e9 a mis en vigueur un plan op\u00e9rationnel en vue d\u2019\u00e9liminer l\u2019arr\u00e9rage des dossiers de griefs avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004. Elle ajoute que le Comit\u00e9 a d\u00fb, dans ce contexte, faire une \u00e9tude approfondie de ses besoins op\u00e9rationnels. Elle mentionne que, vu le nombre de griefs en anglais, le Comit\u00e9 avait offert des postes aux candidats qui s\u2019\u00e9taient plac\u00e9s sur la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 anglais uniquement , ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux sur la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 bilingue .\n[45] Elle informe Me Montreuil que le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas de besoin op\u00e9rationnel pour des agents de griefs unilingues fran\u00e7ais. Elle pr\u00e9cise cependant que le Comit\u00e9 a prolong\u00e9 la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des postes d\u2019agents de griefs unilingues fran\u00e7ais jusqu\u2019en mars 2004 et elle assure Me Montreuil que si le Comit\u00e9 devait avoir besoin d\u2019un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais qu\u2019il ferait appel \u00e0 ses services. D\u2019ailleurs, je me demande pourquoi le Comit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prolonger cette liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il parait \u00e9vident, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les explications de Me Korngold-Wexler, que le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019aurait jamais besoin d\u2019un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais puisque les agents bilingues pourraient suffire \u00e0 cette t\u00e2che..\n[46] Le 18 janvier 2004, Me Montreuil demande \u00e0 Me Korngold-Wexler de lui fournir plus de pr\u00e9cisions concernant la r\u00e9partition linguistique des agents de grief. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, Me Korngold-Wexler pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019entre le 1er septembre et le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, le Comit\u00e9 a embauch\u00e9 au total neuf (9) agents de griefs r\u00e9partis comme suit : un agent de griefs unilingue anglais \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, trois agents de griefs unilingues anglais \u00e0 des postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, un agent unilingue anglais par la voie du programme \u00c9changes Canada, deux agents de griefs unilingues par voie d\u2019emploi temporaire et deux agents de griefs bilingues par voie de d\u00e9tachement. En date du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, le Comit\u00e9 comptait \u00e0 son actif quinze (15) agents de griefs dont six \u00e9taient bilingues au niveau CCC et neuf unilingues anglais. Finalement, Me Korngold-Wexler mentionne, \u00e0 nouveau, que si le volume de dossiers \u00e0 \u00eatre trait\u00e9s en fran\u00e7ais augmentait et que le Comit\u00e9 se voyait dans le besoin d\u2019embaucher un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais, alors il utiliserait la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 unilingue fran\u00e7ais sur laquelle Me Montreuil \u00e9tait la seule candidate. Elle pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement que le Comit\u00e9 avait prolong\u00e9 cette liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2004\n[47] De cette information, la plaignante tire certaines conclusions. Elle soutient qu\u2019un unilingue anglophone peut \u00eatre embauch\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9, mais que la seule postulante unilingue francophone ne sera pas embauch\u00e9e. Elle ajoute que la seule caract\u00e9ristique qui diff\u00e9rencie la postulante unilingue francophone dans le cas pr\u00e9sent c\u2019est qu\u2019elle est transgenre. Selon elle, la langue n\u2019est pas la cause de la discrimination qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue avoir subie, mais le pr\u00e9texte pour cacher la discrimination. Elle soutient que la discrimination est bas\u00e9e sur le sexe et que la langue n\u2019est qu\u2019un rideau devant.\n[48] Plus tard durant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2004, la plaignante demande \u00e0 Me Korngold-Wexler de lui donner des pr\u00e9cisions concernant la r\u00e9partition linguistique des agents de griefs toujours en poste et sur la validit\u00e9 de la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9.\n[49] Le 20 juillet 2004, elle re\u00e7oit l\u2019information suivante. On l\u2019informe que le 6 juin 2004, l\u2019intim\u00e9 comptait 13 agents de griefs dont sept (7) unilingues anglais et six (6) bilingues au niveau CCC . On ajoute \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est pass\u00e9 de quinze (15) agents de griefs en d\u00e9cembre 2003 \u00e0 treize (13) agents de griefs en juin 2004 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, un concours interne \u00e0 la Fonction publique \u00e9tait en cours afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir des listes d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en vue de pourvoir aux besoins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour les deux prochaines ann\u00e9es. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 pour des candidats unilingues fran\u00e7ais, la plaignante \u00e9tait toujours la seule \u00e0 figurer sur cette liste. La lettre indique que cette liste serait utilis\u00e9e advenant que le volume de dossiers \u00e0 \u00eatre trait\u00e9s en fran\u00e7ais augmente consid\u00e9rablement et que les agents bilingues, qui traitent entre autres de ces dossiers, ne suffisent plus \u00e0 la demande. (C\u2019est moi qui souligne.) Me Korngold \u2013 Wexler n\u2019expliquera pas ce qu\u2019elle entend par une augmentation consid\u00e9rable des dossiers \u00e0 trait\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais.\n[50] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, nous pourrions conclure que la candidature de Me Montreuil n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. En effet, les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont tous indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises et qui a finalement expir\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2004. De plus, on lui indique que si le nombre de dossiers en fran\u00e7ais augmentait consid\u00e9rablement , le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019h\u00e9siterait pas \u00e0 faire appel \u00e0 ses services. Or, cette possibilit\u00e9 n\u2019avait aucune chance de se r\u00e9aliser, car de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de dossiers francophones au Comit\u00e9 pour un poste unilingue francophone et que quoi qu'il en soit, les agents de griefs bilingues suffisent pour le traitement de ces dossiers.\n[51] Ainsi, en pla\u00e7ant Me Montreuil sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 pour laquelle il n\u2019y aurait jamais de besoins, le Comit\u00e9 a, en fait, rejet\u00e9 la candidature de celle-ci, car il imposait une condition impossible \u00e0 remplir soit que le volume de dossiers \u00e0 traiter en fran\u00e7ais augmente \u00e0 un niveau tel que les agents bilingues ne suffiraient plus \u00e0 la t\u00e2che. Or, m\u00eame si le nombre de dossiers en fran\u00e7ais augmentait, le Comit\u00e9 pourrait toujours accro\u00eetre le nombre d\u2019agents bilingues rendant vaine l\u2019embauche d\u2019un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais.\n(c) Les candidats retenus, en r\u00e9ponse au concours et par la suite, \u00e9taient-ils mieux qualifi\u00e9s que la plaignante [52] Le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des autres candidats est les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019entrevue qui indiquent que Me Montreuil s\u2019est class\u00e9e troisi\u00e8me sur les quatre candidats. Les trois autres candidats, unilingues anglophones, ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s. Rien n\u2019indique que les candidats retenus \u00e9taient mieux qualifi\u00e9s que Me Montreuil pour occuper un poste d\u2019agent de grief.\n(d) Une preuve prima facie a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie? [53] Je conclus de la preuve qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Le fardeau est maintenant au Comit\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable de la conduite qui lui est reproch\u00e9e.\n(ii) L\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [54] L\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 pour refuser la candidature de Me Montreuil est qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas de besoins op\u00e9rationnels pour un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais et que, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, ses agents de griefs bilingues suffisent \u00e0 la t\u00e2che pour traiter les dossiers en langue fran\u00e7aise. Or, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019annonce du concours pour lequel Me Montreuil a postul\u00e9 indiquait que la majorit\u00e9 des postes \u00e9tait bilingue imp\u00e9ratif CCC mais que certains sont unilingues anglais ou fran\u00e7ais (C\u2019est moi qui souligne.). Pourquoi alors avoir annonc\u00e9 que certains postes seraient unilingue fran\u00e7ais , si le comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019avis, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de dossier en fran\u00e7ais pour justifier l\u2019embauche d\u2019un agent de griefs avec ce profil? Les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 cette question fournies par les t\u00e9moins du Comit\u00e9 ne m\u2019ont pas convaincues ni satisfaites.\n[55] Notons que dans sa lettre du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, dont nous avons fait mention ci-dessus, Me Korngold-Wexler pr\u00e9cise : Le Comit\u00e9 ne peut pas pr\u00e9dire le nombre de griefs qu\u2019on aura \u00e0 traiter en 2004. Cependant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s nos donn\u00e9es des deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, sur 226 dossiers compl\u00e9t\u00e9s en 2002 et 2003 \u00e0 date, 89 % \u00e9taient en anglais et 11 % en fran\u00e7ais. Elle ajoute que le Comit\u00e9 traite en moyenne 100 \u00e0 126 griefs par an et qu\u2019il a en place cinq agents de griefs bilingues au niveau CCC (dont la langue maternelle est le fran\u00e7ais) qui sont \u00e0 m\u00eame de traiter les dossiers fran\u00e7ais. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs en pr\u00e9vision de ces besoins que nous avions embauch\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019agents bilingues, lesquels seraient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler dans les deux langues. Je ne vois pas en quoi cette explication justifie la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9.\n[56] Aux fins de l\u2019audience, Me Korngold-Wexler, a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un tableau montrant le nombre de griefs trait\u00e9 par le comit\u00e9 entre 2000 et 2007. Selon ce tableau, pour les ann\u00e9es 2002 (205 griefs) et 2003 (146 griefs), le Comit\u00e9 aurait re\u00e7u un total de 351 griefs, dont 287 (81 %), en anglais, et 64 (18 %), en fran\u00e7ais. Je note que ces chiffres ne concordent pas avec ceux fournis dans sa lettre du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Quoi qu'il en soit, l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par Me Korngold\u2011Wexler pour expliquer pourquoi le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019agents de griefs bilingue est loin d\u2019\u00eatre convaincante. Pousser \u00e0 son extr\u00eame cette logique pourrait \u00e9galement vouloir dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019embaucher des agents de griefs unilingues anglais puisqu\u2019en augmentant le nombre d\u2019agents de griefs bilingues, ceux-ci pourraient traiter tous les dossiers en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais. Et pourtant, le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 embaucher des agents de griefs unilingues anglophones.\n[57] Je constate \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucune preuve, autre le fait que 18 % des dossiers en langue fran\u00e7aise ne soit pas suffisant pour justifier l\u2019embauche d\u2019un agent de griefs fran\u00e7ais, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour expliquer quel nombre de dossiers en langue fran\u00e7aise serait n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019un besoin op\u00e9rationnel justifie l\u2019embauche d\u2019un agent de griefs unilingue francophone.\n[58] Selon le tableau de Me Korngold-Wexler, en 2002, le Comit\u00e9 a re\u00e7u 205 griefs dont 173 (84,4 %), en anglais, et 32 (15,6 %), en fran\u00e7ais. En 2003, il a re\u00e7u 146 griefs, dont 114 (78,1 %), en anglais, et 32 (21,9 %), en fran\u00e7ais. En 2004, le Comit\u00e9 a re\u00e7u 102 griefs, dont 82 (80,4 %), en anglais, et 20 (19,6 %), en fran\u00e7ais. En 2005, le Comit\u00e9 a re\u00e7u 80 dossiers dont 52 (65 %), en anglais, et 28 (35 %), en fran\u00e7ais. En 2006, 63 griefs dont 51 (81 %), en anglais, et 12 (19 %), en fran\u00e7ais.\n[59] M\u00eame \u00e0 35 %, le comit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rait ne pas avoir de besoins op\u00e9rationnels pour un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais. \u00c0 partir de cette preuve, je dois en conclure que le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019aura jamais besoin d\u2019un agent de griefs unilingue fran\u00e7ais , \u00e0 moins d\u2019un revirement exceptionnel dans la composante linguistique des dossiers. Mais, alors pourquoi avoir plac\u00e9 Me Montreuil sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 dont on n\u2019aurait jamais besoin?\n[60] Pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision, le Comit\u00e9 s\u2019est \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9 sur la Politique sur la dotation des postes bilingues \u00e9mise par le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada qui pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un poste \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e doit \u00eatre dot\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on imp\u00e9rative, ce qui veut dire que l\u2019on ne retient qu\u2019uniquement la candidature de personne qui satisfont \u00e0 toutes les exigences linguistiques du poste lors de l\u2019embauche (Voir : Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada, Politique sur la dotation des postes bilingues \u2013 version archiv\u00e9e de 2001). Bien que cette Politique explique les raisons pour lesquelles Me Montreuil n\u2019a pu obtenir l\u2019un des postes bilingues, elle ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 la question \u00e0 savoir pourquoi le Comit\u00e9 a jug\u00e9 bon de ne pas cr\u00e9er un poste unilingue francophone .\n[61] Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser toutefois que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne cherche pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le Comit\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher Me Montreuil parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait francophone, mais plut\u00f4t si le Comit\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019embaucher parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait transgenre en utilisant son profil linguistique comme pr\u00e9texte. Je suis conscient qu\u2019il ne rel\u00e8ve pas du Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pris en compte les exigences relatives aux langues officielles qui s\u2019imposent lors de la dotation en personnel. En effet, aux termes de l\u2019article 91 de la Loi sur les langues officielles, L.R.C. (1985), ch. 31 (4e suppl.), les Parties IV et V de cette loi ne permettent pas, lors d\u2019une dotation en personnel, la prise en compte des exigences relatives aux langues officielles que si elles s\u2019imposent objectivement pour l\u2019exercice des fonctions. Les exigences en mati\u00e8re de langues officielles ne peuvent donc pas \u00eatre dict\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on frivole ou arbitraire (Voir : Canada (P.G.) c. Viola, [1991] 1 C.F. 373 (C.A.), mais uniquement en fonction de chaque situation. (Institut professionnel de la fonction publique c. Canada, [1993] 2 C.F. 90). Aux termes de l\u2019article 91, le gouvernement n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement fond\u00e9 \u00e0 exiger, pour un poste donn\u00e9, le bilinguisme des candidats. Il en va particuli\u00e8rement ainsi lorsque l\u2019employeur ne s\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur les crit\u00e8res objectifs fix\u00e9s par le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et lorsque le dossier de dotation ne comporte aucun motif justifiant une telle exigence. (Rogers c. Canada (Service correctionnel), [2001] 2 C.F. 586 (1re inst.); voir \u00e9galement R. Leckey et E. Didier, Le droit linguistique priv\u00e9 dans Les droits linguistiques au Canada (2i\u00e8me \u00e9d.), sous la direction de Michel Bastarache, \u00c9ditions Yvon Blais, p. 537.)\n[62] Bien qu\u2019il existe des recours sp\u00e9cifiques pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 la Partie X de la Loi sur les langues officielles, afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019institution dans sa dotation en personnel a contrevenu aux obligations qui sont les siennes en vertu de cette loi, cela n\u2019enl\u00e8ve aucunement la comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer, si une exigence linguistique, m\u00eame celle qui se justifie objectivement, est en m\u00eame temps porteuse de discrimination. Le Tribunal n\u2019outrepasse pas son mandat lorsqu\u2019il se demande si l\u2019aspect linguistique d\u2019une dotation, comme c\u2019est le cas ici, n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte pour une discrimination au sens de la LCDP. Le fait qu\u2019une activit\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 la surveillance et la r\u00e9glementation sectorielle, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la Loi sur les langues officielles, n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019application de la LCDP. (Voir notamment le paragraphe 82(2) de la Loi sur les langues officielles qui mentionne sp\u00e9cifiquement qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas primaut\u00e9 sur la LCDP.)\n[63] Ainsi, dans Vlug c. S.R.C (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. 404, aux paras, 30 \u00e0 32, le Tribunal a conclu que les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9mises par le CRTC concernant le sous-titrage n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9terminantes quant \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de sous-titrer en vertu de la LCDP. Il s\u2019agit, selon le Tribunal, de deux crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux diff\u00e9rents.\n[64] De m\u00eame, le juge Rothstein (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) \u00e9crit dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569 :\nL\u2019avocat du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soutient que suivant la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. (1985), ch. P-33, les promotions doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es au m\u00e9rite. Il affirme que ce syst\u00e8me de promotion est expos\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail dans la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, et qu\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne ne peut y passer outre. Il pr\u00e9tend que le pouvoir du Tribunal se limite \u00e0 renvoyer l\u2019affaire devant le Service correctionnel du Canada pour que celui-ci pr\u00e9sente une demande d\u2019exemption en vertu de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, et d\u00e9clare que M. Uzoaba avait droit \u00e0 un poste de niveau WP-5 ou encore, ordonne que M. Uzoaba a le droit de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 un concours pour un poste de niveau WP-5.\n[\u2026]\nJe pense que le principe de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance doit s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour permettre \u00e0 un tribunal des droits de la personne d\u2019ordonner l\u2019octroi d\u2019une promotion qui, selon lui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e pour des motifs discriminatoires, en violation de la Loi. En d\u2019autres termes, la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission de la fonction publique et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit normalement \u00eatre suivie pour l\u2019octroi des promotions au sein de la fonction publique n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance dans ces rares cas o\u00f9 des promotions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es pour des motifs discriminatoires et o\u00f9 un tribunal, exer\u00e7ant la comp\u00e9tence qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Loi, ordonne qu\u2019une promotion soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne afin de corriger les effets de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019employeur. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je fais mienne l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du juge Dickson, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kelso c. La Reine, [1981] 1 R.C.S. 199, o\u00f9 il dit \u00e0 la page 207 :\nPersonne ne conteste le droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources et les effectifs comme il le juge appropri\u00e9. Mais ce droit n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9. Son exercice doit respecter la loi. Le droit du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources ne peut l\u2019emporter sur une loi telle que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, S.C. 1976-77, ch. 33, ou sur un r\u00e8glement tel que le D\u00e9cret d\u2019exclusion.\n[65] Les m\u00eames principes s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien qu\u2019un recours puisse exister en vertu de la Loi sur les langues officielles, cela n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de traiter de la question de discrimination le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[66] Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer une discrimination n\u2019est pas une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 un constat de discrimination. Dans Commission des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario et Theresa O\u2019Malley c. Simpson\u2011Sears Ltd, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, la juge McIntyre d\u00e9clare aux pages 549\u2011550 :\n[\u2026] conclure que l\u2019intention constituer un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire de la discrimination en vertu du Code (Code ontarien des droits de la personne) serait, me semble-t-il, \u00e9lever une barri\u00e8re pratiquement insurmontable pour le plaignant qui demande r\u00e9paration [\u2026] Je suis d\u2019avis que les tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieur ont eu tort de conclure que l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u00e9cessaire.\n[67] Ainsi, nul n\u2019est besoin de d\u00e9montrer que les membres du Comit\u00e9 avaient l\u2019intention de discriminer \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Me Montreuil. D\u2019ailleurs, la discrimination est souvent invisible. Des personnes qui font de la discrimination souvent ne se rendent pas compte qu\u2019elles le font. Cela ne signifie pas cependant que les autres ne s\u2019en rendent pas compte. Ainsi, en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, est-il possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il existe ici de subtiles odeurs de discrimination comme d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019affaire Basi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e?\n[68] Pour en arriver \u00e0 ma conclusion, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la situation en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 un examen soign\u00e9 et approfondi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les deux parties. J\u2019ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 objectivement les arguments de Me Montreuil et ceux du comit\u00e9. Or, la preuve et les arguments qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis par le Comit\u00e9 ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu qu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas une subtile odeur de discrimination dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas offrir un poste d\u2019agent de griefs \u00e0 Me Montreuil.\n[69] Bien que les t\u00e9moins du Comit\u00e9 aient soutenu que le transgendrisme de Me Montreuil n\u2019ait eu aucun effet sur la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l\u2019embaucher, la preuve et les explications qu\u2019ils m\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour soutenir leurs arguments ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu. Est-ce raisonnable de dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de travail en fran\u00e7ais au Comit\u00e9 pour occuper m\u00eame un seul agent de griefs francophone unilingue alors que la charge de travail en fran\u00e7ais approchait de 18 %? Tout au long de l\u2019audience, aucune r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette question. Le simple fait de dire que les agents bilingues pouvaient satisfaire au besoin pour traiter les dossiers fran\u00e7ais n\u2019est pas une r\u00e9ponse satisfaisante. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la m\u00eame logique pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour justifier le fait d\u2019avoir moins d\u2019agents unilingues anglophones.\n[70] De m\u00eame, l\u2019argument voulant que les agents bilingues \u00e9tant tous francophones, de d\u00e9signer un poste fran\u00e7ais unilingue restreindrait leur droit de travailler en fran\u00e7ais, n\u2019est appuy\u00e9 par aucune preuve.\n[71] Finalement, un fait saute aux yeux lorsque nous regardons la preuve dans son ensemble. Me Montreuil poss\u00e9dait une caract\u00e9ristique que les autres agents de griefs n\u2019avaient pas : elle est transgenre. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la norme de la preuve dans les causes de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, je me dois de conclure que le Comit\u00e9 a fait preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de discrimination. Il me faut conclure que la preuve rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible. Bien qu\u2019il se puisse que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires ne soient pas les seules raisons de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher Me Montreuil, cela n\u2019est pas suffisant, lorsque des consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires sont \u00e9galement des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher.\n[72] Le Comit\u00e9 n\u2019a pu fournir d\u2019explication raisonnable justifiant sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019embauche Me Montreuil pour un poste d\u2019agents de griefs et pour ces raisons, je conclus qu\u2019il existe cette subtile odeur de discrimination. . Je conclus donc que le Comit\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Me Montreuil de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (transgenre) contrairement aux articles 3 et 7 de la LCDP.\nD. Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s par Micheline Montreuil [73] Ayant conclu que le Comit\u00e9 avait exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Me Montreuil, il me faut maintenant aborder la question des redressements. \u00c0 titre de redressement, Me Montreuil r\u00e9clame :\nune ordonnance en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP pour pertes de salaire; une ordonnance pour indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP; les int\u00e9r\u00eats aux termes du paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP\n(i) R\u00e9clamation pour pertes de salaire [74] Me Montreuil r\u00e9clame en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2) c) de la LCDP que le Tribunal ordonne le Comit\u00e9 a lui payer le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7us si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2003 jusqu\u2019au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2006. Elle r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement un montant pour dommages futurs pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre le 1er mars 2006 et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006.\n[75] En premier, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal pour soutenir la r\u00e9clamation pour dommages futurs et que cette r\u00e9clamation est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[76] Selon l\u2019annonce du concours, le poste pour lequel Me Montreuil a postul\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 12 mois ou plus qui devait se conclure le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004. Le traitement se situait dans une \u00e9chelle entre 59 817 $ et 64 670 $. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel niveau de l\u2019\u00e9chelle Me Montreuil se serait trouv\u00e9 s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9. J\u2019en d\u00e9duis donc qu\u2019initialement, elle se serait retrouv\u00e9e au bas de l\u2019\u00e9chelle soit \u00e0 59 817 $. Bien que le Comit\u00e9 ait embauch\u00e9 trois agents de griefs en septembre 2003, j\u2019accepte les pr\u00e9tentions de Me Montreuil que la date de son embauche soit fix\u00e9e au 1er novembre 2003.\n[77] Du 1er novembre 2003 au 1er novembre 2004, le salaire de Me Montreuil si elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour le Comit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 59 817 $. Puisque le poste devait se terminer, le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004, j\u2019ajoute \u00e0 ce montant de 10 000 $, comme perte de salaire pour les mois de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2004. Ainsi, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2003 jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004, Me Montreuil aurait re\u00e7u un salaire de 69 817 $.\n[78] De ce montant doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9duits les revenus que Me Montreuil a re\u00e7us pour ces deux ann\u00e9es respectives. Dans ses rapports d\u2019imp\u00f4t pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 et 2004, Me Montreuil a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des pertes pour l\u2019exercice de sa profession lib\u00e9rale ainsi que des revenus de location en ce qui concerne l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004. Comme ces pertes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je ne vois aucune raison pour laquelle le Comit\u00e9 devrait en \u00eatre tenu responsable dans le calcul de la perte de salaire. Je n\u2019en tiendrai donc pas compte dans le pr\u00e9sent calcul.\n[79] Selon les rapports d\u2019imp\u00f4t de Me Montreuil pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003, ses revenus d\u2019emploi \u00e9taient de 46 741 $ et pour 2004 de 22 853 $. Pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er novembre 2003 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004, je d\u00e9duirai donc du montant de 69 817 $, la somme de 30 643 $. J\u2019\u00e9tablis donc la perte de salaire de Me Montreuil pour cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 39 174 $. La plaignante ayant r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer, par ces diff\u00e9rentes tentatives d\u2019obtenir d\u2019autres emplois, qu\u2019elle avait fait ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire afin de minimiser ses pertes, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de diminuer cette somme pour manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les pertes.\n[80] En ce qui concerne la perte de salaire, j\u2019ordonne que Me Montreuil soit indemnis\u00e9e pour une somme de 39 174$.\n(ii) Ordonnance pour indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [81] La plaignante r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement une somme de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9dommagement pour pr\u00e9judice moral aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. Encore une fois, aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour soutenir cette r\u00e9clamation. Il ne suffit pas pour une partie d\u2019all\u00e9guer un pr\u00e9judice moral, encore faut-il qu\u2019elle \u00e9taye cette r\u00e9clamation avec certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, aussi modeste soit-il, pour d\u00e9montrer quel effet l\u2019acte discriminatoire a eu sur elle.\n[82] Vu l\u2019absence de preuve que la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 ait caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 la plaignante, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il y ait lieu d\u2019\u00e9mettre l\u2019ordonnance r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\n(iii) Une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP [83] La plaignante r\u00e9clame en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP un montant de 20 000$ puisqu\u2019elle soutient que les gestes pos\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[84] En ce qui concerne la nature d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e des gestes pos\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9, aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne vient \u00e9tayer la pr\u00e9tention que le Comit\u00e9 ait agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Dans ma d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai tout simplement conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable, sur une balance des probabilit\u00e9s, de conclure que certains aspects de la conduite du Comit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre per\u00e7us comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires. Je n\u2019ai jamais conclu et aucune preuve ne m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour permettre de conclure que le Comit\u00e9 avait agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e envers la plaignante.\n[85] Le Comit\u00e9 a-t-il agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e? Selon le Black's Law Dictionary, un acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est un acte qui fait preuve d'indiff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences. Le mot recklessly dans la version anglaise de la LCDP est traduit dans la version fran\u00e7aise par le mot inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 , lequel semble envisager un acte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9fl\u00e9chie (qui t\u00e9moigne d'un manque de r\u00e9flexion; qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9, pes\u00e9 : Le petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise - 2006).\n[86] Selon moi, dans une langue ou l'autre, le qualificatif peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire commis par le Comit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la nature du mandat du Comit\u00e9, nous aurions \u00e9t\u00e9 en droit de nous attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit plus sensible aux cons\u00e9quences que pourraient avoir les gestes qu\u2019il posait. En ce sens, nous pouvons dire qu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 d\u2019un manque de r\u00e9flexion et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pes\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement les cons\u00e9quences de ses gestes. J\u2019en conclus donc que les gestes du Comit\u00e9 \u00e9taient inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[87] Le paragraphe 53(3) mentionne qu'une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, notamment du fait que les actes discriminatoires commis par le Comit\u00e9 n'\u00e9taient pas vraiment d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou malveillants, j'ordonne qu\u2019il paie \u00e0 Me Montreuil la somme de 5 000 $ au titre de l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3).\n(iv) Int\u00e9r\u00eat [88] L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat est payable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi). L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat devra \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 selon la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits la personne (03-05-04) soit au taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la banque du Canada. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat courra \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nE. Conclusion [89] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je juge fond\u00e9 la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (transgenre) contrairement aux articles 3 et 7 de la LCDP d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante, Micheline Montreuil, contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Comit\u00e9 des griefs des Forces canadiennes et j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la plaignante :\nune indemnit\u00e9 de 39 174 $ en guise de perte de salaire; une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 5 000 $; et c) de lui verser les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s au taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement des indemnit\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 20 novembre 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1108\/8905\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Thwaites et six autres pilotes chez Air Canada ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e9gime de retraite des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. Ils se sont retir\u00e9s entre le 1er mai 2005 et le 1er avril 2006.\n[2] Les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans lesquelles ils pr\u00e9tendent que la politique de retraite obligatoire en vigueur chez Air Canada constitue de la discrimination contre eux fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, ce qui contrevient aux articles 7, 9 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] Air Canada, intim\u00e9e dans les sept plaintes, et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, intim\u00e9e dans trois plaintes, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant au Tribunal de rejeter les sept plaintes sans audience. Elles soutiennent que la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Vilven et Kelly c. Air Canada, 2007 TCDP 36, a statu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on incontestable sur les questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes. Tenir une audience concernant les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure puisque les circonstances des plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne diff\u00e8rent pas de celles de M. Vilven et de M. Kelly.\n[4] Dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven et Kelly, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 si la politique de retraite obligatoire en vigueur chez Air Canada, laquelle avait oblig\u00e9 les plaignants dans cette affaire \u00e0 prendre leur retraite en 2003 et en 2005, \u00e9tait discriminatoire. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas discriminatoire de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne en appliquant la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d\u2019emploi. Les plaignants soutenaient que le Tribunal ne devait pas appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e0 leurs plaintes, car il contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s.\n[5] Le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) ne contrevenait pas \u00e0 la Charte. Il a de plus statu\u00e9 que M. Vilven et M. Kelly avaient atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour le genre d\u2019emploi qu\u2019ils occupaient. Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes.\n[6] Pour \u00e9tablir quel \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur en 2003 et en 2005 pour le genre d\u2019emploi qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants, le Tribunal a employ\u00e9 deux approches. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait l\u2019approche normative, laquelle obligeait le Tribunal \u00e0 chercher la r\u00e8gle r\u00e9gissant l\u2019\u00e2ge maximal de la retraite dans l\u2019industrie de l\u2019aviation. L\u2019Organisation de l\u2019aviation civile internationale (OACI) a adopt\u00e9 des normes concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge maximal des pilotes des transporteurs a\u00e9riens commerciaux. En septembre 2003 et en mai 2005, la norme de l\u2019OACI applicable aux pilotes commandants de bord \u00e9tait la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[7] La deuxi\u00e8me approche employ\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans Vilven et Kelly pour d\u00e9terminer quel \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00e9tait l\u2019approche empirique. Cette derni\u00e8re consistait en un examen de la preuve relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite chez les principaux transporteurs a\u00e9riens internationaux. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que, en 2003 et en 2005, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire pour le genre d\u2019emploi occup\u00e9 par les plaignants \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 \u00e0 60 ans.\n[8] Le 23 novembre 2006, une nouvelle norme de l\u2019OACI est entr\u00e9e en vigueur, laquelle fixait \u00e0 65 ans l\u2019\u00e2ge maximal des pilotes commandants de bord. Tous les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont pris leur retraite avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de cette nouvelle norme. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal, dans Vilven et Kelly, a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la nouvelle norme de l\u2019OACI en novembre 2006, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00e9tait de 60 ans, permettre aux plaignants de mettre \u00e0 nouveau la question en litige constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure selon les intim\u00e9es.\n[9] La doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est appliqu\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9ouverture de litiges dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les exigences strictes de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9taient pas remplies, mais o\u00f9 la r\u00e9ouverture aurait n\u00e9anmoins port\u00e9 atteinte aux principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice : Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 77, au paragraphe 37. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019application de cette doctrine dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal : Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Cremasco), 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 41; conf. par 2004 CAF 363.\n[10] Comme l\u2019a not\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment le Tribunal dans Morten c. Air Canada, 2007 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 23, la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est appliqu\u00e9e pour emp\u00eacher les remises en causes, car elles peuvent avoir des cons\u00e9quences dommageables. Par exemple, une remise en cause peut entra\u00eener des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires. Elle peut constituer un gaspillage de ressources judiciaires et \u00eatre une source de d\u00e9penses inutiles pour les parties (Toronto c. S.C.F.P., 2003 CSC 63, aux paragraphes 37 et 51).\n[11] Cependant, le Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence dans l\u2019application de doctrines comme l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, lesquelles ont comme r\u00e9sultat le rejet d\u2019une plainte sans audience. Une telle d\u00e9cision prive les parties de l\u2019occasion de produire une preuve et de formuler des observations au sujet de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e violation de leurs droits (O\u2019Connor c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 22). Quand il appara\u00eet clairement que le rejet d\u2019une plainte pourrait \u00eatre source d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 ou d\u2019injustice, la doctrine ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e (Morton, au paragraphe 24; Toronto c. S.C.F.P., au paragraphe 52).\n[12] Je conclus que rejeter les plaintes maintenant en me fondant sur la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pourrait \u00eatre source d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 ou d\u2019injustice. Les questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re incontestable. Les plaignants et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Vilven et Kelly. En fonction de l\u2019issue de ces demandes, les questions dans les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes pourraient demeurer en suspens. Le droit de soumettre ces questions au Tribunal serait irr\u00e9vocablement perdu si le Tribunal rejetait maintenant les plaintes sans audience. Ce r\u00e9sultat serait injuste. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de nouvelles plaintes ne pourrait r\u00e9parer cette injustice, puisque les nouvelles plaintes ne pourraient selon toute probabilit\u00e9 pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pour d\u00e9poser les plaintes (alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la LCDP).\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate des intim\u00e9es visant \u00e0 faire rejeter les plaintes est rejet\u00e9e, sans qu\u2019il soit port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 leur droit d\u2019introduire une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 suspendre la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que soit connue l\u2019issue des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans Vilven et Kelly.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKaren A.

Pour ce faire, les procureurs de l'intim\u00e9e ont remis au Tribunal les documents constituant les divulgations de f\u00e9vrier et avril 2006 (pi\u00e8ce I-17), documents num\u00e9rot\u00e9s de 1 \u00e0 275, ainsi qu'une liste des documents (pi\u00e8ce I-18) contenus \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce I-17. Cette liste fait une concordance entre les documents divulgu\u00e9s en f\u00e9vrier et avril 2006 et les pages de la pi\u00e8ce I-2.\n[3] La comparaison des documents faisant partie de la divulgation de f\u00e9vrier et avril 2006 (pi\u00e8ce I-17) avec les documents produits \u00e0 l'audience en octobre 2006 (pi\u00e8ce I-2) r\u00e9v\u00e8le que, sauf pour les pages 190 \u00e0 197 de la pi\u00e8ce I-2, curriculum vitae de Me Montreuil, les documents contenus \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce I-2 ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante en f\u00e9vrier et avril 2006.\n[4] Le Tribunal conclut donc que tous les documents qui se trouvent aux pages 12 \u00e0 289 de la pi\u00e8ce I-2, \u00e0 l'exception des pages 190 \u00e0 197, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante en f\u00e9vrier et avril 2006 et auraient donc pu \u00eatre soumis au Dr. Beltrami pour les fins de la r\u00e9daction de son expertise.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1047\/2805\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Micheline Montreuil c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Ruth Walden fait partie des 431 plaignants qui soutiennent que les intim\u00e9s ont fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe envers eux. Les plaignants sont un groupe d'infirmiers et d'infirmi\u00e8res majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes qui travaillent \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Pendant 35 ans, ils ont travaill\u00e9 aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de m\u00e9decins, un groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes, pour un but commun : d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\n[2] Les plaignants soutiennent que les m\u00e9decins (qui portent le titre de conseillers m\u00e9dicaux) et les infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers (qui portent le titre d'\u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux) font le m\u00eame travail : ils utilisent leurs connaissances m\u00e9dicales pour d\u00e9terminer si une personne a droit aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Lorsque les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux effectuent ce travail, ils sont reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 dans le Syst\u00e8me de classification de la fonction publique. Cependant, lorsque ce sont les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux qui font le travail, ils ne sont pas reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9. En fait, ils sont class\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des administrateurs de programme. En raison de leur classification, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux re\u00e7oivent une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, des avantages sociaux, de la formation, une reconnaissance professionnelle et des possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement professionnel qui sont meilleurs que ceux auxquels les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont droit.\n[3] Les plaignants soutiennent qu'il est discriminatoire de traiter un groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes diff\u00e9remment d'un groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes lorsqu'ils effectuent un travail identique ou un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent. Ils demandent \u00e0 recevoir le m\u00eame traitement que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux.\n[4] Il s'agit de d\u00e9terminer en l'esp\u00e8ce si les intim\u00e9s ont fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe envers les plaignants : 1) en les traitant diff\u00e9remment des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, en contravention avec l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) et\/ou 2) en appliquant des lignes de conduite susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi des plaignants, en contravention avec l'article 10 de la LCDP.\nII. R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 DE LA D\u00c9CISION [5] Les plaignants ont satisfait \u00e0 l'exigence au sujet de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi. Pour satisfaire \u00e0 cette exigence, les plaignants devaient pr\u00e9senter des preuves cr\u00e9dibles qui, en l'absence d'une justification raisonnable des intim\u00e9s, \u00e9tablissent le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[6] La preuve des plaignants \u00e9tayait l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle, depuis 1972, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux effectuaient un travail identique, ou un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent, que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Les deux groupes utilisaient leur expertise et leurs qualifications m\u00e9dicales pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Pourtant, seuls les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux sont reconnus comme professionnels de la sant\u00e9 dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9 (SH) de la fonction publique, et seuls les conseillers re\u00e7oivent les avantages et la reconnaissance qui d\u00e9coulent de cette classification.\n[7] Les plaignants ont aussi \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 10 de la Loi. Pour ce faire, il doit y avoir une preuve cr\u00e9dible que l'intim\u00e9 applique une ligne de conduite susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi d'un individu.\n[8] La preuve des plaignants \u00e9tayait l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il s'agissait d'une ligne de conduite susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi des plaignants au service des intim\u00e9s que de consid\u00e9rer le travail des plaignants comme \u00e9tant fondamentalement diff\u00e9rent de celui des conseillers.\n[9] Le fardeau est ensuite pass\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s, qui devaient justifier les actes qui, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, \u00e9taient discriminatoires.\n[10] Les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une explication raisonnable qui a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 une partie de la preuve prima facie des plaignants, mais qui n'a pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve en entier. Bien qu'il y ait un chevauchement marqu\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches dans les deux postes, il existe aussi certaines diff\u00e9rences importantes. Dans la t\u00e2che commune d'examen de l'admissibilit\u00e9, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont un r\u00f4le de supervision et de consultation que les \u00e9valuateurs n'ont pas. Il y a donc certaines diff\u00e9rences entre les t\u00e2ches accomplies par les conseillers et celles accomplies par les \u00e9valuateurs. Ces diff\u00e9rences expliquent les distinctions dans les titres de postes et certaines des diff\u00e9rences en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et d'avantages sociaux.\n[11] Cependant, les diff\u00e9rences ne sont pas assez importantes pour expliquer la grande diff\u00e9rence de traitement et, en particulier, elles n'expliquent pas pourquoi les conseillers sont reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et que les \u00e9valuateurs ne le sont pas. La t\u00e2che principale des deux postes est d'appliquer leurs connaissances professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 d'une personne aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas justifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on raisonnable et non discriminatoire la raison pour laquelle cette t\u00e2che constitue du travail m\u00e9dical lorsque les conseillers l'effectuent, et du travail d'administration de programme lorsque ce sont les \u00e9valuateurs qui le font.\n[12] De plus, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas prouv\u00e9 que la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux comme professionnels de la sant\u00e9 dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9 leur causerait une contrainte excessive. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es.\nIII. QUELLES SONT LES CIRCONSTANCES QUI ONT DONN\u00c9 LIEU \u00c0 LA PLAINTE? [13] En 1966, le R\u00e9gime de pension du Canada (le RPC ou le R\u00e9gime) est entr\u00e9 en vigueur. En plus des prestations de retraite, le R\u00e9gime offrait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 aux travailleurs. Une personne \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 si elle avait contribu\u00e9 au RPC pendant au moins cinq ans et si elle souffrait d'une invalidit\u00e9 mentale ou physique grave et prolong\u00e9e.\n[14] Vers 1971, des m\u00e9decins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 des demandeurs aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Il y avait tellement de demandes que les m\u00e9decins \u00e9taient incapables de toutes les traiter avec diligence. Un arri\u00e9r\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'accumuler. Par cons\u00e9quent, en 1972, le directeur du programme a embauch\u00e9 des infirmi\u00e8res et des infirmiers pour qu'ils aident les m\u00e9decins \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9.\n[15] Il est n\u00e9cessaire d'utiliser des connaissances m\u00e9dicales pour bien comprendre et \u00e9valuer les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui d'une demande, afin de d\u00e9terminer si la personne peut recevoir des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Tant les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont toujours utilis\u00e9 leurs connaissances professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Ni l'un ni l'autre poste ne n\u00e9cessite la prestation de soins directs \u00e0 un patient.\n[16] Le fait que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux utilisent leurs connaissances professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 est reconnu par la classification de leur poste dans la fonction publique du Canada. Le fait que les infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers utilisent leurs connaissances professionnelles en soins infirmiers n'est pas reconnu dans leur classification.\n[17] La classification des postes \u00e0 la fonction publique est importante. Elle d\u00e9termine, entre autres, la reconnaissance professionnelle, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux, ainsi que les possibilit\u00e9s de formation continue et d'avancement professionnel auxquels le titulaire du poste aura droit. Les postes sont class\u00e9s selon leur fonction principale. Ils sont d'abord inscrits dans un groupe professionnel, qui est un ensemble de postes regroup\u00e9s en fonction de t\u00e2ches communes ou de travail semblable. Dans un groupe professionnel, les normes de classification pr\u00e9cisent le type de travail qui est effectu\u00e9 dans ce groupe. Par exemple, dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9 (SH), il y a, entre autres, la norme de classification groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) et la norme de classification groupe M\u00e9decine (MD). Dans le groupe Services des programmes et de l'administration (PA), il y a, entre autres, la norme de classification groupe Administration des programmes (PM).\n[18] Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont la classification MD dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9. La d\u00e9finition de ce groupe comprend les postes pour lesquels le titulaire doit appliquer ses connaissances en m\u00e9decine ou en sciences infirmi\u00e8res (entre autres sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s professionnelles) \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des personnes. Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont toujours fait partie de ce groupe parce que la d\u00e9finition de conseiller m\u00e9dical a toujours compris les postes dont le titulaire est responsable principalement d'\u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 d'autres prestations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[19] Les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont toujours eu la classification PM dans le groupe Services des programmes et de l'administration (PA). Ce groupe comprend des postes dont les titulaires ont comme t\u00e2ches principales la planification, l'\u00e9laboration, la prestation ou la gestion de programmes administratifs et f\u00e9d\u00e9raux pour le public. Les postes du groupe PA n'ont pas pour objectif l'application de connaissances approfondies de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s professionnelles telles que les sciences infirmi\u00e8res ou la m\u00e9decine.\n[20] Depuis 1988 jusqu'\u00e0 tout r\u00e9cemment, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnu comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 par la classification de leur poste dans le groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) des Services de sant\u00e9. Ces tentatives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuses. Au cours des ann\u00e9es, les intim\u00e9s le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'Agence de gestion des ressources humaines de la fonction publique du Canada (AGRHFPC, maintenant l'AFPC) ont entrepris un certain nombre d'examens de la classification et, chaque fois, la classification du poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical au sein du groupe PM a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e.\n[21] En 2004, Ruth Walden a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. De 2004 \u00e0 2007, 430 autres \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui portaient sur les m\u00eames actes discriminatoires et qui demandaient les m\u00eames r\u00e9parations.\n[22] La majorit\u00e9 des plaignants \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat \u00e0 l'audience. Environ 17 plaignants n'\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience. Des repr\u00e9sentants r\u00e9gionaux ont fourni les renseignements au sujet de l'audience aux plaignants qui n'\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat.\nIV. QUEL EST LE CADRE TEMPOREL APPROPRI\u00c9 POUR LES PLAINTES? [23] Chaque plaignant soutient que l'acte discriminatoire a d\u00e9but\u00e9 \u00e0 sa date d'embauche et qu'il a continu\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui (s'il travaille toujours pour le Programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC) ou jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 son emploi pour le R\u00e9gime s'est termin\u00e9.\n[24] L'avocat de certains plaignants a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une liste de dates d'embauche pour les plaignants qu'il repr\u00e9sentait. La date la plus ancienne est ao\u00fbt 1979, alors que la plus r\u00e9cente est f\u00e9vrier 2007. Les dates d'embauche des plaignants qui n'\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal. Albina Elliot, l'une des premi\u00e8res infirmi\u00e8res embauch\u00e9es en 1972, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. L'avocat de certains des plaignants a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Elliot avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte. Cependant, son nom n'appara\u00eet pas sur la liste des plaignants que la Commission et l'avocat des plaignants ont fait parvenir au Tribunal.\n[25] Pendant l'audience, l'avocat de certains des plaignants a soutenu que, bien que sur les formulaires de plaintes, il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit que l'acte discriminatoire a d\u00e9but\u00e9 lorsque les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s, le Tribunal peut et devrait conclure que l'acte contest\u00e9 a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 1972, lorsque la premi\u00e8re infirmi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e et qu'elle a obtenu la classification PM.\n[26] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cet argument.\n[27] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en mars 1978. La jurisprudence des Cours et du Tribunal est constante : la LCDP ne s'applique pas de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive aux actes et aux lignes de conduite qui existaient avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi ou de ses modifications (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 20; Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel Canada), [2001] CCDP no 1, CT 1\/01, au paragraphe 233, cit\u00e9e avec approbation dans Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 50).\n[28] Dans Latif c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, [1980] 1 C.F. 687, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la nouvelle LCDP avait une application r\u00e9troactive tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e. Elle s'appliquait aux actes qui avaient d\u00e9but\u00e9s avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi et qui avaient continu\u00e9 pendant quelques temps apr\u00e8s qu'elle soit entr\u00e9e en vigueur (Latif, au paragraphe 34). Cela visait \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la Commission de traiter les plaintes qui \u00e9taient en instance lorsque la Loi est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. La Cour a conclu que, de cette fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e, la Loi pouvait avoir une application r\u00e9troactive pour les actes discriminatoires qui ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 avant que la Loi entre en vigueur, mais qui se sont poursuivis jusqu'\u00e0 la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur ou peu apr\u00e8s celle-ci. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 qu'autrement, la LCDP n'a pas d'application r\u00e9troactive. (Au sujet de l'application r\u00e9troactive limit\u00e9e en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, voir : Dell Computer Corp. c. Union des consommateurs, 2007 CSC 34, au paragraphe 113.)\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la responsabilit\u00e9 possible des intim\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce se limite aux actes et aux lignes de conduite qui existent depuis l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LCDP.\n[30] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que la responsabilit\u00e9 possible pour les actes ou les lignes de conduite discriminatoires devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 un an avant que Mme Walden d\u00e9pose sa plainte. Cela limiterait la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9tendant de 2003 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui. Sur ce fondement, le Tribunal devrait rejeter les plaintes des plaignants qui ont quitt\u00e9 leur emploi pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC avant 2003.\n[31] \u00c0 mon avis, il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 de le faire. Selon moi, il est important d'\u00e9tablir une distinction entre la d\u00e9termination de la responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s au sujet des actes discriminatoires au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi, et l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal, en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, lui permettant d'indemniser les victimes pour les pertes r\u00e9sultant des actes discriminatoires. Ces questions sont connexes, mais distinctes. La responsabilit\u00e9 au sujet des actes discriminatoires devrait, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00eatre examin\u00e9e s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de la question de l'indemnit\u00e9 qui pourrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e apr\u00e8s qu'aura \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e la question de la responsabilit\u00e9.\n[32] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants soutiennent qu'il y a eu discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Cette discrimination, par sa nature m\u00eame, s'\u00e9tend sur une certaine p\u00e9riode et ne peut \u00eatre isol\u00e9e sous forme d'acte ou de d\u00e9claration unique (Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale) (NFP), [1996] 3 C.F. 789, au paragraphe 16). Pour ce motif, il n'est pas appropri\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce de fixer une date arbitraire \u00e0 partir de laquelle l'acte discriminatoire aurait d\u00e9but\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9. Le Tribunal doit plut\u00f4t examiner la preuve et conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, s'il y a eu acte discriminatoire et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quand cet acte a eu lieu.\n[33] Cela ne veut cependant pas dire que le Tribunal ne peut pas imposer de limite aux pertes indemnisables caus\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire si les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es. En effet, dans l'arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), qui permet au Tribunal d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes, laisse aussi au Tribunal la possibilit\u00e9 d'imposer une limite \u00e0 ces pertes caus\u00e9es par un acte discriminatoire. \u00c0 mon avis, c'\u00e9tait dans le contexte de l'examen du caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal, pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 53(2), que la Cour, dans la d\u00e9cision NFP, a statu\u00e9 que, pour cette affaire, il \u00e9tait raisonnable de limiter l'indemnisation des pertes de salaire \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Cependant, \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape de l'examen de la responsabilit\u00e9, il ne convient pas d'imposer une limite d'un an.\n[34] Pour tous ces motifs, le Tribunal examinera la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de mars 1978 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui. N\u00e9anmoins, pour les fins limit\u00e9es d'analyse du travail qui \u00e9tait, et est toujours, effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, et des circonstances qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9, il est n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner l'historique complet de l'affaire, de 1972 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui.\nV. QUEL EST LE PROCESSUS \u00c0 SUIVRE POUR D\u00c9TERMINER L'ADMISSIBILIT\u00c9 AUX PRESTATIONS D'INVALIDIT\u00c9 DU RPC? [35] Il est utile, pour comprendre les questions en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce, de conna\u00eetre les principes de base du processus servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Il y a deux crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9 : le demandeur doit avoir suffisamment contribu\u00e9 au RPC et son invalidit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre grave et prolong\u00e9e.\n[36] Le processus servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e9tait, et est toujours, le suivant :\nune personne pr\u00e9sente une demande de prestations; une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision est prise quant \u00e0 l'octroi des prestations en fonction des crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9; si la demande est rejet\u00e9e, le demandeur peut pr\u00e9senter une demande de r\u00e9examen de la d\u00e9cision; si les prestations sont refus\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen, le demandeur peut interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision au Tribunal de r\u00e9vision (TR) (anciennement le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision); si le TR rend une fois de plus une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable au sujet des prestations, le demandeur peut demander l'autorisation d'interjeter appel \u00e0 la Commission d'appel des pensions (CAP); si le TR accorde les prestations au demandeur, le ministre responsable du programme du RPC peut demander une autorisation de pourvoi de la d\u00e9cision du TR; le demandeur et le ministre peuvent tous deux pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la CAP; \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape du processus, le demandeur peut pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux renseignements, m\u00e9dicaux ou non, ou des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires. Le d\u00e9cideur qui en est saisi examine les renseignements afin de d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\n[37] Le graphique d'acheminement suivant peut aider \u00e0 visualiser le processus servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Il est cependant important de garder \u00e0 l'esprit que 90 p. 100 des demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC sont tranch\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de la d\u00e9cision initiale ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de r\u00e9examen. Peu de cas font l'objet d'un appel aupr\u00e8s du TR ou de la CAP. Encore moins de cas font l'objet de demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\nD\u00e9cision -> R\u00e9examen -> Tribunal -> Commission d'appel -> Cour d'appel initiale de r\u00e9vision des pensions f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\nVI. QUELS SONT LES CRIT\u00c8RES AUXQUELS IL FAUT SATISFAIRE POUR \u00c9TABLIR UNE PREUVE PRIMA FACIE DE DISCRIMINATION AU SENS DES ARTICLES 7 ET 10 DE LA LCDP? [38] L'article 7 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait [...] de [...] d\u00e9favoriser [un employ\u00e9] en cours d'emploi . Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 7, les plaignants doivent prouver qu'ils sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s en cours d'emploi en raison de leur sexe. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi, les plaignants doivent prouver l'existence de lignes de conduite, fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite, qui sont susceptibles d'annihiler leurs chances d'emploi.\n[39] La pr\u00e9sentation de statistiques prouvant qu'une ligne de conduite apparemment neutre a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur un grand nombre de membres d'un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Chapdelaine c. Air Canada, 1987 CanLII 102 (T.C.D.P.); appel interjet\u00e9 pour d'autres motifs (1991), 15 C.H.R.R. D\/22 (Trib. r\u00e9v. C.D.P), les deux plaignantes poss\u00e9daient toutes les qualit\u00e9s requises pour le poste de pilote pour Air Canada, sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la taille requise. Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 des preuves statistiques au sujet de la taille des hommes et des femmes dans la population en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et a conclu que, bien que le crit\u00e8re de la taille soit neutre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l'effet de son application \u00e9tait d'annihiler les chances d'emploi \u00e0 titre de pilote de 82 p. 100 de toutes les Canadiennes et de 11 p. 100 des Canadiens qui ont entre 20 et 29 ans. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que la ligne de conduite d\u00e9favorisait les femmes par rapport aux hommes. La preuve au sujet des cons\u00e9quences disproportionn\u00e9es de la ligne de conduite envers les femmes a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante pour \u00e9tablir prima facie qu'il y avait eu discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[40] Les observations de madame la juge L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de production du Qu\u00e9bec et de l'Acadie c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 879 (SEPQA), aux paragraphes 80 \u00e0 82, m\u00eame si elles faisaient partie de motifs dissidents et de remarques incidentes, sont utiles en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans cette affaire, la juge L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10, le recours \u00e0 des donn\u00e9es statistiques d\u00e9montrant l'existence d'une s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle est un outil des plus pr\u00e9cieux. La preuve dans SEPQA \u00e9tait qu'un groupe d'employ\u00e9s majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes \u00e9tait moins bien r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'un groupe d'employ\u00e9s majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes, alors que les deux groupes travaillaient dans des conditions semblables et qu'ils effectuaient des t\u00e2ches ayant le m\u00eame objectif. La juge L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'avis que cela suffisait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10, mais ne suffisait pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une telle preuve de discrimination au sens de l'article 11 de la LCDP. En vertu de l'article 11, un plaignant doit prouver que le travail est de valeur \u00e9gale, en plus de prouver qu'il y a eu s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation professionnelle.\n[41] Il ne s'agit pas en l'esp\u00e8ce d'une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants n'ont pas \u00e0 prouver que le travail est de valeur \u00e9gale pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En fait, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 7 de la LCDP, il suffit pour les plaignants de prouver qu'ils font partie d'un groupe d'employ\u00e9s majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes qui effectue des t\u00e2ches identiques ou des t\u00e2ches sensiblement \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles du groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, qui est majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes, et qu'ils sont pourtant d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s par rapport aux conseillers. Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 10, il suffit de prouver qu'une ligne de conduite a des cons\u00e9quences disproportionn\u00e9es sur les femmes parce qu'elle annihile leurs chances d'emploi contrairement aux hommes qui effectuent le m\u00eame travail ou un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent.\nVII. LES PLAIGNANTS ONT-ILS \u00c9TABLI UNE PREUVE PRIMA FACIE DE DISCRIMINATION AU SENS DE L'ARTICLE 7 DE LA LCDP? (i) Quel est le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9? [42] Le groupe comparateur appropri\u00e9 fait implicitement partie du crit\u00e8re permettant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie : il s'agit du groupe d'employ\u00e9s majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes qui effectue un travail identique, ou un travail sensiblement \u00e9quivalent, \u00e0 celui des plaignants, soit le groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Dans le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, il n'y a aucun autre groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes qui effectue un travail qui pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant identique ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalent au travail des \u00e9valuateurs.\n(ii) Quelle est la preuve au sujet de la pr\u00e9dominance d'un sexe dans le groupe professionnel? [43] Avant d'\u00eatre embauch\u00e9s, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux doivent prouver qu'ils ont un permis d'exercer \u00e0 titre d'infirmi\u00e8re ou d'infirmier autoris\u00e9 au Canada. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 que 95 p. 100 des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers sont des femmes. Comme il y a pr\u00e9dominance des femmes dans le domaine des sciences infirmi\u00e8res et qu'il faut pr\u00e9senter un permis de pratiquer avant de pouvoir \u00eatre embauch\u00e9 comme \u00e9valuateur, il s'ensuit qu'il y a une majorit\u00e9 \u00e9crasante de femmes titulaires du poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical. Les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pr\u00e9sentement, 95 p. 100 des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux sont des femmes.\n[44] Selon la preuve des intim\u00e9s, 80 p. 100 des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux sont des hommes.\n(iii) Quelle est la preuve \u00e9tablissant que le travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux est identique ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux? [45] Il y a trois p\u00e9riodes distinctes en l'esp\u00e8ce, marqu\u00e9es par des \u00e9v\u00e9nements importants qui ont affect\u00e9 la nature du travail des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. La preuve prima facie sera analys\u00e9e en fonction de ce cadre temporel.\n1972-1989\n[46] De 1972 \u00e0 1989, les d\u00e9cisions finales au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e9taient rendues par le directeur du programme d'invalidit\u00e9, en fonction des recommandations d'une commission d'\u00e9valuation de l'invalidit\u00e9. La commission \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e d'au moins deux personnes et l'une d'elles devait \u00eatre un m\u00e9decin d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9 (R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, R\u00e8glements codifi\u00e9s du Canada 1978, ch. 385, art. 71(1)).\n[47] Albina Elliott, l'une des premi\u00e8res infirmi\u00e8res embauch\u00e9es en 1972, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tant les \u00e9valuateurs que les conseillers \u00e9valuaient les demandes et signaient les recommandations au directeur. Lorsque les demandes arrivaient, elles \u00e9taient plac\u00e9es dans des dossiers sur des \u00e9tag\u00e8res. Les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux se rendaient aux \u00e9tag\u00e8res et prenaient le premier dossier en vue, peu importe la complexit\u00e9 du cas. Le conseiller ou l'\u00e9valuateur examinait alors le dossier et recommandait d'accorder ou non les prestations. Mme Elliott a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuateurs devaient faire approuver leurs recommandations par les conseillers.\n[48] Alfred Gregory, un m\u00e9decin qui travaille comme conseiller m\u00e9dical pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC depuis 1980, a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux devaient approuver les recommandations des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Il a cependant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient des coll\u00e8gues; le jugement professionnel et les recommandations des \u00e9valuateurs au sujet des dossiers \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9s.\n[49] Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et les conseillers avaient la m\u00eame fonction premi\u00e8re pendant cette p\u00e9riode : \u00e9valuer les demandes et formuler des recommandations au sujet des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour effectuer cette fonction premi\u00e8re, des connaissances, de la formation et de l'exp\u00e9rience en m\u00e9decine avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires, tant pour les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux que pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. \u00c0 l'occasion, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux donnaient des conseils aux \u00e9valuateurs pour les dossiers compliqu\u00e9s.\n[50] Le Dr Gregory a expliqu\u00e9 que depuis la mise en place du programme, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont graduellement c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux leur travail d'examen de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations. Au d\u00e9but, seuls les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux s'occupaient de l'\u00e9valuation initiale. Puis, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s et ils se sont aussi occup\u00e9s des \u00e9valuations initiales. Par la suite, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux se sont r\u00e9orient\u00e9s vers les t\u00e2ches de r\u00e9examen des dossiers et de pr\u00e9paration pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision. Cependant, au fil des ans, ces t\u00e2ches ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es aux \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux.\n[51] Le Dr Gregory a donn\u00e9 comme exemple le fait qu'avant 1983, seuls les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9paraient les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des dossiers qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision. Ce comit\u00e9, compos\u00e9 de trois membres de la collectivit\u00e9, entendait les appels de d\u00e9cisions portant sur le r\u00e9examen. Les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des dossiers pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision donnaient un bref aper\u00e7u de la chronologie du dossier, expliquaient les questions m\u00e9dicales, r\u00e9sumaient la jurisprudence et pr\u00e9sentaient au comit\u00e9 une recommandation au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 du demandeur.\n[52] Vers 1982, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont mentionn\u00e9 qu'ils n'aimaient pas pr\u00e9parer les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers. On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Elliott de prendre en charge cette t\u00e2che. Un conseiller m\u00e9dical lui a donn\u00e9 la formation n\u00e9cessaire et, en avril 1983, elle est devenue enti\u00e8rement responsable de la pr\u00e9paration des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers. Elle n'avait pas \u00e0 faire approuver les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s par un conseiller m\u00e9dical avant de les envoyer au Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision. Par la suite, d'autres infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour aider Mme Elliott \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers.\n[53] Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsque les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux s'occupaient des d\u00e9cisions initiales, des r\u00e9examens et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision, il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les fonctions des deux groupes. Lorsque Mme Elliott effectuait ces t\u00e2ches, elle avait la classification d'administrateur de programme (PM), alors que le Dr Gregory, pour les m\u00eames t\u00e2ches, avait la classification de m\u00e9decin agr\u00e9\u00e9 (MD).\n1989-1999\n[54] En 1989, des changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s au R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Ces changements permettaient \u00e0 un \u00e9valuateur de rendre des d\u00e9cisions finales au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 (R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime des pensions du Canada, modification DORS\/89-345, art. 7 de l'annexe). Le nouveau R\u00e8glement, qui est toujours en vigueur, comprend un R\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l'\u00e9tude d'impact de la r\u00e9glementation qui \u00e9nonce que l'\u00e9valuation et la d\u00e9cision finale relatives aux demandes sont effectu\u00e9es par des \u00e9valuateurs ayant ce type de formation, en plus d'une formation en qualit\u00e9 de professionnel de la sant\u00e9 (par exemple, une infirmi\u00e8re, un technicien m\u00e9dical) et poss\u00e9dant de l'exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'\u00e9valuation de l'invalidit\u00e9 (Programme des accident\u00e9s au travail, R\u00e9gime de rentes du Qu\u00e9bec). Pour les cas contest\u00e9s, on peut en tout temps consulter un m\u00e9decin du personnel (DORS\/89-345 : Gazette du Canada, partie II, vol. 123, no 15).\n[55] M\u00eame si le R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9cisait que les \u00e9valuateurs rendraient la d\u00e9cision finale au sujet des demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9, la preuve montre que, de 1989 \u00e0 environ 1999, tant les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux continuaient de rendre des d\u00e9cisions finales pour les demandes initiales et pour les r\u00e9examens. Les deux groupes pouvaient prendre des d\u00e9cisions finales sans qu'il ne soit n\u00e9cessaire d'obtenir la signature ou l'approbation d'une autre personne.\n[56] Vers 1996, le traitement des demandes initiales et des r\u00e9examens a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gionalis\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, de 1996 \u00e0 1999, la plupart des d\u00e9cisions, qui relevaient jadis uniquement du pouvoir des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, \u00e9taient d\u00e9sormais rendues dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux par des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Il n'y avait aucun conseiller m\u00e9dical dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux. Cependant, il y avait toujours des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 Ottawa, qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions finales au sujet de demandes initiales et de r\u00e9examens jusqu'en 1999.\n[57] En 1988, la Division de l'expertise m\u00e9dicale (DEM) \u00e0 Ottawa a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e afin de traiter les appels interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission d'appel des pensions (CAP) et de donner des conseils m\u00e9dicaux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s au sujet des dossiers complexes. Tant les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux travaillaient \u00e0 la DEM pour pr\u00e9parer les audiences de la CAP. La Commission d'appel des pensions \u00e9tait, et est toujours, compos\u00e9e de trois juges qui rendent une d\u00e9cision sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 au dernier stade de la proc\u00e9dure d'appel dans le programme des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux t\u00e9moignent sous serment ou sous affirmation solennelle devant la CAP au sujet des questions m\u00e9dicales du dossier.\n[58] Ruth Walden, l'une des plaignantes, a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 1993 au poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical dans la DEM. Elle y travaille toujours. Mme Walden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les m\u00e9decins et les infirmiers et infirmi\u00e8res \u00e0 la DEM travaillaient ensemble \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration des dossiers pour les audiences devant la CAP. Ce travail comprend l'examen du dossier, la demande de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, et la prise d'une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si le dossier doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 avant d'\u00eatre envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la CAP.\n[59] Le Dr Gregory et Mme Walden ont soutenu que la fonction principale des \u00e9valuateurs et des conseillers dans la DEM et dans les r\u00e9gions pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e9tait d'appliquer leurs connaissances approfondies en m\u00e9decine pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations du RPC. Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre le travail des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux qui, dans les r\u00e9gions, rendaient une d\u00e9cision finale sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 et le travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 Ottawa, qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions finales sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n1999 - pr\u00e9sent\n[60] \u00c0 partir de 1999, tous les postes de conseillers m\u00e9dicaux pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC ont migr\u00e9 \u00e0 la DEM. Depuis ce temps, la d\u00e9cision finale au sujet des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen est rendue par les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Au Manitoba et en Saskatchewan, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux repr\u00e9sentent le ministre dans les audiences devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision (TR). Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ne participent \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de l'invalidit\u00e9 que lorsqu'on leur demande des conseils ou lorsqu'il y a un arri\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le traitement des demandes. Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ne donnent des conseils que dans 1 ou 2 p. 100 des dossiers \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen ou \u00e0 l'audience devant le TR. Les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s sont rares.\n[61] Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, depuis 1999, la majorit\u00e9 du travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 la DEM porte sur la pr\u00e9paration des audiences de la CAP et leur pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 ces audiences. Ils doivent effectuer un examen approfondi du dossier, pr\u00e9parer un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du dossier et t\u00e9moigner sous serment ou sous affirmation solennelle devant la CAP.\n[62] Depuis 1999, l'une des plaignantes, Elizabeth Franklin, repr\u00e9sente le ministre responsable du programme des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision du Manitoba et de la Saskatchewan. Avant de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une audience devant le TR, Mme Franklin pr\u00e9pare un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du dossier pour le tribunal, qui comprend une analyse des questions m\u00e9dicales et juridiques du dossier. Elle se pr\u00e9sente ensuite devant le tribunal, interroge les t\u00e9moins et r\u00e9pond aux questions du tribunal. Mme Franklin explique au tribunal la position du ministre et les questions m\u00e9dicales relatives au dossier. Elle rel\u00e8ve les incoh\u00e9rences dans les t\u00e9moignages. Mme Franklin a le pouvoir d'offrir une entente, sans obtenir d'approbation au pr\u00e9alable, au demandeur avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience si elle est d'avis que le dossier du demandeur est solide.\n[63] On a lu \u00e0 Mme Franklin la description du travail que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux font en vue de se pr\u00e9parer et de se pr\u00e9senter devant la CAP. Elle a soutenu que, sauf le fait qu'ils t\u00e9moignent sous serment ou affirmation solennelle, le travail qu'elle fait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du TR est le m\u00eame que celui des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience devant la CAP. Tant les conseillers que les \u00e9valuateurs pr\u00e9sentent la position du ministre \u00e0 l'audience; ils doivent tous deux expliquer le fondement de la d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente qui fait l'objet de l'appel et ils doivent tous deux expliquer aux d\u00e9cideurs l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, la terminologie et les diagnostics.\n[64] Le Dr Gregory a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, dans la Division de l'expertise m\u00e9dicale (DEM), tant les conseillers que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux travaillent sur les dossiers qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la CAP. Il a soutenu que la principale fonction des deux postes au sein de la DEM est l'examen de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations.\n[65] Tant les conseillers que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux peuvent participer aux activit\u00e9s de relations externes et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques. Le Dr Gregory travaille avec d'autres conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration et \u00e0 l'analyse de politiques. Ruth Walden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle connaissait au moins un \u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical qui travaillait dans le domaine de l'\u00e9laboration de politiques. La description de poste des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9cise que les \u00e9valuateurs peuvent faire partie d'\u00e9quipes qui travaillent \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de formations et de politiques, ou diriger de telles \u00e9quipes.\n[66] Le Dr Gregory s'occupe d'activit\u00e9s de relations externes et de r\u00e9seautage avec d'autres sections du gouvernement et avec des associations professionnelles et m\u00e9dicales. La description de poste des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9cise que les \u00e9valuateurs peuvent aussi repr\u00e9senter le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC lors de consultations avec des clients ou des intervenants cl\u00e9s internes et externes (y compris les d\u00e9put\u00e9s, la collectivit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, les repr\u00e9sentants de compagnies d'assurance, les groupes d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et le public canadien) pour fournir des connaissances techniques approfondies sur les questions portant sur l'admissibilit\u00e9 au programme et sur les questions m\u00e9dicales.\n(iv) Conclusions au sujet de la similitude entre le travail des \u00e9valuateurs et celui des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. [67] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis convaincue que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que le travail qu'ils effectuent depuis mars 1978, et qu'ils effectuent encore \u00e0 ce jour, est identique ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux.\n[68] La preuve des plaignants d\u00e9montrait que, depuis la cr\u00e9ation du programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, la principale responsabilit\u00e9 et fonction des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux autant que des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux est l'utilisation de leur expertise et de leurs connaissances professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes du processus et\/ou de pr\u00e9parer les dossiers pour les appels et de repr\u00e9senter le ministre lors des audiences.\n[69] Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, tant les conseillers que les \u00e9valuateurs ont assum\u00e9 les fonctions suivantes \u00e0 divers moments pendant les trois p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9crites dans la plainte :\nformuler des recommandations et prendre des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de demandes initiales dont le degr\u00e9 de complexit\u00e9 et de difficult\u00e9s en termes de questions m\u00e9dicales et juridiques varie; formuler des recommandations et prendre des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de demandes de r\u00e9examen qui ont aussi divers degr\u00e9s de complexit\u00e9 et de difficult\u00e9; pr\u00e9parer les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision, qui a ensuite pris le nom de Tribunal de r\u00e9vision; demander aux demandeurs ou \u00e0 d'autres personnes des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et non m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet de demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC; pr\u00e9parer un dossier pour la Commission d'appel des pensions; pr\u00e9senter une offre de r\u00e8glement ou une recommandation de r\u00e8glement (sans obtenir d'approbation au pr\u00e9alable); participer aux activit\u00e9s de relation externes et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques.\n[70] Au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes, le temps que les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs ont consacr\u00e9 aux fonctions qui se chevauchaient s'est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 d'un poste \u00e0 l'autre. Cependant, la preuve d\u00e9montre que, de 1972 \u00e0 1999, des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux avaient pour fonction principale la formulation de recommandations ou la prise de d\u00e9cisions finales au sujet de demandes initiales et de demandes de r\u00e9examen, ainsi que la pr\u00e9paration de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision. Les t\u00e2ches portant sur les demandes initiales et les demandes de r\u00e9examen repr\u00e9sentent une grande partie du travail des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs puisque plus de 90 p. 100 de toutes les demandes sont tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 l'une de ces deux \u00e9tapes. Au fil du temps, plus d'\u00e9valuateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont pass\u00e9 moins de temps \u00e0 traiter les demandes \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale, \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du TR, et ont pass\u00e9 de plus en plus de temps \u00e0 traiter les appels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la CAP. Cependant, de 1972 \u00e0 1999, il y a toujours eu des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs qui ont occup\u00e9 essentiellement les m\u00eames fonctions d'examen de l'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen, et qui ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le TR.\n[71] Depuis 1999, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux dans les r\u00e9gions effectuent essentiellement le m\u00eame travail que les conseillers ont effectu\u00e9 de 1972 \u00e0 1999 : rendre une d\u00e9cision finale au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen.\n[72] Aussi, depuis 1999, les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux effectuent \u00e0 la DEM des t\u00e2ches semblables quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de dossiers pour les audiences devant la CAP. La pr\u00e9paration des dossiers et la pr\u00e9sentation de ceux-ci au Tribunal de r\u00e9vision, dont les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux s'occupent au Manitoba depuis 1999, ressemble consid\u00e9rablement au travail que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux effectuent lorsqu'ils pr\u00e9parent les dossiers et qu'ils t\u00e9moignent devant la Commission d'appel des pensions.\n(v) Quel est le traitement diff\u00e9rent? a) La reconnaissance professionnelle [73] Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 en vertu du syst\u00e8me de classification de la fonction publique, alors que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ne le sont pas. Bien que ni l'un ni l'autre poste ne comprenne la prestation de soins \u00e0 des patients, leurs titulaires doivent tous deux poss\u00e9der des connaissances professionnelles au sujet de maladies causant une invalidit\u00e9 permanente.\n[74] Les connaissances requises pour l'exercice d'une fonction ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas pertinentes quant \u00e0 l'attribution d'un poste en particulier \u00e0 un groupe professionnel dans le syst\u00e8me de classification de la fonction publique. Cependant, en ce qui a trait au groupe Services de sant\u00e9, la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonce express\u00e9ment que, pour que des postes soient class\u00e9s dans ce groupe, ils doivent \u00eatre principalement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'application de la connaissance approfondie de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s professionnelles dans les domaines [...] de la m\u00e9decine, des soins infirmiers (entre autres) \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des personnes .\n[75] Le fait que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux appliquent leurs connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es professionnelles pertinentes en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9termination de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations du RPC a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 refl\u00e9t\u00e9 par leur classification dans le groupe MD du groupe Services de sant\u00e9. Cependant, le fait que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux appliquent leurs connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es professionnelles pertinentes n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 refl\u00e9t\u00e9 par leur classification dans le groupe Administrateur de programme (PM) du groupe Administration de programme (PA).\nb) R\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avantages [76] Mme Walden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 plus ou moins le double de celle des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et que les conseillers re\u00e7oivent une prime annuelle de continuit\u00e9 d'emploi que les \u00e9valuateurs ne re\u00e7oivent pas. La diff\u00e9rence de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration se r\u00e9percute dans les prestations de retraite, qui sont moins \u00e9lev\u00e9es pour les \u00e9valuateurs par rapport aux conseillers.\n[77] Mme Walden a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, y compris les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, ont toujours eu plus de jours de vacances que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Les intim\u00e9s ne contestent pas ce fait.\nc) Paiement des honoraires professionnels et possibilit\u00e9s d'\u00e9ducation et de formation [78] L'intim\u00e9 D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (DSC) paye annuellement les droits de permis pour les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. L'argent pour ce paiement n'est pas tir\u00e9 du budget de formation et d'\u00e9ducation pr\u00e9vu pour les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux qui travaillent pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RCP.\n[79] Par contre, jusqu'en 1999, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux payaient leurs propres droits de permis d'infirmier et d'infirmi\u00e8re et n'\u00e9taient pas rembours\u00e9s par DSC. Ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 ce sujet et, en 1999, DSC a accept\u00e9 de payer les droits des \u00e9valuateurs en puisant dans le budget de formation. Mme Walden a expliqu\u00e9 que le paiement des droits des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 m\u00eame le budget de formation laissait moins d'argent pour les possibilit\u00e9s de formation continue pour les \u00e9valuateurs. On lui a dit qu'il ne restait pas d'argent pour la formation continue. Elle a soutenu que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, quant \u00e0 eux, pouvaient participer \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement; il ne semblait pas manquer de fonds pour leurs activit\u00e9s de formation continue.\nd) Avancement professionnel [80] Mme Walden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 titre de PM, ses chances d'obtenir un emploi comme infirmi\u00e8re au gouvernement n'\u00e9taient pas aussi bonnes que si elle avait la classification de professionnel de la sant\u00e9, comme les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Les postes d'infirmi\u00e8res exigent une exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en sciences infirmi\u00e8res. Mme Walden a soutenu que, bien que les associations d'infirmier et infirmi\u00e8re dans tout le pays reconnaissent que les \u00e9valuateurs exercent la profession d'infirmiers et d'infirmi\u00e8res, la fonction publique du Canada ne le reconna\u00eet pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, si elle cherchait \u00e0 obtenir un poste d'infirmi\u00e8re au sein de la fonction publique, son travail \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical ne serait pas accept\u00e9 comme exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente en sciences infirmi\u00e8res.\n(vi) Conclusion : les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 7 [81] Je conclus que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli prima facie que, depuis mars 1978, ils sont trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes, qui effectuent des t\u00e2ches identiques ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux depuis la m\u00eame date.\nVIII. LES PLAIGNANTS ONT-ILS \u00c9TABLI UNE PREUVE PRIMA FACIE DE DISCRIMINATION AU SENS DE L'ARTICLE 10 DE LA LCDP? [82] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi, les plaignants doivent prouver l'existence de lignes de conduite, fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite, susceptibles d'annihiler leurs chances d'emploi.\n(i) Quelle est la ligne de conduite discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e? [83] Les plaignants soutiennent que les intim\u00e9s ont appliqu\u00e9 une ligne de conduite qui traitait les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs comme s'ils effectuaient des t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes et qui classifiait leurs postes de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\n[84] Comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli plus t\u00f4t, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la fonction principale des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs est l'application de leurs connaissances professionnelles \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d'un demandeur afin de d\u00e9terminer son admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Selon la d\u00e9finition du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, les deux postes devraient y \u00eatre classifi\u00e9s. Cependant, depuis 1972, lorsque la premi\u00e8re infirmi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AGRHFPC ont donn\u00e9 aux \u00e9valuateurs une classification dans le groupe Services des programmes et de l'administration (PA).\n[85] Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a toujours soutenu que le poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical ne correspond pas \u00e0 la norme de classification du groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, parce que la fonction principale d'un \u00e9valuateur n'est pas la prestation de soins directs \u00e0 un patient. La norme de classification NU pr\u00e9cise que le poste doit comprendre l'application de connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des personnes et, en particulier, les soins aux patients et le traitement et la gestion de la maladie en collaboration avec des m\u00e9decins.\n[86] En 2002, le sous-ministre adjoint du Programme de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du revenu a \u00e9crit une lettre au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor dans laquelle il expliquait que la norme de classification d\u00e9su\u00e8te, qui exigeait que les infirmiers et infirmi\u00e8res fournissent des soins de sant\u00e9 directs, ne refl\u00e9tait pas les nouvelles r\u00e9alit\u00e9s dans le domaine des sciences infirmi\u00e8res, soit que de nombreux infirmiers et infirmi\u00e8res praticiens ne fournissaient pas de soins de sant\u00e9 directs \u00e0 des patients. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la norme de classification NU devrait comprendre les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et il a propos\u00e9 qu'un poste-rep\u00e8re y soit ajout\u00e9 afin de faciliter l'inclusion des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux au groupe Services de sant\u00e9.\n[87] En mars 2004, DSC a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un dossier d'analyse dans une tentative de persuader l'AGRHFPC de cr\u00e9er un sous-groupe de Sciences infirmi\u00e8res qui permettrait aux \u00e9valuateurs de faire partie du groupe Services de sant\u00e9. Dans le dossier d'analyse, DSC expliquait que, lorsque le minist\u00e8re parle des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, il les appelle [traduction] professionnels de la sant\u00e9 . DSC a ajout\u00e9 que [traduction] le processus d'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale est complexe et exige des connaissances professionnelles, des aptitudes et du jugement en mati\u00e8re de sciences infirmi\u00e8res . De plus, les associations provinciales d'attribution de permis d'infirmiers et d'infirmi\u00e8res, ainsi que l'Association des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers du Canada, reconnaissent le travail d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical comme faisant partie de la pratique professionnelle des sciences infirmi\u00e8res.\n[88] En r\u00e9ponse au dossier d'analyse, l'AGRHFPC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que les connaissances en sciences m\u00e9dicales et infirmi\u00e8res soient importantes pour les postes d'\u00e9valuateurs, le but principal de ces postes est de fournir un programme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au public, et non d'appliquer des connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des personnes. L'AGRHFPC a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que l'agent n\u00e9gociateur n'avait pas approuv\u00e9 le dossier d'analyse ce qui, a-t-on soutenu, est l'un des pr\u00e9alables lorsqu'on examine la possibilit\u00e9 de changer les d\u00e9finitions des groupes professionnels.\n[89] En raison de cette qualification du travail des \u00e9valuateurs, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AGRHFPC ont continu\u00e9 l'application de la ligne de conduite, mise en place avant 1999, selon laquelle les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux rel\u00e8vent de la classification PM et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, de la classification MD.\n[90] La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si les intim\u00e9s avaient donn\u00e9 la classification d'infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers aux \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, plut\u00f4t que celle d'administrateurs de programme, une partie de la ligne de conduite discriminatoire aurait disparue parce que, comme les conseillers, les \u00e9valuateurs auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et auraient fait partie du groupe Services de sant\u00e9.\n[91] Cependant, l'avocat de la Commission a soutenu que la ligne de conduite discriminatoire en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce n'aurait pas compl\u00e8tement disparu par la classification des \u00e9valuateurs dans le groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res. La Commission et les plaignants sont d'avis que le d\u00e9faut des intim\u00e9s de reconna\u00eetre que les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers font le m\u00eame travail, et qu'ils devraient occuper le m\u00eame poste et \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence, constitue aussi une ligne de conduite discriminatoire.\n[92] Jusqu'\u00e0 r\u00e9cemment, les \u00e9valuateurs n'ont pas soutenu qu'ils faisaient le m\u00eame travail que les conseillers; ils soutenaient qu'ils exer\u00e7aient \u00e0 titre d'infirmiers et d'infirmi\u00e8res, tout comme les conseillers exer\u00e7aient \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9decins. Par cons\u00e9quent, la ligne de conduite des intim\u00e9s qui s\u00e9parait les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs en deux postes distincts, dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des pr\u00e9sentes plaintes.\n[93] Selon la Commission, le fait que les plaignants n'ont soutenu que r\u00e9cemment qu'ils faisaient le m\u00eame travail que les conseillers n'est d'aucune importance. La Loi n'exige pas qu'il soit \u00e9tabli que les intim\u00e9s savaient que les lignes de conduite contest\u00e9es avaient un effet discriminatoire ou qu'ils auraient d\u00fb le savoir. Si le r\u00e9sultat des lignes de conduite est d'annihiler les avantages en mati\u00e8re d'emploi d'un groupe sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite, alors peu importe le fait que les intim\u00e9s aient eu connaissance de la nature de leurs actions ou non, il sera conclu qu'ils ont contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi. La question de la connaissance ou de l'intention n'est pertinente qu'en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de l'indemnisation pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n[94] Je suis du m\u00eame avis que la Commission \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[95] Je conclus que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli prima facie que, depuis 1972, les intim\u00e9s ont appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite qui traitent les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs comme s'ils effectuaient des t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes, m\u00eame si leurs t\u00e2ches sont sensiblement \u00e9quivalentes, et qu'ils leur attribuent par cons\u00e9quent une classification diff\u00e9rente.\n(ii) Quelles sont les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement dont les plaignants ont cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s? [96] Les plaignants soutiennent que les lignes de conduite des intim\u00e9s les ont priv\u00e9s des avantages suivants : (i) la reconnaissance \u00e0 titre de professionnels de la sant\u00e9; (ii) la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages sociaux \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 ceux des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux; (iii) le paiement des droits professionnels et les offres de possibilit\u00e9s d'\u00e9ducation et de formation auxquels les conseillers ont droit; (iv) les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement de carri\u00e8re \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Les avantages en mati\u00e8re d'emploi susmentionn\u00e9s constituent-ils des chances d'emploi ou d'avancement au sens de l'article 10 de la LCDP?\n[97] La version fran\u00e7aise de l'article 10 porte sur les lignes de conduite qui sont susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus . Lorsque les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise de l'article 10 sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es ensemble, on en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'expression chances d'emploi ou d'avancement vise les conditions qui permettent l'emploi ou l'avancement d'une personne dans son domaine.\n[98] La jurisprudence du Tribunal refl\u00e8te cette interpr\u00e9tation. Le Tribunal a utilis\u00e9 l'expression chances d'emploi ou d'avancement pour parler de possibilit\u00e9s de transfert \u00e0 un autre poste (Gauthier c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [1989] T.C.D.P. no 3 T.D. 3\/89); de possibilit\u00e9s de faire certains types de travail qui am\u00e9liorerait la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement de carri\u00e8re (O'Connell c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, [1988] T.C.D.P. no T.D. 9\/88); des possibilit\u00e9s de formation (Green c. Canada (Commission de la fonction publique), [1998] T.C.D.P. no T.D. 6\/98, contr\u00f4le judiciaire pour d'autres motifs : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green, [2000] 4 C.F. 629 (1re inst.)); et des possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi continu et ininterrompu (Hay c. Cameco, [1991] T.C.D.P. no 5 no T.D. 5\/91).\n[99] En l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que constituent des chances d'emploi ou d'avancement au sens de l'article 10 : la reconnaissance et la classification \u00e0 titre de professionnels de la sant\u00e9, le paiement des droits professionnels et les possibilit\u00e9s de formation et d'\u00e9ducation \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, ainsi que les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement de carri\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de professionnels de la sant\u00e9. Ces conditions affectent la capacit\u00e9 des plaignants d'am\u00e9liorer leur r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et leur potentiel professionnel au sein de la fonction publique. Pour ce motif, il s'agit de chances d'emploi ou d'avancement au sens de l'article 10 de la Loi.\n(iii) Conclusion : les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'article 10 [100] La preuve des plaignants qui \u00e9tablissait prima facie la discrimination au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9tablit aussi, prima facie, le fait que la ligne de conduite appliqu\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, d\u00e9crite ci-dessus, \u00e9tait susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement des plaignants. Le fait de qualifier le travail des \u00e9valuateurs comme \u00e9tant de l'administration de programme et de conclure que ce travail est diff\u00e9rent de celui des conseillers a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'annihilation des chances d'emploi et d'avancement pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, auxquelles les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ont droit.\n[101] Comme je l'ai not\u00e9, il suffit de prouver que la ligne de conduite a eu des cons\u00e9quences disproportionn\u00e9es sur les femmes pour \u00e9tablir un lien entre la ligne de conduite et le motif de distinction illicite. La preuve au sujet de la pr\u00e9dominance des femmes en sciences infirmi\u00e8res et, par extension, au poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical, \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie que la ligne de conduite annihilait les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement des plaignants sur la base de leur sexe.\nIX. QUELLE EST L'EXPLICATION DES INTIM\u00c9S? [102] Lorsqu'il est \u00e9tabli prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10, le fardeau est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s, qui doivent donner une explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire pour leur conduite.\n[103] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les explications suivantes au sujet des plaintes fond\u00e9es sur les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi :\nLe groupe de travailleurs majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes le plus appropri\u00e9 auquel le travail des \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales peut \u00eatre compar\u00e9 est le groupe des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux masculins. En comparant avec ce groupe, on peut conclure que les \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et d\u00e9favorable; Subsidiairement, si le Tribunal conclut que le groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux est le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9, le travail des conseillers est diff\u00e9rent de celui des \u00e9valuateurs. Toute diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs est enti\u00e8rement fond\u00e9e sur la diff\u00e9rence du travail effectu\u00e9, et non sur le sexe; \u00c9galement \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, si le Tribunal conclut que les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie au sens des deux dispositions de la Loi, le traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et les lignes de conduite sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es.\n(i) Le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 [104] Les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu que le groupe des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux masculins \u00e9tait le groupe de comparaison le plus appropri\u00e9 parce qu'ils ont des fonctions comparables \u00e0 celles des \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales et qu'ils atteignent des niveaux de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s comparables. Les intim\u00e9s ont encourag\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 se fonder sur la d\u00e9cision du tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique dans Prpich c. Pacific Shores Nature Resort Ltd., 2001 C.L.L.C. 230-035. Cette affaire portait sur une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 13 du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique, qui interdit \u00e0 l'employeur de payer un salaire diff\u00e9rent aux employ\u00e9s d'un certain sexe de celui qu'il paye aux employ\u00e9s de l'autre sexe s'ils font un [traduction] travail semblable ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalent . Le paragraphe 13(2) du Code de la Colombie-Britannique pr\u00e9voit que les notions de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es pour d\u00e9terminer si le travail est semblable ou sensiblement \u00e9quivalent.\n[105] Les articles 7 et 10 ne prescrivent pas les facteurs dont on doit tenir compte lorsqu'on examine si la conduite en cause \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Par comparaison, l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, comme l'article 13 du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique, \u00e9nonce les crit\u00e8res qui doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s afin de d\u00e9terminer si un employeur a commis un acte discriminatoire en instaurant ou en pratiquant la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Ces facteurs sont le dosage de qualifications, d'efforts et de responsabilit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaire pour l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, compte tenu des conditions de travail.\n[106] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision Prpich ne s'applique pas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Elle porte sur des dispositions d'une autre loi qui sont comparables \u00e0 l'article 11 de la LCDP plut\u00f4t qu'aux articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[107] De plus, l'argument des intim\u00e9s selon lequel le travail des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux masculins devrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 celui des \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales est d\u00e9raisonnable. Les \u00e9valuateurs masculins ne sont pas un groupe distinct, mais font plut\u00f4t partie du groupe, majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes, des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu de leur appartenance \u00e0 ce groupe, ils sont eux aussi touch\u00e9s par les diff\u00e9rences de traitement possibles entre les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. La comparaison de leur travail \u00e0 celui des \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales ne serait pas un indicateur valable du traitement \u00e9quitable de la grande majorit\u00e9 de femmes qui fait partie du groupe. Les plaignants en l'esp\u00e8ce ont soutenu que leurs conditions de travail inf\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles des conseillers sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 la grande pr\u00e9dominance des femmes dans leur groupe professionnel. Cette all\u00e9gation ne peut pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9e correctement si elle est analys\u00e9e en fonction des conditions de travail de la minorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s masculins faisant partie de ce groupe.\n[108] Par cons\u00e9quent, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te que le groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9 est le groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes.\n(ii) Le travail des conseillers est diff\u00e9rent de celui des \u00e9valuateurs [109] Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que la preuve d\u00e9montrait qu'au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes, les fonctions des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes de celles des \u00e9valuateurs. Ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, \u00e0 l'appui de cet argument, les descriptions des deux postes pour chacune des trois p\u00e9riodes.\n[110] La description de poste des conseillers pr\u00e9cise qu'ils fournissent des conseils m\u00e9dicaux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s au sujet des dossiers d'invalidit\u00e9 les plus complexes et litigieux, qu'ils examinent et \u00e9valuent la qualit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision, qu'ils contribuent au d\u00e9veloppement professionnel des autres conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, qu'ils discutent \u00e0 l'interne et \u00e0 l'externe de questions portant sur l'invalidit\u00e9 au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, qu'ils examinent les demandes de renseignements personnels et y r\u00e9pondent conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et qu'ils exercent d'autres fonctions.\n[111] La description de poste des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9cise que leurs fonctions principales sont : effectuer l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale des demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, offrir aux demandeurs des services d'aiguillage, diriger ou g\u00e9rer des \u00e9quipes de projet, y compris la conception, les services et les politiques de programmes, entrer en contact avec les repr\u00e9sentants de la collectivit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, d'autres minist\u00e8res et niveaux du gouvernement, le secteur des assurances, le public, etc. et entretenir ces liens en vue de garder des connaissances approfondies en mati\u00e8re de m\u00e9decine et d'invalidit\u00e9, de tendances et de nouveaux troubles de sant\u00e9.\n[112] Les descriptions de postes donnent \u00e0 penser que la principale diff\u00e9rence entre le travail des conseillers et celui des \u00e9valuateurs est, en fait, refl\u00e9t\u00e9e dans leurs titres de postes respectifs : les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux exercent des fonctions qui portent plut\u00f4t sur les conseils m\u00e9dicaux et la supervision, alors que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux travaillent directement avec les demandeurs en \u00e9valuant leurs demandes et en leur offrant des services d'aiguillage.\n[113] Il est cependant important d'examiner les descriptions de poste en tenant compte du t\u00e9moignage des personnes qui font le travail et qui administrent le programme afin de d\u00e9terminer si les descriptions de poste refl\u00e8tent avec exactitude le travail qui est effectu\u00e9 et qui l'\u00e9tait au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes en question en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[114] Le Dr Raymond Aubin, directeur par int\u00e9rim de la Division de l'expertise m\u00e9dicale, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s. Son t\u00e9moignage portait principalement sur les diff\u00e9rences entre le travail effectu\u00e9 par les conseillers et \u00e0 celui des \u00e9valuateurs pendant la p\u00e9riode de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd'hui.\n[115] Il a soutenu que, pr\u00e9sentement, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux sont exclusivement responsables de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions et mesures prises \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus d'appel pour les prestations d'invalidit\u00e9, soit la Commission d'appel des pensions. C'est le conseiller m\u00e9dical qui examine le dossier, qui pr\u00e9pare le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du dossier et qui t\u00e9moigne devant la CAP. Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux passent pr\u00e9sentement environ 75 p. 100 de leur temps \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l'audience de la CAP. Une partie de ce temps est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 des fonctions qui chevauchent celles des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, soit la pr\u00e9paration des dossiers pour l'audience. Cependant, les conseillers ont plus de pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnaires \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape que les \u00e9valuateurs.\n[116] La pr\u00e9paration des conseillers pour les audiences devant la CAP, de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd'hui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9e au travail de certains \u00e9valuateurs au Manitoba, qui se pr\u00e9parent pour l'audience devant les tribunaux de r\u00e9vision et qui y t\u00e9moignent. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que ce travail est en effet tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celui pour les audiences devant la CAP, mais il existe des diff\u00e9rences importantes. Les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers doivent tous deux appliquer leurs connaissances m\u00e9dicales et leurs connaissances du programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC afin de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l'audience et de pr\u00e9senter des renseignements aux d\u00e9cideurs. Cependant, ce n'est qu'au Manitoba et en Saskatchewan que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux repr\u00e9sentent le ministre devant le TR. Dans les autres provinces, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le TR sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par des employ\u00e9s qui n'ont pas n\u00e9cessairement de formation en m\u00e9decine et personne ne repr\u00e9sente le ministre. Il semble donc que pr\u00e9sentement, \u00e0 l'exception du Manitoba et de la Saskatchewan, la pr\u00e9sentation de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s \u00e0 un d\u00e9cideur est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape finale des appels, soit la CAP. Cette fonction est exclusivement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux.\n[117] Compte tenu de toutes les preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que certaines fonctions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es uniquement par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes en l'esp\u00e8ce. Les voici :\napprouver les recommandations des \u00e9valuateurs au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9, de 1972 \u00e0 1989; fournir des conseils m\u00e9dicaux sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s aux \u00e9valuateurs pour 1 \u00e0 2 p. 100 des dossiers au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes en question; approuver les d\u00e9cisions ou les recommandations au sujet d'ententes, de demandes d'autorisation d'interjeter appel \u00e0 la CAP et les demandes de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience devant la CAP, de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd'hui; fournir une certaine formation aux \u00e9valuateurs, jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie; examiner les dossiers, pr\u00e9parer le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des dossiers et t\u00e9moigner devant la Commission d'appel des pensions au cours des trois p\u00e9riodes en question; t\u00e9moigner par affidavit ou de vive voix, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, pour les demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de d\u00e9cisions de la CAP, pr\u00e9sentement.\n[118] Certains des plaignants ont reconnu qu'il existait des diff\u00e9rences entre le travail des conseillers et celui des \u00e9valuateurs. Par exemple, Mme Franklin a admis franchement que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux jouent un r\u00f4le diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 un niveau diff\u00e9rent du sien. Elle a cependant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'au fil des ans, les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs ont exerc\u00e9 de nombreuses fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. De plus, la fonction principale des deux postes est la m\u00eame : d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\n[119] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9claration de Mme Franklin constitue un excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce. Pendant toute l'existence du programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, il y a eu, et il y a toujours, un important chevauchement des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Cependant, le travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux est diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards de celui des \u00e9valuateurs. Contrairement aux \u00e9valuateurs, les conseillers ont toujours eu un r\u00f4le de superviseurs et de conseillers dans les d\u00e9cisions au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Ils devaient entre autres fournir des conseils m\u00e9dicaux pour les dossiers complexes et ils avaient des responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de formation et de d\u00e9cisions finales \u00e0 certains niveaux du processus. De plus, les conseillers t\u00e9moignent \u00e0 titre d'experts en m\u00e9decine devant les d\u00e9cideurs \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape finale des appels du processus d'examen de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, soit la Commission d'appel des pensions. L'audience devant la CAP est la derni\u00e8re chance pour les parties de voir le dossier jug\u00e9 sur le fond en fonction des preuves m\u00e9dicales pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es jusqu'alors.\n[120] Les conseillers apportent une connaissance diff\u00e9rente au programme, effectuent certaines t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes et ont des responsabilit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes de celles des \u00e9valuateurs. Il s'agit d'une explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire au sujet de certaines des diff\u00e9rences de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et d'avantages sociaux. Cela explique aussi pourquoi les postes de conseillers et ceux d'\u00e9valuateurs peuvent occuper un niveau diff\u00e9rent dans la norme de classification Services de sant\u00e9.\n[121] Cependant, les diff\u00e9rences de responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de travail de chacun des postes ne sont pas suffisantes pour expliquer l'\u00e9norme \u00e9cart de traitement entre les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs. En particulier, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas donn\u00e9 d'explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire \u00e0 la question suivante : pourquoi les conseillers sont-ils reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9, et sont-ils r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence, lorsque leur fonction principale est de rendre une d\u00e9cision au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 alors que, lorsque les \u00e9valuateurs ex\u00e9cutent la m\u00eame fonction principale, ils sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des administrateurs de programme et re\u00e7oivent la moiti\u00e9 du salaire des conseillers?\n[122] Les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question se trouve dans la d\u00e9cision de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique (CRTFP). Cette affaire portait sur une demande de l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada (IPFPC) d'ajouter les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux au groupe Services de sant\u00e9. La CRTFP a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux comme \u00e9tant des administrateurs de programme dans le groupe PA \u00e9tait correcte. Les intim\u00e9s ont fait valoir que la d\u00e9cision de la CRTFP donne une explication raisonnable des diff\u00e9rences de traitement entre les postes et qu'elle devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[123] La CRTFP a conclu que le poste d'\u00e9valuateur n'avait pas sa place dans le groupe Services sant\u00e9 parce que les \u00e9valuateurs ne fournissent pas des soins de sant\u00e9 directs aux demandeurs de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RCP. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien que les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux utilisent leurs connaissances en m\u00e9decine pour \u00e9valuer les demandes et les dossiers des demandeurs, ils n'\u00e9valuent pas les demandeurs comme tels. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils ne fournissent pas de soins aux demandeurs comme l'exigent les crit\u00e8res de classification pour le groupe Services de sant\u00e9.\n[124] Cependant, la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que, si les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux ne s'occupent pas de l'\u00e9valuation des demandeurs lorsqu'ils examinent l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux ne le font pas non plus. Pourtant, les conseillers sont reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et ont une classification correspondante, alors que ce n'est pas le cas pour les \u00e9valuateurs. La CRTFP n'a pas effectu\u00e9 d'analyse comparative des deux postes et elle n'a pas rendu de d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 savoir si de telles diff\u00e9rences contreviennent \u00e0 la LCDP. Pour ce motif, je suis d'avis que la conclusion de la CRTFP a peu d'influence sur ma d\u00e9cision.\n[125] Patricia Power, directrice par int\u00e9rim, Politique de classification, Politique et strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 l'AGRHFPC, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour les intim\u00e9s. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux font partie du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 parce qu'ils satisfont \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la norme de classification du groupe M\u00e9decine (MD). Mme Power a soutenu que les \u00e9valuateurs ne font pas partie du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 parce qu'ils ne satisfont pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de ce groupe ni \u00e0 la norme de classification des Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU).\n[126] Pour faire partie du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, un poste doit satisfaire \u00e0 la [traduction] d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 et doit ensuite s'inscrire dans les postes inclus dans les normes de classification MD ou NU.\n[127] La d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise que le groupe comprend les postes qui sont principalement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'application de la connaissance approfondie de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s professionnelles dans les domaines de la m\u00e9decine et des soins infirmiers (entre autres) \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des personnes.\n[128] Mme Power a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien que le poste de conseiller satisfasse \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, le poste d'\u00e9valuateur n'y satisfait pas. Elle semble fonder cette distinction sur le fait que l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale ne comprend pas l'application de connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res pour fournir des soins directs \u00e0 des patients. Cependant, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ni l'un ni l'autre poste ne comprend l'application de connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res ou en m\u00e9decine pour fournir des soins directs \u00e0 des patients, comme c'est le cas en milieu clinique. Par cons\u00e9quent, si les \u00e9valuateurs ne satisfont pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce qu'ils ne fournissent pas de soins directs aux patients, alors pour le m\u00eame motif, le poste de conseiller ne satisfait pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition non plus.\n[129] N\u00e9anmoins, dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Power a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conseillers satisfaisaient non seulement \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, mais qu'ils satisfaisaient aussi \u00e0 la norme de classification MD parce que le poste correspond \u00e0 l'un des postes inclus dans la d\u00e9finition de la classification MD. Il s'agit du poste inclus no 5, qui est le suivant : \u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de demandeuses et demandeurs admissibles en vue d'une prise de d\u00e9cision sur leurs demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 ou d'autres prestations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral [...] .\n[130] Mme Power a expliqu\u00e9 que le poste inclus no 5 a toujours fait partie de la norme de classification MD. En 1999, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 une nouvelle d\u00e9finition du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 par le processus du syst\u00e8me de classification universel (SCU). Mme Power a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si la nouvelle d\u00e9finition du groupe Services de sant\u00e9, \u00e9labor\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce au SCU, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e au poste d'\u00e9valuateur m\u00e9dical, elle aurait permis aux \u00e9valuateurs de faire partie de la classification du groupe Services de sant\u00e9 en vertu du poste inclus no 5.\n[131] Cependant, en raison d'un processus qui a eu lieu \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990, la nouvelle d\u00e9finition a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et le poste inclus no 5 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 aux \u00e9valuateurs. Mme Power a expliqu\u00e9 qu'en 1993, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9, en vertu de la Loi sur la r\u00e9forme de la fonction publique, de r\u00e9duire le nombre de groupes professionnels dans la fonction publique. Il avait six ans pour le faire. L'une des conditions pr\u00e9vues par la Loi \u00e9tait que l'affiliation \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation ne devait pas \u00eatre chang\u00e9e par la r\u00e9duction du nombre de groupes. Afin d'\u00e9viter le changement d'affiliation \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, le poste inclus no 5 a sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus de la norme de classification NU et inclus dans la norme MD. Cette mesure a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise parce que l'application du poste inclus no 5 aux \u00e9valuateurs aurait caus\u00e9 le transfert de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada \u00e0 une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'Institut professionnel de la fonction publique du Canada. Mme Power a expliqu\u00e9 que le but du processus de 1999 \u00e9tait d'\u00e9viter le changement d'affiliation de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation.\n[132] Cependant, Mme Power a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le processus de 1999 ne visait pas \u00e0 bloquer ind\u00e9finiment la composition des unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, s'il y avait eu de bonnes raisons de le faire, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'apporter des modifications entra\u00eenant un changement d'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation.\n[133] Mme Power a reconnu que l'\u00e9limination de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une bonne raison de modifier les normes de classification dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9. Elle a admis que, s'il y avait eu une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes dans le syst\u00e8me de classification, le processus de 1999 aurait eu l'effet inattendu de transf\u00e9rer cette in\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans le nouveau syst\u00e8me. Mme Power a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si le processus de 1999 avait introduit ou r\u00e9introduit un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 sexiste, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor aurait eu la responsabilit\u00e9 de retravailler les d\u00e9finitions du groupe et les normes de classification afin d'\u00e9liminer le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a le pouvoir exclusif, en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique, de d\u00e9finir les classification. Il n'a pas besoin de l'approbation de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation pour apporter des changements aux normes de classification.\n[134] Cependant, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et l'AGRHFPC ont justement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils avaient besoin de l'approbation de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation lorsqu'ils ont r\u00e9pondu au dossier d'analyse de D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, qui proposait la modification de la norme de classification NU. Le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'examinerait la possibilit\u00e9 d'apporter des changements \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du groupe professionnel Services de sant\u00e9 que lorsqu'on lui pr\u00e9senterait un dossier d'analyse solide \u00e0 ce sujet et que toutes les parties, y compris les agents de n\u00e9gociation, appuieraient ces changements.\n[135] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse au dossier d'analyse, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a aussi soutenu que l'objectif principal de l'\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale n'est pas l'application de connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des personnes, ni l'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Son but principal est l'administration d'un programme du gouvernement.\n[136] \u00c0 mon avis, s'il est conclu que les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux appliquent leurs connaissances m\u00e9dicales \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 physique des personnes ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 afin de d\u00e9terminer leur admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations, alors il faudrait aussi conclure, pour la classification, que les \u00e9valuateurs font la m\u00eame chose. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de justification raisonnable et non discriminatoire pour l'application diff\u00e9rente des principes de classification dans la fonction publique. Ils n'ont pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi ils ont refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par un groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes qui ex\u00e9cute essentiellement la m\u00eame fonction principale que le groupe majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes, qui lui jouit d'une reconnaissance professionnelle.\n[137] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fourni d'explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire quant au fait qu'ils traitent les \u00e9valuateurs diff\u00e9remment des conseillers en ce qui a trait au paiement de leurs droits professionnels, aux possibilit\u00e9s d'\u00e9ducation et de formation et aux offres d'avancement professionnel. Les \u00e9valuateurs utilisent leur expertise en m\u00e9decine pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations, tout comme les conseillers le font. Ils sont des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et devraient avoir droit aux m\u00eames avantages d'emploi et aux m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement et d'avancement professionnel dont jouissent les autres professionnels de la sant\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction publique.\n[138] Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a le pouvoir exclusif de modifier les normes de classification, avec ou sans l'approbation de l'unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor aurait pu d\u00e9cider de reprendre la norme de classification Sciences infirmi\u00e8res qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par le processus SCU et qui comprenait le poste inclus no 5. Il aurait aussi pu \u00e9laborer une nouvelle norme de classification dans le groupe Services de sant\u00e9, dans laquelle il aurait pu inclure le travail des \u00e9valuateurs et des conseillers. En effet, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor avait la pr\u00e9rogative d'agir comme bon lui semblait, tant que les qualifications professionnelles des \u00e9valuateurs \u00e9taient reconnues proportionnellement \u00e0 celles des conseillers. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor n'a pas exerc\u00e9 ce pouvoir.\n(iii) Les intim\u00e9s ont-ils \u00e9tabli que le traitement diff\u00e9rent d\u00e9coulait d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e? [139] L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voient une justification pour les actes et les lignes de conduite discriminatoire s'il est prouv\u00e9 qu'elles d\u00e9coulent d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Pour ce faire, les intim\u00e9s doivent \u00e9tablir que la prise de mesures d'accommodement pour les plaignants leur aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[140] Le seul facteur qui s'applique en l'esp\u00e8ce est le co\u00fbt. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas prouv\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt li\u00e9 au traitement \u00e9quivalent des \u00e9valuateurs et des conseillers, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle, le paiement des droits de permis et l'offre de possibilit\u00e9s de formation et d'\u00e9ducation, leur aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[141] Marc Thibodeau, un n\u00e9gociateur au Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le changement de classification des \u00e9valuateurs et les r\u00e9percussions qui s'ensuivraient sur les niveaux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration toucheraient la classification et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de postes semblables \u00e0 la fonction publique. Par exemple, l'\u00e9valuation des demandes d'invalidit\u00e9 au minist\u00e8re des Anciens Combattants est effectu\u00e9e par des employ\u00e9s qui ont la classification PM-4. La reconnaissance de la sp\u00e9cialisation m\u00e9dicale des \u00e9valuateurs en l'esp\u00e8ce pourrait entra\u00eener une r\u00e9vision des niveaux de classification des \u00e9valuateurs dans des minist\u00e8res comme celui des Anciens Combattants. Cela pourrait alors entra\u00eener une augmentation importante de la masse salariale de la fonction publique.\n[142] Il y a presque toujours des co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la modification d'un milieu de travail pour qu'il soit exempt de discrimination. On avance souvent l'augmentation des co\u00fbts pour justifier le refus de r\u00e9gler un probl\u00e8me de discrimination au travail. Cependant, l'acte ne sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une exigences professionnelle justifi\u00e9e que si le co\u00fbt li\u00e9 au redressement de la situation est si \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu'il causerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas prouv\u00e9 que la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 titre de professionnels de la sant\u00e9 leur causerait une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts.\nX. CONCLUSION AU SUJET DE LA RESPONSABILIT\u00c9 AU SENS DES ARTICLES 7 ET 10 DE LA LOI [143] Je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli que le refus des intim\u00e9s, depuis mars 1978, de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux proportionnellement \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle accord\u00e9e au travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux constitue un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10. L'acte a eu pour effet de priver les \u00e9valuateurs de la reconnaissance professionnelle et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 leurs qualifications et de les priver du paiement de leurs droits professionnels ainsi que des possibilit\u00e9s de formation et d'avancement professionnel au m\u00eame titre que les conseillers.\nXI. QUELLE EST LA R\u00c9PARATION APPROPRI\u00c9E EN L'ESP\u00c8CE? [144] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP donne au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner aux intim\u00e9s de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables. Les parties m'ont demand\u00e9, si je concluais que les plaintes \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, d'ordonner aux intim\u00e9s de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, mais que je ne pr\u00e9cise pas les mesures de redressement \u00e0 prendre. Ils m'ont demand\u00e9 de leur donner la chance de n\u00e9gocier les mesures appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 prendre avec tous les intervenants importants. Je souscris \u00e0 cette demande. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rends l'ordonnance suivante, mais je demeure saisie de cet aspect de ma d\u00e9cision si les parties n'arrivent pas \u00e0 une entente :\nJ'ordonne aux intim\u00e9s de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 143 ci-dessous.\n[145] Une conf\u00e9rence de cas sera pr\u00e9vue pour trois mois apr\u00e8s la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, auquel moment les parties feront un rapport au Tribunal de l'\u00e9tat des n\u00e9gociations. \u00c0 la m\u00eame date, le Tribunal \u00e9tablira un calendrier pour la r\u00e9solution finale de toute question non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e portant sur cet aspect de la d\u00e9cision. S'il n'y a pas de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, je rendrai une d\u00e9cision finale apr\u00e8s que les parties auront eu la chance de pr\u00e9senter des preuves, s'il y a lieu, et des arguments au sujet du redressement.\n[146] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner aux intim\u00e9s d'indemniser les victimes de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte. Compte tenu de mon ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente au sujet de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) et des r\u00e9percussions possibles sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, je crois qu'il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que je reste saisie de l'affaire, selon les m\u00eames crit\u00e8res, au sujet de toute indemnit\u00e9 au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c).\n[147] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ordonner aux intim\u00e9s d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a subi un pr\u00e9judice moral. J'ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Walden et de trois autres plaignants qui ont mentionn\u00e9 la frustration, la d\u00e9moralisation et la perte d'estime de soi qu'ils ont v\u00e9cues en raison du refus des intim\u00e9s de reconna\u00eetre leur expertise professionnelle. Pour ce motif, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 ordonner aux intim\u00e9s d'indemniser les plaignants en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e). Cependant, je me pose des questions quant au montant puisque nous n'en avons pas discut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. Par exemple, un plaignant qui ne travaille pour le programme que depuis f\u00e9vrier 2007 devrait-il recevoir la m\u00eame indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral qu'un plaignant qui y est employ\u00e9 depuis 1993? Je resterai saisie de la question du montant en fonction des m\u00eames crit\u00e8res que j'ai mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus. J'encourage les parties \u00e0 s'entendre sur la question sinon, comme pour les questions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, je rendrai une d\u00e9cision finale \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[148] La Commission et les plaignants ont soutenu que le Tribunal devrait ordonner une indemnisation en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Cette disposition autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je conclus qu'une ordonnance d'indemnisation en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) n'est pas appropri\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il s'agit d'une affaire portant sur de la discrimination ayant un effet d\u00e9favorable parce qu'une ligne de conduite a eu pour effet inattendu de d\u00e9favoriser un tr\u00e8s grand nombre de femmes. La sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 et la franchise du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Power m'a convaincue que, si elle et d'autres membres du groupe des intim\u00e9s avaient r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'il y avait des actes de discrimination en cours, ou que de tels actes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 perp\u00e9tu\u00e9s involontairement \u00e0 cause des n\u00e9gociations de 1999 avec les agents n\u00e9gociateurs, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor aurait exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir de prendre les mesures de redressement appropri\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne rel\u00e8ve aucune preuve d'acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 qui justifierait l'ordonnance d'une indemnisation en vertu du paragraphe 53(3).\n[149] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, je resterai saisie de l'affaire en ce qui a trait aux trois questions en instance au sujet desquelles les parties doivent n\u00e9gocier. Le rapport d'\u00e9tape et l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour la r\u00e9solution des litiges s'appliquent aux trois questions.\nKaren A.

(l'intim\u00e9 ), a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, que son client avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers une proposition concordataire en vertu de Loi sur la faillite et l'insolvabilit\u00e9, L.R.C.

La proposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers et a pris effet le 5 novembre 2003 Pour sa part, le syndic a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 le 17 mars 2004.

Pour soutenir ses pr\u00e9tentions, il s'appuie, entre autres, sur le paragraphe 69.1(1) de la Loi sur la faillite qui pr\u00e9voit :\n69.1 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (2) \u00e0 (6) et des articles 69.4 et 69.5, entre la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une proposition visant une personne insolvable et :\na) soit sa faillite, soit la lib\u00e9ration du syndic, les cr\u00e9anciers n'ont aucun recours contre elle ou contre ses biens et ne peuvent intenter ou continuer aucune action, ex\u00e9cution ou autre proc\u00e9dure en vue du recouvrement de r\u00e9clamations prouvables en mati\u00e8re de faillite;\nb) soit sa faillite, soit la lib\u00e9ration du syndic, est sans effet toute disposition d'un contrat de garantie conclu entre elle et un cr\u00e9ancier garanti qui pr\u00e9voit, pour l'essentiel, que celle-ci, d\u00e8s qu'elle devient insolvable, qu'elle manque \u00e0 un engagement pr\u00e9vu par le contrat de garantie ou qu'est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard un avis d'intention aux termes de l'article 50.4 ou une proposition aux termes du paragraphe 62(1), est d\u00e9chue des droits qu'elle aurait normalement de se servir des avoirs vis\u00e9s par le contrat de garantie ou de faire d'autres op\u00e9rations \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard;\nc) soit sa faillite, soit la lib\u00e9ration du syndic, soit l'expiration des six mois suivant l'approbation de la proposition par le tribunal, est suspendu l'exercice par Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada des droits que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 224(1.2) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu ou toute disposition du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada ou de la Loi sur l'assurance-emploi qui renvoie \u00e0 ce paragraphe et qui pr\u00e9voit la perception d'une cotisation, au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, ou d'une cotisation ouvri\u00e8re ou d'une cotisation patronale, au sens de la Loi sur l'assurance-emploi, et des int\u00e9r\u00eats, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s ou autres montants y aff\u00e9rents, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la personne insolvable, lorsque celle-ci est un d\u00e9biteur fiscal vis\u00e9 \u00e0 ce paragraphe ou \u00e0 cette disposition;\nd) soit sa faillite, soit la lib\u00e9ration du syndic, soit l'expiration des six mois suivant l'approbation de la proposition par le tribunal, est suspendu l'exercice par Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef d'une province des droits que lui conf\u00e8re toute disposition l\u00e9gislative provinciale dont l'objet est semblable \u00e0 celui du paragraphe 224(1.2) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, ou qui renvoie \u00e0 ce paragraphe, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la personne insolvable, lorsque celle-ci est un d\u00e9biteur vis\u00e9 par la loi provinciale, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la disposition pr\u00e9voit la perception d'une somme, et des int\u00e9r\u00eats, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s ou autres montants y aff\u00e9rents, qui :\n(i) soit a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue par une personne sur un paiement effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre personne, ou d\u00e9duite d'un tel paiement, et se rapporte \u00e0 un imp\u00f4t semblable, de par sa nature, \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu auquel les particuliers sont assujettis en vertu de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu,\n(ii) soit est de m\u00eame nature qu'une cotisation pr\u00e9vue par le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, si la province est une province instituant un r\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pensions au sens du paragraphe 3(1) de cette loi et si la loi provinciale institue un r\u00e9gime provincial de pensions au sens de ce paragraphe.\n[3] En vertu de cette disposition, si la proposition concordataire est accept\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers, nul cr\u00e9ancier ne peut exercer de recours contre le d\u00e9biteur, en l'esp\u00e8ce l'intim\u00e9, ou contre ses biens sans l'autorisation du tribunal. Une proposition concordataire est un contrat conclu entre un d\u00e9biteur et ses cr\u00e9anciers. Lorsqu'elle est accept\u00e9e par ces derniers et homologu\u00e9e par le tribunal, elle lie tous les cr\u00e9anciers. Cons\u00e9quemment, en l'esp\u00e8ce, les cr\u00e9anciers de l'intim\u00e9 qui ont accept\u00e9 la proposition concordataire ne pourraient, sans remettre en cause l'essence m\u00eame de la proposition et de son acceptation, \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 entreprendre ou continuer des proc\u00e9dures d'ex\u00e9cution contre lui pour le solde de leur cr\u00e9ance. Je constate, selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, que la plaignante ne fait pas partie de la proposition concordataire conclue entre l'intim\u00e9 et ses cr\u00e9anciers.\n[4] L'article 69.4 de la Loi sur la faillite pr\u00e9voit pour sa part :\n69.4 Tout cr\u00e9ancier touch\u00e9 par l'application des articles 69 \u00e0 69.31 ou toute personne touch\u00e9e par celle de l'article 69.31 peut demander au tribunal de d\u00e9clarer que ces articles ne lui sont plus applicables. Le tribunal peut, avec les r\u00e9serves qu'il estime indiqu\u00e9es, donner suite \u00e0 la demande s'il est convaincu que la continuation d'application des articles en question lui causera vraisemblablement un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux ou encore qu'il serait, pour d'autres motifs, \u00e9quitable de rendre pareille d\u00e9cision.\n[5] Selon cette disposition, un cr\u00e9ancier touch\u00e9 par l'article 69.1 doit obtenir l'autorisation du tribunal pour intenter ou continuer des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. Me Jobidon en d\u00e9duit donc que la plaignante ne pouvait proc\u00e9der devant le Tribunal sans au pr\u00e9alable avoir obtenu l'autorisation de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec. Il ajoute qu'elle ne serait exempt\u00e9e de cette obligation que si elle tombe sous l'une ou l'autre des exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 178(1) de la Loi sur la faillite, lequel \u00e9nonce :\n[6] 178 (1) Une ordonnance de lib\u00e9ration ne lib\u00e8re pas le failli :\na) de toute amende, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, ordonnance de restitution ou toute ordonnance similaire inflig\u00e9e ou rendue par un tribunal, ou de toute autre dette provenant d'un engagement ou d'un cautionnement en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale;\na.1) de toute indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en justice dans une affaire civile :\n(i) pour des l\u00e9sions corporelles caus\u00e9es intentionnellement ou pour agression sexuelle,\n(ii) pour d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u00e9coulant de celles-ci;\nb) de toute dette ou obligation pour pension alimentaire;\nc) de toute dette ou obligation aux termes de la d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal en mati\u00e8re de filiation ou d'aliments ou aux termes d'une entente alimentaire au profit d'un \u00e9poux, d'un ex-\u00e9poux ou ancien conjoint de fait ou d'un enfant vivant s\u00e9par\u00e9 du failli;\nd) de toute dette ou obligation r\u00e9sultant de la fraude, du d\u00e9tournement, de la concussion ou de l'abus de confiance alors qu'il agissait, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 titre de fiduciaire ou d'administrateur du bien d'autrui ou, dans les autres provinces, \u00e0 titre de fiduciaire;\ne) de toute dette ou obligation r\u00e9sultant de l'obtention de biens par des fausses repr\u00e9sentations ou des pr\u00e9sentations erron\u00e9es et frauduleuses des faits;\nf) de l'obligation visant le dividende qu'un cr\u00e9ancier aurait eu droit de recevoir sur toute r\u00e9clamation prouvable non r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e au syndic, \u00e0 moins que ce cr\u00e9ancier n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 averti ou n'ait eu connaissance de la faillite et n'ait omis de prendre les mesures raisonnables pour prouver sa r\u00e9clamation;\ng) de toute dette ou obligation d\u00e9coulant d'un pr\u00eat consenti ou garanti au titre de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les pr\u00eats aux \u00e9tudiants, de la Loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur l'aide financi\u00e8re aux \u00e9tudiants ou de toute loi provinciale relative aux pr\u00eats aux \u00e9tudiants lorsque la faillite est survenue avant la date \u00e0 laquelle le failli a cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre un \u00e9tudiant, \u00e0 temps plein ou partiel, en application de ces lois, ou dans les dix ans suivant cette date;\nh) de toute dette relative aux int\u00e9r\u00eats dus \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une somme vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'un des alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 g).\n[7] Il est \u00e9vident que la plaignante ne tombe dans aucune de ces exceptions. Me Jobidon en tire donc la conclusion que puisqu'elle n'a pas obtenu l'autorisation de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec pour poursuivre sa proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal et qu'aucune des exceptions pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 178(1) ne s'applique, alors le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour poursuivre l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nD\u00e9cision [8] Une proposition concordataire est un contrat entre un d\u00e9biteur et ses cr\u00e9anciers. Ces propositions sont couvertes par la Partie III de la Loi sur la faillite traite des dispositions applicables \u00e0 ces propositions. Le d\u00e9biteur qui pr\u00e9sente une proposition est une personne insolvable au sens de l'article 2 de la Loi sur la faillite, mais n'est pas un failli.\n[9] Selon l'article 2 de la Loi sur la faillite, le mot personne comprend une corporation, mais la d\u00e9finition de personne insolvable exclut celle qui est en faillite. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, Me Jobidon, a qui incombait le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer que le Tribunal n'\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tent pour \u00eatre saisi du dossier, n'a pas pr\u00e9sent de preuve permettant d'\u00e9tablir que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au moment de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa proposition soit une personne insolvable ou un failli. J'en tire la conclusion que Groupe Major Express Inc. \u00e9tait, \u00e0 ce moment, insolvable et non en faillite.\n[10] Dans le cadre d'une proposition concordataire, le syndic ne prend pas possession des biens et il ne peut donc en disposer comme il le ferait dans le cas d'une faillite. D'ailleurs, il ne faut pas confondre les pouvoirs du syndic \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la possession et de la disposition des biens d'un failli et ceux du m\u00eame syndic agissant lors de la proposition d'une personne insolvable. Malgr\u00e9 l'intervention du syndic, le d\u00e9biteur demeure propri\u00e9taire de son entreprise. Le syndic est alors consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un mandataire et non un cessionnaire. La Loi sur la faillite permet \u00e0 une personne insolvable de soumettre une proposition \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers sans faire pr\u00e9alablement une cession de ses biens entre les mains du s\u00e9questre officiel. Ainsi, le d\u00e9biteur conserve ses biens et continue de les administrer. (Darabaner c. Imperial Bank of Canada, [1960] C.S. 411; Appolo Refrigeration Inc. c. Office de construction du Qu\u00e9bec, [1976] C.S. 1716; comment\u00e9 par Boh\u00e9mier, A. Proposition pr\u00e9ventive - refus des cr\u00e9anciers - cession r\u00e9troactive - d\u00e9termination des cr\u00e9ances admissibles , (1977) 37 R. du B. 229.)\n[11] Selon la Loi sur la faillite, si une proposition est refus\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers, le d\u00e9biteur est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir fait cession de ses biens le jour du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la proposition. Toutefois, si les cr\u00e9anciers acceptent la proposition, le syndic doit imm\u00e9diatement demander au tribunal de l'approuver (voir art. 58 de la Loi sur la faillite.) Une proposition accept\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers et approuv\u00e9e par le tribunal lie tous les cr\u00e9anciers d\u00e9tenant des r\u00e9clamations prouvables vis\u00e9es par la proposition (par. 62(2) de la Loi sur la faillite). Dans un tel cas, le d\u00e9biteur continue \u00e0 faire affaire, mais doit se soumettre aux prescriptions de la Loi sur la faillite relatives aux propositions concordataires et aux restrictions r\u00e9sultantes de la proposition. Ce n'est que dans le cas de refus de la proposition par ses cr\u00e9anciers que le d\u00e9biteur devient un failli et qu'il est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir fait une cession des ses biens. (Appolo Refrigeration Inc. c. Office de construction du Qu\u00e9bec, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9)\n[12] En l'esp\u00e8ce, nous pouvons d\u00e9duire de la preuve soumise \u00e0 l'audience que la proposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les cr\u00e9anciers de l'intim\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9e par le tribunal. La proposition concordataire accept\u00e9e et approuv\u00e9e n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 produite. Le Tribunal n'en conna\u00eet donc pas le contenu. De plus, Me Jobidon n'a soumis aucune preuve quant \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de cette proposition.\n[13] \u00c0 la suite de mon analyse de la Loi sur la faillite concernant les propositions concordataires et de l'\u00e9tat de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, je conclus que le fait que l'intim\u00e9 ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une proposition concordataire n'a aucun effet sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d'entendre la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Dans le cas d'une proposition concordataire accept\u00e9e et approuv\u00e9e, l'intim\u00e9 continue \u00e0 faire affaire. Aucun argument de l'intim\u00e9 ne m'a convaincu qu'il \u00e9tait, de ce fait, lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ses obligations en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[14] Pour ces raisons, je conclus que le Tribunal a toujours comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Les parties devront donc dans les dix (10) jours suivants la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision faire parvenir au Tribunal leurs dates de disponibilit\u00e9 pour les trois prochains mois pour une audience de trois (3) jours. Si les parties ne devaient pas se conformer \u00e0 cette directive, le Tribunal fixera les dates de l'audience. Si l'une ou l'autre des parties n'a aucune date de disponible dans les trois prochains mois, elle devra, par \u00e9crit, donner au Tribunal des raisons suffisantes pour expliquer sa non-disponibilit\u00e9. Le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera alors du bien-fond\u00e9 de ces pr\u00e9tentions.\nSign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nLe 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1179\/6106\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Magaly Germain c.

INTRODUCTION [1] En date du 19 octobre 1999 M. Dan Durrer n'avait travaill\u00e9 que pour une seule soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la Banque Canadienne Imp\u00e9riale de Commerce (CIBC), et ce, depuis plus de 28 ans. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il fut avis\u00e9 que son poste serait aboli et que son emploi pendrait fin. Il \u00e9tait alors \u00e2g\u00e9 de 48 ans. Son emploi comptait parmi les nombreux emplois qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis dans l'ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cadre d'un programme de compression et de restructuration. Sur une p\u00e9riode de deux ans et demi, M. Durrer a occup\u00e9 trois postes temporaires \u00e0 la Banque, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que, finalement, comme il n'avait obtenu aucun autre poste, sa date de cessation d'emploi fut finalement fix\u00e9e au 12 avril 2002.\n[2] Le 23 juillet 2002, M. Durrer a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de personne (la Commission) une plainte dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tendait que la CIBC avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en raison de son \u00e2ge, et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP). La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 30 janvier 2006. La Commission a choisi de ne pas participer \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience de l'instruction, et ce, tout en demeurant partie. L'audition de la preuve a eu lieu en novembre 2006. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nII. LA PLAINTE D\u00c9POS\u00c9E PAR M. DURRER [3] Il semble que la nature exacte de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Durrer a chang\u00e9 entre le moment de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t et le moment de son audition. Quel \u00e9tait exactement le fondement de la plainte de M. Durrer? Dans la section intitul\u00e9e All\u00e9gation du formulaire de plainte qu'il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, M. Durrer a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Moi, Dan Durrer, pr\u00e9tend que la Banque Canadienne Imp\u00e9riale de Commerce a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard en cours d'emploi en mettant fin \u00e0 mon emploi en raison de mon \u00e2ge (50 ans), et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Comme M. Durrer a mentionn\u00e9 l'\u00e2ge de 50 ans, il est permis de penser que le fondement de sa plainte s'est cristallis\u00e9 le 12 avril 2002, sa derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de travail. Le reste de la plainte portait principalement sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode et non pas sur la d\u00e9cision initiale par laquelle on a aboli son poste et par laquelle on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le r\u00e9affecter au nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9.\n[4] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, sa plaidoirie en fait, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal par son avocat, M. Durrer met l'accent sur la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge et sur les ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Le plaignant plaide que la [traduction] CIBC a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une politique de cong\u00e9diement des employ\u00e9s qui approchaient de la retraite, privant ces derniers de leur emploi tout simplement en raison de leur \u00e2ge. L'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions souligne le pr\u00e9tendu refus de la CIBC de permettre \u00e0 M. Durrer d'occuper un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire et d'atteindre l'\u00e2ge de 53 ans, d'o\u00f9 il aurait pu, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 deux ann\u00e9es d'indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi, faire le pont vers une retraite sans p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Il est \u00e9crit ce qui suit dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant : [traduction] La CIBC a mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi de M. Durrer \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 50 ans et demi dans le but de faire obstacle \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la pension et dans le but de se soustraire \u00e0 ses obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite. Il est de plus \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nOn a emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Durrer de pouvoir recevoir la pension offerte aux employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient \u00e2g\u00e9s de 53 ans au moment de la cessation de leur emploi parce que la CIBC ne lui a pas permis de prolonger sa carri\u00e8re chez elle par le biais d'une nomination pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e [poste temporaire]. Par ces actes, la CIBC a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Durrer en cours d'emploi, en contravention de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, en vertu d'une politique qui a priv\u00e9 M. Durrer d'occasions d'emploi, en contravention de l'article 10 de la LCDP.\n[5] L'avocat de la CIBC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, entre autres choses, son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions - sa plaidoirie en r\u00e9ponse - dans lequel il s'oppose \u00e0 ce que le plaignant ajoute \u00e0 sa plainte la question relative \u00e0 l'article 10 car il affirme qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans la plaidoirie du plaignant. Le plaignant n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9plique. Dans ses remarques pr\u00e9liminaires, l'avocat de la CIBC a soulev\u00e9 la question relative \u00e0 l'article 10 et il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il attendrait pour voir comment la cause de M. Durrer [traduction] se d\u00e9roulerait. L'avocat du plaignant n'a fait aucune mention de l'article 10 dans ses tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ves remarques pr\u00e9liminaires. \u00c0 la fin de l'audience, aucune autre mention d'une violation en soi de l'article 10 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. L'avocat du plaignant n'a fait aucune observation \u00e0 propos de cela dans sa plaidoirie finale, \u00e0 l'exception d'une br\u00e8ve mention. Cette mention avait trait \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration faite dans la plaidoirie de la CIBC qui figurait dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 titre subsidiaire de la Banque quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de l'all\u00e9gation fond\u00e9e sur l'article 10 figurant dans la plaidoirie du plaignant. Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la CIBC n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation concernant une violation de l'article 10. Dans le recueil des textes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par le plaignant figurent deux d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique traitant du pouvoir de modification des plaintes. L'avocat du plaignant n'a toutefois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation \u00e0 propos de ces d\u00e9cisions. Il est \u00e9galement important de souligner que le plaignant n'a jamais chercher \u00e0 modifier sa plainte dans le but d'ajouter la question relative \u00e0 l'article 10. J'interpr\u00e8te ceci comme \u00e9tant un abandon de l'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la CIBC a viol\u00e9 l'article 10 de la LCDP. Subsidiairement, je conclus que, \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, la CIBC s'attendait raisonnablement \u00e0 ce que je n'examine la preuve et les arguments que sous l'angle d'une violation de l'article 7. L'examen par moi, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, d'une question de violation de l'article 10 constituerait un d\u00e9ni d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de justice naturelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'examinerai la preuve et les arguments dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ont trait \u00e0 une violation des alin\u00e9as 7a) et 7b) de la LCDP.\n[6] Bien que dans sa plaidoirie et dans son t\u00e9moignage M. Durrer ait mis l'accent sur le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 refus de la CIBC de lui permettre de continuer \u00e0 travailler dans le cadre d'affectations temporaires jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 53 ans, d'o\u00f9 il pouvait faire le pont vers la retraite, j'ai entendu la preuve quant \u00e0 savoir si la d\u00e9cision initiale d'\u00e9liminer le poste de M. Durrer au service de la Conformit\u00e9 \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des arguments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'avocat du plaignant quant \u00e0 savoir si la d\u00e9cision de M. Young de ne pas r\u00e9affecter le plaignant dans le nouveau service r\u00e9organis\u00e9 de la Conformit\u00e9 constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge. Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, la violation de l'article 7 comportait deux volets : premi\u00e8rement, l'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer fut pris en compte par M. Young lorsque celui-ci a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi de M. Durrer; deuxi\u00e8mement, en mars et avril 2002, les Ressources humaines ont fait \u00e9chec \u00e0 la tentative d'obtention par M. Durrer d'un quatri\u00e8me emploi temporaire et l'emploi de ce dernier a donc pris fin.\nIII. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [7] Je traiterai des questions suivantes :\nLa CIBC a-t-elle \u00e9limin\u00e9 le poste de M. Durrer en octobre 1999 en raison de l'\u00e2ge de ce dernier; La CIBC a-t-elle d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9affecter M. Durrer \u00e0 un autre poste au sein du m\u00eame service (Conformit\u00e9) en raison de son \u00e2ge; La CIBC a-t-elle fait obstacle aux tentatives de r\u00e9affectation de M. Durrer au sein de la CIBC en raison de son \u00e2ge.\nIV. LES CONCLUSIONS DE FAIT [8] Dans la pr\u00e9sente partie, je tire mes conclusions de fait, notamment celles qui d\u00e9coulent de l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nA. L'historique [9] M. Dan Durrer est n\u00e9 le 9 octobre 1951. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la CIBC en janvier 1971. Il poss\u00e9dait un dipl\u00f4me de 12e ann\u00e9e. Il a gravi les \u00e9chelons \u00e0 la Banque; il a occup\u00e9 divers postes dans diverses succursales et dans divers bureaux r\u00e9gionaux. Entre 1994 et son dernier jour de travail en 2002, M. Durrer a occup\u00e9 divers postes au si\u00e8ge social de la Banque \u00e0 Toronto. Au moment o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u son avis de cessation d'emploi, le 19 octobre 1999, M. Durrer occupait le poste de directeur, service d'experts-conseils en risque d'entreprise, services bancaires de d\u00e9tail, au sein de l'un des trois services de la Conformit\u00e9 de la Banque. Il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 48 ans.\n[10] Selon l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, [traduction] Au cours de son emploi \u00e0 la CIBC, M. Durrer fut un employ\u00e9 loyal et d\u00e9vou\u00e9. Il a obtenu de nombreuses promotions et a fait l'objet de nombreuses mentions \u00e9logieuses de la part de ses sup\u00e9rieurs. Il a notamment re\u00e7u deux prix du pr\u00e9sident pour rendement exceptionnel. De son propre aveu, M. Durrer \u00e9tait un g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste qui \u00e9voluait dans un milieu de travail de plus en plus sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9.\nB. Restructuration et compressions effectu\u00e9es dans l'ensemble de l'entreprise [11] En 1999, la CIBC a embauch\u00e9 un nouveau pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; M. John Hunkin. Le nouveau PDG a mis en place un programme de compression et de restructuration dans l'ensemble de l'entreprise, afin de, notamment, rendre la CIBC plus comp\u00e9titive. Je retiens la preuve selon laquelle la CIBC traversait alors une p\u00e9riode difficile sur le plan financier. La restructuration a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'\u00e9limination d'environ 2 500 emplois. L'emploi de M. Durrer figurait parmi ces emplois. Le courriel interne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 aux cadres et aux gestionnaires (ainsi qu'\u00e0 M. Durrer) le 27 septembre 1999, pour distribution aux membres du personnel, se lit en partie comme suit :\n[traduction]\nL'engagement de la CIBC \u00e0 ramener sa base de co\u00fbts au m\u00eame niveau que celui de ses comp\u00e9titeurs entra\u00eenera une restructuration importante au cours des prochains mois [...]\nCette initiative de restructuration de la CIBC entra\u00eenera vraisemblablement, dans l'imm\u00e9diat, pour les membres du personnel, une diminution des occasions de r\u00e9affectation. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous devons accorder plus de flexibilit\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s dont les emplois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis, et ce, afin de leur permettre d'examiner d'abord les perspectives de carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC et de leur fournir un plus grand soutien afin de les aider dans ce qui sera peut-\u00eatre une recherche d'emploi plus longue \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Banque.\n[12] Le courriel mentionne clairement qu'il y aurait [traduction] moins d'occasions de r\u00e9affectation et que les employ\u00e9s seraient encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 rechercher des emplois \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC. Je retiens la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Durrer selon laquelle il ne croyait pas qu'il serait touch\u00e9 par la restructuration et que son emploi serait \u00e9limin\u00e9, bien que d\u00e8s qu'il eut re\u00e7u le courriel susmentionn\u00e9, il savait que des changements importants se produiraient bient\u00f4t.\n[13] Je conclus qu'une partie de la restructuration comportait l'\u00e9limination d'emplois inutiles et de doubles emplois ainsi qu'une r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts. Il y a lieu de s'attendre \u00e0 de telles mesures dans ce genre de processus. Rien dans la preuve n'indique que les travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s furent cibl\u00e9s ou que des emplois furent \u00e9limin\u00e9s en fonction de l'\u00e2ge des employ\u00e9s. Par exemple, dans son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix ainsi que dans son rapport d'expert, M. Michael Banks, un expert en mati\u00e8re de retraite et de science actuarielle, associ\u00e9 chez Mercer Human Resources Consulting, a donn\u00e9 une vue d'ensemble [traduction] des taux de cessation d'emplois des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par le Programme de soutien \u00e0 la transition (PST) qui figurent dans [le] rapport sur l'\u00e9valuation actuarielle du r\u00e9gime de retraite de la CIBC au 31 octobre 2005. Dans la cat\u00e9gorie d'\u00e2ge 21 \u00e0 30 ans, le taux de cessation d'emploi des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par le PST \u00e9tait de 1 pour 100 pour chacun des \u00e2ges compris dans cette fourchette. Dans la cat\u00e9gorie d'\u00e2ge 31 \u00e0 52 ans, le taux \u00e9tait 1,5 pour 100 pour chacun des \u00e2ges compris dans cette fourchette. M. Banks a conclu ce qui suit : [traduction] Le taux de cessation d'emploi des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par le PST est uniforme quant aux employ\u00e9s \u00e2g\u00e9s de 31 \u00e0 52 ans. Rien n'indique qu'un tri fut fait en fonction de l'\u00e2ge dans cette fourchette. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de M. Banks.\nC. La Politique sur le maintien de l'emploi (PME) et le Programme de soutien \u00e0 la restructuration (PSR) [14] En 1992 et 1993, la CIBC a cr\u00e9\u00e9, respectivement, sa Politique sur le maintien de l'emploi (PME) et son Programme de soutien \u00e0 la restructuration (PSR). La PME et le PSR s'appliquaient en parall\u00e8le afin de donner, aux employ\u00e9s qui avaient perdu leur emploi dans le cadre de l'abolition de postes, la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9 dans un autre poste au sein de la Banque ou, si cela n'\u00e9tait pas possible, la possibilit\u00e9 de recevoir une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part ainsi que d'autres avantages, notamment du counseling, de la r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle, des conseils juridiques et financiers, et ce, dans le but de les aider \u00e0 vivre leur transition vers un emploi \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC.\n[15] L'un des avantages les plus importants offerts aux employ\u00e9s admissibles touch\u00e9s par la restructuration avait trait au r\u00e9gime de retraite de la Banque. Ces employ\u00e9s, s'ils avaient 55 ans \u00e0 la date de cessation de leur emploi ou s'ils avaient entre 53 et 55 ans et que leur indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part (un maximum de deux ans) \u00e9tait suffisante pour qu'il puisse faire le pont jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans, avaient droit \u00e0 une dispense de la r\u00e9duction actuarielle de retraite anticip\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue en vertu du r\u00e9gime de retraite. En d'autres mots, ils \u00e9taient admissibles \u00e0 recevoir imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e0 leur d\u00e9part de la Banque, une pension non r\u00e9duite. Dans les circonstances normales, s'ils choisissaient de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans, ils pouvaient recevoir imm\u00e9diatement une pension r\u00e9duite ou recevoir \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans une pension diff\u00e9r\u00e9e non r\u00e9duite. Cette dispense de la r\u00e9duction de la pension de retraite anticip\u00e9e est un avantage important qui fut conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s dont l'emploi avait pris fin durant cette p\u00e9riode. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de l'expert en r\u00e9gime de retraite, M. Michael Banks, qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'un avantage tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et tr\u00e8s rare en milieu de travail. \u00c0 la page 3 de son rapport, M. Banks \u00e9crit que, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 4 ans se terminant le 31 octobre 2004, 1 795 employ\u00e9s, \u00e2g\u00e9s de 20 \u00e0 53 ans, ont perdu leur emploi \u00e0 la CIBC et 700 employ\u00e9s ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans et plus (y compris les personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es de 53 \u00e0 55 ans qui ont fait le pont jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans).\n[16] Comme nous en discuterons plus loin, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment central de la plainte de M. Durrer est que la CIBC ne lui a pas permis de continuer \u00e0 travailler jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge cl\u00e9 de 53 ans. Si elle le lui avait permis, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa p\u00e9riode d'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part d'une dur\u00e9e maximum de 24 mois, M. Durrer aurait atteint l'\u00e2ge cible de 55 ans. Il aurait ensuite eut droit \u00e0 la dispense de la r\u00e9duction de pension, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant ainsi d'une pension imm\u00e9diate non r\u00e9duite. Par cons\u00e9quent, les actes de la CIBC ont emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Durrer de pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet avantage. La CIBC a r\u00e9pondu en affirmant que M. Durrer n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas admissible \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet avantage g\u00e9n\u00e9reux qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas, au d\u00e9part, l\u00e9galement tenue d'accorder \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s licenci\u00e9s. M. Durrer \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 48 ans en octobre 1999 lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que le poste qu'il occupait au service de la Conformit\u00e9 serait aboli \u00e0 compter du 7 janvier 2000. Malgr\u00e9 les trois postes temporaires qu'il a par la suite occup\u00e9s au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de deux ans et demi (il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 50 ans et demi \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0) et malgr\u00e9 les 2 ann\u00e9es d'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 cette combinaison, il fut consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant 52 ans et demi, soit 2 ans et demi de moins que l'\u00e2ge cl\u00e9 exig\u00e9.\n[17] La CIBC a introduit dans son PSR des modifications exceptionnelles qui prenaient effet le 1er septembre 1999. Ces modifications pr\u00e9voyaient l'attribution d'indemnit\u00e9s de licenciement en lieu de pr\u00e9avis ainsi que l'attribution d'une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part am\u00e9lior\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s, au Canada, qui avaient re\u00e7u un avis d'abolition de leur emploi en raison de la restructuration. Je retiens la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la Banque selon lequel un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir des postes temporaires (p. ex. M. Durrer) qui leur donnaient la possibilit\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir de nouvelles comp\u00e9tences dans le but d'obtenir un nouveau poste permanent ou dans le but de gagner du temps suppl\u00e9mentaire pour pouvoir trouver un emploi \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC. Comme nous en discuterons plus loin, l'intention ou l'objectif du programme de la CIBC \u00e9tait de ne pas permettre aux employ\u00e9s de se servir de postes ou d'affectations temporaires pour accumuler du temps dans le but d'\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 faire le pont vers la retraite. Elle voulait tout simplement que ces postes ou affectations servent comme moyen de trouver un poste permanent au sein de la CIBC ou comme moyen de trouver un emploi \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC.\nD. L'introduction du Programme de soutien \u00e0 la transition (PST) [18] En avril 2001, la CIBC a introduit son Programme de soutien \u00e0 la transition (PST), lequel a remplac\u00e9 la Politique sur le maintien de l'emploi (PME) ainsi que le Programme de soutien \u00e0 la restructuration (PSR). Les employ\u00e9s ont eu le choix entre continuer \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de la PME et du PSR ou se pr\u00e9valoir du PST. M. Durrer a choisi de se pr\u00e9valoir du PST car les avantages pr\u00e9vus dans ce programme \u00e9taient plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reux que ceux qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus dans les anciens programmes. Bien qu'il continuerait de recevoir une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de 2 ans, la valeur en argent de l'ensemble des indemnit\u00e9s (y compris les autres formes de soutien) \u00e9tait plus grande que la valeur des avantages pr\u00e9vus dans le PST. La dispense de la r\u00e9duction de la pension de retraite anticip\u00e9e existait \u00e9galement dans le PST, mais M. Durrer n'\u00e9tait toujours pas admissible \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de ce g\u00e9n\u00e9reux avantage.\n[19] Le r\u00f4le du gestionnaire de soutien \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent dans le nouveau programme par rapport aux anciens programmes. Dans le PST, bien que le gestionnaire de soutien aidait l'employ\u00e9 licenci\u00e9 \u00e0 se trouver un autre emploi, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qu'incombait la responsabilit\u00e9 de se trouver un emploi. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, peu importe le programme dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait M. Durrer \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s proactif et faisait preuve de beaucoup d'initiative dans sa recherche d'un emploi temporaire et d'un emploi permanent au sein de la CIBC. Il n'a pas fait preuve de la m\u00eame diligence en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la recherche d'un emploi \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC. M. Durrer a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Il ne fait donc absolument aucun doute que je concentrais ma recherche d'emploi \u00e0 l'interne. Plus tard, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nMais je l'ai dit plus t\u00f4t et je le r\u00e9p\u00e9terai encore, j'ai beaucoup investi dans la CIBC. C'est l\u00e0 que ma vie, ma vie professionnelle notamment, s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. La valeur de mes investissements dans le fond de pension \u00e9tait importante et j'aimais mon travail.\nJ'imagine que, dans mon esprit, je ne voulais pas m'en aller comme \u00e7a, tout simplement, sans me battre, et je crois que je me suis battu pendant le reste du temps que j'ai pass\u00e9 \u00e0 la CIBC.\nE. La restructuration du service de la Conformit\u00e9 [20] Le nouveau PDG a nomm\u00e9 un nouveau Premier vice-pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 - l'agent en chef charg\u00e9 de l'observation des normes de la Banque. C'est au bureau de New York qu'on est all\u00e9 chercher ce dernier : il s'agissait d'Eric Young. Celui-ci faisait l'aller-retour entre New York et Toronto. Il s'est vu confier la responsabilit\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9 pour l'ensemble de la Banque. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, la CIBC \u00e9tait dot\u00e9e de trois services de la Conformit\u00e9, un au groupe Personnel et Commercial, un \u00e0 March\u00e9s mondiaux et un au Centre de service aux entreprises. M. Young a en fin de compte d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de regrouper les trois services en un seul service, int\u00e9gr\u00e9 et efficace. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de M. Young selon lequel que bien que la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts constitu\u00e2t un facteur ou un \u00e9l\u00e9ment (quoique non essentiel) dont il devait tenir compte, on ne lui avait donn\u00e9 aucun mandat, ni aucune directive, concernant le montant des co\u00fbts \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ou concernant la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der. L'objectif vis\u00e9, de son point de vue, n'\u00e9tait pas de r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts mais de [traduction] cr\u00e9er un service de la Conformit\u00e9 efficace. En fait, il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les sommes \u00e9conomis\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cet exercice devaient probablement \u00eatre r\u00e9investies dans le produit final. Il ne s'est vu imposer aucun plafond budg\u00e9taire pr\u00e9cis.\n[21] Selon M. Young, il y avait beaucoup \u00e0 faire dans le cadre de sa t\u00e2che. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a renvoy\u00e9 aux notes manuscrites qu'il avait prises \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve. M. Young faisait \u00e9tat dans ses notes de l'ancien monde de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque par opposition au nouveau monde qu'il envisageait de cr\u00e9er. Lorsqu'il est arriv\u00e9, les services de la Conformit\u00e9 \u00e9taient marqu\u00e9s par le double emploi, parfois par le triple emploi. Ces emplois \u00e9taient des emplois \u00e0 temps partiel et des emplois non productifs. Il songeait \u00e0 regrouper les trois services de la Conformit\u00e9 en un seul service qui serait de nature multidisciplinaire (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il serait compos\u00e9 d'avocats, de comptables, etc.). Les agents charg\u00e9s de l'observation des normes seraient plus proactifs ([traduction] ils ne seraient pas assis dans leur tour d'ivoire \u00e0 \u00e9mettre des avis de politique de conformit\u00e9 [...] ou des avis de modification r\u00e8glementaire aux utilisateurs de l'entreprise), ils travailleraient \u00e0 temps plein et poss\u00e8deraient une formation et des comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. M. Young voulait que ses agents charg\u00e9s de l'observation des normes soient plus ind\u00e9pendants sur le plan institutionnel, comme le sont les v\u00e9rificateurs. Le nouveau monde de la conformit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de l'ancien monde. La r\u00e9forme et la restructuration \u00e9taient \u00e9galement importantes, selon M. Young, en raison de la nature changeante de la conformit\u00e9 au sein de l'industrie bancaire. La conformit\u00e9 devenait de plus en plus complexe car les lois et les r\u00e8glements \u00e9taient de plus en plus contraignants. La Banque \u00e9tait de plus en plus expos\u00e9e aux risques. L'objectif primordial de M. Young \u00e9tait de [traduction] prot\u00e9ger la Banque dans son ensemble.\n[22] Une partie de la restructuration de la Conformit\u00e9 allait toucher le personnel des trois services de la Conformit\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il n'avait aucune notion pr\u00e9con\u00e7ue quant \u00e0 savoir combien il resterait de postes. Ce qui \u00e9tait certain, c'\u00e9tait qu'il en resterait moins. Cela n'a rien d'\u00e9tonnant compte tenu de son opinion qu'il y avait du double emploi et parfois du triple emploi au sein des services de la Conformit\u00e9 de la CIBC. Il y avait notamment du double emploi dans les postes de direction des trois services de la Conformit\u00e9.\n(i) Le processus utilis\u00e9 par M. Young [23] M. Young devait d\u00e9cider quels postes seraient conserv\u00e9s, quels postes seraient abolis et quels postes seraient modifi\u00e9s ou restructur\u00e9s. Et, \u00e9videmment, il devait d\u00e9cider ce qu'il fallait faire avec les employ\u00e9s qui occupaient ces postes dans les trois services de la Conformit\u00e9. Il a interrog\u00e9 diverses personnes travaillant dans les services de la Conformit\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement des cadres\/gestionnaires ainsi que des agents charg\u00e9s de l'observation des normes. Il a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 avec les gens d'affaires (les employ\u00e9s de la CIBC qui assuraient la liaison et communiquaient avec les agents charg\u00e9s de l'observation des normes) [traduction] afin d'obtenir leurs points de vue sur les activit\u00e9s de la Conformit\u00e9 ainsi que leur point de vue sur divers gestionnaires\/directeurs travaillant \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 savoir si ceux-ci ajoutaient de la valeur. De plus, M. Young a consult\u00e9 des personnes travaillant aux Ressources humaines, notamment Mme Cindy Nicholls, la conseill\u00e8re principale en ressources humaines qui a trait\u00e9 avec M. Durrer dans les ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi.\n[24] Il est important de noter que M. Young a rencontr\u00e9 (dans certains cas plus d'une fois) tous les employ\u00e9s dont il envisageait le licenciement ou dont il envisageait d'abolir le poste. Il a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 les dossiers de rendement et les dossiers personnels de ces derniers.\n(ii) Les crit\u00e8res utilis\u00e9s par M. Young [25] La CIBC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des extraits du cahier de notes de M. Young que celui-ci a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 l'automne 1999 et qu'il a remis \u00e0 la CIBC lorsqu'il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi. On s'est longuement \u00e9tendu sur ces extraits en interrogatoire principal et en contre-interrogatoire. Il suffit de dire que les extraits comportaient des notes abr\u00e9g\u00e9es sous forme de sch\u00e9mas et de fl\u00e8ches. Les extraits n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e9crits en prose; ils ne comportaient aucune phrase compl\u00e8te. M. Young avait une bonne m\u00e9moire des \u00e9v\u00e9nements m\u00eame si ceux-ci s'\u00e9taient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s plus de sept ans auparavant.\n[26] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement les extraits du cahier de notes de M. Young ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier quant \u00e0 ceux-ci, je conclus que M. Young a tenu compte des facteurs importants suivants lorsqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il devait garder un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 :\nL'employ\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait-il une bonne compr\u00e9hension de la conformit\u00e9 et de ce qu'elle comportait; Quelle exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9glementation ou de conformit\u00e9 (y compris la formation) l'employ\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait-il; Quelles furent les opinions des gens d'affaires \u00e0 propos de l'employ\u00e9 de la Conformit\u00e9. L'employ\u00e9 ajoutait-il de la valeur au nouveau monde du service de la Conformit\u00e9?\n[27] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Young, je conclus que, \u00e0 un moindre degr\u00e9, celui-ci a \u00e9galement tenu compte de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (salaire et avantages sociaux) des divers employ\u00e9s en d\u00e9cidant s'il devait ou non les garder \u00e0 l'emploi de la CIBC. L'un des extraits du cahier de notes, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, aurait pu servir de fondement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de M. Young quant \u00e0 savoir s'il devait garder ces employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de la CIBC et (ou) aurait pu servir comme \u00e9valuation du rendement quant \u00e0 savoir si on devait leur accorder des primes ou des points d'\u00e9quipe ce qui, selon M. Young, s'est produit au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode (octobre 1999). Lors du nouvel interrogatoire, M. Young a affirm\u00e9 que ses notes ont servi \u00e0 ces deux fins. Je retiens son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point.\n[28] Je conclus \u00e9galement que M. Young ne faisait pas que d\u00e9cider quels employ\u00e9s il devait garder et quels employ\u00e9s il devait licencier dans les trois services de la Conformit\u00e9. Il examinait \u00e9galement quels postes il devait conserver, quels postes il devait abolir et quels postes il devait diviser et r\u00e9partir en d'autres postes. Cet exercice comprenait l'examen de la question du double emploi quant aux postes de direction (comme le poste de M. Durrer) au sein des trois services de la Conformit\u00e9.\n(iii) Le r\u00e9sultat : abolition de postes et cessation d'emplois [29] Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de M. Young selon lequel la t\u00e2che susmentionn\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas facile. Compte tenu de la preuve, je conclus que les d\u00e9cisions de M. Young ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en la cr\u00e9ation d'un seul service de la Conformit\u00e9 dont l'effectif est diversifi\u00e9 sur le plan du sexe, de l'\u00e2ge, des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et de l'exp\u00e9rience.\n[30] Deux tableaux cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la CIBC ainsi qu'une note manuscrite r\u00e9dig\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque par M. Young ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve quant \u00e0 la composition selon l'\u00e2ge du groupe des employ\u00e9s dont les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9s et du groupe des employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de la CIBC. La preuve donne \u00e0 penser que les employ\u00e9s figurant dans le tableau fusionn\u00e9 et modifi\u00e9 ci-dessous \u00e9taient des cadres\/gestionnaires qui travaillaient aux services de la Conformit\u00e9.\nEmploy\u00e9s dont les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis2\nNOM \u00c2GE LORS DE LA RESTRUCTURATION \u00c2GE PAR RAPPORT \u00c0 CELUI DE M.

L'autre tableau portait l'en-t\u00eate suivant : Gard\u00e9s et Licenci\u00e9s. Selon moi, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de vive voix et la preuve documentaire, les gestionnaires dont les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis ont \u00e9galement perdu leur emploi.\n[31] Le tableau ci-dessus indique que les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9s (sauf l'employ\u00e9 I) \u00e9taient les employ\u00e9s les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s, notamment l'employ\u00e9 H qui avait 11 ans de plus que M. Durrer. De plus, trois des employ\u00e9s dont les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis \u00e9taient plus jeunes que M. Durrer. Je traiterai de l'importance de ce point plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Qu'il suffise de dire qu'il s'agit d'une preuve concluante que M. Young ne ciblait aucunement M. Durrer ou d'autres personnes en raison de leur \u00e2ge.\nF. L'examen fait par M. Young quant \u00e0 M. Durrer et quant \u00e0 son emploi [32] M. Young a pris la d\u00e9cision d'abolir le poste de M. Durrer et de ne pas r\u00e9affecter ce dernier au sein du nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9. Il a affirm\u00e9 que le poste de directeur, service d'experts-conseils en risque d'entreprise, services bancaires de d\u00e9tail de M. Durrer \u00e9tait exc\u00e9dentaire et inutile et qu'il avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 environ 50 p. 100 des t\u00e2ches et des responsabilit\u00e9s de ce poste \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s de la Banque. Quant \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision d'abolir le poste de M. Durrer, M. Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Je n'avais pas besoin qu'autant de personnes accomplissent ces diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches [comme les t\u00e2ches de M. Durrer] au sein du service. Il voulait dire par l\u00e0 qu'il n'avait pas besoin d'un gestionnaire \u00e0 temps plein pour effectuer les t\u00e2ches de M. Durrer. Le plaignant n'a pas contest\u00e9 cette preuve.\n[33] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Durrer n'a pas principalement port\u00e9 sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de M. Young d'\u00e9liminer son poste ou sur le fait qu'il ne fut pas r\u00e9affect\u00e9 au sein du service de la Conformit\u00e9. M. Durrer \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t irrit\u00e9 que la CIBC ait mis fin, en avril 2002, \u00e0 son d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis prolong\u00e9 de 28 mois, l'emp\u00eachant ainsi d'obtenir un quatri\u00e8me emploi temporaire (et un cinqui\u00e8me au besoin) afin de l'amener jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge magique de 53 ans, d'o\u00f9 il aurait pu faire le pont jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans et pouvoir ainsi b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une retraite imm\u00e9diate non r\u00e9duite. Ironiquement, si M. Durrer avait obtenu un poste permanent au sein de la CIBC (ce que, selon ses dires, il cherchait \u00e0 obtenir ainsi que des postes temporaires), il n'aurait plus \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible au PST et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'aurait plus eu droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part ou \u00e0 l'avantage de l'\u00e2ge d'o\u00f9 il pouvait faire le pont sur lequel il a mis l'accent tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente cause (l'anneau de laiton comme l'avocat de la CIBC l'appelle). Je conclus que M. Young avait des motifs d'affaires l\u00e9gitimes, qui n'avaient pas rapport avec l'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer, pour arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision d'abolir le poste de M. Durrer. Je reconnais l'expertise de M. Young en mati\u00e8re de conformit\u00e9 au sein de l'industrie bancaire. C'est \u00e0 lui qu'il revenait de prendre cette d\u00e9cision et il \u00e9tait bien plac\u00e9 pour la prendre.\n[34] Qu'en est-il de la d\u00e9cision de M. Young de ne pas r\u00e9affecter M. Durrer au sein du nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9? M. Young a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Durrer ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 ses exigences pour occuper un poste au sein du nouveau mod\u00e8le de la Conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la CIBC. En effet, M. Durrer a pass\u00e9 la plus grande partie de sa vie professionnelle \u00e0 la CIBC \u00e0 uvrer dans le domaine des services bancaires de d\u00e9tail. Il travaillait \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 depuis moins de trois ans. M. Young a rencontr\u00e9 M. Durrer \u00e0 quelques reprises. Il a examin\u00e9 son dossier personnel et il a discut\u00e9 avec ses gestionnaires et ses utilisateurs d'entreprise. M. Young a estim\u00e9 que le plaignant [traduction] ne comprenait pas les questions de conformit\u00e9. M. Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un gestionnaire de projet et il ne travaillait pas \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 depuis longtemps. M. Young a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que les utilisateurs d'entreprise avec lesquels il avait discut\u00e9 estimaient que M. Durrer ne poss\u00e9dait pas les comp\u00e9tences qui ajoutent de la valeur \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9. En termes simples, il ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de droit, de comptabilit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9glementation que les autres personnes poss\u00e9daient et que M. Young recherchait. En ce qui concerne le fait que M. Durrer ne poss\u00e9dait qu'une douzi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e d'\u00e9tudes, M. Young a affirm\u00e9 qu'il aurait gard\u00e9 ce dernier \u00e0 l'emploi de la CIBC, malgr\u00e9 qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas d'\u00e9tudes postsecondaires, s'il avait poss\u00e9d\u00e9 l'exp\u00e9rience et la compr\u00e9hension exig\u00e9es quant aux questions de conformit\u00e9. M. Durrer a lui-m\u00eame avou\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste uvrant dans une industrie qui devenait de plus en plus sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e, comme c'\u00e9tait notamment le cas \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9.\nG. L'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer en tant qu'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d'appr\u00e9ciation [35] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Young s'il savait quel \u00e2ge avait M. Durrer. Apr\u00e8s tout, ce renseignement figurait dans le dossier personnel de M. Durrer qu'il avait examin\u00e9. Compte tenu des diverses r\u00e9ponses de M. Durrer aux nombreuses questions pos\u00e9es en interrogatoire principal, en contre-interrogatoire et en r\u00e9interrogatoire, je conclus que M. Young aurait pu prendre connaissance de la date de naissance de M. Durrer, mais qu'il est certain qu'il n'a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Qu'il ait oui ou non pris connaissance de la date de naissance de M. Durrer n'est pas une question importante. Apr\u00e8s tout, juste en faisant le calcul math\u00e9matique (en 1999, M. Durrer travaillait depuis plus de 28 ans \u00e0 la CIBC et on savait qu'il n'avait pas pu commencer \u00e0 travailler bien longtemps avant l'\u00e2ge de 18 ans), il savait que M. Durrer devait \u00eatre dans la quarantaine avanc\u00e9e, \u00e0 tout le moins. M. Young savait qu'il n'avait pas affaire \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 \u00e2g\u00e9 de 25 ou 35 ans.\n[36] Fait plus important, l'\u00e2ge est-il entr\u00e9 en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9cision de M. Young d'\u00e9liminer le poste de M. Durrer et (ou) de ne pas le r\u00e9affecter au sein du service de la Conformit\u00e9? Je ne crois pas. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage suivant de M. Young : [traduction] S'il avait poss\u00e9d\u00e9 l'exp\u00e9rience, alors je l'aurais gard\u00e9 1 pour d'autres postes, mais il ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'exp\u00e9rience et je n'avais pas besoin du poste.\n[37] M. Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9, dans diverses parties de son interrogatoire principal, de son contre-interrogatoire et de son r\u00e9interrogatoire, quant \u00e0 la question de l'\u00e2ge. Comme il s'agit d'une question cruciale et qu'une certaine partie du t\u00e9moignage que M. Young a rendu lors du premier interrogatoire \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t \u00e9quivoque ou ambigu, je mentionne ci-dessous divers extraits de la transcription portant sur cette question :\n[traduction]\nL'interrogatoire principal (page 564 de la transcription)\nM. GROSMAN : En \u00e9valuant M. Durrer et en prenant la d\u00e9cision d'\u00e9liminer son poste, avez-vous tenu compte, si tant soi peu, de son \u00e2ge?\nM. YOUNG : Non.\nLe contre-interrogatoire (pages 588, 589, 594)\nM. MORIN : [...] Au moment o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u l'avis, M. Durrer venait tout juste d'avoir 48 ans. Vous souvenez-vous de cela monsieur?\nM. YOUNG : Dans le contexte de son licenciement, oui.\nM. MORIN : D'accord.\nM. YOUNG : Sur le plan de l'\u00e2ge, non, parce que cela n'avait pas vraiment d'importance pour moi. Ce que je veux dire par l\u00e0, c'est que, comme je viens des \u00c9tats-Unis, l'\u00e2ge n'\u00e9tait pas vraiment quelque chose dont je devais tenir compte. Mais, vous savez, selon - vous fondez vos d\u00e9cisions sur le rendement et le besoin.\n[...] [...]\nM. MORIN : En examinant son dossier personnel, vous avez d\u00fb regarder sa date de naissance?\nM. YOUNG : J'aurais certainement pu.\nM. MORIN : D'accord.\nM. YOUNG : J'imagine que je veux simplement souligner qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un facteur crucial.\n[...] [...]\nM. MORIN : Donc, en examinant son dossier personnel, dans le cadre de l'examen global de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, vous saviez quelle \u00e9tait sa date de naissance et vous saviez quel \u00e2ge il avait?\nM. YOUNG : J'aurais certainement pu le savoir. Disons que je ne cherchais pas \u00e0 le savoir.\nLe r\u00e9interrogatoire (pages 640 \u00e0 642)\nM. GROSMAN : [...] Vous souvenez-vous d'avoir vu la date de naissance de M. Durrer?\nM. YOUNG : Non, je peux peut-\u00eatre vous donner quelques explications?\nM. MORIN : 2 Bien s\u00fbr, pas de probl\u00e8me.\nM. YOUNG : Comme je viens des \u00c9tats-Unis, les dates de naissance sont moins pertinentes en ce qui a trait - moins pertinentes en ce qui a trait aux crit\u00e8res. Il s'agit tout simplement d'un environnement diff\u00e9rent, donc comme je viens de l\u00e0, ce n'\u00e9tait pas quelque chose que je cherchais vraiment \u00e0 savoir.\nM. GROSMAN : Que voulez-vous dire par moins pertinentes?\nM. YOUNG : C'est - la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge est - bon, premi\u00e8rement, il y a beaucoup de poursuites aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Deuxi\u00e8mement, en raison de cela, demander l'\u00e2ge ou tenir compte de l'\u00e2ge constitue d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale un signal d'alerte aux \u00c9tats-Unis en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la gestion des personnes.\nC'est quelque chose auquel on doit \u00eatre sensibilis\u00e9. Donc, comme je suis venu au Canada pour restructurer le service et pour tout simplement g\u00e9rer des personnes et compte tenu de l'exp\u00e9rience que je poss\u00e9dais en gestion m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment, je savais que les dates de naissance et l'\u00e2ge \u00e9taient moins pertinentes en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 la direction du service.\nM. GROSMAN : D'accord. Donc, lorsque vous \u00e9valuez M. Durrer, l'\u00e2ge est-il un facteur qui entre un tant soit peu en ligne de compte?\nM. YOUNG : Il s'agit d'un facteur, mais pas d'un facteur d\u00e9terminant. C'est - vous savez, quand on parlait de l'exp\u00e9rience, du rendement, de la valeur ajout\u00e9e, etc.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Excusez-moi, l'\u00e2ge est un facteur, mais pas un facteur d\u00e9terminant. Un facteur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 quoi?\nM. YOUNG : Il ne s'agit que du rendement, quand il est question d'un agent de conformit\u00e9 ou d'un autre employ\u00e9, l'\u00e2ge, -- particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la restructuration, est l\u00e0, mais ce que je tente d'expliquer, c'est qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un facteur d\u00e9terminant pour ce qui est de d\u00e9cider si on doit oui ou non garder des employ\u00e9s.\nLE PR\u00c9SIDENT : Excusez-moi, une seconde. Il ne s'agit pas d'un facteur d\u00e9terminant pour ce qui est de savoir si on doit oui ou non garder des employ\u00e9s, mais il s'agit d'un facteur pour ce qui est de savoir si vous allez oui ou non garder des employ\u00e9s, n'est-ce pas?\nM. YOUNG : Oui, et la raison pour laquelle je dis cela, comme je viens des \u00c9tats-Unis, en tant que gestionnaire, un gestionnaire devrait voir \u00e0 ne prendre aucune d\u00e9cision en fonction de l'\u00e2ge.\n[38] De prime abord, on pourrait interpr\u00e9ter certaines des d\u00e9clarations de M. Young comme \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une admission de responsabilit\u00e9 qu'il a tenu compte de l'\u00e2ge, m\u00eame si ce ne fut que dans une faible mesure, pour d\u00e9cider de ne pas garder M. Durrer au service de la Conformit\u00e9. Toutefois, lorsque l'on examine l'ensemble de son t\u00e9moignage et de ses actions concernant la r\u00e9organisation de la Conformit\u00e9, c'est un tableau diff\u00e9rent qui appara\u00eet. Je conclus que l'\u00e2ge ne fut pas un facteur utilis\u00e9 par M. Young au d\u00e9triment du plaignant. Je tire cette conclusion pour les raisons suivantes :\nLa preuve objective du tableau sur lequel figuraient les noms des employ\u00e9s, class\u00e9s selon l'\u00e2ge, dont les postes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis\/conserv\u00e9s donne \u00e0 penser que l'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment; Dans les nombreux \u00e9changes susmentionn\u00e9s, M. Young r\u00e9p\u00e8te les d\u00e9clarations que la prise en compte de l'\u00e2ge constitue de la discrimination et que l'on ne doit pas en tenir compte - c'est un signal d'alarme. Il nie \u00e9galement cat\u00e9goriquement, en interrogatoire principal, qu'il a tenu compte de l'\u00e2ge dans le cadre de sa d\u00e9cision d'abolir le poste de M. Durrer; Personne n'a jamais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Young comment l'\u00e2ge fut utilis\u00e9 comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de consid\u00e9ration dans le cas de M. Durrer et s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte, l'a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avantage ou au d\u00e9triment de M. Durrer ou l'\u00e2ge a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement ignor\u00e9 - un facteur neutre. Hypoth\u00e9tiquement, si M. Young a tenu compte de l'\u00e2ge de M. Young comme facteur positif (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'on a tenu compte des avantages dont jouissait le participant comme l'exp\u00e9rience, la maturit\u00e9, la connaissance de la Banque, etc.), mais que les facteurs n\u00e9gatifs non fond\u00e9s sur l'\u00e2ge ont eu plus de poids, cela ne constitue pas un traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Durrer en raison de son \u00e2ge au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP; J'interpr\u00e8te les commentaires c'est l\u00e0 et il ne s'agit pas d'un facteur d\u00e9terminant comme signifiant qu'il est impossible de ne pas ne pas tenir compte de l'\u00e2ge - il figure dans le dossier personnel d'un employ\u00e9, il est possible de faire le calcul : si un gestionnaire conna\u00eet le nombre d'ann\u00e9es de service d'un employ\u00e9 et qu'il discute avec lui, il peut dire si l'employ\u00e9 est \u00e2g\u00e9, par exemple, de 25 ou de 55 ans. L'\u00e2ge est une caract\u00e9ristique \u00e9vidente. Cela n'est pas comme affirmer, par exemple, que l'on s'est servi de l'\u00e2ge d'un employ\u00e9 au d\u00e9triment de ce dernier, que l'on a agi en fonction de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s d\u00e9favorables, st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9s, fond\u00e9s sur l'\u00e2ge et que cela a eu pour cons\u00e9quence que l'employ\u00e9 s'est vu refuser un emploi; M. Young, qui occupait \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 un poste sup\u00e9rieur dans le cadre duquel il a eu \u00e0 traiter des questions juridiques et r\u00e9glementaires complexes et qui a travaill\u00e9 dans un environnement litigieux comme celui des \u00c9tats-Unis, est sensibilis\u00e9 (comme il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage) \u00e0 l'interdiction juridique voulant qu'un employeur n'a pas le droit de licencier une personne en raison de son \u00e2ge.\n[39] Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que M. Young est un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Il a rendu un t\u00e9moignage sinc\u00e8re.\nH. Le 19 octobre 1999 : l'avis de cessation d'emploi remis \u00e0 M. Durrer [40] Le 19 octobre 1999, M. Young et Mme Cindy Nicholls, conseill\u00e8re principale en ressources humaines, ont rencontr\u00e9 M. Durrer. Ils lui ont dit que son poste serait aboli en janvier 2000. Ils lui ont remis une lettre dans laquelle il lui \u00e9tait offert un pr\u00e9avis de cessation d'emploi de 12 semaines, une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part comportant le salaire de 24 mois et d'autres mesures de soutien, notamment de la r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle et du counseling, et ce, en reconnaissance du fait qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 plus de 28 ans \u00e0 la CIBC et en conformit\u00e9 avec le PSR et la PME. Le PSR pr\u00e9voyait que : [traduction] Le d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis, qu'elle soit utilis\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9avis de licenciement ou consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en remplacement est accord\u00e9e en plus des indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part applicables. Les employ\u00e9s pouvaient utiliser le d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis de licenciement pour trouver une affectation temporaire ou un poste permanent au sein de la CIBC.\n[41] Dans le cadre des avantages pr\u00e9vus dans l'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part, M. Durrer a rencontr\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour un agent en replacement afin de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 chercher un autre emploi au sein de la CIBC ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la CIBC. La Banque lui a \u00e9galement fourni un soutien de recherche d'emploi \u00e0 l'interne dispens\u00e9 par Mme Nicholls qui l'a rencontr\u00e9 et (ou) qui a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui (en personne, par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou par courriel) \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises au cours des deux ann\u00e9es et demie qui ont suivi afin de discuter de ses projets de r\u00e9emploi et de l'aider quant \u00e0 ceux-ci.\nI. L'emploi de M. Durrer apr\u00e8s le 19 octobre 1999 : les trois affectations temporaires [42] Pendant les 28 mois qui ont suivi, M. Durrer a prorog\u00e9 de 12 semaines son d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis de licenciement gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des affectations de projet. Je conclus que cela contrevenait \u00e0 l'objectif de la PME, du PSR ainsi que du PST. Je retiens la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Nicholls qu'aucun autre employ\u00e9 ne s'est pr\u00e9valu de ces programmes, gr\u00e2ce aux postes temporaires, aussi longtemps que M. Durrer.\n[43] Je conclus \u00e9galement que le libell\u00e9 du PST, bien qu'il ne soit pas tout \u00e0 fait clair, \u00e9taye la conclusion raisonnable que les employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par le PST ne pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir pendant longtemps de ce programme. La section intitul\u00e9e Affectations temporaires qui figure \u00e0 la page 12 du Guide \u00e0 l'intention de l'employ\u00e9 vis\u00e9 par le PST est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLes affectations temporaires sont une fa\u00e7on pour les employ\u00e9s d'am\u00e9liorer leurs capacit\u00e9s et de se positionner pour trouver un autre emploi au sein de la CIBC.\nComment les affectations temporaires fonctionnent-elles?\nDe fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les affectations temporaires doivent durer moins de 12 mois.\nLe d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis continue de courir m\u00eame si l'employ\u00e9 se voit accorder une affectation temporaire.\nSi l'employ\u00e9 est en affectation temporaire lorsque le d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis prend fin, l'emploi occup\u00e9 par l'employ\u00e9 au sein de la CIBC prend fin et l'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part est vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de l'affectation \u00e0 moins que l'employ\u00e9 ne se trouve un autre poste avant ce moment.\nL'employ\u00e9 aura la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 chercher un poste permanent au sein de la CIBC pendant qu'il est en affectation temporaire.\nCOMMENTAIRE\nSi l'employ\u00e9 trouve un autre emploi au sein de la CIBC pendant l'affectation temporaire, l'employ\u00e9 n'aura plus droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part pr\u00e9vu au Programme.\n[44] Je conclus que la CIBC utilise ci-haut le mot poste en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un poste permanent et utilise l'expression affectation temporaire en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un poste temporaire. Une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable est que la Banque utilise \u00e9galement l'expression autre emploi en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un poste permanent. Par exemple, si on examine la premi\u00e8re phrase ci-dessus (une fa\u00e7on pour les employ\u00e9s [...]), il serait illogique si l'expression autre emploi signifiait affectation temporaire. La phrase serait ainsi libell\u00e9e : Les affectations temporaires sont une fa\u00e7on pour les employ\u00e9s d'am\u00e9liorer leurs capacit\u00e9s et de se positionner pour trouver une affectation temporaire au sein de la CIBC. Bien qu'elle ne soit pas tout \u00e0 fait claire, je suis plut\u00f4t enclin \u00e0 croire que la phrase De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les affectations temporaires doivent durer moins de 12 mois signifiait que les employ\u00e9s ne devaient pas se pr\u00e9valoir du PST pendant plus de 12 mois au total. Cela ne voulait pas dire que les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9valaient du PST pouvaient prendre autant d'affectations temporaires qu'ils le d\u00e9siraient, pourvu que chacune des affectations durait moins de 12 mois. Si l'on accepte la m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation (c'est-\u00e0-dire que la CIBC utilise l'expression poste en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un poste permanent), alors la troisi\u00e8me phrase susmentionn\u00e9e donne \u00e0 penser que si un employ\u00e9 est en affectation temporaire lorsque son d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis prend fin, son emploi prendra fin sauf s'il trouve un poste permanent avant ce moment.\n[45] La CIBC n'a fait part de ses r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 cette pratique en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 M. Durrer que lorsque celui-ci a soulev\u00e9 la question pour la premi\u00e8re fois aupr\u00e8s de Mme Nicholls, le 21 mars 2002, soit 28 mois apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u son avis de licenciement. Donc, bien qu'une interpr\u00e9tation plus raisonnable de la politique que celle qui figure dans le Guide \u00e0 l'intention de l'employ\u00e9 vis\u00e9 par le PST est que les postes temporaires \u00e9taient un moyen de trouver un autre emploi permanent, je peux comprendre comment M. Durrer en est venu \u00e0 croire qu'il avait le droit d'aller de poste temporaire en poste temporaire (bien qu'il cherch\u00e2t \u00e9galement un poste permanent).\n[46] Les trois postes temporaires occup\u00e9s par M. Durrer furent les suivants :\nLeader de la mise en uvre des op\u00e9rations, Gestion selon le rendement : du 4 janvier 2000 au 13 mai 2001. M. Durrer a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de cette possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi par Mme Nicholls et celle-ci l'a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir le poste; Leader des processus, Projet financier des op\u00e9rations de base : du 16 mai 2001 au 31 janvier 2002; Projet de description des processus de centres bancaires : du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2002 au 29 mars 2002.\n[47] La CIBC a accept\u00e9 de laisser \u00e0 M. Durrer les deux semaines qui lui restaient en vertu de son avis initial d'abolition de poste en 1999 dans lequel on lui accordait deux autres semaines pour trouver un autre emploi au sein de la CIBC. Sauf si M. Durrer trouvait un autre poste, sa date de licenciement serait finalement fix\u00e9e au 12 avril 2002, ce qui fut son dernier jour d'emploi \u00e0 la CIBC.\nJ. La r\u00e9union du 4 avril 2002 et la question de ne plus accorder d'affectations temporaires [48] Le 4 avril 2002, Mme Nicholls a remis \u00e0 M. Durrer sa lettre de cessation d'emploi d\u00e9finitive. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage de M. Durrer que ce fut l\u00e0 un moment tr\u00e8s p\u00e9nible pour lui. Apr\u00e8s 31 ann\u00e9es de service, tout indiquait que sa vie professionnelle \u00e0 la CIBC venait de prendre fin.\n[49] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Durrer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'est lors de cette r\u00e9union qu'il a appris pour la premi\u00e8re fois que la CIBC ne prorogerait pas son emploi par le biais d'un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire, s'il en trouvait un. S'il ne trouvait aucun poste permanent \u00e0 la CIBC, au plus tard le 12 avril 2002, son emploi prendrait fin. Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nicholls ainsi que de la preuve documentaire (c'est-\u00e0-dire les courriels), il ressort clairement que Mme Nicholls et ses coll\u00e8gues de Ressources humaines ont fait part, le 21 mars 2002, de leur m\u00e9contentement quant au fait que M. Durrer continuait d'aller de poste temporaire en poste temporaire et qu'il obtiendrait une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part lorsqu'il n'aurait plus de poste. Mme Nicholls a-t-elle carr\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 de songer \u00e0 ce qu'un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire soit accord\u00e9? Comme nous le verrons plus loin, m\u00eame si c'\u00e9tait le cas, si on fait abstraction que les actions de Mme Nicholls furent fond\u00e9es sur l'\u00e2ge, un refus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral constituerait-il une violation de l'article 7 de la LCDP? Les notes que M. Durrer a prises \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque quant \u00e0 la conversation qu'il a eue avec Mme Nicholls le 21 mars 2002 sont ainsi libell\u00e9es :\n[traduction]\n3. Si j'obtenais une autre affectation temporaire de court terme, disons de 6 \u00e0 8 mois, les Ressources humaines donneraient-elles leur accord?\n[R\u00e9ponse de Mme Nicholls] Je ne sais pas. Je vais examiner cela. Je vais parler \u00e0 Jackie Stewart. Je voulais parler \u00e0 Lori Kennedy. On n'a pas voulu me dire quand elle me rappellerait.\n[50] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Durrer a reconnu que, au cours de la conversation qu'il a eue le 21 mars avec Mme Nicholls, lorsqu'il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re si les Ressources humaines donneraient leur accord quant \u00e0 une quatri\u00e8me affectation de court terme s'il en trouvait une, Mme Nicholls a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit : [traduction] Je vais examiner \u00e7a; nous allons y songer, oui. Je souligne que c'est M. Durrer qui a soulev\u00e9 la question pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\n[51] La CIBC conteste l'affirmation de M. Durrer selon laquelle elle lui aurait dit, le 4 avril 2002, qu'elle n'envisageait plus proroger une autre fois son d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'attribution d'un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire. Mme Nicholls a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle voulait tout simplement dire que M. Durrer ne pouvait pas continuer \u00e0 proroger ind\u00e9finiment son d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9avis en pr\u00e9voyant recevoir \u00e9galement l'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de 24 mois \u00e0 la fin de ce d\u00e9lai. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle ne voulait pas dire qu'il ne pouvait pas obtenir une quatri\u00e8me affectation temporaire. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s'il en avait trouv\u00e9 une, elle aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur si cela posait un probl\u00e8me.\n[52] Le courriel envoy\u00e9 par Lori Kennedy (de Ressources humaines) \u00e0 Mme Nicholls le 11 avril 2002 (le jour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le dernier jour de travail de M. Durrer \u00e0 la CIBC) traite de la discussion que Mme Kennedy a eue avec M. Durrer. Il reprend l'opinion que les Ressources humaines ont adopt\u00e9 le point de vue qu'elles ne voyaient pas d'un bon il que M. Durrer obtienne un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire. Toutefois, Mme Kennedy mentionnait ce qui suit dans son courriel : [traduction] J'ai \u00e9galement offert de donner suite avec mon client de Risque afin de voir ce qu'il a et s'il ne pourrait pas l'aider pr\u00e9sentement [...]. Cela peut donner l'impression que les Ressources humaines auraient consenti \u00e0 proroger l'emploi de M. Durrer en lui accordant une quatri\u00e8me affectation temporaire si une telle affectation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 disponible. Mme Kennedy n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Je ne sais pas, par exemple, si Mme Kennedy a offert son aide pour tenter de trouver un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire aupr\u00e8s de son client de Risque ou de tenter de trouver un poste \u00e0 contrat.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nicholls et celui de M. Durrer ainsi qu'apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les courriels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode d'un mois, j'arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la CIBC a certainement donn\u00e9 l'impression qu'elle ne voyait pas d'un bon il que l'emploi de M. Durrer soit prorog\u00e9 si celui-ci trouvait un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire, mais la CIBC n'a pas compl\u00e8tement refus\u00e9 d'envisager cette possibilit\u00e9. Je conclus \u00e9galement que la CIBC n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Durrer de chercher un autre poste temporaire ou un poste permanent comme il l'a manifestement fait.\n[54] En date du 12 avril 2002, M. Durrer n'avait pas trouv\u00e9 de quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire, ni de poste permanent, \u00e0 la CIBC. Nous ne saurons jamais si la CIBC aurait permis \u00e0 M. Durrer de demeurer \u00e0 son emploi dans le cadre d'un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire. J'ajouterais \u00e9galement que m\u00eame si la CIBC lui avait affirm\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait inacceptable qu'il occupe un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire, M. Durrer a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par ses actes qu'il n'acceptait pas cela. Il a activement continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un poste temporaire ou permanent, comme il l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis deux ans et demi. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Durrer a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Apr\u00e8s le 4 avril, j'ai principalement cherch\u00e9 un emploi permanent \u00e0 temps plein. Je n'ai pas abandonn\u00e9 parce que je me suis dit que si je trouvais une affectation pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, cela serait pris en compte en raison de tout ce que j'avais fait pour la Banque au fil des ans.\nK. La date de cessation d'emploi et la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi la cessation d'emploi [55] M. Durrer a re\u00e7u sa lettre de confirmation que sa relation avec la CIBC en tant qu'employ\u00e9 prendrait fin le 12 avril 2002. Il \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 50 ans et demi. Le 1er mai 2002, la CIBC l'a r\u00e9embauch\u00e9, sur une base contractuelle, \u00e0 titre d'analyste commercial (ailleurs qu'au service de la Conformit\u00e9). Il a travaill\u00e9 sur une base contractuelle du 5 juin 2002 au 21 f\u00e9vrier 2003.\n[56] Le 23 juillet 2002, M. Durrer a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait que la CIBC avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en refusant de continuer \u00e0 l'employer en raison de son \u00e2ge, et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En date du dernier jour de l'audience, le 22 novembre 2006, M. Durrer n'avait accept\u00e9 aucune des indemnit\u00e9s de d\u00e9part que lui avait offert la CIBC. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre la CIBC, en Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice, une action qui est le reflet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nV. LE DROIT [57] C'est le plaignant ou la Commission qui a la charge initiale d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de la LCDP : Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28 (O'Malley). Une fois que cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir une justification ou des explications quant \u00e0 la pratique ou quant \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Une fois que l'intim\u00e9 a fait cela, il incombe au plaignant ou \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9montrer que cette justification ou cette explication n'\u00e9tait qu'un pr\u00e9texte quant \u00e0 la pratique ou quant \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire : Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1)(1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), paragraphe 38474.\n[58] Le principe juridique suivant est pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce : pour faire droit \u00e0 une plainte, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la discrimination soient le seul motif de la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un des facteurs [si petit soit-il] qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur (Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes)(2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (T.C.D.P.), paragraphe 69.\nA. La d\u00e9finition de la discrimination [59] Aucune d\u00e9finition du mot discrimination ne figure dans la LCDP. Le juge McIntrye a formul\u00e9 une d\u00e9finition souvent cit\u00e9e dans une ancienne d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada portant sur l'article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s; Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 R.C.S. 143, page 175 :\nJ'affirmerais alors que la discrimination peut se d\u00e9crire comme une distinction, intentionnelle ou non, mais fond\u00e9e sur des motifs relatifs \u00e0 des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles d'un individu ou d'un groupe d'individus, qui a pour effet d'imposer \u00e0 cet individu ou \u00e0 ce groupe des fardeaux, des obligations ou des d\u00e9savantages non impos\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres ou d'emp\u00eacher ou de restreindre l'acc\u00e8s aux possibilit\u00e9s, aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et aux avantages offerts \u00e0 d'autres membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nB. L'\u00e2ge en tant que motif de distinction illicite [60] L'\u00e2ge est l'un des motifs de distinction illicite mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 3(1) de la LCDP. La LCDP pr\u00e9voit diverses d\u00e9fenses, exceptions et justifications quant \u00e0 ce qui serait autrement des pratiques discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur l'\u00e2ge comme les questions concernant l'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 des organisations syndicales, la retraite obligatoire, les assurances et les r\u00e9gimes de retraite (paragraphe 9(2), alin\u00e9as 15(1)b) \u00e0 d). La LCDP pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9\/motif justifiable fond\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge (alin\u00e9as 15(1)a) et 15(1)g). Certaines d\u00e9fenses\/exceptions sont propres au motif de distinction illicite de l'\u00e2ge. Ce qui suit sont des exemples d'introduction dans la loi par le l\u00e9gislateur de certaines exceptions au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral voulant que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge est ill\u00e9gale.\nC. La disposition l\u00e9gislative pertinente [61] La plainte comporte des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles la CIBC aurait viol\u00e9 l'article suivant de la LCDP, lequel porte sur le motif de distinction illicite de l'\u00e2ge :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\nVI. L'ANALYSE A. La CIBC a-t-elle aboli le poste de M. Durrer en octobre 1999 en raison de son \u00e2ge? [62] Compte tenu des conclusions que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9es quant \u00e0 cette question, je conclus que la CIBC n'a pas aboli le poste de M. Durrer en octobre 1999 en raison de son \u00e2ge. M. Young a aboli le poste de M. Durrer pour des raisons commerciales l\u00e9gitimes : le poste \u00e9tait superflu et n'\u00e9tait d'aucune utilit\u00e9 dans le nouveau mod\u00e8le de service de la Conformit\u00e9 consolid\u00e9 et unique. Personne n'a remplac\u00e9 M. Durrer dans ce poste : il a \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli dans le cadre de la restructuration. Le tableau figurant dans le pr\u00e9sent document montre qu'il n'y avait aucune constante entre l'\u00e2ge des gestionnaires \u00e0 la Conformit\u00e9 dont les postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis et l'\u00e2ge de ceux dont les postes n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abolis et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de la CIBC.\n[63] Le nouveau PDG de la CIBC a fait appel \u00e0 M. Young et lui a confi\u00e9 le mandat de cr\u00e9er le service de la Conformit\u00e9 le plus efficace qui soit. M. Young poss\u00e8de les comp\u00e9tences pour s'acquitter de cette t\u00e2che. M. Durrer ne conteste pas cela. J'ajouterais que le Tribunal n'a pas comme mandat de mettre en doute le bien-fond\u00e9 sur le plan commercial des d\u00e9cisions administratives de M. Young. Il doit plut\u00f4t d\u00e9terminer si elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9es de discrimination.\n[64] Le fait que la CIBC ait \u00e9conomis\u00e9 de l'argent en abolissant le poste de M. Durrer ne rend pas l'acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. Si c'\u00e9tait le cas, alors les employeurs ne pourraient proc\u00e9der \u00e0 aucune abolition de poste qui se traduirait par des \u00e9conomies parce qu'un employ\u00e9 qui occupe un poste touch\u00e9 pourrait all\u00e9guer la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge, peu importe son \u00e2ge, c'est-\u00e0-dire que s'il est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 25 ans, il pourrait pr\u00e9tendre avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination parce qu'il est jeune; s'il est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans, il pourrait pr\u00e9tendre avoir fait l'objet d'un traitement d\u00e9favorable parce qu'il est \u00e2g\u00e9. Les concepts de personne jeune et de personne \u00e2g\u00e9e sont relatifs.\nB. La CIBC a-t-elle d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas affecter M. Durrer \u00e0 un autre poste au sein du m\u00eame service (Conformit\u00e9) en raison de son \u00e2ge? [65] Compte tenu de mes conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de M. Young de ne pas offrir un poste \u00e0 M. Durrer dans le nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise, en tout ou en partie, parce que le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 48 ans. Je retiens son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel on lui avait confi\u00e9 la difficile t\u00e2che de consolider, tout en en r\u00e9duisant la taille, les trois services de la Conformit\u00e9 en un seul. M. Durrer ne poss\u00e9dait pas l'exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de conformit\u00e9, ni les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents professionnels, ni la compr\u00e9hension des questions de conformit\u00e9 que M. Young recherchait. Le tableau reproduit dans le pr\u00e9sent document d\u00e9montre, de fa\u00e7on objective, que des employ\u00e9s plus \u00e2g\u00e9s que M. Durrer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de la Banque (notamment un employ\u00e9 11 ans plus \u00e2g\u00e9 que M. Durrer) et que des employ\u00e9s moins \u00e2g\u00e9s que M. Durrer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9s. On ne d\u00e9c\u00e8le aucune tendance selon laquelle les travailleurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s (en l'esp\u00e8ce, des employ\u00e9s qui avaient presque l'\u00e2ge de M. Durer) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9s. En fait, l'\u00e2ge n'a rien eu \u00e0 voir avec les licenciements. Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage suivant de M. Banks : [traduction] Le taux de licenciement en vertu du PST est uniforme quant aux employ\u00e9s dont l'\u00e2ge se situe entre 31 et 52 ans. Rien n'indique qu'il y a eu s\u00e9lection en fonction de l'\u00e2ge dans cette fourchette d'\u00e2ge.\n[66] En ce qui concerne les extraits de la transcription du t\u00e9moignage de M. Young reproduits plus haut dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je fais les observations et je tire les conclusions suivantes. J'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement le t\u00e9moignage int\u00e9gral de M. Young ainsi que la preuve documentaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Selon moi, M. Young n'a pas affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait utilis\u00e9 l'\u00e2ge de M. Young au d\u00e9triment de ce dernier lorsqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il continuerait \u00e0 l'employer au service de la Conformit\u00e9. En effet, on n'a jamais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Young si l'\u00e2ge avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dont il avait tenu compte. M. Young a-t-il utilis\u00e9 ce facteur \u00e0 l'avantage de M. Durrer, \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment ou l'a-t-il utilis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on neutre. \u00c9videmment, soit que M. Young connaissait l'\u00e2ge exact de M. Durrer ou soit qu'il connaissait son \u00e2ge approximatif. M. Young a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] C'est l\u00e0. Il savait quel \u00e2ge avait M. Durrer de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'il savait \u00e0 quel sexe appartenait M. Durrer. Cela ne veut pas dire que, en ne lui accordant pas un poste dans le nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9, il a puni M. Durrer parce que celui-ci avait 48 ans. En d'autres mots, M. Young n'a pas d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 M. Durrer en raison de son \u00e2ge lorsqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le r\u00e9affecter dans le nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9. M. Durrer n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu au service de la Banque parce qu'il ne poss\u00e9dait pas les qualifications recherch\u00e9es par M. Young par rapport aux autres employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient dans les trois services de la Conformit\u00e9 sous examen.\n[67] Conclure autrement et juger que la CIBC aurait d\u00fb garder M. Durrer \u00e0 son emploi au sein du nouveau service de la Conformit\u00e9 parce que celui-ci \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 48 ans, et ce, malgr\u00e9 qu'il ne poss\u00e9d\u00e2t pas les qualifications recherch\u00e9es, aurait des cons\u00e9quences inqui\u00e9tantes. Cela signifierait que l'\u00e2ge d'un employ\u00e9 (peu importe la fourchette d'\u00e2ge) est plus important que son exp\u00e9rience, son instruction, sa valeur ajout\u00e9e, etc. Essentiellement, c'est l'\u00e2ge de l'employ\u00e9 qui est le facteur d\u00e9cisif ou le facteur crucial et non pas ses qualifications.\nC. La CIBC a-t-elle fait obstacle aux tentatives de M. Durrer d'obtenir une r\u00e9affectation au sein de la CIBC, et ce, en raison de son \u00e2ge? [68] Il s'agit du point crucial de la cause de M. Durrer : en ne lui accordant pas une quatri\u00e8me affectation temporaire et en fixant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive sa date de cessation d'emploi, la CIBC a emp\u00each\u00e9 M. Durrer d'atteindre l'\u00e2ge de 53 ans, d'o\u00f9 il pouvait faire le pont vers la retraite anticip\u00e9e. Cela l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 d'atteindre son objectif, c'est-\u00e0-dire obtenir une pension imm\u00e9diate, non r\u00e9duite. Tout au long du t\u00e9moignage de M. Durrer ainsi que dans les lettres qu'il a envoy\u00e9es avant son renvoi \u00e0 la Commission, cette question a constitu\u00e9 le point central de la pr\u00e9occupation de M. Durrer quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle la CIBC l'avait trait\u00e9. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Durrer a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] Pourquoi ne pouvaient-ils pas faire une exception pour moi? Il y avait beaucoup de travail. Il a \u00e9galement tenu des propos semblables dans d'autres parties de son t\u00e9moignage. Il a m\u00eame affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la Banque avait fait faire le pont \u00e0 d'autres personnes qui ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux crit\u00e8res de la PME, du PSR et du PST quant \u00e0 la retraite anticip\u00e9e (c'est-\u00e0-dire que le poste de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait aboli et celui-ci n'avait pas 55 ans, ni entre 53 et 55 ans et ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait pas d'une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part suffisante pour qu'on lui fasse faire le pont jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans). \u00c0 l'audience, la CIBC a ni\u00e9 avoir fait cela. M. Durrer n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aucune preuve probante selon laquelle la CIBC aurait fait faire le pont \u00e0 d'autres personnes qui ne rencontraient pas les crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9.\n[69] Le plaignant d\u00e9clare que divers courriels \u00e9mis en 2002 par Mme Nicholls ainsi que par d'autres personnes travaillant aux Ressources humaines illustrent que la CIBC nuisait \u00e0 ses tentatives de trouver un autre travail. Selon mes conclusions de fait ant\u00e9rieures, j'estime que ce n'est pas le cas. Au contraire, je conclus que la CIBC a apport\u00e9 son aide \u00e0 M. Durrer d\u00e8s que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9, en octobre 1999, que son poste \u00e9tait aboli. La CIBC lui a offert une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse, laquelle, en date de la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience, n'avait pas fait l'objet d'une acceptation de sa part. En vertu de la PME, du PSR et du PST les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s de 45 ans et plus recevaient une prime. M. Durrer s'est vu offrir l'indemnit\u00e9 maximum de 24 mois. La CIBC lui a accord\u00e9 du counseling et de la formation en r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle. Mme Nicholls a rencontr\u00e9 M. Durrer et lui a parl\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but. En effet, c'est \u00e0 la suite de sa suggestion et de son aide que M. Durrer a obtenu sa premi\u00e8re affectation temporaire. Je retiens \u00e9galement le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Nicholls selon lequel elle a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises d'autres membres du personnel des Ressources humaines de la CIBC et qu'ils ont discut\u00e9 ensemble des filons qu'ils pourraient trouver pour M. Durrer.\n[70] De plus, la CIBC a permis \u00e0 M. Durrer ainsi qu'\u00e0 d'autres personnes qui se trouvaient dans la m\u00eame situation que lui de continuer \u00e0 rechercher un emploi permanent au sein de la CIBC, ou m\u00eame un emploi temporaire, dans le but de trouver un travail permanent \u00e0 la CIBC. M. Durrer avait acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me interne informatis\u00e9 d'affichage des postes de la CIBC. En effet, en vertu de la PME, du PSR et du PST, les employ\u00e9s d\u00e9plac\u00e9s comme M. Durrer ont fait l'objet d'une attention plus grande que celle dont ont fait l'objet les autres employ\u00e9s qui appliquaient pour les m\u00eames postes, mais qui ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient pas de la PME, du PSR ou du PST. Les employ\u00e9s comme M. Durrer devaient d\u00e9clarer leur identit\u00e9 dans leur demande et s'ils poss\u00e9daient les m\u00eames qualifications que les demandeurs qui ne faisaient pas partie du PST, ce sont eux qui obtenaient le poste. Le journal d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de M. Durrer fait \u00e9tat qu'il a appliqu\u00e9 sur de nombreux postes (surtout des postes temporaires). En effet, M. Durrer a occup\u00e9 trois postes temporaires successifs entre janvier 2000 et avril 2002, soit pr\u00e8s de deux ans et demi apr\u00e8s qu'il eut re\u00e7u son pr\u00e9avis de cessation d'emploi. Durant tout ce temps, M. Durrer a accumul\u00e9 des prestations de retraite ainsi que d'autres avantages. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 par la CIBC en juin 2002 en vertu d'un contrat de 9 mois. En termes simples, je conclus que la CIBC a trait\u00e9 M. Durrer avec respect, et ce, durant ce qui, sans aucun doute, fut une p\u00e9riode difficile pour lui. En effet, le plaignant, dans certains de ses courriels qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve, remercie les gestionnaires et le personnel de la CIBC de l'avoir aid\u00e9.\n[71] Selon l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, M. Durrer a occup\u00e9 trois postes temporaires sur une p\u00e9riode de 28 mois. Il s'agit d'une preuve concluante en soi que la CIBC n'a pas nuit \u00e0 ses tentatives de trouver un emploi permanent ou temporaire en raison de son \u00e2ge. En effet, pour autant que nous sachions, l'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer et tous les avantages qui en d\u00e9coulent (l'exp\u00e9rience, la maturit\u00e9, etc.) ont pu contribuer au fait qu'il a obtenu un, deux ou trois des postes temporaires.\n[72] M. Durrer a utilis\u00e9 le mot conspiration dans son t\u00e9moignage ainsi que dans une lettre qu'il a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission afin de d\u00e9crire les actes de la CIBC visant \u00e0 l'emp\u00eacher de trouver un autre emploi dans le but de lui permettre d'atteindre l'\u00e2ge d'o\u00f9 il pouvait faire le pont vers la retraite anticip\u00e9e. Son avocat a fait preuve de plus de retenue. Il a affirm\u00e9 que les actes de la CIBC n'avaient pas constitu\u00e9 une conspiration et qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s [traduction] d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment ou intentionnellement, mais [avaient refl\u00e9t\u00e9] une indiff\u00e9rence d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, une n\u00e9gligence absolue et [\u00e9taient] honteux. Selon moi, les actes de la CIBC ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de la sorte et n'avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec l'\u00e2ge de M. Durrer.\n[73] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la partie traitant des conclusions de fait, on ne saura jamais si la CIBC aurait, en bout de ligne, permis \u00e0 M. Durrer de se pr\u00e9valoir d'une quatri\u00e8me (ou d'une cinqui\u00e8me ou d'une sixi\u00e8me, si n\u00e9cessaire) affectation temporaire afin d'atteindre l'\u00e2ge de 53 ans d'o\u00f9 il aurait pu faire le pont vers la retraite anticip\u00e9e. Selon ma conclusion ant\u00e9rieure, je crois que la CIBC avait song\u00e9 \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 M. Durrer de se pr\u00e9valoir d'une quatri\u00e8me affectation temporaire. La preuve indique clairement que, en date du 12 avril 2002, date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la cessation d'emploi (et m\u00eame lors de la r\u00e9union du 4 avril au cours de laquelle M. Durrer a affirm\u00e9 avoir appris pour la premi\u00e8re fois que la CIBC ne lui permettrait pas de se pr\u00e9valoir d'un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire), M. Durrer n'avait obtenu, pas m\u00eame provisoirement, aucun poste temporaire ou permanent \u00e0 la CIBC.\n[74] M\u00eame si j'avais conclu que la CIBC avait refus\u00e9 de songer \u00e0 accorder un quatri\u00e8me poste temporaire \u00e0 M. Durrer, celui-ci ne m'a pas convaincu que ce refus \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e2ge, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP. Et si M. Durrer avait obtenu un poste permanent \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, il n'aurait plus \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible au PST et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'aurait pas eu droit \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part ni \u00e0 la dispense de la r\u00e9duction de la pension de la retraite anticip\u00e9e, les deux avantages qu'il voulait obtenir.\n(i) Soustraction aux obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite [75] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant plaide ce qui suit : [traduction] La CIBC a licenci\u00e9 M. Durrer \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 50 ans et demi [le 12 avril 2002] dans le but d'enlever \u00e0 M. Durrer son droit \u00e0 la pension et, ainsi, pouvoir se soustraire \u00e0 ses obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n[76] J'estime que cette all\u00e9gation est non fond\u00e9e. Premi\u00e8rement, M. Durrer, en date du 12 avril 2002, n'a perdu aucun droit \u00e0 la pension, ni aucun avantage pr\u00e9vu dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite de la CIBC. Ces droits et avantages sont demeur\u00e9s intacts. M. Durrer n'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas admissible \u00e0 la dispense de la r\u00e9duction de la pension. En date d'aujourd'hui, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 55 ans, il peut commencer \u00e0 recevoir une pension r\u00e9duite sur une base actuarielle ou attendre jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans et recevoir une pleine pension non r\u00e9duite. Deuxi\u00e8mement, si son all\u00e9gation est que la Banque faisait obstacle \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 une pension future et tentait de se soustraire \u00e0 ses obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite en l'emp\u00eachant de travailler pendant encore deux ans et demi de telle sorte qu'il ne puisse pas atteindre l'\u00e2ge de 53 ans d'o\u00f9 il pouvait faire le pont vers la retraite anticip\u00e9e, je ne souscris toujours pas \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation. Si la CIBC d\u00e9sirait vraiment se soustraire \u00e0 d'autres obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite envers M. Durrer, elle l'aurait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans motif en octobre 1999 et ne lui aurait pas permis de continuer \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la Banque dans le cadre d'affectations temporaires pendant les deux ans et demi qui ont suivi. Durant ce temps, M. Durrer a accumul\u00e9 des prestations de retraite suppl\u00e9mentaires. Comme l'avocat de la CIBC l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, si c'\u00e9tait ce que son client voulait, c'est le contraire qui s'est produit, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'obligation de la Banque envers M. Durrer au titre des prestations de retraite a augment\u00e9. Cela ne fait pas beaucoup de sens sur le plan des affaires si l'objectif de la Banque \u00e9tait de se d\u00e9barrasser de M. Durrer afin d'\u00e9conomiser de l'argent.\n[77] Je retiens \u00e9galement la d\u00e9claration suivante faite par M. Banks: [traduction] L'incidence du licenciement d'employ\u00e9s par la CIBC, en vertu du PST, sur ses obligations d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite, a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligeable. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'incidence de la pension d'un seul employ\u00e9 (M. Durrer) sur les obligations de la CIBC d\u00e9coulant du r\u00e9gime de retraite aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligeable.\nVII. CONCLUSION [78] Il ne fait aucun doute que ce fut une p\u00e9riode triste et p\u00e9nible pour M. Dan Durrer. Il a pass\u00e9 toute sa vie professionnelle \u00e0 la CIBC. Au dire de tous, il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 qui travaillait tr\u00e8s fort et qui avait du succ\u00e8s. Toutefois, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, son \u00e2ge n'a rien eu \u00e0 voir avec la cessation de son emploi \u00e0 la CIBC. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nMatthew D.

Lors de son retour au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Bell de lui accorder un horaire de travail qui lui permettrait de se rendre \u00e0 la maison afin d'allaiter son enfant \u00e0 chaque jour, \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure. Elle pr\u00e9tend que, en rejetant sa demande, Bell a refus\u00e9 de l'accommoder. Selon elle, ce refus constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur son sexe et sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial, et ce, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a choisi de ne pas compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l'audience. Mme Cole a plaid\u00e9 sa cause elle-m\u00eame, sans \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par quiconque. Bell \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\nI. LES FAITS [3] Mme Cole a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Bell en 1987 comme commis au service de la facturation. En 2000, elle travaillait au centre d'appels de Bell \u00e0 Toronto (\u00e9galement appel\u00e9 le Mass Queue), lequel fournissait des services aux clients de Bell. En f\u00e9vrier 2000, Mme Cole a pris un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 pour donner naissance \u00e0 son deuxi\u00e8me enfant. Peu de temps avant de prendre son cong\u00e9, Mme Cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e au nouveau service de centre d'appels appel\u00e9 le High Value Queue (HVQ). Ce service fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque comme projet pilote visant \u00e0 fournir un service prioritaire aux clients les plus importants de Bell. Mme Cole n'avait pas encore commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au service HVQ au moment de son d\u00e9part en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[4] Le fils de Mme Cole est n\u00e9 le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2000. Malheureusement, l'enfant est n\u00e9 avec une cardiopathie cong\u00e9nitale pour laquelle il a d\u00fb subir une angioplastie alors qu'il n'\u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 que de quatre mois. Mme Cole s'est fait dire par les m\u00e9decins de son enfant que, lorsqu'il serait un peu plus \u00e2g\u00e9, il devrait probablement subir une intervention chirurgicale afin que l'on r\u00e9pare son cur d\u00e9fectueux. Compte tenu de l'\u00e9tat de son fils, les m\u00e9decins ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cole de l'allaiter le plus longtemps possible afin de renforcir son syst\u00e8me immunitaire.\n[5] Theresa Agnew, une infirmi\u00e8re de carri\u00e8re, a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience comme experte en mati\u00e8re d'allaitement et de mastite. Mme Agnew est l'\u00e9pouse du fr\u00e8re de Mme Cole. Bell n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune objection \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et, selon moi, son lien de parent\u00e9 n'a eu aucune incidence sur sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 en tant que t\u00e9moin expert. Mme Agnew a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le colostrum dans le lait des m\u00e8res poss\u00e8de de nombreuses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immunologiques qui peuvent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques pour les enfants, notamment pour les enfants qui ont des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 qui les rendent plus sensibles aux infections. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les enfants qui souffrent d'une cardiopathie cong\u00e9nitale sont sujets aux infections bact\u00e9riennes, \u00e0 tel point que, par exemple, on prescrit souvent des antibiotiques pour ces enfants lorsqu'ils se font faire un simple nettoyage de dents chez le dentiste. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'allaitement, ces enfants deviennent moins susceptibles de contracter ces infections et ils les combattent mieux dans les cas o\u00f9 ils les contractent.\n[6] Mme Cole a suivi les conseils des m\u00e9decins de son fils et a allait\u00e9 ce dernier jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit \u00e2g\u00e9 d'environ sept mois, \u00e2ge auquel elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui donner un peu de nourriture solide. \u00c0 partir de janvier 2001, le fils de Mme Cole se faisait allaiter de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de trois \u00e0 quatre fois par jour environ : \u00e0 6 h 30, \u00e0 16 h 30, entre 21 et 22 h 00 et parfois pendant la nuit entre 2 h 00 et 3 h 00.\n[7] Vers le 20 janvier 2001, Mme Cole a appel\u00e9 et laiss\u00e9 un message vocal \u00e0 Elizabeth Long, la gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre au centre d'appels Mass Queue o\u00f9 Mme Cole travaillait avant de prendre son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. La gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre \u00e9tait notamment charg\u00e9e de traiter les probl\u00e8mes des employ\u00e9s quant aux cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et quant aux cong\u00e9s d'invalidit\u00e9 ainsi que d'aider le directeur (ou chef d'\u00e9quipe) du centre d'appels \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler la pr\u00e9sence des employ\u00e9s ainsi que la constance de leur rendement. \u00c0 ce titre Mme Long devait s'occuper d'environ 350 employ\u00e9s.\n[8] Dans son message vocal, Mme Cole demandait l'autorisation de prendre un cong\u00e9 personnel non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 (PNR) d'une heure par jour afin de pouvoir s'occuper de son b\u00e9b\u00e9. Les superviseurs de Bell avaient le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder aux employ\u00e9s des cong\u00e9s PNR pendant leurs heures normales de travail afin de leur permettre de vaquer \u00e0 des occupations personnelles comme, par exemple, se rendre \u00e0 un rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin ou assister \u00e0 une pi\u00e8ce de th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de son enfant. L'octroi d'un cong\u00e9 PNR n'a aucune incidence n\u00e9gative sur la fiche de travail d'un employ\u00e9.\n[9] Compte tenu de son anciennet\u00e9 chez Bell, Mme Cole travaillait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur des quarts de travail qui commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 8 h 00 et qui se terminaient \u00e0 16 h 00, et ce, du lundi au vendredi. Selon Mme Cole, en de rares occasions, peut-\u00eatre trois fois par ann\u00e9e au maximum, elle travaillait sur le quart de travail de 8 h 15 \u00e0 16 h 15. La demande qu'elle a faite \u00e0 Mme Long \u00e9tait la suivante : elle voulait quitter le travail une heure avant la fin normale de son quart de travail et inscrire ce temps comme cong\u00e9 PNR. Cette mesure lui aurait permis de se rendre chez sa gardienne afin d'allaiter son fils avant 16 h30, en conformit\u00e9 avec son horaire d'allaitement. Mme Cole a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, lorsque l'heure de l'allaitement de l'apr\u00e8s-midi approchait, son sein commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 couler. En quittant le travail plus t\u00f4t, elle r\u00e9duirait les \u00e9coulements qui se produisaient \u00e0 son travail. Elle a parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage de l'odeur qui se d\u00e9gageait du lait maternel et de la g\u00eane que cela lui causait lorsque que l'on pouvait voir, \u00e0 travers ses v\u00eatements, le lait s'\u00e9couler.\n[10] Mme Cole savait qu'on avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre employ\u00e9e, Barb Kustec, des cong\u00e9s PNR afin de lui permettre d'allaiter sa fille au travail. La fille de Mme Kustec souffrait de nombreuses allergies et on avait recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de continuer \u00e0 l'allaiter le plus longtemps possible. En juin 2000, Mme Kustec avait demand\u00e9 et avait obtenu l'autorisation de prendre quinze minutes de plus en cong\u00e9 PNR apr\u00e8s sa pause-repas de 30 minutes. Son \u00e9poux amenait l'enfant au bureau \u00e0 cette heure-l\u00e0 et elle l'allaitait. Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle avait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que sa demande qu'on lui accorde un cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e serait moins d\u00e9rangeante pour Bell que la mesure d'accommodement qui fut accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Kustec et dont celle-ci se pr\u00e9valait durant l'heure achaland\u00e9e du d\u00eener alors que de nombreux employ\u00e9s prennent leur pause.\n[11] Le 22 janvier 2001, Mme Long a r\u00e9pondu par courriel au message vocal de Mme Cole. Mme Long a soulign\u00e9 que lors de son retour de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, Mme Cole devait se pr\u00e9senter directement au centre d'appels HVQ et que son dossier y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9. Toute nouvelle demande devait \u00eatre faite \u00e0 sa nouvelle chef d'\u00e9quipe \u00e0 HVQ, Mme Maria Bozzelli.\n[12] Bien que le dossier de Mme Cole se trouv\u00e2t maintenant apparemment entre les mains de HVQ, Mme Long a n\u00e9anmoins pris soin de faire des commentaires quant \u00e0 la demande de cong\u00e9 PNR faite par Mme Cole. Elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nNous ne pouvons malheureusement pas donner suite \u00e0 votre demande de cong\u00e9. La solution de rechange serait de choisir plut\u00f4t l'heure du d\u00eener, etc. etc., afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 vos besoins pour lesquels l'adjoint en dotation \u00e0 HVQ pourrait vous aider.\n[13] Mme Cole a r\u00e9pondu par courriel \u00e0 Mme Long. Elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nJ'aimerais obtenir plus de renseignements quant \u00e0 savoir pourquoi l'octroi d'un cong\u00e9 PNR de 60 minutes par jour pour allaiter mon b\u00e9b\u00e9 m'est refus\u00e9. Est-ce que toutes les demandes de cong\u00e9 PNR sont refus\u00e9es? Pourrait-on m'accorder 15 minutes par jour? Trente minutes? Quarante-cinq minutes?\n[14] Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2001, Mme Long a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit au courriel de Mme Cole :\n[traduction]\nJe vous recommande de pr\u00e9senter votre demande \u00e0 votre nouveau service HVQ, car, nous, \u00e0 Mass queue, sommes toujours en train d'embaucher et, par cons\u00e9quent, nous ne pouvons pas justifier l'octroi d'un cong\u00e9 PNR.\n[15] Mme Cole n'a plus parl\u00e9 par la suite de sa demande \u00e0 Mme Long. Elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2001 et elle a imm\u00e9diatement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au service HVQ. Quelques jours plus tard, Mme Cole s'est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Bozzelli afin de discuter de la question. Elle lui a parl\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes cardiaques de son fils et de la recommandation de ses m\u00e9decins, \u00e0 savoir que celui-ci devrait \u00eatre allait\u00e9 le plus longtemps possible. Mme Bozzelli a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, elle et Mme Cole, sont devenus tr\u00e8s \u00e9mues lors de cette conversation.\n[16] Mme Cole avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses de Mme Long \u00e0 ses demandes ant\u00e9rieures comme \u00e9tant un refus de la part de Bell de lui accorder un cong\u00e9 PNR. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle n'a pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 sa demande \u00e0 Mme Bozzelli. Mme Cole a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 que ses quarts de travail se terminent toujours \u00e0 16 h 00. Elle esp\u00e9rait que, en portant des coussinets pour sein, elle pourrait retenir son lait maternel au travail et que, si elle quittait au plus tard \u00e0 16 h 00, elle serait aupr\u00e8s de son fils juste \u00e0 temps pour son prochain allaitement.\n[17] Mme Bozzelli a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que Mme Cole demandait en fait qu'on lui accorde un quart de travail qui commencerait toujours \u00e0 8 h 00 et qui se terminerait toujours \u00e0 16 h 00. Elle a dit \u00e0 Mme Cole que, compte tenu de la possibilit\u00e9 que les droits d'anciennet\u00e9 des autres employ\u00e9s puissent \u00eatre touch\u00e9s, elle devait consulter son directeur de second niveau, M. Kam Rawal, avant d'accepter la demande. Mme Bozzelli a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Rawal en rapport avec la demande de Mme Cole. Elle pr\u00e9tend que M. Rawal lui a dit que comme Mme Cole demandait l'octroi d'une restriction m\u00e9dicale, des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'appui devraient \u00eatre fournis \u00e0 Bell. M. Rawal n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[18] Mme Bozzelli a affirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait ensuite communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Cole afin de l'informer qu'elle devait soumettre des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'appui de la mesure d'accommodement qu'elle demandait qu'on lui accorde en raison des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de son fils. Mme Bozzelli a garanti \u00e0 Mme Cole que tant qu'elle n'aurait pas soumis ces documents, elle ne se verrait accorder que des quarts de travail de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00.\n[19] Mme Cole n'a pas tout \u00e0 fait le m\u00eame souvenir de cette conversation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'on lui avait tout simplement dit qu'un billet du m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 pour que sa demande soit accept\u00e9e. Elle a trouv\u00e9 curieux qu'un billet du m\u00e9decin soit exig\u00e9 compte tenu que, \u00e0 l'exception de peut-\u00eatre trois jours par ann\u00e9e, son quart de travail se terminait \u00e0 16 h 00. N\u00e9anmoins, elle a accept\u00e9 de fournir un billet \u00e9manant de sa m\u00e9decin.\n[20] Le 23 mars 2001, Mme Cole a rencontr\u00e9 sa m\u00e9decin de famille et celle-ci lui a remis un billet \u00e9crit sur son calepin de prescription. Il \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit sur le billet : [traduction] Je certifie que j'ai conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Hayley Cole de quitter le travail tous les jours \u00e0 16 h 00, et ce, pour des raisons d'ordre m\u00e9dical. Le billet ne faisait aucune mention de l'enfant de Mme Cole, ni de ses probl\u00e8mes cardiaques.\n[21] Mme Cole a remis le billet de sa m\u00e9decin \u00e0 Mme Bozzelli, laquelle l'a envoy\u00e9 au bureau du Groupe de gestion des invalidit\u00e9s (GGI) de Bell \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Le GGI s'occupe de toutes les demandes en mati\u00e8re d'invalidit\u00e9, de sant\u00e9 au travail et d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s de Bell. Le personnel du GGI est compos\u00e9 de gestionnaires de cas qui examinent les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et prennent des d\u00e9cisions, en collaboration avec un m\u00e9decin, quant aux droits des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 recevoir des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de courte ou de longue dur\u00e9e et quant aux droits des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d'accommodement.\n[22] Mme Bozzelli a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a pas examin\u00e9 le billet avant de l'envoyer au GGI. Afin de respecter la vie priv\u00e9e des employ\u00e9s de Bell, tous les renseignements fournis dans les documents m\u00e9dicaux soumis par ceux-ci ne sont consult\u00e9s que par le GGI, et ce, en toute confidentialit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, si le GGI d\u00e9cide que, selon la preuve m\u00e9dicale soumise par un employ\u00e9, l'octroi de restrictions m\u00e9dicales est justifi\u00e9, le GGI informera tout simplement le superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 de la nature des restrictions et de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre accommod\u00e9es. Les d\u00e9tails concernant l'invalidit\u00e9 ou la maladie de l'employ\u00e9 sur laquelle la d\u00e9cision du GGI est fond\u00e9e ne sont pas divulgu\u00e9s au superviseur.\n[23] Le GGI a estim\u00e9 que le billet de la m\u00e9decin de Mme Cole ne comprenait pas suffisamment de d\u00e9tails. On a donc demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cole de fournir un autre billet dans lequel figurerait un diagnostic ainsi que le temps que dureraient les restrictions propos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 son horaire de travail. Le 11 mai 2001, Mme Cole est all\u00e9e voir sa m\u00e9decin de famille \u00e0 nouveau et l'a inform\u00e9e de la demande du GGI, puis elle lui a demand\u00e9 de lui donner un deuxi\u00e8me billet. La m\u00e9decin a accept\u00e9 et elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un autre billet, \u00e9galement \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main, sur une feuille de son calepin de prescriptions. Le deuxi\u00e8me billet \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9 : [traduction] Je certifie que j'ai conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Hayley Cole de quitter le travail \u00e0 16 h 00 \u00e0 tous les jours pendant 12 mois, \u00e0 compter d'aujourd'hui, afin de pr\u00e9venir les mastites p\u00e9riodiques. Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que sa m\u00e9decin avait fait mention de la mastite parce qu'[traduction] [elle] croyait peut-\u00eatre que c'\u00e9tait ce que Bell voulait. La m\u00e9decin de Mme Cole n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\n[24] Mme Agnew a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la mastite est une infection du tissu mammaire qui est souvent caus\u00e9e par l'obstruction de canaux. Certains des facteurs qui peuvent mener \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat sont l'engorgement du sein (lequel peut se produire lorsque le sein n'est pas vid\u00e9 de son lait assez souvent), la fatigue et le stress, des crevasses dans les mamelons qui permettent aux bact\u00e9ries de s'introduire et des modifications ou des diminutions de la fr\u00e9quence des allaitements. Si on ne s'occupe pas de l'engorgement, des bact\u00e9ries p\u00e9n\u00e8trent dans les canaux et peuvent entra\u00eener une infection locale et, dans les pires cas, des bact\u00e9ries p\u00e9n\u00e8trent dans le sang occasionnant ainsi une infection g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e.\n[25] Mme Cole a souffert d'une mastite vers le troisi\u00e8me ou quatri\u00e8me mois apr\u00e8s son accouchement. Sa m\u00e9decin de famille lui a prescrit des antibiotiques et lui a conseill\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 allaiter de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Comme Mme Agnew l'a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, l'un des traitements habituels de la mastite est l'allaitement fr\u00e9quent, surtout dans le cas du sein infect\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s environ deux semaines, la mastite de Mme Cole est disparue. Elle n'a plus souffert d'aucune autre mastite apr\u00e8s son retour au travail en f\u00e9vrier 2001. Mme Agnew a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'un faible pourcentage des m\u00e8res souffrent d'une mastite chronique ou r\u00e9currente. La mastite est plus susceptible de se produire dans les premiers 24 mois apr\u00e8s la naissance. Toutefois, si une femme souffre de mastites r\u00e9currentes au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, l'infection peut r\u00e9appara\u00eetre, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s le 24e mois, mais cela est tr\u00e8s rare.\n[26] Le GGI a examin\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me billet de la m\u00e9decin et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'horaire de travail fixe recommand\u00e9 constituait une mesure pr\u00e9ventive qui, selon le GGI, devait, dans la mesure du possible, faire l'objet d'un accommodement. D\u00e8s qu'elle a re\u00e7u un message \u00e0 ce sujet de la part du GGI, Mme Bozzelli a mis en application la recommandation et a vu \u00e0 ce que Mme Cole se voit attribuer exclusivement des quarts de travail de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00 pendant une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois se terminant le 24 mai 2002. Mme Bozzelli a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que d'autres employ\u00e9s du HVQ avaient remarqu\u00e9 que Mme Cole obtenait toujours les m\u00eames quarts de travail et ils se sont renseign\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet. Mme Bozzelli leur a expliqu\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision avait trait \u00e0 une question propre \u00e0 Mme Cole dont elle ne pouvait pas r\u00e9v\u00e9ler les d\u00e9tails.\n[27] En mars 2002, alors que la p\u00e9riode de 12 mois tirait \u00e0 sa fin, l'agente de traitement des cas du GGI, St\u00e9phanie Houle, a communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Cole afin de l'informer que le billet de la m\u00e9decin figurant au dossier ne serait bient\u00f4t plus valide. Si Mme Cole avait toujours besoin de travailler sur des quarts de travail fixes apr\u00e8s le 24 mai 2002, sa m\u00e9decin devrait d\u00e9poser un nouveau rapport en remplissant un formulaire GGI appel\u00e9 Rapport du m\u00e9decin au Groupe de gestion des invalidit\u00e9s, \u00e9galement appel\u00e9 par son num\u00e9ro d'identification BC1935.\n[28] Fait int\u00e9ressant, selon les directives figurant sur le formulaire, l'employ\u00e9 doit remplir le formulaire dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'absente du travail pendant plus de sept jours civils pour des raisons de maladie et (ou) blessures hors travail ou pour une journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re en raison d'une blessure hors travail et (ou) maladie professionnelle. Rien ne prouve que Mme Cole se soit absent\u00e9e du travail pour des raisons de maladie ou de blessures, de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9crite dans le formulaire, apr\u00e8s qu'elle soit retourn\u00e9e au travail apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Le GGI lui a malgr\u00e9 tout demand\u00e9 de soumettre le formulaire.\n[29] La m\u00e9decin de Mme Cole a rempli le formulaire le 22 mai 2002. Elle a d\u00e9crit la nature et la fr\u00e9quence du traitement de Mme Cole comme \u00e9tant du travail selon des heures stables. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de savoir si un plan de retour progressif au travail \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9, la m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] Capable de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, t\u00e2ches compl\u00e8tes mais conserver l'horaire stable de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00 du lundi au vendredi. Bell avait r\u00e9cemment introduit les quarts de travail du samedi au centre d'appels HVQ et ceux-ci commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 9 h 00 et se terminaient \u00e0 17 h 30. Si le quart de travail de Mme Cole devait se terminer aussi tard dans le jour, elle ne serait jamais capable d'aller voir son enfant \u00e0 temps pour son allaitement de 16 h 30. Mme Cole pr\u00e9tend qu'elle a fait part de cette situation \u00e0 sa m\u00e9decin qui a par cons\u00e9quent d\u00e9cider d'inscrire la mention du lundi au vendredi dans le rapport. Mme Cole a envoy\u00e9 le formulaire BC1935 d\u00fbment rempli au GGI.\n[30] La Dre Liliane Demers est m\u00e9decin consultante pour le GGI. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le GGI n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le formulaire BC1935, \u00e0 appuyer l'octroi de mesures suppl\u00e9mentaires visant \u00e0 accommoder Mme Cole. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que le diagnostic de mastite r\u00e9currente de la m\u00e9decin de Mme Cole ne pr\u00e9cisait pas le nombre d'\u00e9pisodes qui s'\u00e9taient produits et ne faisait aucune description d'un quelconque traitement quant \u00e0 ces \u00e9pisodes. Le diagnostic ne faisait \u00e9galement aucune mention de rendez-vous de suivi avec la patiente. La Dre Demers a soulign\u00e9 que la mastite se produit le plus souvent dans les premiers six mois apr\u00e8s la naissance. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le fils de Mme Cole avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus de deux ans.\n[31] La d\u00e9cision du GGI qu'il n'appuyait pas l'octroi d'autres mesures d'accommodement a apparemment \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 la direction du HVQ mais, selon Mme Cole, aucun des d\u00e9tails soulev\u00e9s dans le t\u00e9moignage de la Dre Demers ne lui a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis. Au lieu de cela, elle pr\u00e9tend qu'elle s'est tout simplement fait dire par Mme Liz Brownrigg, la gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre charg\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 HVQ, que le rapport de sa m\u00e9decin avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. Il semble que la conversation qu'elle a eue avec Mme Brownrigg a principalement port\u00e9 sur la question du quart de travail du samedi car dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 31 mai 2002, Mme Cole a \u00e9crit ce qui suit \u00e0 Mme Houle :\n[traduction]\nLiz m'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 vous afin de savoir quels renseignements vous d\u00e9sirez obtenir de la part de ma m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l'appui de la dispense du samedi. Dois-je demander \u00e0 ma m\u00e9decin de remplir un autre formulaire 1935?\n[32] Mme Houle a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit par courriel le 3 juin 2002 :\n[traduction]\nNous avons besoin de comprendre le trouble m\u00e9dical qui vous emp\u00eache de travailler le samedi (votre m\u00e9decin traitante peut ajouter ce renseignement en marge sur le formulaire bc1935 [rempli et sign\u00e9]).\n[33] Mme Cole est donc retourn\u00e9e voir sa m\u00e9decin et lui a demand\u00e9 d'ajouter sur le m\u00eame formulaire le renseignement suppl\u00e9mentaire exig\u00e9. La m\u00e9decin a ajout\u00e9 de nombreuses lignes dans la marge du formulaire et celui-ci \u00e9tait maintenant ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nCapable de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, t\u00e2ches pleines mais conserver l'horaire stable de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00, du lundi au vendredi, continuer les allaitements r\u00e9guliers afin de pr\u00e9venir la r\u00e9currence de la mastite, l'horaire de travail du samedi est diff\u00e9rent, ne s'applique pas [sic].\n[34] Mme Cole a envoy\u00e9 le formulaire BC1935 r\u00e9vis\u00e9e au GGI.\n[35] Le 7 ao\u00fbt 2002, Mme Houle a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Brownrigg d\u00e9clarant que bien qu'il fut recommand\u00e9 que Mme Cole travaille selon un horaire stable, le GGI n'appuyait pas, du point de vue m\u00e9dical, la recommandation de la m\u00e9decin que Mme Cole travaille selon des heures pr\u00e9cises et (ou) selon des jours pr\u00e9cis. Mme Houle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il revenait aux gestionnaires de travail de Mme Cole de d\u00e9cider s'ils r\u00e9pondraient \u00e0 cette demande d'attribution d'heures de travail pr\u00e9cises ou de journ\u00e9es de travail pr\u00e9cises. Mme Brownrigg, pour sa part, a inform\u00e9 verbalement Mme Cole que le GGI n'appuyait plus sa demande d'accommodement fond\u00e9e sur des motifs d'ordre m\u00e9dical.\n[36] Mme Cole a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire part de sa situation \u00e0 la gestionnaire des communications en mieux-\u00eatre \u00e0 HVQ, Mme Melanie Blackall. Les t\u00e2ches de Mme Blackall comprenaient notamment la gestion des besoins en dotation au sein du service. Mme Blackall a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que Mme Cole semblait d\u00e9concert\u00e9e par la r\u00e9ponse du GGI et elle se demandait de quelle autre fa\u00e7on sa m\u00e9decin pouvait \u00e9crire le rapport. Mme Blackall a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'en avait aucune id\u00e9e, elle savait tout simplement que le GGI avait estim\u00e9 que le deuxi\u00e8me rapport \u00e9tait insuffisant. Entre mai et septembre 2002, \u00e0 trois reprises, Mme Cole \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e travailler pendant le quart de travail du samedi se terminant \u00e0 17 h 30, ce qu'elle a pu \u00e9viter de faire en utilisant ses journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9 de maladie ou en \u00e9changeant ses quarts de travail avec d'autres employ\u00e9s. Ces ajustements n'ont eu aucune incidence sur son salaire. Quant aux jours de semaine, Bell a continu\u00e9 de faire travailler Mme Cole exclusivement sur le quart de travail de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00.\n[37] Le 27 septembre 2002, Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Blackall qu'elle avait pris un autre rendez-vous chez sa m\u00e9decin pour le 7 octobre 2002 afin d'obtenir un autre rapport BC1935 qu'elle soumettrait au GGI. Tel qu'il fut confirm\u00e9 dans un courriel ult\u00e9rieur, Mme Blackall a inform\u00e9 Mme Cole que, \u00e0 moins que le GGI ne modifie sa position apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du nouveau rapport, Mme Cole devait \u00eatre pr\u00eate \u00e0 travailler selon l'horaire r\u00e9gulier \u00e0 compter du 14 octobre 2002, et ce, sans b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'aucune des restrictions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attribution de ses quarts de travail. Mme Cole a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les remarques de Mme Blackall comme signifiant qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 ne plus allaiter car elle ne travaillerait plus exclusivement sur des quarts de travail se terminant \u00e0 16 h 00. Mme Blackall a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que, d'apr\u00e8s son langage corporel et d'apr\u00e8s le ton de sa voix, Mme Cole fut de toute \u00e9vidence contrari\u00e9e par cette nouvelle.\n[38] Comme pr\u00e9vu, Mme Cole a rendu visite \u00e0 sa m\u00e9decin et a obtenu un autre rapport BC1935 dans lequel figuraient plus de renseignements que dans les rapports ant\u00e9rieurs. Sous l'en-t\u00eate Nature et fr\u00e9quence du traitement actuel, la m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] travailler selon un horaire stable et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de jours de cong\u00e9s cons\u00e9cutifs. Sous l'en-t\u00eate \u00c9tendue de l'invalidit\u00e9, la m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit que Mme Cole [traduction] peut effectuer l'ensemble des t\u00e2ches mais doit travailler selon un horaire stable, c'est-\u00e0-dire de 8 h00 \u00e0 16 h00, tous les jours, et elle doit b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de deux jours de cong\u00e9 cons\u00e9cutifs afin de conserver un horaire r\u00e9gulier d'allaitement et deux jours de cong\u00e9 pour recueillir du lait maternel et l'entreposer pendant le reste de la semaine afin d'\u00e9viter la mastite. La m\u00e9decin a mentionn\u00e9 que ces restrictions s'appliqueraient pendant environ un an.\n[39] Le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au GGI. \u00c0 la fin d'octobre, Mme Blackall a appris que le GGI avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 une fois de plus que les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux n'\u00e9tayaient pas les restrictions recommand\u00e9es par la m\u00e9decin de Mme Cole. Mme Blackall a demand\u00e9 des instructions \u00e0 un gestionnaire d'un niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, soit Mme Karen Neave. Mme Neave l'a inform\u00e9e qu'elle s'occuperait de l'affaire \u00e0 partir de ce moment et lui a enjoint de voir \u00e0 ce que Mme Cole conserve entre-temps son horaire de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00.\n[40] Compte tenu de l'avis ant\u00e9rieur transmis par courriel de Mme Blackall que Mme Cole devait \u00eatre pr\u00eate \u00e0 travailler selon des quarts de travail r\u00e9guliers (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle devrait peut-\u00eatre travailler apr\u00e8s 16 h 00) si le GGI ne modifiait pas sa position, Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler selon des quarts de travail plus longs. Elle a donc arr\u00eat\u00e9 d'allaiter son fils \u00e0 16 h 30 le 8 ou le 9 octobre 2002. Avant No\u00ebl 2002, Mme Cole avait mis fin aux allaitements de 10 h 00 et en mars ou avril 2003, au plus tard, elle avait compl\u00e8tement cess\u00e9 d'allaiter son fils.\n[41] Le 4 novembre 2002, Mme Blackall a inform\u00e9 par courriel son directeur de la dotation en personnel que [traduction] \u00e0 compter de maintenant, et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre, Hayley travailler[ait] de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00 en raison de ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales. Mme Cole affirme qu'on ne lui a jamais remis copie de ce courriel et qu'on ne lui a jamais donn\u00e9 ce renseignement. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au centre d'appels HVQ jusqu'en janvier 2003, mois o\u00f9 ce centre fut aboli. Entre octobre 2002 et janvier 2003, Mme Cole n'a d\u00fb travailler que trois quarts de travail se terminant apr\u00e8s 16 h 00, soit deux \u00e0 la fin d'octobre et un au d\u00e9but de novembre. Apr\u00e8s qu'elle eut inform\u00e9 Mme Blackall de cette situation, Mme Blackall a ramen\u00e9 la fin des quarts de travail \u00e0 16 h 00. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans l'ensemble, entre mai 2002, mois o\u00f9 la p\u00e9riode initiale des quarts de travail se terminant \u00e0 16 h 00 devait expirer et le 28 janvier 2003, mois o\u00f9 elle a quitt\u00e9 HVQ, Mme Cole n'a en fait travaill\u00e9 aucun quart de travail se terminant apr\u00e8s 16 h 00.\n[42] Apr\u00e8s que le centre d'appels HVQ fut aboli, Mme Cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e au Move Queue qui est apparemment un grand centre d'appels comme le Mass Queue. Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, compte tenu du nombre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s au Move Queue et compte tenu de son niveau d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle \u00e9tait certaine de se voir attribuer des quarts de travail de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00, du lundi au vendredi.\n[43] La gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre qui s'occupait du centre d'appels Move Queue \u00e9tait Mme Long, la m\u00eame gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre \u00e0 qui Mme Cole avait adress\u00e9 sa demande initiale de cong\u00e9 PNR. Mme Long a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, en f\u00e9vrier 2003, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se concentrer sur l'am\u00e9lioration de l'assiduit\u00e9 au travail dans les centres d'appels dont elle avait la responsabilit\u00e9. L'une des mesures qu'elle a adopt\u00e9es pour s'occuper de l'important probl\u00e8me de l'assiduit\u00e9 au travail \u00e9tait de travailler en \u00e9troite collaboration avec le GGI afin de s'assurer que tous les documents justificatifs relatifs aux personnes en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e9taient en ordre et que les employ\u00e9s retourneraient travailler d\u00e8s que cela serait possible du point de vue m\u00e9dical. En effectuant son examen des employ\u00e9s pour lesquels des restrictions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place, elle a d\u00e9couvert que Bell continuait officiellement \u00e0 imposer des restrictions quant aux quarts de travail de Mme Cole. Le GGI a inform\u00e9 Mme Long que plus aucun document vers\u00e9 au dossier n'\u00e9tayait l'application de ces restrictions.\n[44] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 5 mars 2003, Mme Long a \u00e9crit un courriel \u00e0 Mme Cole pour l'informer que, compte tenu des renseignements obtenus de la part du GGI, ses restrictions m\u00e9dicales quant \u00e0 l'horaire de ses quarts de travail \u00e9taient abolies. Mme Long a ajout\u00e9 que si Mme Cole estimait que les restrictions s'appliquaient toujours, elle devrait d\u00e9poser un nouveau formulaire BC1935. Mme Long a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce courriel de la part de Mme Cole.\n[45] Le 14 avril 2004, Mme Cole a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\nII. L'ANALYSE A. Que doit d\u00e9montrer Mme Cole en l'esp\u00e8ce afin d'\u00e9tablir qu'il y a eu discrimination? [46] Mme Cole pr\u00e9tend que, dans le cadre de son emploi, Bell a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi en la d\u00e9favorisant en cours d'emploi par des moyens directs ou indirects, pour un motif de distinction illicite. Le sexe et le statut familial sont compris dans les motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi.\n[47] Les plaignants dans les causes en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne doivent d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28).\n[48] Une fois que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de fournir des explications raisonnables ou satisfaisantes quant \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire (voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, paragraphe 23; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[49] Par ailleurs, la conduite d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire si celui-ci peut d\u00e9montrer que ses refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu'une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\nB. La diff\u00e9rence de traitement quant \u00e0 l'allaitement constitue-t-elle de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la situation de famille? [50] Mme Cole pr\u00e9tend que le traitement par Bell de la demande de cong\u00e9 qu'elle a faite pour lui permettre d'allaiter son fils constituait un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur son sexe et sa situation familiale. Le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique, dans Poirier c. British Columbia (Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Recreation and Housing) (1997), 29 C.H.R.R. D\/87 (T.D.P.C.B.), a trait\u00e9 de la question de savoir si la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d'une femme en raison du fait qu'elle allaite est une forme de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le Tribunal a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat Brooks c. Canada Safeway Ltd. [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1219, dans lequel le juge en chef Dickson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la possibilit\u00e9 de devenir enceinte est propre au sexe f\u00e9minin. Une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse est donc une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le Tribunal de la Colombie-Britannique, dans Poirier, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le m\u00eame raisonnement s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'allaitement. La possibilit\u00e9 d'allaiter est propre au sexe f\u00e9minin. Par cons\u00e9quent, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le fait qu'une personne allaite est une forme de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Je souscris \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation.\n[51] Il semble que l'on peut faire un parall\u00e8le avec le motif de la situation familiale. Comme Mme Cole \u00e9tait la m\u00e8re de l'enfant qu'elle voulait allaiter, la traiter de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard constituerait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation familiale en tant que parent. Toutefois, Mme Cole n'a avanc\u00e9 aucun argument \u00e0 l'audience quant au volet situation familiale de sa plainte et n'a pas non plus orient\u00e9 le Tribunal vers un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l'appui de celui-ci. Ses observations ont principalement port\u00e9 sur la proposition selon laquelle la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite discriminatoire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Je ne puis donc que pr\u00e9sumer que Mme Cole a choisi de ne plus poursuivre le volet situation familiale de sa plainte. Dans les circonstances, selon moi, il s'agirait d'un manquement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et aux r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle si je tentais, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, de formuler des arguments \u00e0 l'appui de ce volet de la plainte et tirais des conclusions \u00e0 ce sujet (voir Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, paragraphe 8). La cause fond\u00e9e sur la situation familiale est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nC. Existe-t-il une preuve prima facie d\u00e9montrant que Mme Cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente en cours d'emploi en raison de son sexe? [52] Peu apr\u00e8s \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au travail, Mme Cole a communiqu\u00e9 avec la direction de Bell (c'est-\u00e0-dire avec Mme Long) afin de pr\u00e9senter une demande sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 titre de m\u00e8re allaitante. Elle d\u00e9sirait allaiter son fils lors de son heure d'allaitement de l'apr\u00e8s-midi. Bell pouvait-elle l'autoriser \u00e0 quitter le travail une heure plus t\u00f4t, \u00e0 chaque jour, lui accordant ainsi suffisamment de temps pour aller voir son fils et l'allaiter? Bell n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de lui verser un salaire pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait absente du travail (cong\u00e9 PNR).\n[53] La r\u00e9ponse initiale de Mme Long a \u00e9t\u00e9 non ambigu\u00eb : [traduction] Votre demande de cong\u00e9 PNR ne peut malheureusement pas \u00eatre honor\u00e9e. Lorsque Mme Cole a demand\u00e9 si ce refus \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitif ou si l'octroi d'un cong\u00e9 PNR plus court serait acceptable, Mme Long a r\u00e9pondu qu'au sein du service Mass Queue, on \u00e9tait toujours en train d'embaucher et qu'on ne pouv[ait] pas justifier l'octroi d'un cong\u00e9 PNR.\n[54] Bell pr\u00e9tend que Mme Cole aurait d\u00fb ne pas tenir compte de ces remarques \u00e9manant de Mme Long \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle allait travailler au centre d'appels HVQ lors de son retour au travail, un service dont Mme Long n'avait pas la responsabilit\u00e9. En effet, Mme Long a commenc\u00e9 ses observations dans le deuxi\u00e8me courriel en recommandant que Mme Cole pr\u00e9sente sa demande au service HVQ.\n[55] Mme Cole a tout de m\u00eame interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Long comme \u00e9tant un rejet de sa demande de cong\u00e9 PNR. L'interpr\u00e9tation de Mme Cole \u00e9tait-elle raisonnable? Celle-ci a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, avant son retour au travail, elle croyait que son emploi \u00e9tait toujours li\u00e9 au Mass Queue. Apr\u00e8s tout, lorsqu'elle est partie en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle travaillait toujours au Mass Queue. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle commence \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 HVQ, Mme Long serait sa gestionnaire du mieux-\u00eatre.\n[56] De plus, m\u00eame si Mme Long a mentionn\u00e9 que le dossier de Mme Cole \u00e9tait maintenant entre les mains du HVQ, elle a tout de m\u00eame pris la peine de discuter de la demande de cong\u00e9 PNR de Mme Cole dans ses deux courriels. Mme Cole s'est fait dire \u00e0 deux reprises par cette gestionnaire de Bell que le cong\u00e9 PNR ne pouvait pas \u00eatre honor\u00e9 ou justifi\u00e9. En effet, Bell d\u00e9courageait fortement ses tentatives d'obtention de cong\u00e9 visant \u00e0 lui permettre d'aller allaiter son enfant selon la formule qu'elle proposait. Dans les circonstances, selon moi, il \u00e9tait raisonnable que Mme Cole concl\u00fbt que Bell ne lui accorderait aucun cong\u00e9 PNR afin de lui permettre d'allaiter son enfant.\n[57] Mme Cole a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas faire valoir la solution du cong\u00e9 PNR aupr\u00e8s de Mme Bozzelli. Elle a r\u00e9duit sa demande \u00e0 ce qu'elle consid\u00e9rait comme \u00e9tant, \u00e0 tout le moins, une assurance que son quart de travail se terminerait \u00e0 16 h 00, ce qui lui permettrait de se rendre chez la gardienne de son enfant juste \u00e0 temps pour allaiter ce dernier. La r\u00e9action de Bell \u00e0 cette demande est d'une importance cruciale quant \u00e0 l'issue de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Plut\u00f4t que de traiter cette demande comme une demande de modification d'horaire de travail de la part d'une employ\u00e9e qui est \u00e0 la fois une femme et une m\u00e8re afin de lui permettre de pouvoir allaiter son enfant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, Bell a choisi de traiter l'affaire comme s'il s'agissait d'une question d'ordre m\u00e9dicale. Mme Bozzelli s'est fait enjoindre de demander \u00e0 Mme Cole de fournir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande. Pourquoi cela \u00e9tait-il n\u00e9cessaire? La Dr Demers a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage, comme d'ailleurs l'avocat de Bell dans sa plaidoirie finale, que l'acte d'allaitement n'est pas une invalidit\u00e9. Je vais revenir sur cette question plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[58] \u00c0 l'audience, Bell a soulign\u00e9 que Mme Cole avait en bout de ligne fait l'objet d'une mesure d'accommodement au cours de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e car elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'un horaire de travail garanti de 8 h 00 \u00e0 16 h 00. Cette mesure d'accommodement ne fut toutefois pas accord\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande d'allaitement de la part d'une m\u00e8re mais comme \u00e9tant une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande formul\u00e9e par une employ\u00e9e malade ou invalide qui a besoin de mesures d'accommodement afin d'\u00e9viter la r\u00e9currence d'une maladie. Cette approche \u00e0 la demande de Mme Cole a eu pour r\u00e9sultat que, un an plus tard, celle-ci s'est fait dire que les mesures d'accommodement dont elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait prendraient officiellement fin en raison du fait qu'il \u00e9tait improbable que la mastite r\u00e9apparaisse, m\u00eame si elle allaitait toujours son fils et demandait qu'on lui garantisse que son quart de travail se termine \u00e0 16 h 00 afin qu'elle puisse l'allaiter avant 16 h 30.\n[59] Par cons\u00e9quent, Bell n'a vraiment jamais trait\u00e9 la demande faite par Mme Cole en tant que m\u00e8re qu'on lui accorde un quart de travail qui se termine \u00e0 heure fixe de telle sorte qu'elle puisse allaiter son fils en apr\u00e8s-midi. Ce fait \u00e9tablit-il prima facie que Mme Cole a fait l'objet de discrimination en raison de son sexe? Oui, selon moi.\n[60] L'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi mentionne que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d'emploi. L'article 2 mentionne que la Loi a pour objet d'\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de l'application du principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur, notamment, le sexe.\n[61] Dans le cadre de leur vie professionnelle, les femmes font face \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s et \u00e0 des obstacles particuliers auxquels les hommes ne sont pas confront\u00e9s. Une femme qui choisit d'allaiter son b\u00e9b\u00e9 assume une responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son enfant qu'aucun homme ne pourra jamais assumer. Pour qu'une m\u00e8re qui est sur le march\u00e9 du travail puisse accorder \u00e0 son enfant les avantages que peut procurer l'allaitement, elle peut avoir besoin d'un certain degr\u00e9 d'accommodement. Autrement, elle peut \u00eatre confront\u00e9e \u00e0 un choix difficile \u00e0 faire qu'un homme n'aura jamais \u00e0 faire. D'une part, elle peut cesser d'allaiter son enfant afin de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour gagner sa vie et celle de sa famille. D'autre part, elle peut quitter son emploi afin de pouvoir allaiter son enfant. Ce ne sont que les travailleuses qui sont confront\u00e9es \u00e0 ce dilemme et cela a pour cons\u00e9quence qu'elles sont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d'emploi. Cela peut avoir comme cons\u00e9quence que l'on cr\u00e9e pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le genre d'obstacle qui prive les femmes de leur droit, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement (article 2 de la Loi).\n[62] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la r\u00e9action de Bell, qui, \u00e0 tout le moins, a fortement d\u00e9courag\u00e9 Mme Cole, en tant que m\u00e8re, de demander un cong\u00e9 PNR pour allaiter son enfant, a eu pour effet de confronter Mme Cole \u00e0 un dilemme auquel un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin ne peut pas \u00eatre confront\u00e9. \u00c0 ce titre, Mme Cole a fait l'objet d'un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[63] De plus, la demande ult\u00e9rieure que Mme Cole a faite \u00e0 Bell quant \u00e0 l'octroi d'un ajustement relativement l\u00e9ger de son horaire de travail afin de lui permettre d'aller allaiter son fils a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Bell n'a jamais trait\u00e9 cette demande comme \u00e9tant une demande faite par une m\u00e8re allaitante. Au lieu de cela, en renvoyant l'affaire au GGI, Bell a trait\u00e9 Mme Cole comme une employ\u00e9e malade ou invalide. Mme Cole a d\u00fb se rendre chez sa m\u00e9decin \u00e0 plusieurs reprises afin d'obtenir des billets et des rapports. Par cons\u00e9quent, en plus de vivement faire sentir \u00e0 Mme Cole que sa demande initiale de cong\u00e9 PNR n'\u00e9tait pas la bienvenue, lorsque celle-ci a sensiblement r\u00e9duit sa demande \u00e0 une simple garantie que son quart de travail se terminerait \u00e0 16 h 00, Bell a soumis cette demande \u00e0 des conditions et \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cifications (c'est-\u00e0-dire au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de rapports m\u00e9dicaux justifiant l'allaitement) auxquelles un employ\u00e9 de sexe masculin, chez Bell, n'aurait manifestement jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis. Le statut de m\u00e8re allaitante de Mme Cole faisait partie int\u00e9grante de ses demandes et le rejet de ces demandes a eu une incidence tout \u00e0 fait particuli\u00e8re sur Mme Cole en tant que femme, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en tant que m\u00e8re allaitante. \u00c0 ce titre, il existe un lien clair entre le traitement d\u00e9favorable dont Mme Cole a fait l'objet et son statut de femme.\n[64] Une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de Mme Cole a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nD. Quelle est la r\u00e9ponse de Bell \u00e0 la preuve prima facie? [65] Comme Mme Cole a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il incombe maintenant \u00e0 Bell de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette preuve.\n[66] Selon l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi, le refus de Bell d'accorder un cong\u00e9 PNR ou les sp\u00e9cifications de Bell que Mme Cole obtienne un rapport m\u00e9dical justifiant sa demande de quitter le travail de bonne heure ne constitueraient pas une pratique discriminatoire s'ils \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Afin d'\u00e9tablir ce moyen de d\u00e9fense, Bell doit d\u00e9montrer que la prise de mesures d'accommodement quant \u00e0 la personne ou quant au groupe de personnes vis\u00e9es imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 Bell en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2)). En effet, comme la Cour Supr\u00eame l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, paragraphe 21 (Grismer), pour se pr\u00e9valoir de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense, un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu'il a pris toutes les mesures d'accommodement possibles tant qu'il n'en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour lui une contrainte excessive.\n[67] Bell pr\u00e9tend toutefois que, avant que l'obligation d'offrir un accommodement naisse, un employ\u00e9 doit demander qu'on lui accorde une mesure d'accommodement et doit d\u00e9montrer de fa\u00e7on objective qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire que cette mesure soit accord\u00e9e. De plus, Bell pr\u00e9tend que l'employ\u00e9 doit \u00e9galement fournir des renseignements pertinents \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande et que ceux-ci doivent \u00eatre clairs, d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et suffisent \u00e0 \u00e9tayer la demande.\n[68] En l'esp\u00e8ce, Bell souligne que lorsque Mme Cole a parl\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 Mme Bozzelli, elle lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle demandait qu'un ajustement soit apport\u00e9 \u00e0 son horaire de travail afin de lui permettre d'allaiter son fils et pouvoir ainsi augmenter l'immunit\u00e9 de ce dernier aux infections. Celui-ci \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement susceptible \u00e0 contracter des infections en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes cardiaques. S'il s'agissait l\u00e0 du besoin qui devait faire l'objet d'une mesure d'accommodement, Bell pr\u00e9tend que Mme Cole n'a pas fourni suffisamment de renseignements afin de l'\u00e9tayer. Lorsque Bell lui a demand\u00e9 de fournir un billet du m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande, les documents m\u00e9dicaux produits par Mme Cole ne faisaient aucune mention de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son fils. Aucun membre du GGI n'avait jamais entendu parler que celui-ci \u00e9tait malade. Si des membres du GGI en avaient entendu parler, il est possible que le GGI aurait tir\u00e9 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente en 2002 et peut-\u00eatre qu'il aurait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 appuyer la demande d'accommodement de Mme Cole sans demander que celle-ci fournisse des documents m\u00e9dicaux additionnels.\n[69] L'argument de Bell ne tient toutefois pas compte d'un point fondamental. Pourquoi la sant\u00e9 du fils de Mme Cole consituerait-elle un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d'appr\u00e9ciation de la demande de Mme Cole? Cela peut-il faire une diff\u00e9rence quant \u00e0 la motivation qu'a pu avoir cette m\u00e8re lorsqu'elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de cong\u00e9 afin de pouvoir aller allaiter son enfant? L'objectif principal de Mme Cole \u00e9tait d'augmenter l'immunit\u00e9 de son fils compte tenu de sa tendance \u00e0 contracter des infections et compte tenu de la possibilit\u00e9 d'une future intervention chirurgicale. Mme Kustec avait comme motivation d'aider sa fille \u00e0 combattre ses allergies. Comme Mme Agnew l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage d'expert, les avantages procur\u00e9s par l'allaitement sont nombreux et ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas seulement \u00e0 l'enfant et \u00e0 la m\u00e8re mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de son ensemble. Comme il fut \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 dans Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) et Gigu\u00e8re c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville) (2003), 47 C.H.R.R. D\/67, 2003 QCTDP 88, paragraphes 53 \u00e0 57, ces avantages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle internationale dans la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ratifi\u00e9e par le Canada en 1991. La promotion de l'allaitement est l'un des principaux objectifs vis\u00e9s par l'Organisation mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de trois d\u00e9cennies.\n[70] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que Mme Cole ait inform\u00e9 la direction de Bell quant \u00e0 la raison principale pour laquelle elle voulait continuer \u00e0 allaiter son b\u00e9b\u00e9 apr\u00e8s \u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au travail, la r\u00e9action de Bell n'aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre que d'examiner cette demande comme \u00e9tant une demande faite par une m\u00e8re qui demande \u00e0 son employeur de lui accorder des mesures qui lui permettraient de continuer \u00e0 allaiter son enfant. L'exigence de Bell que Mme Cole fournisse une preuve m\u00e9dicale afin d'\u00e9tayer sa demande n'\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. Bell aurait peut-\u00eatre eu une certaine raison pour imposer cette condition si elle avait quelque raison de douter que Mme Cole avait accouch\u00e9 12 mois auparavant ou de douter de sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle allaitait toujours son enfant. Je ne suis saisi d'aucune preuve dans cette affaire que Bell a pu entretenir de telles questions ou de tels doutes.\n[71] La d\u00e9cision prise par Bell d'exiger une preuve m\u00e9dicale de la part de Mme Cole \u00e9tait malheureuse car elle a en bout de ligne cr\u00e9\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que Mme Cole perde, en mai 2002, les quarts de travail garantis dont elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait. Je suis convaincu, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cole, qu'elle fut surprise par la demande initiale de Bell voulant qu'elle pr\u00e9sente un billet du m\u00e9decin et qu'elle ne savait pas vraiment quoi faire. Elle a cependant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'acquiescer \u00e0 cette demande. Son principal souci \u00e9tait le bien-\u00eatre de son enfant. Si la direction de Bell insistait pour obtenir un billet du m\u00e9decin, elle lui en fournirait un.\n[72] Je souligne en passant que compte tenu de ma conclusion que la demande de production d'un billet du m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9e, rien ne porte vraiment sur la question de savoir si Mme Bozzelli a oui ou non vraiment pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cole que le billet du m\u00e9decin devait faire pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment mention de la maladie de son fils. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Mme Bozzelli est demeur\u00e9e dans la salle d'audience pendant que Mme Cole et tous les autres t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posaient. Mme Bozzelli a donc eu l'avantage d'entendre la version des faits de Mme Cole avant de rendre son propre t\u00e9moignage. De plus, compte tenu du d\u00e9sir et de la volont\u00e9 de Mme Cole de faire tous les efforts n\u00e9cessaires afin de s'assurer qu'elle puisse allaiter son fils, il semble fort improbable, comme il m'appert de l'ensemble de son t\u00e9moignage, qu'elle aurait omis de donner suite \u00e0 la demande quant \u00e0 ce type de renseignement m\u00e9dical si Mme Bozzelli avait vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi pr\u00e9cise qu'elle le pr\u00e9tend.\n[73] Au contraire, il ressort tr\u00e8s clairement du peu de renseignements fournis dans le premier billet de la m\u00e9decin que ni Mme Cole, ni sa m\u00e9decin, n'ont compris ce que Bell demandait exactement. Mme Cole avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 sa situation \u00e0 sa directrice. N\u00e9anmoins, Bell demandait des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la raison pour laquelle Mme Cole avait besoin qu'on lui accorde des mesures d'accommodement en raison de sa sant\u00e9. En effet, le formulaire BC1935 qu'on lui avait demand\u00e9 de remplir en 2002 ne portait que sur la maladie ou l'invalidit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. Il ne traitait pas des maladies des membres des familles des employ\u00e9s et pourquoi aurait-il d\u00fb l'\u00eatre? Le r\u00f4le du GGI consistait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les restrictions m\u00e9dicales des employ\u00e9s de Bell. Mme Cole ne faisait pas l'objet d'aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale, mais la demande de Bell l'a en fait contraint de trouver une restriction m\u00e9dicale (la mastite) pour obtenir les mesures d'accommodement qu'elle cherchait \u00e0 obtenir afin de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de son fils. Toutefois, comme il \u00e9tait peu probable que la mastite se produise \u00e0 nouveau apr\u00e8s les premiers 24 mois suivant la naissance (un point sur lequel Mme Agnew et la Dr Demers s'entendent), il \u00e9tait certain que la demande d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Cole serait refus\u00e9e d\u00e8s que l'enfant aurait atteint l'\u00e2ge de deux ans en 2002.\n[74] En ce sens, le GGI \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de refuser de continuer \u00e0 appuyer l'octroi de mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 Mme Cole. Mais l'opinion du GGI aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre sans importance. Tout d'abord le GGI n'aurait jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre saisi de cette affaire car Mme Cole \u00e9tait ni malade, ni invalide. Elle \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re allaitante qui n'avait aucun probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9.\n[75] Bell convient que l'acte d'allaitement n'est pas une invalidit\u00e9 mais pr\u00e9tend qu'un employeur a le droit de demander \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e qui demande l'octroi d'une mesure d'accommodement afin de pouvoir nourrir son enfant de soumettre une preuve \u00e0 l'appui objective. L'employ\u00e9e doit faire la preuve d'un besoin et non pas d'une simple pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Afin de remettre les choses dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, une m\u00e8re peut pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer allaiter un enfant \u00e0 une certaine heure de la journ\u00e9e, mais est-il n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle le fasse \u00e0 cette heure-l\u00e0? Bell pr\u00e9tend que c'est \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9e qu'il incombe de faire cette preuve car, selon elle, un employeur n'est pas tenu d'accepter sans examen la demande d'un employ\u00e9. L'avocat de Bell a propos\u00e9 que l'on fasse une analogie avec la situation o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 demande qu'on lui accorde une mesure d'accommodement d'ordre religieux (un cong\u00e9 pour motifs d'ordre religieux par exemple). Un employeur serait justifi\u00e9 de demander une confirmation \u00e0 l'eccl\u00e9siastique de l'employ\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l'authenticit\u00e9 de la pratique religieuse de ce dernier. De m\u00eame, Bell a pr\u00e9tendu qu'un employeur serait justifi\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 une femme de fournir une preuve m\u00e9dicale que l'accommodement d'allaitement qu'elle demande est n\u00e9cessaire. Bell n'a fourni aucun fondement juridique \u00e0 l'appui de cet argument.\n[76] De plus, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9misse de cette analogie. Dans Syndicat Northcrest c. Amselem, [2004] 2 R.C.S. 551, paragraphe 43, une affaire qui portait sur la libert\u00e9 de religion, la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 que l'accent dans une telle affaire porte sur le choix personnel exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des croyances religieuses. Un expert ou une autorit\u00e9 en droit religieux ne saurait remplacer l'affirmation par l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de ses croyances religieuses. Exiger la preuve des pratiques \u00e9tablies d'une religion pour appr\u00e9cier la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la croyance diminue la libert\u00e9 m\u00eame que l'on cherche \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger. Le demandeur peut pr\u00e9senter une preuve d'expert pour d\u00e9montrer que ses croyances correspondent aux pratiques et croyances des autres disciples de sa religion. Bien qu'une telle preuve puisse \u00eatre pertinente pour \u00e9tablir la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la croyance, elle n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire (Syndicat Northcrest, paragraphe 54).\n[77] Si on se fie \u00e0 l'analogie de Bell, s'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'un revendicateur de la libert\u00e9 de religion pr\u00e9sente une soi-disante preuve objective de pratique religieuse pour \u00e9tablir la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de ses croyances religieuses, pourquoi alors une m\u00e8re devrait-elle produire une preuve objective afin de prouver sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 lorsqu'elle d\u00e9clare qu'elle allaite son enfant et qu'elle a besoin de mesures d'accommodement pour pouvoir continuer \u00e0 l'allaiter apr\u00e8s son retour au travail? Selon moi, en l'absence d'une preuve contraire qui am\u00e8nerait l'employeur \u00e0 douter de la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'affirmation de l'employ\u00e9e (c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle a un enfant et qu'elle allaite), la m\u00e8re ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 prouver \u00e0 son employeur qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle allaite son enfant. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la cause en mati\u00e8re d'arbitrage Re : Carewest and H.S.A.A. (2001), 93 L.A.C. (4th) 129, page 160, l'allaitement, qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, est propre \u00e0 la femme, est aussi intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance que la grossesse et devrait \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re (voir \u00e9galement Gigu\u00e8re, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 60).\n[78] Je ne souscris donc pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de Bell qu'un employeur est justifi\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 son employ\u00e9e de fournir une preuve ind\u00e9pendante de son besoin d'allaiter son enfant. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de Bell, en l'esp\u00e8ce, que Mme Cole produise une preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande d'accommodement n'\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. Bell ne peut donc pas faire valoir, comme explication raisonnable ou satisfaisante, que Mme Cole n'a soumis au GGI aucun document m\u00e9dical quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son enfant.\nE. Bell a-t-elle prouv\u00e9 qu'elle a pris toutes les mesures d'accommodement possibles sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive? [79] En l'esp\u00e8ce, non seulement Bell n'a pas prouv\u00e9 qu'elle a pris toutes les mesures d'accommodement possibles sans qu'il en r\u00e9sulte pour elle une contrainte excessive, mais rien n'indique qu'elle a tent\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Cole en tant que m\u00e8re qui allaite son enfant. La demande initiale d'octroi de cong\u00e9 PNR pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Cole fut tr\u00e8s mal accueillie. Sa demande ult\u00e9rieure qu'on lui garantisse que son quart de travail se termine \u00e0 16 h 00 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e. Bien qu'il soit vrai que, en fait, on lui a accord\u00e9 des quarts de travail \u00e0 heure fixe pour l'ann\u00e9e suivante, cela ne fut pas fait dans le but de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins en tant que m\u00e8re, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 ses besoins en tant que personne invalide ou malade. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9, cette qualification erron\u00e9e a \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en une perte potentielle pour Mme Cole de ses quarts de travail garantis et a oblig\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 plusieurs reprises chez sa m\u00e9decin afin d'obtenir sans cesse un nouveau rapport m\u00e9dical.\n[80] Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que Bell n'ait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande d'accommodement de Mme Cole, compte tenu du fait que, comme la Dr Demers l'a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, Bell n'a \u00e9tabli aucune politique quant \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 accommoder les employ\u00e9es qui allaitent leur enfant. Les d\u00e9cisions sont prises au cas par cas par les gestionnaires. Nous savons, par exemple, que Bell a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande d'accommodement de Mme Kustec. Mme Long a dit \u00e0 Mme Cole qu'elle n'accorderait aucun cong\u00e9 PNR pour allaitement aux employ\u00e9es qui travaillaient dans son service, mais qu'elle envisageait la possibilit\u00e9 de tenter de trouver des solutions de rechange heure du d\u00eener etc., etc..\n[81] Non seulement Bell n'a pas tent\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Cole en tant que m\u00e8re, mais la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal donne \u00e0 penser que l'attribution \u00e0 Mme Cole d'un quart de travail qui se termine \u00e0 16 h 00 n'aurait occasionn\u00e9 aucune contrainte \u00e0 Bell, encore moins une contrainte excessive. Compte tenu de son anciennet\u00e9, Mme Cole avait droit qu'on lui accorde, \u00e0 quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s, ces quarts de travail garantis \u00e0 tous les jours. Mme Bozzelli a fait allusion dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 certains commentaires que certains autres employ\u00e9s ont apparemment faits lorsqu'ils ont remarqu\u00e9 que les quarts de travail de Mme Cole se terminaient toujours \u00e0 16 h 00. Aucun autre d\u00e9tail n'a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ces commentaires et aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e quant \u00e0 des cons\u00e9quences qui auraient d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de ces observations faites par les autres employ\u00e9s. Aucune preuve n'a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 produite quant \u00e0 une incidence possible sur les droits d'anciennet\u00e9 des autres employ\u00e9s.\n[82] De plus, Bell n'a m\u00eame pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la demande de Mme Cole qu'on lui accorde un quart de travail qui se termine plus t\u00f4t (voir m\u00eame une heure plus t\u00f4t) \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. L'employeur n'aurait pas eu \u00e0 verser un salaire \u00e0 Mme Cole pendant qu'elle \u00e9tait absente car cette absence aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un cong\u00e9 PNR. De plus, l'absence aurait eu lieu \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e. Mme Cole a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, selon son exp\u00e9rience, il n'y avait d'ordinaire pas plus d'une personne en pause \u00e0 15 h 45. Un plus grand nombre de personnes \u00e9taient absentes de leur poste de travail \u00e0 l'heure du d\u00eener, moment auquel Mme Kustec s'est vu accorder son cong\u00e9 PNR afin de pouvoir allaiter son enfant. La seule preuve de Bell \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est un commentaire fait par Mme Long selon quoi il lui \u00e9tait difficile de pr\u00e9dire les besoins lorsque Mme Cole a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande. Mme Long a ajout\u00e9 que, actuellement (c'est-\u00e0-dire en novembre 2006, lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9), Bell a vraiment besoin que ses employ\u00e9s soient pr\u00e9sents entre 16 h 00 et 17 h 00 et que l'heure du d\u00eener n'a jamais pos\u00e9 de probl\u00e8me.\n[83] Selon moi, Bell n'a pas \u00e9tabli selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s que, en 2002, les absences quotidiennes de Mme Cole, lesquelles pouvaient commencer jusqu'\u00e0 une heure avant la fin de son quart de travail ordinaire, lui aurait impos\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[84] Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que Bell n'a pas \u00e9tabli la d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) ainsi qu'au paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi.\n[85] Comme aucune autre explication raisonnable ou satisfaisante et comme aucune exemption n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies afin de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie de discrimination, je conclus que Mme Cole a fait l'objet de discrimination de la part de Bell en raison de son sexe, au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi, et que sa plainte est donc fond\u00e9e.\nF. Quelles redressements Mme Cole demande-t-elle? (i) La d\u00e9livrance d'une ordonnance en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi [86] Mme Cole demande que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 Bell, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, qu'elle prenne des mesures afin d'emp\u00eacher que la pratique discriminatoire qui s'est produite en l'esp\u00e8ce ne se reproduise plus. Elle souligne que Bell n'informe pas ses employ\u00e9es qui retournent au travail apr\u00e8s leur cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de lui demander des accommodements afin d'allaiter leur enfant. Mme Cole pr\u00e9tend que si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de ses droits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elle aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande plus \u00e9nergiquement, par exemple en n'annulant pas sa demande initiale de cong\u00e9 PNR.\n[87] Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, Bell reconna\u00eet qu'elle n'a mis en place aucune politique officielle en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement des employ\u00e9es qui d\u00e9sirent allaiter. Les demandes sont trait\u00e9es au cas par cas. Bell n'a produit aucune preuve indiquant qu'elle fournit actuellement des renseignements \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s quant \u00e0 cette forme d'accommodement.\n[88] Selon moi, la demande de d\u00e9livrance de l'ordonnance susmentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Cole est raisonnable. La direction de Bell et l'ensemble de son personnel b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient d'une plus grande compr\u00e9hension de leurs obligations et de leurs droits respectifs pr\u00e9vus dans la Loi quant \u00e0 cette question particuli\u00e8re. Cela pourrait \u00e0 son tour emp\u00eacher que des pratiques discriminatoires, semblables \u00e0 celle en l'esp\u00e8ce, se produisent dans l'avenir.\n[89] J'ordonne donc que Bell prenne, en conformit\u00e9 avec l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir que des actes semblables ne se reproduisent. Ces mesures doivent comprendre la mise en place d'une politique relative aux demandes d'accommodement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s de Bell en rapport avec l'allaitement qui est compatible avec les conclusions de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Les employ\u00e9s de Bell, notamment les parents qui sont les plus susceptibles d'\u00eatre touch\u00e9s par la politique, devraient \u00eatre inform\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la teneur de cette politique.\n(ii) Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)) [90] Mme Cole demande que Bell soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'indemniser pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu'elle a subi en raison de la pratique discriminatoire. Elle r\u00e9clame le montant d'indemnit\u00e9 maximum pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), soit 20 000 $.\n[91] Une partie du pr\u00e9tendu pr\u00e9judice subi par Mme Cole a trait au fait que celle-ci n'a pas obtenu une heure de cong\u00e9 PNR \u00e0 la fin de ses quarts de travail. En \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9e de quitter son travail au plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 16 h 00, elle ne pouvait se rendre voir son fils que tout juste avant son prochain allaitement et environ 12 heures apr\u00e8s son dernier allaitement. Par cons\u00e9quent, le lait de Mme Cole avait tendance \u00e0 s'accumuler et, t\u00f4t ou tard, il se mettait \u00e0 couler. Mme Cole portait des coussinets pour sein afin d'emp\u00eacher que l'\u00e9coulement paraisse sur ses v\u00eatements. L'\u00e9coulement provoquait des odeurs. Mme Cole a qualifi\u00e9 cette situation d'humiliante. Elle a reconnu que les \u00e9coulements pouvaient se produire \u00e0 n'importe quel moment de la journ\u00e9e, mais elle a pr\u00e9tendu que ceux-ci devenaient plus fr\u00e9quents au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l'heure du prochain allaitement de son fils approchait.\n[92] Mme Cole a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il arrivait parfois, vers la fin de son quart de travail, qu'elle soit en train de parler avec un client et qu'elle ne puisse pas mettre fin imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la conversation. Par cons\u00e9quent, il arrivait parfois qu'elle aille voir son fils avec 15 minutes de retard. Ce retard avait pour cons\u00e9quence que ses seins s'engorgeaient davantage, ce qui lui occasionnait certaines douleurs physiques.\n[93] Mme Cole a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit les d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments que lui ont occasionn\u00e9 les visites r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es qu'elle a d\u00fb faire chez sa m\u00e9decin afin d'obtenir des billets et des rapports dans le but de justifier les mesures d'accommodement qu'elle voulait obtenir m\u00eame si elle n'\u00e9tait ni malade, ni invalide. Elle a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 de l'angoisse et de l'incertitude qu'elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es lorsqu'elle a appris, en mai 2002, que les mesures d'accommodement qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es jusque l\u00e0, prendraient bient\u00f4t fin, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne fournisse une preuve m\u00e9dicale qui satisfasse Bell et le GGI.\n[94] De plus, Mme Cole a expliqu\u00e9 la souffrance morale et le sentiment de perte que lui a occasionn\u00e9 le fait de devoir cesser d'allaiter son fils en octobre 2002, \u00e0 la suite des remarques faites par Mme Blackall le 27 septembre 2002. Je ne suis toutefois pas convaincu que ces remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de la d\u00e9cision de Mme Cole d'arr\u00eater d'allaiter son enfant en octobre 2002. Bien qu'il soit vrai que les remarques de Mme Blackall refl\u00e8tent le fait que Bell n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre ad\u00e9quatement aux demandes de Mme Cole, on doit \u00e9galement souligner que Mme Blackall n'a jamais vraiment dit \u00e0 Mme Cole que ses quarts de travail se terminant \u00e0 heure fixe prendraient fin. En effet, Mme Cole n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s novembre 2002, sur un quart de travail se terminant apr\u00e8s 16 h 00, et, officiellement, Bell n'a pas mis fin \u00e0 l'accommodement d'ordre m\u00e9dical avant f\u00e9vrier 2003. Mme Cole devait en fait savoir, ou \u00e0 tout le moins se douter, que Bell n'avait pas officiellement modifi\u00e9 sa position \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. C'est ce qui ressort du fait que, \u00e0 trois reprises, en octobre et novembre 2002, alors qu'on l'avait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 certains quarts de travail qui se terminaient apr\u00e8s 16 h 00, elle a imm\u00e9diatement communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Blackall, laquelle a rapidement corrig\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me et a vu \u00e0 ce que ses quarts de travail se terminent au plus tard \u00e0 16 h 00.\n[95] Mme Cole a reconnu que ce fut toujours elle qui pouvait d\u00e9cider quand arr\u00eater l'allaitement. Le p\u00e9diatre de son enfant lui avait tout simplement conseill\u00e9 de continuer l'allaitement tant et aussi longtemps que cela conviendrait \u00e0 elle et \u00e0 son fils.\n[96] Je ne suis pas convaincu que la d\u00e9cision prise en bout de ligne par Mme Cole de mettre fin \u00e0 l'allaitement fut vraiment li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avis de Mme Blackall; c'est plut\u00f4t par choix personnel que Mme Cole a mis fin \u00e0 l'allaitement. Le pr\u00e9judice moral qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 occasionn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Cole en raison de sa d\u00e9cision de ne plus allaiter son enfant en octobre 2002 a \u00e9t\u00e9, selon moi, trop indirect pour \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire de Bell.\n[97] Enfin, je ne peux pas ignorer le fait important que, de mai 2001 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2003, mois o\u00f9 Mme Cole a quitt\u00e9 le service HVQ, elle n'a jamais d\u00fb travailler sur un quart de travail qui devait se terminer apr\u00e8s 16 h 00. Il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises que, afin de terminer \u00e0 16 h 00, Mme Cole a d\u00fb utiliser des journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9 de maladie ou \u00e9changer ses quarts de travail avec d'autres employ\u00e9s, mais il n'en reste pas moins qu'elle n'a jamais travaill\u00e9 sur un quart de travail qui devait se terminer apr\u00e8s 16 h 00.\n[98] Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 Bell de verser \u00e0 Mme Cole la somme de 5 000 $ au titre de l'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi.\n(iii) L'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi [99] Mme Cole sollicite l'adjudication d'une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi. Elle pr\u00e9tend que Bell a commis un acte discriminatoire inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 contre elle. En refusant avec d\u00e9sinvolture de lui accorder aussi peu qu'un cong\u00e9 PNR de 15 minutes, sans \u00e9valuer davantage sa situation, et, au cours de la seconde \u00e9tape, en qualifiant mal sa situation comme \u00e9tant celle d'une employ\u00e9e invalide ou malade et en l'obligeant \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises chez sa m\u00e9decin, Bell a agi de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e\n[100] Selon le Black's Law Dictionary, un acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est un acte qui fait preuve d'indiff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences. Le mot recklessly dans la version anglaise de la Loi est traduit dans la version fran\u00e7aise par le mot inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, lequel semble envisager un acte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9fl\u00e9chie (qui t\u00e9moigne d'un manque de r\u00e9flexion; qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9, pes\u00e9 : Le petit Robert de la langue fran\u00e7aise - 2006).\n[101] Selon moi, dans une langue ou l'autre, le qualificatif peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire commis par Bell en l'esp\u00e8ce. Mme Long n'a pas sembl\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi aux cons\u00e9quences de sa r\u00e9ponse plut\u00f4t abrupte \u00e0 la demande de cong\u00e9 PNR de Mme Cole. La d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure de Bell de traiter le cas de Mme Cole comme \u00e9tant un cas d'ordre m\u00e9dical a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sans que l'on se demande d'abord si l'allaitement devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'une invalidit\u00e9 ou qu'une maladie. Cette d\u00e9cision a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un certain nombre de cons\u00e9quences f\u00e2cheuses pour Mme Cole, notamment que celle-ci a d\u00fb se rendre inutilement \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises chez sa m\u00e9decin.\n[102] Le paragraphe 53(3) mentionne qu'une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, notamment du fait que les actes discriminatoires commis par Bell n'\u00e9taient pas vraiment d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou malveillants, j'ordonne \u00e0 Bell de payer \u00e0 Mme Cole la somme de 2 000 $ au titre de l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3).\n(iv) La perte de salaires [103] Mme Cole demande, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), qu'on lui accorde une indemnit\u00e9 pour les salaires qu'elle a perdus en raison de l'acte discriminatoire. Cette demande peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9e en trois cat\u00e9gories. La premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie a trait aux cas o\u00f9 Mme Cole a d\u00fb quitter le travail sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration afin de se rendre chez sa m\u00e9decin dans le but d'obtenir les billets m\u00e9dicaux et de faire remplir les formulaires comme le GGI lui avait demand\u00e9. La deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de demande a trait au temps que Mme Cole a pass\u00e9 en dehors du travail afin de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'audience de sa plainte et a trait \u00e9galement aux deux s\u00e9ances de m\u00e9diation qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l'audience. Enfin, Mme Cole demande \u00e9galement qu'on lui accorde une indemnit\u00e9 pour les trois jours qu'elle a consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9paration pour l'audience (l'une de ces journ\u00e9es \u00e9tait une journ\u00e9e de travail qu'elle a prise en cong\u00e9 PNR).\n[104] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie de r\u00e9clamation, j'ordonne \u00e0 Bell de payer \u00e0 Mme Cole les salaires qu'elle a perdus en se rendant \u00e0 des rendez-vous chez sa m\u00e9decin afin d'obtenir les billets m\u00e9dicaux et les rapports demand\u00e9s.\n[105] En ce qui concerne les deux autres types de r\u00e9clamations, selon moi, je ne suis saisi, en l'esp\u00e8ce, d'aucune circonstance exceptionnelle qui justifierait l'octroi de telles indemnit\u00e9s (voir Canada (P.G.) c. Lambie (1996), 124 F.T.R. 303, [1996] A.C.F. no 1695 (C.F. 1re inst.); Woiden c. Lynn (2002), 43 C.H.R.R. D\/296 (T.C.D.P.)). Les r\u00e9clamations de Mme Cole au titre de ces chefs de dommage sont donc rejet\u00e9es.\n(v) Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [106] Des int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables sur les montants d'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal, mais compte tenu du d\u00e9p\u00f4t relativement tardif de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de Mme Cole en rapport avec l'acte discriminatoire, les int\u00e9r\u00eats courent \u00e0 compter de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, soit le 14 avril 2004.\n(vi) La d\u00e9claration de comp\u00e9tence par le Tribunal [107] Le Tribunal conservera sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 recevoir des t\u00e9moignages, \u00e0 entendre des arguments suppl\u00e9mentaires et \u00e0 rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires en ce qui a trait aux conflits ou aux probl\u00e8mes d\u00e9coulant de l'interpr\u00e9tation ou de l'application des redressements ordonn\u00e9s.\nAthanasios D.

Cette requ\u00eate faisait suite \u00e0 une lettre que la plaignante avait fait parvenir aux parties, ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal, le 22 mars 2007, dans laquelle elle annon\u00e7ait qu\u2019une telle requ\u00eate serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\nI. La position des parties A. La plaignante [2] La plaignante fonde sa requ\u00eate sur le fait que, depuis l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du calendrier d\u2019audience, sa situation personnelle a chang\u00e9 en ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient, depuis le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2006, un emploi au Conseil de la justice administrative du Qu\u00e9bec, organisme qui surveille la conduite d\u00e9ontologique de quelque 500 juges administratifs.\n[3] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019il lui est impossible de s\u2019absenter plus de deux semaines par mois de son emploi actuel, que si elle \u00e9tait contrainte de le faire, elle devrait d\u00e9missionner de son emploi. Par ailleurs, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9missionner de son emploi, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle serait alors contrainte de n\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente devant le Tribunal que lorsque son horaire de travail le lui permettrait.\n[4] Selon la plaignante, l\u2019organisme pour lequel elle travaille ne peut se passer d\u2019elle durant 6 ou 7 semaines cons\u00e9cutives. Dans son argumentation, la plaignante fait valoir qu\u2019elle repr\u00e9sente le tiers des effectifs de l\u2019organisme et que son absence priverait plus de 6 millions de justiciables qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de ses services.\n[5] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la plaignante affirme, par ailleurs, ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de trouver un accommodement raisonnable avec son employeur en ce qui concerne ses p\u00e9riodes d\u2019absence continue reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[6] La plaignante demande donc au Tribunal de se conformer \u00e0 la pratique usuelle du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir deux semaines d\u2019audition au maximum \u00e0 la fois (Lettre du 22 mars 2007).\n[7] Cela dit, \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 26 mars 2007, la plaignante a, par ailleurs, soutenu devant le Tribunal qu\u2019elle serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de son emploi si l\u2019audition de sa plainte se d\u00e9roulait durant deux mois cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[8] Enfin, la plaignante a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019en cas d\u2019\u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, elle serait vraisemblablement candidate pour le Parti n\u00e9o-d\u00e9mocrate. Elle devrait alors s\u2019absenter pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, soit le temps de la campagne \u00e9lectorale. La plaignante a fait valoir qu\u2019elle envisageait mal que pr\u00e8s de 85 000 \u00e9lecteurs soient priv\u00e9s d\u2019elle durant le temps de la campagne \u00e9lectorale. Pour ce qui est de son emploi, la plaignante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que sa convention collective lui permettait d\u2019avoir un cong\u00e9 sans solde.\nB. La Commission [9] Pour sa part, la Commission soutient que la demande de la plaignante vise \u00e0 l\u2019accommoder et ne constitue par un caprice de la part de cette derni\u00e8re. Elle invoque la difficult\u00e9 pour les personnes transgendres \u00e0 trouver un emploi.\n[10] Pour la Commission, demander \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sente pour quatre semaines cons\u00e9cutives est extr\u00eamement difficile pour celle-ci. En outre, ne pas faire droit \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante emp\u00eacherait cette derni\u00e8re de participer pleinement \u00e0 l\u2019audition de sa plainte. La Commission fait valoir que la plaignante a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre accommod\u00e9e et r\u00e9it\u00e8re que la Commission se rendra disponible quoi qu\u2019il advienne.\n[11] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la Commission n\u2019a fait aucune suggestion concr\u00e8te quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont elle envisageait la reprise des audiences si le Tribunal faisait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante.\nC. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [12] Pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, il ne saurait \u00eatre question de modifier le calendrier d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019une demande exorbitante de la part de la plaignante et qu\u2019aucune preuve ne fut entendue justifiant quelque modification que ce soit au calendrier d\u2019audience. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le calendrier actuel doit \u00eatre maintenu, sous r\u00e9serve de modifications mineures.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la modification du calendrier actuel lui causerait pr\u00e9judice alors qu\u2019elle s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9buter sa preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que ses t\u00e9moins sont appel\u00e9s dans un ordre logique et que d\u00e9placer l\u2019ordre des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce stade-ci des audiences lui causerait pr\u00e9judice.\n[14] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que modifier le calendrier d\u2019audition aurait pour effet d\u2019annuler plusieurs semaines d\u2019audition d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019all\u00e8gue la plaignante, doit garder le contr\u00f4le sur le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audience et la d\u00e9termination des dates d\u2019audition dans le respect des droits des parties. Elle rappelle que le calendrier d\u2019audience, tel qu\u2019\u00e9tabli, ne r\u00e9sulte pas de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une des parties mais d\u2019une concertation de toutes les parties.\n[15] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante doit accepter les cons\u00e9quences associ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audition de sa plainte et les engagements pris par les procureurs. Elle souligne que les multiples activit\u00e9s de la plaignante ne devraient pas dicter le d\u00e9roulement de la pr\u00e9sente instance et le calendrier d\u2019audience.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que le pr\u00e9sent dossier m\u00e9rite une gestion \u00e9troite, serr\u00e9e et qu\u2019il incombe au Tribunal de s\u2019assurer que les audiences proc\u00e8dent de fa\u00e7on raisonnable.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande donc au Tribunal de maintenir le pr\u00e9sent calendrier d\u2019audience.\nII. Discussion [18] Le Tribunal constate que la plaignante est une personne fort occup\u00e9e. En plus de son emploi actuel, elle est la webmestre du site internet du Conseil de la justice administrative. En outre, elle enseigne l\u2019\u00e9thique au Campus de L\u00e9vis de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, si\u00e8ge ou si\u00e9geait sur plusieurs comit\u00e9s ou commissions, entend \u00eatre candidate aux prochaines \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. La plaignante est, en outre, engag\u00e9e dans des litiges devant la Cour canadienne de l\u2019imp\u00f4t et la Cour d\u2019appel. Deux causes o\u00f9 elle est la plaignante sont actuellement pendantes devant le Tribunal.\n[19] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a connaissance du fait que la plaignante est impliqu\u00e9e dans une cause qui doit proc\u00e9der devant le Tribunal dans les semaines du 17 et du 24 avril 2007. Ces dates furent fix\u00e9es une fois les dates dans la pr\u00e9sente instance connues. L\u2019acceptation de ces dates par la plaignante fait en sorte qu\u2019elle doit affronter 6 semaines cons\u00e9cutives d\u2019audience en avril et mai, ce qui ne semble pas \u00eatre acceptable pour son employeur.\n[20] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ses multiples activit\u00e9s et au nouvel emploi qu\u2019elle occupe, la plaignante fait valoir qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour elle que le Tribunal ne si\u00e8ge que deux semaines par mois. Ceci lui permettrait de ne pas avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de son emploi actuel. Soit dit en passant, aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal voulant que la plaignante serait tenue de d\u00e9missionner de son emploi si le Tribunal ne faisait pas droit \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate.\n[21] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal est conscient que le pr\u00e9sent calendrier d\u2019audience impose de multiples contraintes aux parties, ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal. Cela dit, le Tribunal entend rappeler aux parties que les dates d\u2019audience dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es, pour l\u2019essentiel, en octobre et d\u00e9cembre 2006 avec l\u2019accord de toutes les parties. Plusieurs journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience ont alors \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 la confection du calendrier d\u2019audience. Une fois le calendrier \u00e9tabli, le Tribunal a pris les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9server des salles d\u2019audience dans divers emplacements. La fixation des dates d\u2019audience dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier a eu \u00e9galement un impact sur la disponibilit\u00e9 du membre instructeur pour entendre d\u2019autres plaintes et sur la fixation de dates dans d\u2019autres causes dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[22] En l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du dossier, quatre semaines d\u2019audience sont pr\u00e9vues en mai, cinq semaines d\u2019audience en juillet et une semaine en octobre. Il y a possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une autre semaine d\u2019audience en octobre pour permettre, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter une contre-preuve.\n[23] Modifier le calendrier actuel \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci des proc\u00e9dures, alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve, en suivant la suggestion de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir fixer deux semaines d\u2019audience par mois au maximum afin de l\u2019accommoder signifierait :\nl\u2019annulation de deux semaines d\u2019audience en mai et leur report en juillet en raison de la non disponibilit\u00e9 du membre instructeur en juin; l\u2019annulation des arrangements pris pour la r\u00e9servation de salles d\u2019audience; le d\u00e9placement des t\u00e9moignages des m\u00e9decins-experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en juillet, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur disponibilit\u00e9 ; le report des cinq semaines d\u2019audience du mois de juillet en octobre et novembre, le membre instructeur n\u2019\u00e9tant pas disponible en ao\u00fbt et septembre ; l\u2019annulation des arrangements pris pour la r\u00e9servation de salles d\u2019audience ; l\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins experts de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 des dates ult\u00e9rieures ; le report du t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami, pr\u00e9vu pour la semaine du 22 octobre 2007 ; la fixation de deux semaines d\u2019audition en octobre pour la suite de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; la fixation de deux semaines d\u2019audition en novembre pour la suite de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; la fixation de deux semaines d\u2019audition en d\u00e9cembre, une semaine pour compl\u00e9ter la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et une semaine pour entendre le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami dans le cadre de la preuve de la Commission ; la fixation d\u2019une autre semaine d\u2019audition en janvier pour une \u00e9ventuelle contre-preuve de la plaignante.\n[24] Dans les faits, une modification du calendrier actuel selon la proposition initiale de la plaignante, qui a termin\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve, signifierait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait contrainte d\u2019\u00e9taler sa preuve sur une p\u00e9riode de huit mois, soit de mai \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2007, alors que, suivant le calendrier actuel, la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait close au d\u00e9but du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal, cette fa\u00e7on de faire ne servirait pas les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice et serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 ce stade-ci des proc\u00e9dures, s\u2019est assur\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sence de ses t\u00e9moins, tant ordinaires qu\u2019experts et ce, depuis fort longtemps.\n[25] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la plaignante, bien qu\u2019elle ait propos\u00e9 que les audiences soient limit\u00e9es \u00e0 deux semaines par mois afin d\u2019\u00e9viter, selon elle, qu\u2019elle perde son emploi, a soutenu n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner de son emploi si les audiences avaient lieu sur une p\u00e9riode de deux mois cons\u00e9cutifs.\n[26] Pour assurer le bon d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il ne suffit pas pour une partie de simplement sugg\u00e9rer un nouveau modus operandi sans en pr\u00e9ciser les tenants et aboutissants et laisser \u00e0 plus tard la d\u00e9termination d\u2019un nouveau calendrier d\u2019audience, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 du membre instructeur, des procureurs, des t\u00e9moins. La saine gestion d\u2019une audience ne le permet pas.\n[27] Le calendrier d\u2019audience pr\u00e9sentement en vigueur \u00e9tait connu de la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 elle a accept\u00e9 son nouvel emploi. En d\u00e9cembre 2006, lorsque la plaignante a obtenu son nouvel emploi, elle aurait d\u00fb informer son employeur de l\u2019\u00e9tat de ses contestations judiciaires devant le Tribunal et du temps qui devrait leur \u00eatre consacr\u00e9.\n[28] Le Tribunal est pr\u00eat \u00e0 accommoder les parties en autant que la demande d\u2019une partie est raisonnable et que les alternatives propos\u00e9es sont viables. Les alternatives propos\u00e9es par la plaignante, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit deux mois d\u2019audience cons\u00e9cutifs ou deux semaines d\u2019audience par mois, ne sont pas, \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l\u2019audition de sa plainte, raisonnables.\n[29] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est du devoir des parties de respecter les engagements pris, en connaissance de cause, en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9roulement de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[30] Il importe de noter, enfin, qu\u2019une fois la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e close, il restera encore plusieurs journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles le calendrier n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9, si ce n\u2019est pour le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Beltrami dans la semaine du 22 octobre 2007.\n[31] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la poursuite des auditions dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, les parties pourront faire, en temps opportun, toutes les repr\u00e9sentations qu\u2019elles jugent utiles de faire. Pour l\u2019heure, il importe de respecter le calendrier d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli.\nIII. D\u00e9cision [32] Pour les consid\u00e9rations exprim\u00e9es ci-dessus, la requ\u00eate de la plaignante visant \u00e0 faire modifier le calendrier d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 arr\u00eat\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9. La reprise des auditions aura donc lieu, tel que pr\u00e9vu, le 30 avril 2006 et les auditions se d\u00e9rouleront selon le calendrier d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 transmis aux parties.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPierre Deschamps\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 5 avril 2007\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1047\/2805\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Micheline Montreuil c.

Hadjis\n[1] Le 30 mars 2007, Mme Gaucher a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au Tribunal afin d'obtenir un ajournement de l'audience qui devait reprendre le 16 avril 2006, \u00e0 Edmonton. Comme elle l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 30 mars 2007, elle a fait cette demande parce qu'elle n'avait pas encore trouv\u00e9 d'avocat pour la repr\u00e9senter.\n[2] Le 5 avril 2007, Mme Gaucher a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que j'avais rejet\u00e9 sa demande et que je d\u00e9livrerais ult\u00e9rieurement les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\n[3] Dans l'intervalle, avant que je ne prononce mes motifs, Mme Gaucher, le 11 avril 2007, a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal dans lequel elle mentionnait que comme on lui avait refus\u00e9 un autre ajournement, elle n'avait pas d'autre choix que de mettre fin \u00e0 son action. \u00c0 la date et \u00e0 l'heure o\u00f9 je suis en train de signer la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal n'a toujours pas re\u00e7u de demande officielle de retrait de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[4] Que cette demande soit oui ou non pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je crois que je dois toujours exposer les motifs pour lesquels j'ai rejet\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re demande de report pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Gaucher quant \u00e0 l'audition de sa plainte.\n[5] Mme Gaucher a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 16 juin 1998. La Commission, \u00e0 son tour, a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2004. Depuis le renvoi, Mme Gaucher a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par deux avocats diff\u00e9rents et elle a mis fin au mandat du dernier en liste le 1er novembre 2006. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le Tribunal avait entendu des t\u00e9moignages pendant pr\u00e8s de trois semaines. Les deux premi\u00e8res semaines d'audience se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es \u00e0 Edmonton et la troisi\u00e8me semaine s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 Halifax. \u00c0 ce point, Mme Gaucher n'avait pas encore termin\u00e9 sa preuve, mais il semblait que la majorit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins qu'elle entendait produire avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[6] Lorsque Mme Gaucher a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle avait mis fin au mandat de son avocat, elle a demand\u00e9 un ajournement de l'audience, laquelle, d\u00e8s lors, \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e se poursuivre pendant un peu plus de deux semaines \u00e0 compter du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2006. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait \u00e9galement cens\u00e9 entendre, le 28 novembre 2006, le t\u00e9moignage d'un t\u00e9moin par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Le 3 novembre 2006, une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue afin de traiter notamment de la demande d'ajournement. Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 l'ajournement, mais il a inform\u00e9 les parties de fa\u00e7on claire et non \u00e9quivoque que la cause serait instruite lors des prochaines dates d'audience, peu importe que la plaignante ait pu retenir ou non les services d'un avocat d'ici-l\u00e0.\n[7] Les parties ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elles \u00e9taient pr\u00eates \u00e0 poursuivre la cause en avril et, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 des dates pour la tenue de l'audience \u00e0 Edmonton, laquelle audience s'\u00e9tendrait sur une p\u00e9riode de deux semaines, et ce, \u00e0 compter du 16 avril 2007.\n[8] Un certain nombre de conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion de cas ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re dans les mois qui ont suivi. Lors de chacune de ces conf\u00e9rences, Mme Gaucher a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de trouver un autre avocat pour la repr\u00e9senter dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Je l'ai inform\u00e9e que, peu importe le r\u00e9sultat de sa recherche, je m'attendais \u00e0 ce qu'elle proc\u00e8de, avec ou sans avocat, lorsque la cause reprendrait en avril.\n[9] Durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de cas qui a eu lieu le 29 mars 2007, Mme Gaucher a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas encore trouv\u00e9 de nouvel avocat et elle a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de lui accorder un autre ajournement. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans une lettre de suivi \u00e9manant du Tribunal, j'ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, compte tenu du nombre d'ajournements qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire (trois ajournements avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience et un autre ajournement lorsque Mme Gaucher a mis fin au mandat de son avocat en novembre 2006), l'audience ne pouvait pas \u00eatre retard\u00e9e davantage. J'ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gaucher de prendre des dispositions pour faire compara\u00eetre ses t\u00e9moins aux dates d'audience pr\u00e9vues pour avril. Je l'ai \u00e9galement inform\u00e9e que comme, selon ses dires, l'un de ses t\u00e9moins r\u00e9sidait au Manitoba, des dispositions pourraient \u00eatre prises afin de permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de t\u00e9moigner par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[10] Le 30 mars 2007, Mme Gaucher a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au Tribunal afin de demander une fois de plus un ajournement. C'est cette derni\u00e8re demande que je suis en train de traiter dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Mme Gaucher a essentiellement demand\u00e9 que je r\u00e9examine ma d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure. Je ne vois aucune raison de modifier cette d\u00e9cision. Mme Gaucher a fait \u00e9tat de certaines difficult\u00e9s qu'elle a eues pour obtenir l'approbation de financement de la part de l'aide juridique. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que son avocat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent avait retenu son dossier pendant un certain nombre de mois, mais je dois souligner que, d'apr\u00e8s sa lettre, ce n'est que le 26 janvier 2007 qu'elle a apparemment tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ce dossier, soit pr\u00e8s de trois mois apr\u00e8s avoir cong\u00e9di\u00e9 son avocat.\n[11] Mme Gaucher a pr\u00e9tendu dans sa lettre qu'elle n'avait pu prendre aucune disposition pour que certains de ses t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moignent lors des prochaines dates d'audience parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas en possession de son dossier dans lequel figurait la liste des t\u00e9moins potentiels que son avocat avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9e dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure de divulgation des documents du Tribunal. Toutefois, le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2007, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gaucher une copie CD de l'ensemble de la correspondance figurant dans le dossier du Tribunal, notamment de l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de son avocat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, lequel comprenait la liste des t\u00e9moins. Mme Gaucher a soulign\u00e9 que le CD a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 son ancienne adresse ce qui en a retard\u00e9 la livraison. Elle n'avait cependant pas inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de sa nouvelle adresse.\n[12] L'intim\u00e9e, pour sa part, ne consent pas \u00e0 ce que l'on ajourne une autre fois. L'avocate de l'intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9tat du pr\u00e9judice que celle-ci subirait en raison de la grande quantit\u00e9 de temps et d'argent qui est gaspill\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque fois que l'avocat et les t\u00e9moins doivent pr\u00e9parer la reprise d'une audience qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e. Elle souligne qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public que les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de discrimination soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9es en temps opportun.\n[13] En effet, l'instruction des plaintes devant le Tribunal se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (article 48.9 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne). Selon moi, exiger \u00e0 ce stade-ci que Mme Gaucher termine sa preuve, environ neuf ans apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, trois ans apr\u00e8s que celle-ci fut renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, apr\u00e8s trois semaines d'audience et suite \u00e0 quatre ajournements, ne constituerait pas une violation des exigences de la justice naturelle. Mme Gaucher a reconnu au cours des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu'elle avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver un avocat poss\u00e9dant des connaissances suffisantes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui consentirait \u00e0 s'occuper de son dossier \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l'affaire. Compte tenu de ces circonstances, on ne s'attend pas raisonnablement \u00e0 ce que Mme Gaucher trouve un avocat dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9.\n[14] Selon moi, permettre \u00e0 Mme Gaucher de retarder sa cause pour une p\u00e9riode de temps ind\u00e9finie, sans aucun r\u00e8glement, serait injuste et nuirait de fa\u00e7on inacceptable \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 un certain moment, les parties doivent toutes avoir termin\u00e9 leur preuve. Il est peut-\u00eatre regrettable que la plaignante n'ait pas pu retenir les services d'un avocat, mais ce probl\u00e8me a moins d'importance que l'injustice qui serait commise envers l'autre partie si on permettait que la pr\u00e9sente affaire demeure non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e au beau milieu de la preuve pendant que la plaignante tente ind\u00e9finiment de se trouver un avocat.\n[15] Voici donc les motifs pour lesquels j'ai rejet\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re demande d'ajournement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Gaucher.\nAthanasios D.
