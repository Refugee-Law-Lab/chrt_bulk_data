Background [1] The Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (the Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN), have filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounts to discrimination on the basis of race and national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\n[2] On July 10, 2012, a Panel composed of Members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer, was appointed by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) to hear this case (2012 CHRT 16).\n[3] On December 9, 2013, the Commission recalled Dr. Cindy Blackstock to the stand. Following an objection from the Respondent pertaining to the admissibility of a document being put to Dr. Blackstock and, after hearing the parties\u2019 submissions on the issue, the Tribunal briefly adjourned the proceedings to consider the objection. The Tribunal advised the parties that, in light of the Commission\u2019s intention to put a number of other newly disclosed documents to Dr. Blackstock in a similar manner, the Tribunal felt that it would be best to decide the issue of document admissibility at that time, rather than to wait until the end of the hearing as had been initially agreed upon by the parties.\n[4] The Caring Society advised the Tribunal that it would therefore file a motion regarding document admissibility with the Tribunal the following day, or soon thereafter. The Caring Society provided the Tribunal and parties with a Notice of Motion, entitled \u201cMotion for an Order Admitting Documents as Evidence for the Truth of their Contents\u201d.\n[5] In a Case Management Conference (CMC) in the afternoon of December 9, 2013, the parties agreed to argue the Motion on December 10, 2013. The parties also agreed to argue the question of the parameters of the recall of witnesses, as raised by the Respondent.\n[6] Given the fact that the Complainants had planned to have Dr. Blackstock testify in early January 2014, and in order to expedite matters so as to provide the parties with greater certainty, the Tribunal issued, on January 6, 2014, a point form ruling with reasons to follow.\n[7] On January 14, 2014, the Commission recalled Dr. Blackstock to the stand. The parties requested clarification of the Tribunal\u2019s point form ruling of January 6, 2014. The Tribunal deliberated on the matter and, following a brief adjournment, orally issued the following clarification decision:\n1. Portion means \u201ca part\u201d. The use of the term portion in the point form ruling means the part that the witness is testifying about or that Counsel directs the Panel to. For example, Dr. Blackstock testified to several portions of the BC service agreement found at tab 275;\n2. The Panel\u2019s intention is to ensure that the opposing party knows the case to be met in response to the party adducing evidence;\n3. In dispensing of the requirement to authenticate documents through a witness, the Tribunal did not intend to permit the party adducing evidence to rely on evidence during its final argument that wasn\u2019t introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing according to the procedure set out in paragraph c of the point form ruling without giving the opposing party an opportunity to adequately prepare a response, if need be; [Underlining ours]\n4. If a party intends in argument to rely on portions of documents that were not introduced during the hearing phase in accordance with paragraph c), it runs the risk of the Panel allowing the opposing party additional time to adequately prepare a response. [Underlining ours]\n5. The Tribunal takes note of Mr. Champ\u2019s suggestion that prior to the Respondent commencing its case, he will provide a clear indication of portions of documents not introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing that he intends to rely on in argument. [Underlining ours]\n6. This may help to allow the Respondent to prepare its own evidence during the hearing phase and may avoid the need for the Panel to provide the curative measures set out in paragraph d) of the point form decision. [Underlining ours]\n[8] The reasons of the point form ruling were provided on January 16, 2014 (2014 CHRT 2).\n[9] On October 24, 2014, the hearing on the merits concluded and the Panel advised the parties it would communicate to them, the following week, on a process to best address the evidence forming part of the Tribunal\u2019s evidentiary record.\n[10] On November 3, 2014, the Tribunal requested that the parties \"circulate and exchange between themselves a list indicating what documents were not referred to by the parties at the hearing from the evidence filed at the Tribunal also considering the Commission's and the Complainants' Chart, detailing the documents upon which the Complainants had relied in support of their case.\n[11] In its letter dated December 1, 2014, the Commission provided the Tribunal with a list found at Appendix A, listing the documents that the parties agree can be removed from the Books of Documents. The documents are identified according to their exhibit and tab numbers.\n[12] In the same letter, the Commission also listed documents over which there is no agreement. The list is found at Appendix B of the Commission\u2019s letter. (See Appendix B for reference).\n[13] The Commission stated it understands that the documents listed in Appendix B fall into the two following categories:\na) Documents in Exhibits HR-01 to HR-15 which were identified in the Commission and Complainants' Chart as being \"relied on by Counsel\", but which were not referred to during the oral hearing or in final written submissions; and\nb) Documents in Exhibits HR-01 to HR-15 which were identified in the Commission and Complainants' Chart as being \"relied on by Counsel\", which were referred to only in final written submissions. One document from Exhibit R-13 also falls into this category. [Underlining ours]\n[14] The Commission also indicated that, based on its discussions with the parties, it understands that the Attorney General objects to the above-mentioned categories of documents forming part of the record before the Tribunal because they were not entered into evidence in accordance with paragraph 75 of the Tribunal's ruling of January 16, 2014 (2014 CHRT 2), which states:\nThe witnesses who have previously given evidence, to the extent that they testified with respect to portions of documents tendered in evidence and to their relevance to the issues in this case, have done so in a manner consistent with this paragraph of the Panel's point form ruling. The documents that will be removed at the end of the hearing will be all documents where no portion has been referred to by a witness in testimony or by Counsel during oral argument. In rendering its final decision, the Tribunal will be relying on the portions of documents tendered that have been referred to in this manner. [Underlining ours]\n[15] The Commission\u2019s position is reproduced in part below:\nEarlier this year, the Commission and Complainants prepared a Chart outlining the portions of each document in Exhibits HR-01 to HR-15, Exhibit C-2 and Exhibit AFN-1 upon which we intended to rely. The purpose of this Chart, which was initially provided to the Tribunal and parties on March 5, 2014 in advance of the start of the Attorney General's case, was to ensure that these documents were introduced in accordance with part (c) of the Tribunal's point-form ruling of January 6, 2014, which states:\nc. For the purposes of Rule 9(4), a document has not been fully \"introduced\" at the hearing until counsel or a witness for the party tendering it has indicated:\ni. which portions of the document are being relied upon; and\nii. how these portions of the document relate to an issue in the case.\n[16] Following further disclosure from the Attorney General and the close of the Respondent\u2019s case, the Commission and Complainants circulated an updated version of the Chart to the Tribunal and parties on July 9, 2014, with a corresponding letter indicating that in their view:\n(i) the documents shaded in \"grey\" in the Chart could be removed from the Commission's Books of Documents HR-01 to HR-15 in accordance with Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure; and\n(ii) the remaining documents had been properly introduced.\n[17] The Commission received no response from the Attorney General and no concerns were raised with respect to the admissibility and proper introduction of the documents listed in the Chart. The Attorney General now raises concerns regarding the admissibility of documents \"relied on by Counsel\" for the Commission, the Caring Society and the AFN that were not referred to by Counsel orally during the hearing.\n[18] In the Commission\u2019s view, the documents identified in the Commission\u2019s and Complainant\u2019s Chart as being \"relied on by Counsel\" ought to form part of the record before the Tribunal, regardless of whether they were explicitly referred to during the oral hearing, for the following reasons. First, the Attorney General has had ample notice of the Commission and Complainants\u2019 intention to rely on these documents, and has therefore suffered no prejudice.\n[19] Second, in the Commission\u2019s view, the inclusion of these documents complies with the letter and spirit of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling (2014 CHRT 2). For all these reasons, the Commission submits that all of the documents listed in Appendix B ought to form part of the record before the Tribunal.\n[20] On the same day, the Caring Society and the AFN wrote to the parties and the Tribunal, supporting the Commission\u2019s position that all of the documents listed in Appendix B ought to form part of the record before the Tribunal.\n[21] The Caring Society noted that the Tribunal\u2019s January 2014 ruling (2014 CHRT 2) allowed a party to refer to a document for the first time in its closing arguments, which would have given the other parties as little as a day to prepare a response to use the document. Given that such use of document was contemplated under the Tribunal\u2019s January 2014 ruling, there should be no objection to the Caring Society having referred to documents in its reply, which the Respondent received two weeks before closing oral arguments, or in its written submissions, which the Respondent received two months before closing oral arguments.\n[22] The Respondent also replied that same day to the parties\u2019 correspondence and requested clarification of the Tribunal\u2019s January 2014 ruling, more specifically with regard to paragraph 75 (reproduced above), as there was uncertainty and lack of consensus among the parties regarding its meaning. The Respondent requested a ruling from the Tribunal so as to determine whether documents introduced by Counsel during \u201coral argument\u201d, as described in paragraph 75, include those that are relied upon by the parties in their written submissions only.\n[23] The present ruling aims to provide this clarity.\nII. Analysis [24] The Panel\u2019s ruling must be read in its entirety, therefore, it is important to avoid isolating specific paragraphs from the rest of the decision in an effort to properly understand the context and reasons thereof.\n[25] For ease of reference, the paragraphs containing the reasons in the Tribunal\u2019s January 16, 2014 ruling are reproduced below:\n[67] The legislature has, in these provisions, provided explicitly for the limitations to the Tribunal\u2019s ability to admit evidence and to compel witnesses. With the exception of these limitations, paragraph 50(3)(c) allows the Tribunal to \u201creceive and accept any evidence and other information\u201d which is limited only by the Tribunal overarching duty of procedural fairness pursuant to paragraphs 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act and the relevancy of the evidence: Dhanjal v. Air Canada, [1996] C.H.R.D. No. 4 at paras. 21-22; Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50 at para. 124 [Warman].\n[68] As a creature of statute, the Tribunal derives its powers solely from its enabling legislation. In the context of the present motion, the jurisprudence has recognized that the wide discretion provided at paragraph 50(3)(c) allows the Tribunal to receive and accept hearsay evidence: Canada (Attorney General) v. Mills (F.C.A.), [1984] F.C.J. No. 917. The parties\u2019 submissions pertaining to the principled approach of reliability and necessity along with the common law exceptions to hearsay are of little help in this regard.\n[69] The Tribunal agrees with the Caring Society and the Commission that it would be onerous and unhelpful to require that they call the authors of the documents for the sole purpose of authenticating them. The parties agreed that this would not be a necessary step at the February 19, 2013, CMCC prior to the beginning of this hearing. The Tribunal\u2019s practice in this case so far has been to admit relevant documents, regardless of hearsay, on a case-by-case basis as the parties introduce them into evidence, and to consider any issues regarding their reliability at the weighing stage. This enables the Tribunal to clearly identify the record which will form the basis for its final decision. The Tribunal informed the parties that this is the approach that it would follow in its oral ruling of February 26, 2013. This approach is also supported by the jurisprudence: Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks, 2006 FC 1244 at paras. 36 \u2013 38; Warman, supra, at para. 124. Contrary to the submissions of the Complainants and the Commission, the Tribunal is not of the view that the decisions in Ault, PIPS and \u00c9thier support the admission of documents in a blanket manner. The Tribunal sees no reason to now depart from its practice and admit at once \u201call documents contained in HR Binders 1 to 13 which were obtained from the Respondent through the Access to Information Act, Privacy Act, or disclosure in these proceedings\u201d, as requested in the Caring Society\u2019s motion.\n[70] The motion goes even further and as such, has highlighted the importance for the Tribunal to take this opportunity to further clarify its rules of procedure regarding the introduction of evidence. In its motion, in addition to seeking a blanket admission of the documents, the Caring Society requests that the documents be \u201cadmissible as evidence for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not they are put to a witness\u201d. It seeks, in this regard, an exception to the Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 9(4), the Tribunal\u2019s usual practice at the end of a hearing is to remove from the Books of Documents any document which parties have not referred to during the proceedings. The Commission confirmed its understanding of this rule and its applicability in the February 19, 2013, CMCC and the Tribunal informed all parties of this procedure in the summary of this CMCC.\n[71] If the Tribunal were to allow this request, this would mean that documents which were never discussed by a witness during the hearing would be admitted into evidence and form part of the record. The Caring Society does not state that it would instead refer to these documents in final argument, although Counsel for the Caring Society expressed in oral argument that it was their intention to do so as much as possible. The result is that documents, never discussed at any point during the hearing, could conceivably form part of the evidence on which the Tribunal is to rely to render its final decision. [Emphasis ours]\n[72] This request raises a number of issues. The Complainants have already tendered several hundred documents and recently reiterated their wish to reserve their right to introduce an unknown amount of additional documents as they complete their review of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. Allowing this request would put the Tribunal in the position of having to examine and even interpret potentially lengthy and even technical documents without the benefit of any viva voce evidence or oral argument. While the Tribunal recognizes that the amount of evidence introduced is significantly less than the hundred thousand plus documents that formed part of the disclosure that the parties had to review, this does not discharge the Complainants of the onus of making their case. [Emphasis ours]\n[73] Moreover, to proceed in this manner also raises a serious issue of fairness for the Respondent. In both the point form decision and the clarification decision, the Tribunal expressed the necessity for a party to know the case that it needs to meet[Emphasis ours]. In admitting documents without requiring that the Complainants specify their relevance to the case and the manner in which they support their position, the Tribunal may place the Respondent in a position where it is unable to adequately respond or rebut this evidence.\n[74] In light of this, as stated in the Tribunal\u2019s point form decision, the Tribunal denies the request for an exception to Rule 9(4) and will, at the end of the hearing, proceed with the removal of documents that have not been properly introduced and accepted by the Tribunal, which would have thereby completed their admission into evidence [Emphasis ours]. The Tribunal clarified the necessary steps to follow to ensure the introduction of documents at paragraph c. of its point form decision. In doing so, the Tribunal has relaxed the application of Rule 9(4). This paragraph reads as follows:\nc. For the purposes of Rule 9(4), a document has not been fully \u201cintroduced\u201d at the hearing until counsel or a witness for the party tendering it has indicated:\ni. which portions of the document are being relied upon; and\nii. how these portions of the document relate to an issue in the case.\n[Emphasis ours]\n[75] The witnesses who have previously given evidence, to the extent that they testified with respect to portions of documents tendered in evidence and to their relevance to the issues in this case, have done so in a manner consistent with this paragraph of the Panel\u2019s point form ruling. The documents that will be removed at the end of the hearing will be all documents where no portion has been referred to by a witness in testimony or by Counsel during oral argument. In rendering its final decision, the Tribunal will be relying on the portions of documents tendered that have been referred to in this manner.\n[76] Counsel for the Commission and the Caring Society have indicated that it is their intention to lead the Panel in their closing submissions to portions of the documents tendered into evidence in this case that they feel are relevant to the proceedings. To the extent that they do so in respect to portions of documents not testified to by witnesses, this is a departure from normal practice and the Tribunal\u2019s usual procedure with regard to leading evidence. While, in light of its flexible Rules of Procedure, the Tribunal has allowed this request, this departure from usual practice requires that the Tribunal ensure the observance of natural justice principles. [Emphasis ours]\n[77] Parties are free to decide their strategy to present their case, however fairness dictates that parties must also know the case they have to meet and can adequately prepare a response. If the Complainants or any other party wishes to introduce during its final argument evidence which was not introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing, the Tribunal provided for a curative provision that may be invoked to remedy any unfairness caused to the opposing party. This is found at paragraph d. of the point form ruling which reads:\nd. Should a party wish to rely on evidence during its final argument that was not introduced according to the procedure above (either prior to or subsequent to this order), appropriate curative measures may be taken by the Panel, and in particular, the opposing party may be allotted additional time to adequately prepare a response, including calling additional witnesses and bringing forward additional documentary evidence, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness. This may result in an adjournment of the proceedings. [Emphasis and underlining ours]\n[78] The Complainants and the Commission have not yet closed their case and may still decide to call additional witnesses. The Complainants and for the Commission have also communicated their intent to provide the Tribunal and the Respondent with a chart in which they will detail the portions of the documents on which they will rely during final argument. They have indicated that they would provide this chart in advance of the beginning of the Respondent\u2019s case so as to allow the Respondent to adequately respond. In as much as the Respondent will receive this chart in advance of the beginning of the presentation of its case it may be helpful to the Respondent in presenting its case and avoid the need to invoke the curative provisions of paragraph d. of the point form ruling. This, of course, will depend on what the chart actually includes in describing the portions of relied on and the time that the Respondent will have to review the document in advance of having to present its case. [Emphasis and underlining ours]\n[26] As highlighted in these paragraphs, the purpose of the ruling was to ensure the opposing party knows the case it has to meet and to avoid leaving it up to the Panel to interpret technical evidence and information without the benefit of hearing an explanation as to the relevance of a specific document through a witness or Counsel. The Complainants and the Commission provided the Respondent with a Chart, detailing the portions of documents on which they were going to rely, before the Respondent commenced its case. Given the ongoing nature of the disclosure, they also amended their Chart as new evidence was disclosed.\n[27] The Respondent was therefore put on notice over a month prior to the hearing on final arguments. Yet it is only after the hearing, on December 1, 2014, that the Respondent objected to documents being entered into evidence that were only referred to by Counsel in final written submissions. The Respondent chose to wait rather than raising its objection at the hearing on final oral arguments.\n[28] The only exception to this is tab 66. The Caring Society included this document in the binders of evidence in support of its case, but did not expressly refer to portions of the document during the oral proceedings. The Respondent, however, raised the document in its final submissions, challenging its credibility and weight. In so doing, the Respondent opened the door for the Caring Society to refute the Respondent\u2019s assertions in its reply and, in the process, to rely on the document which it reproduced at tab 66. The Caring Society\u2019s reply was provided to the Respondent two weeks before the hearing of final oral arguments, providing the Respondent with sufficient time to respond. For these reasons, the Panel is of the view that tab 66 should be considered as forming part of the evidentiary record before the Tribunal. With regard to tab 477, also referred to in the Caring Society\u2019s reply, the Panel notes, that this document was also raised in the Commission\u2019s written submissions. The Panel therefore does not consider this document as forming part of the above-mentioned exception.\n[29] We also have to bear in mind the special circumstances and disclosure history in this case that prompted these specific measures. At the time of the January 16, 2014 ruling, the Panel was not fully aware that the disclosure of documents would continue until after the hearing, as late as August 2014, when final written submissions from the Complainants and the Commission were due.\nIII. Order [30] In an effort to respect the spirit of the entire ruling, in fairness to all parties, and in order to address the special circumstances that were created with parties receiving documentary disclosure after the closing of the parties\u2019 case, the Panel orders the following:\nDocuments listed in Appendix B of the Commission\u2019s December 1, 2014 letter (including Documents Referred to Only in Final Written Submissions (which were Adopted Orally) found at page 9) will be considered as forming part of the evidentiary record. The Respondent will be granted an opportunity to respond to the Complainant\u2019s documents listed in Appendix B and supporting submissions with the exception of tab-66. Should the Respondent decide to benefit from this opportunity, the Respondent is to advise the parties and the Tribunal of its intention and form of response by no later than January 21, 2015, following which the Respondent will have until February 4, 2015 to file its response.\nThe Panel continues to reserve the right to ask clarification questions to the parties concerning any issue or document while it reviews the evidence.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nEdward P.

Introduction\n[1] On March 7, 2014 I rendered a decision (2014 CHRT 10) that, in 2003, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) engaged in discriminatory practices against the Complainant contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA); that by reason of his age, race, colour and a perceived disability of obesity, CBSA wilfully deprived the Complainant of employment opportunities in Vancouver Competition 1002 and Victoria Competition 7003.\n[2] In section VI of my March 7, 2014 decision I made a series of determinations including:\n[257] Based on reasons stated throughout this decision, and in all the surrounding circumstances of this case, I made findings of fact that Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Baird were not credible witnesses; they revealed similar characteristics, often reticent, often resorting to prolixity in order to avoid making direct dispassionate answers. Both floundered under cross- examination. Wherever their evidence differs with that of Mr. Turner, I have accepted Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence.\n[258] Neither Mr. Tarnawski or Mr. Baird provided a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory.\n[259] I find that the interviews of Mr. Turner by Mr. Tarnawski (Vancouver Competition 1002) and Mr. Baird (Victoria Competition 7003) were flawed and injudicious, that they were conducted in a manner which denied Mr. Turner an opportunity to compete for indeterminate employment with CBSA; and that in each case the decision was arbitrary and pretextual, based on prejudice, and constituted discriminatory practices under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[3] In section VII of my March 7, 2014 decision I cited s. 53 of the CHRA:\n[263] Section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA provides that a complainant may be compensated up to $20,000 for pain and suffering experienced as a victim of a discriminatory practice. After a subsequent hearing on remedy, I will order the Respondent to pay such amount as may be appropriate to the Complainant compensating him for pain and suffering experienced after he was denied employment opportunities.\n[264] Section 53(3) of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to the victim if the Respondent is found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. I find that Respondent managers Ron Tarnawski and Trevor Baird acted wilfully in denying the Complainant an opportunity for employment. I will, in due course, after the remedy hearing, make an order in compensation for their wilfulness.\n[265] Section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA provides that a victim may be compensated for any and all wages of which he was deprived as a result of the discriminatory practice. I find that the Complainant did suffer lost wages that he would have earned as a Border Services Officer. The wage loss shall be determined by calculating the total earnings the Complainant would have earned as a Border Services Officer and deducting from that sum the amount of salary the Complainant has been able to earn from other mitigating employment. Income earned by the Complainant in his effort to mitigate his loss of earnings as a Border Services Officer must be supported by particulars and personal income tax returns.\n[266] Interest is payable in respect of all awards made in this decision under s. 53(4) of the CHRA. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. Interest is to be calculated from the date of the complaint with respect to the compensation for lost wages, pain and suffering, and special damages.\n[267] During the hearing on remedy I will consider whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to order the Respondent to offer employment to the Complainant.\nII. Wilfullness\n[4] In my March 7, 2014 decision I summarized the testimony of Respondent superintendents Ron Tarnawski and Trevor Baird. I found neither of them to be credible witnesses. I now determine that in each of the Competitions the respective conduct of Ron Tarnawski and Trevor Baird was wilful. It was deliberate, driven by prejudice and permeated with an ulterior motive to deny the Complainant an opportunity to continue in being employed with CBSA.\nIII. Denial of Employment Opportunity \u2013 How It Affected the Complainant\n[5] The following is an extract from extensive testimony of the Complainant in the hearing of his complaint conducted by Chairperson Sinclair:\nQ. (Mr. Yazbeck) Mr. Turner, generally with respect to the denial of promotional opportunities in Victoria and Vancouver competitions, how did that affect you?\nA. It affected me quite a bit. I mean, when I was first told that I wasn\u2019t going to be coming back, because I had been trying --- hard to get on full- time with them, I was stressed out. I began to wonder, like what\u2019s wrong with me. Have I been doing something wrong all this time.\nI was trying to think about, well, how can I make myself better. Like I said, I went to the EI courses to, you know, first of all, to extend my EI, but, you know, maybe think maybe they would help me with skills or anything like that.\nSo, I was just trying my best to do it, but it extremely hurt me. I mean, I thought I was good. I was training staff as my performance reviews were saying. I was helping out as much as I could. And it affected me that I can\u2019t sleep at night sometimes and this whole process has been drawn out for three years.\nIt\u2019s totally affected, taken over most of my life. I can\u2019t go anywhere. I can\u2019t travel anywhere because I have lawyer\u2019s fees, everything else. It\u2019s completely affected me.\nAnd it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re a government organization and I\u2019m shocked that even that they didn\u2019t want to \u2013 when I put in my complaint, they didn\u2019t want to investigate it. They just sloughed it off as being just not important.\nAnd for a government organization, I\u2019m shocked and I\u2019m pissed. Service Canada, when I got to them, they welcomed me. They treated me equally. As you can see, I\u2019ve moved up from my original CR3 rankage (sic), I\u2019m not PMO2. So obviously, it wasn\u2019t something I was doing wrong.\nQ. Mr. Turner, your complaint is dated February 2005 and, as you know, the agency would have been made aware of it sometime after that. You just mentioned a moment ago that they did not want to investigate it. So did anybody from the agency contact you to discuss your allegations and try to determine directly what your concerns were?\nA. No. The first time I got any sort of contact with the agency was when we had our first mediation session through the Human Rights Commission. \u2026\nIV. Respondent Counsel in a Discussion with Member Sinclair on Remedy\n[6] The following is an extract from the transcript of the proceedings in the hearing conducted by Chairperson Sinclair. It is a portion of interlocutory conversation between Chairperson Sinclair and Respondent counsel:\nMr. Stark: I don\u2019t think a retroactive appointment is actually appropriate in the circumstances of this case and this is why. Mr. Turner is now appointed at the position of PM02 with Service Canada, he has an existing position at (inaudible). I think he had been appointed as Customs Inspector in Victoria, in the Victoria prequalified pool.\nSo he is at the same level now that he was back then and so there is no benefit to him of being reappointed to this position.\nNow this issue I, my learned friend made this, there is no position such as Customs Inspector anymore, it\u2019s Border Services Officer which has been reclassified to a PM03 position , so it\u2019s a different position\/. It doesn\u2019t (inaudible) so there is a whole bunch of other attributes to it as well. After this competition the port of entry functions were transferred from CIC to the Canada Border Services Agency and all employees are challenged, and demonstrate their competency to fill a position as a Border Services Officer, not all of them have.\nSo you are quite correct in your initial statement Mr. Sinclair, that if there is \u2013 it is impossible to put the Complainant back in the position he would have been in. The landscape has changed, he would have to demonstrate competency and that he is qualified to be a Border Services Officer as opposed to a Customs Inspector. He just can\u2019t be put back in the position he was in.\nThe only way to do that is to do it is through compensation if the Tribunal is of a mind to do that. But as I said that\u2019s relatively limited (inaudible), he is at the stage \u2013 and he has reached the position PM02 at the same classification level. So I don\u2019t think it should be done for that reason.\nNow another issue that we talked, and I\u2019m really trying to abbreviate this, Mr. Sinclair, we talked about (inaudible) was mentioned about (inaudible) possibility, that being the test for reappointment. Now Mr. Turner, it should be noted that most candidates appointed from the Vancouver, the Victoria prequalified pool, I can\u2019t stop mixing them up, they were qualified, all of those were \u2013 the only appointments from that pool was term positions.\nSo the (inaudible) that Mr. Turner could have expected from being (inaudible) out of the Vancouver, out of the Victoria prequalified pool was to be a term position. It wouldn\u2019t have given him indeterminate employment. That\u2019s a very important point to note, so out of the Victoria pool he wouldn\u2019t have got indeterminate employment. That\u2019s another reason why Mr. Turner should not be retroactively appointed to a position.\nThe Chairperson: So you are saying the 7003 if successful in that pool he could only go into a term position.\nMr. Stark: Yes \u2026 (referring to Exhibit R-2, Tab 52) \u2026 this is a report on the competition and you\u2019ll note that every single candidate who was appointed from this pool was appointed for a term position.\nThe Chairperson: And is that what the poster said?\nMr. Stark: Well the poster I think was a bit (inaudible) than that, actually the poster was, the poster included permanent, term and (inaudible) but the fact this would appear that there wasn\u2019t any permanent positions granted from there, so there were only term positions. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: You say he can be adequately compensated \u2026 through damages, what does that mean? \u2026\nMr. Stark: Meaning that he can be topped up from the time that he was, from the time of the Victoria prequalified pool up to the time he got his position with Service Canada, he can be compensated for the difference in the two salaries (inaudible) until he reached the difference in the two salaries (inaudible) until he reached the equivalency of PM02. So he would be compensated in that way. But he can\u2019t be compensated for a position that he wasn\u2019t qualified for which is a border Services Officer position. It\u2019s a different position, it\u2019s been reclassified and he would have to challenge a competition in that, just like everyone else did.\nThe Chairperson: So you are saying the time frame for damages would be from the time he was not qualified for Victoria or Vancouver to the time he obtained the PM02 Service Canada position. \u2026\nMr. Stark: Correct.\n[7] In my opinion two matters are misstated in the foregoing discussion, matters which are relevant to the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to be compensated for lost wages.\n[8] First, the assertion that reclassification of Customs Inspector to Border Services Officer reflected a substantial change in the duties performed at Canada\u2019s ports of entry. In my review of the evidence presented to Member Sinclair I was unable to find specific evidence which established that, at the time of the competitions in question, the renaming of Customs Inspectors as Border Services Officers involved any significant change in the duties being carried out at Canada\u2019s ports of entry, other than additional duties related to immigration.\n[9] Second, there was substantial evidence in annual appraisals which established Mr. Turner\u2019s competency as a Customs Inspector. Therefore it is reasonable to draw the inference that, if Border Services Officers were in fact burdened with additional duties, Mr. Turner\u2019s five years of experience as a Customs Inspector would have enabled him to master and carry out any extra duties entrusted to him as a Border Services Officer.\n[10] In the Remedy hearing on April 21 and 22, 2015 Counsel for the Respondent maintained that the circumstances of this case do not warrant compensation for the Complainant\u2019s wage loss for the entire period 2004 to 2014: that compensation should be capped at four years. Capping the Complainant\u2019s wage loss at four years would constitute an arbitrary decision, quite lacking in the exercise of judicial discretion. Moreover, limiting wage-loss-compensation to four years would require me to disregard the emotional trauma of victimization.\n[11] I conclude that the facts and circumstances of this case rule out capping the Complainant\u2019s wage-loss at four years.\nV. Exhibit C-4: Calculation of Complainant\u2019s Wage Loss\n[12] Exhibit C-4 is a four-page factual record, a cooperative endeavour of counsel for the Complainant and counsel for the Respondent. It reveals income Mr. Turner earned in the period 2004 to 2014. It demonstrates that Mr. Turner was able to secure employment with Service Canada, where, in due course, he became an indeterminate federal civil servant.\n[13] Under the caption \u201cDifference\u201d, Exhibit C-4 contains a calculation of the shortfall between Mr. Turner\u2019s actual wages at Service Canada and higher wages paid by CBSA to Border Services Officers. Exhibit C-4 also provides an estimate of additional salary earned from overtime work.\n2004 $40,711.19\n2005 $17,031.25\n2006 $22,293.89\n2007 $22,646.93\n2008 $25,089.37\n2009 $16,665.96\n2010 $16,169.74\n2011 $11,019.97\n2012 $15,238.05\n2013 $10,452.58\n2014 $13,059.57\nTotal: $210,378.50 +*$5,191.53 interest = $215,570.03\n*Exhibit C-4 includes an interest calculation for each year from 2004 to 2014, totalling $5,191.53.2014, totalling $5,191.53.\n[14] Exhibit C-4 included the following notations:\nSalary: 2004 to 2014 (CBSA\u2019s Rated); CBSAShift\/OT Premiums Average for Victoria; Service Canada \u2013 Actual T4 Slip Amounts.\nHighlighted Notes: 2004 includes Salary of $12,635.00 and NOT EI of$10, 325.00; 2009 Signing Bonus of approx. $5,000.00 Not included (Income Tax show $59,534.00); 2011 does not include Severance Payout from Service Canada. CBSA document shows $17,134.85 severance; 2015-2019 is 2014 difference in pay ($13,059.57) x 5 years in lieu of reinstatement.\nAll CBSA amounts taken from Treasury Board Salary Information provided by Mr. Stark\nCBSA amounts: 2003 PM02 step 1; 2004-2006 PM03 step 2-3; 2007-2014 FB03 step 2-4\nService Canada amounts: 2004 CR3 step1; 2005-2008 CR04 Step 1-4 *2008 is 6 months at CR04; 2008-2014 PM02 step 1-4 *2008 is 6 months at PM02\nLevan amounts are taken from 2004 \u2013 2014 income tax returns\/tax slips\nInterest Rates from Bank of Canada Average Annual Interest Rate\nVI. Compensation In Lieu Of Reinstatement\n[15] In paragraph 267 of my March 7, 2014 decision I stated: \u201cDuring the hearing on remedy I will consider whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to order the Respondent to offer employment to the Complainant.\u201d\n[16] At the remedy hearing on April 21 & 22, 2015 the Complainant withdrew his claim for reinstatement as a Border Services Officer. Instead the Complainant seeks an award of compensation of $65,297.85 with respect to anticipated loss of income in the five-year period 2015-2019. This lump sum payment was calculated using the \u201cdifference\u201d in wages for 2014, $13,059.57, and projecting it as a best-guess wage-loss \u2013 (5x $13,059.57 = $65,297.85) \u2013 through each of the ensuing five years.\nVII. Complainant Argument on Compensation for Loss of Income\n[17] Counsel for Mr. Turner argued that the Tribunal should award full compensation for loss of income in the eleven year period 2004 to 2014 as recorded and calculated in Exhibit C-4 in the section captioned \u201cDifference\u201d, together with the lump sum payment in lieu of reinstatement.\n[18] I conclude that Exhibit C-4 provides an accurate calculation that the Complainant\u2019s wage-loss amounts to $210,378.50 which, with interest of $5,191.53 added, amounts to $215,570.03. Additional to that sum is compensation in lieu of reinstatement - $65,297.85 making the total amount of compensation sought by the Complainant to be $280,867.88.\nVIII. Mitigation\n[19] Within a year after he was rejected by CBSA, the Complainant gained employment at Service Canada; doing so while in emotional turmoil over the fact that he likely had been the victim of racial discrimination. It was an exceptional achievement. By getting on with his life and making ends meet the Complainant fulfilled the duty to mitigate his loss of income resulting from CBSA\u2019s discriminatory practices.\nIX. Damages\n[20] It is highly relevant that the two acts of discrimination shattered the Complainant\u2019s dream of a career with CBSA. That discriminatory behaviour was engrained in Vancouver Competition 1002 and Victoria Competition 7003 was detestable; and it was disdainful of the spirit and purpose of the CHRA. It is a matter to be factored into the assessment of damages.\nX. Remedy: Orders for Compensation and Damages\n[21] After consideration of all the findings and conclusions I reached in my March 7, 2014 decision that the Complainant had been subjected to discriminatory practices in two employment competitions; and after consideration of submissions by the parties in the April 21 and 22, 2015 hearing on Remedy, I make the following orders: compensation for lost wages; compensation for pain and suffering; compensation related to the fact that the discriminatory practices were engaged in wilfully.\n1.

Williams\nTable of Contents\nI.Introduction 1\nII.Facts 1\nIII.The Legal Considerations 2\nIV.Issues 4\nV.Analysis 4\nI. Introduction\n[1] Claudette Wilson, a Black woman, alleges that Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) subjected her to employment discrimination on the grounds of race and sex when it transferred her from the location where she had worked for many years to another location in the same city.\nII. Facts\n[2] Ms. Wilson had for 21 years been employed at the same Immigration Holding Detention Centre (\u201cIHDC\u201d) in Toronto. For most of this time she worked as a security officer, but for two years leading to 2010 she was employed as a security supervisor.\n[3] It is important to note that Ms. Wilson was not directly employed by CBSA; rather, CBSA contracted out the security services. At the time in question, G4S Security Services (Canada) Ltd. (\u201cG4S\u201d) held the contract for providing security personnel at the IHDC and it was Ms. Wilson\u2019s employer. CBSA provided supervisory, management and operations personnel. Ms. Wilson believed that she was an exemplary employee, valued by both the respondent, CBSA, and her employer, G4S.\n[4] June 2010 saw a new operations manager employed by CBSA, namely a Mr. Sajjad Bhatti. In July 2010, a workplace incident occurred in which she was involved, which resulted in the transfer of Ms. Wilson from her current location to another IHDC in Toronto. Mr. Bhatti was the author of the letter advising her that she was being transferred to the other site in Toronto.\n[5] Ms. Wilson objected to the transfer, which led to the matter of her transfer being adjudicated by way of grievance arbitration before the Canadian Industrial Relations Board. Ultimately minutes of settlement were signed.\n[6] Ms. Wilson claimed that she was removed because Mr. Bhatti did not want a Black woman at the site where he was working. In support of her claim, she testified that Mr. Bhatti had refused to interact with her on at least two occasions. On one occasion he did not respond to her greeting of \u201cGood Morning Sir\u201d. On a second occurrence, while passing on a stairwell, Mr. Bhatti did not respond to her greeting, and proceeded past her. Her evidence was that he did not have \u201ceye contact\u201d with her and proceeded past her. She stated he said something \u201cunder his breath\u201d, but could not advise as to what if anything was stated. Ms. Wilson further testified that Mr. Bhatti had a discriminatory attitude. She was convinced that his treatment of her was motivated by her race and gender stating, \u201cWhat else could it be, I am a woman and Black\u201d.\n[7] Ms. Wilson could not recall when the two aforementioned incidents occurred. She had no other witnesses. She did provide the Tribunal with copies of two letters \u2013 one, hand printed and signed \u201cJustice Seekers\u201d, and the second, typed and also signed \u201cJustice Seekers\u201d with 4 illegible signatures \u2013 both being offered as evidence in support of her complaint. I find that the letters have little probative value, for reasons that the signatures are indecipherable and the authors were not subject to cross examination. Moreover, the content of the letters provides no information dealing with Ms. Wilson\u2019s discrimination claim and is therefore unhelpful. She did not present any evidence as to damages, if any, that she suffered as a result of the alleged discrimination.\n[8] Mr. Bhatti was the only witness for the Respondent. Mr. Bhatti stated that he was born in Canada and of Pakistani heritage. He stated that as a child he was often the target of derogatory comments and abusive names, because of his skin colour. He stated that he had no recollection of the instances of which Ms. Wilson complains.\n[9] Mr. Bhatti stated that it is not his nature to be rude and if greeted as suggested by the Complainant, he believed that he would have responded in a respectful manner. Notwithstanding his evidence as to his general practice, he could not recall the two aforementioned incidents and was therefore unable to deny they occurred. Thus, Ms. Wilson\u2019s evidence as to the two incidents remains essentially uncontradicted. Mr. Bhatti did admit to having provided Ms. Wilson with a letter transferring her to another site.\nIII. The Legal Considerations\n[10] Ms. Wilson\u2019s complaint is brought under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Subsection 7(b) makes it a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee in the course of their employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 3 of the Act includes sex, race and colour as prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n[11] I believe it is well settled that the burden is on Ms. Wilson to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent-employer\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 558; Canada v. Johnstone, 2014 FCA 110 at para.82).\n[12] Upon Ms. Wilson establishing on a prima facie basis that she was the subject of discrimination, the burden shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation for the conduct in issue (Baptiste v. Canada (Correctional Service), 2001 CanLII 5801 (CHRT), para. 6.).\n[13] There is no direct evidence in this case; rather, Ms. Wilson relies on circumstantial evidence. But this will be sufficient if the evidence offered in support of an inference of discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (Baptiste, supra, para. 60; Khiamal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2009 FC 495, para.60).\n[14] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be a basis for the employer\u2019s actions or decisions (Holden v. Canadian National Railway (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.); Baptiste, supra, para11; Khiamal, supra, para 61).\n[15] Finally, the standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard (Baptiste, supra para 10; Khiamal, supra, para. 60). He or she who alleges, bears the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities (Canada (Social Development) v. Canada Human Rights Commission), 2011 FCA 202, para. 16).\nIV. Issues\n[16] The Respondent raised two basic issues to be considered, namely:\n(1) Was CBSA, Ms. Wilson\u2019s employer, i.e. was there an employer-employee relationship within the meaning of section 7 (b) of the CHRA?; and\n(2) Has the Complainant presented evidence of adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground within the meaning of section 7 (b) of the CHRA?\n[17] Because I find against the Complainant on the second issue, I do not believe it is necessary to address the first issue (whether the requisite employment relationship existed).\nV. Analysis\n[18] Ms. Wilson believes that her re-assignment to the \u201cnew\u201d location occurred as a result of Mr. Bhatti\u2019s adverse treatment of her, which was connected to her being a Black woman. Did the evidence she presented establish a prima facie case of adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground?\n[19] Ms. Wilson\u2019s evidence did not illustrate any prima facie connection between the adverse treatment she experienced and the prohibited grounds of discrimination invoked in this case. In other words, even assuming that Ms. Wilson\u2019s evidence is believed, I cannot see from her testimony how Mr. Bhatti\u2019s refusal to interact with her, viewed together with the decision to transfer her to another IDHC, were in any way related to her race, her gender, both grounds, or the effect of a combination thereof (see section 3.1 of the Act). Mr. Bhatti\u2019s conduct, as described in her testimony, could be the result of any number of circumstances. Ms. Wilson\u2019s belief that because she is a Black woman, Mr. Bhatti wanted her transferred; and Mr. Bhatti\u2019s non communication to her on the two undated occasions, is not sufficient to make out a prima facie case giving rise to the need for a rebuttal. Mere belief, without supporting evidence is not sufficient to support a claim of discrimination (Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc. 2006 FC 785, paras, 30 -31.\n[20] The evidentiary requirement for establishing prima facie discrimination is generally comprised of three elements. Complainants are required to show:\n(1) that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA.\n(2) that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to employment; and\n(3) that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. (See Moore v. British Columbia (Education) 2012 SCC 61, para.33; Johnstone supra, para. 76).\n[21] In the current matter, Ms. Wilson has presented evidence in support of the first and second elements (her race and gender, as well as her adverse work experience). But she has presented no evidence in support of the third element, apart from her own personal belief. In the words of section 7(b) she has presented no evidence, apart from her belief indicating that the adverse differentiation she experienced was on a prohibited ground. This is not complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\n[22] That said, even if I were to find that a prima facie had been made out, I am not convinced on a balance of probabilities that Ms. Wilson\u2019s gender, race or the effect of a combination thereof played a role in CBSA\u2019s decision to transfer her. Having regard to Mr. Bhatti\u2019s evidence, a reasonable non-discriminatory explanation has been presented for the transfer, namely the July 2010 workplace incident. The burden of proof requires that Ms. Wilson convince the Tribunal, on a balance of probabilities that the explanatory evidence presented by Mr. Bhatti on behalf of CBSA is false or a pretext (Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, para.74, 83). This she has been unable to do.\n[23] I make the above finding having due regard to the principle that in the absence of direct evidence, discrimination may be inferred from other evidence presented. However, on the facts of this case, a non-discriminatory inference is more probable; the transfer resulted entirely from the workplace incident. Similarly, I cannot draw a probable inference from the evidence that Ms. Wilson\u2019s race and or gender played a role in Mr. Bhatti\u2019s uncommunicative behaviour toward her.\n[24] For all of the above reasons, and pursuant to section 53 (1) of the Act, I find that the complaint has not been substantiated and therefore, I dismiss the complaint.\nSigned by\nRonald Sydney Williams\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 13, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1961\/4113\nStyle of Cause:\nClaudette Wilson v.

Johnston\nTable of Contents\nI.Motion 1\nII.Background 1\nIII.Analysis 4\nIV.Ruling 5\nI. Motion\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion filed by the respondent, Jenn Trucking Ltd. (the Respondent) dated November 5, 2014, seeking an order dismissing the complaint on the grounds that the Complainant has failed to participate in the process of this Tribunal for approximately 2 \u00bd years and further that such failure to participate has resulted in an undue delay prejudicial to the Respondent and is an abuse of the process of this Tribunal.\nII. Background\n[2] The Complainant brings this matter alleging discrimination based on disability as a result of events allegedly occurring between February and May of 2009. The Respondent employed the Complainant until May 2009 as a swamper\/driver on a picker truck. The Complainant alleges that he was injured in the course of his employment while falling from a truck-bed to the ground and that a disability arising from those injuries was not accommodated by the Respondent.\n[3] The complaint was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) on May 25, 2010. The matter was referred to this Tribunal for an inquiry on October 28, 2011 and on November 29, 2011 the CHRC advised the Complainant and the Tribunal that it would not be participating in the hearing of this matter.\n[4] On December 20, 2011 the Tribunal sent its initial letter to the Complainant and Respondent indicating the Tribunal would be conducting an inquiry into this matter. On January 31, 2012, the Tribunal again wrote to the parties setting out the disclosure process and requesting that the Complainant provide its Statement of Particulars including his lists of remedies and disclosure by February 24, 2012. In this same correspondence, the Tribunal directed the CHRC to make disclosure by February 10, 2012 and the Respondent by March 16, 2012.\n[5] The CHRC made its disclosure on February 9, 2012 and the Respondent did so on March 16, 2012. The Complainant did not comply with the December 20, 2011 direction regarding disclosure. A Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) was set for and held on May 31, 2012 during which the Complainant\u2019s deadline for providing his particulars and disclosure was extended to June 21, 2012 and the Respondent was given the opportunity to provide an amended Statement of Particulars by July 12, 2012.\n[6] The Complainant provided his particulars and disclosure on June 12, 2012 and the Respondent filed its Amended Statement of Particulars on July 12, 2012. Following this, the Tribunal contacted the Complainant on March 27, 2013 and May 3, 2013 requesting his availability for a CMCC; the purpose of the CMCC process being to ensure the parties are moving the matter towards readiness for a hearing. Given the Complainant\u2019s failure to respond with regard to his availability, a CMCC was set for January 21, 2014. The Tribunal advised the Complainant by e-mail and couriered letter that he was required to participate in that call. The Complainant failed to participate in that CMCC.\n[7] On or around July 10, 2014, the Tribunal spoke to the Complainant and confirmed that the matter had moved into the hearing stage and that he would have to make himself available for a CMCC and for the hearing itself. The Complainant during that discussion indicated he would advise the Tribunal with regard to his intentions for the proceedings by August 5, 2014.\n[8] The Complainant failed to contact the Tribunal by August 5, 2014 and a second CMCC was set for August 29, 2014 with notice to the Complainant of his requirement to participate. On August 28, 2014, the Complainant contacted the Tribunal by email and indicated:\nI am hardly ever at home during the day as I am working to support me and my 3 boys\u2026I suppose it would work best and so I\u2019m not holding you up any further with timelines not working out for me, for you to hold your conference call as scheduled, even though I cannot attend\u2026I cannot afford to pursue this matter as it is very time consuming and so I will have to go with the tribunals decision in this matter.\n[9] As a result of the Complainant\u2019s email, the August 29, 2014 CMCC was postponed. The Commission wrote to the Complainant on September 2, 2014 and asked that he confirm \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d whether his August 28, 2014 email meant he wished to withdraw his complaint. The Tribunal then contacted the Complainant by letter on September 16, 2014 asking that he advise on or before September 25, 2014, whether he intended to participate both in the CMCC process and the hearing of this matter. The Complainant again failed to respond and a CMCC was set for October 23, 2014 with notice to the Complainant given by email and courier letter.\n[10] The Complainant failed to participate in the CMCC on October 23, 2014 despite the fact that efforts were made by the Tribunal to contact him by telephone three times during that CMCC. A schedule was then set for the Respondent to proceed with a motion to dismiss the Complaint and to allow for the Complainant to provide submissions. The Respondent\u2019s motion was to be filed on November 5, 2014, the Complainant and the Commission had until December 5, 2014 to provide any response. Notice of the directions regarding this motion was provided to the Complainant by e-mail and couriered letter.\n[11] Numerous efforts were made by the Tribunal to contact the Complainant with regard to this motion. The Complainant was contacted by voicemail, by registered mail and by emails (some of which were confirmed as both delivered and read). When no response was received, the deadline for the Complainant to file a response was extended to January 5, 2015 and the Complainant was advised of this extension by email, which was opened and read.\n[12] Following a review of the Respondent\u2019s submissions, all the parties were given an opportunity to make further submissions on the applicability of the doctrine of abuse of process to this motion. The Respondent provided its additional submissions on May 4, 2015.\n[13] The Commission has taken no position in this motion and the Complainant has failed to make any response or provide any position in regard to this motion.\nIII. Analysis\n[14] The Respondent argues that as a result of the Complainant\u2019s failure to take any meaningful steps in this matter and in particular the Complainant\u2019s failure to participate in this matter in any way since July of 2012, the Respondent has been prejudiced. In addition, the Respondent contends that the Complainant\u2019s failure to participate in the process of this Tribunal constitutes an abuse of that process. The Complainant has no stated position.\n[15] This Tribunal, as master of its own procedure, is entitled to take measures preventing abuse of its process, including dismissing a matter. In Labelle v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 CHRT 4 (CanLii) the Tribunal confirmed that it may dismiss a complaint where the matter has remained static for an unreasonable length of time \u201cdue to a wholesale disregard\u201d for the time limits set by the Tribunal. In such circumstances, that delay can constitute an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process. (See also, Mattice v. Westower Communications Ltd., 2014 CHRT 32)\n[16] The Complainant in this matter has failed to engage in any meaningful way in the process before this Tribunal since June of 2012. Despite extensive efforts on the part of the Tribunal, the Complainant has failed to make himself available for a CMCC in more than 2 \u00bd years. Additionally, the Complainant has expressed some equivocation regarding proceeding but has refused to provide the Tribunal or the Respondent with a clear and unequivocal intention of whether he intends to proceed or not. While the Complainant made note in his August 28, 2014 email of his concerns regarding proceeding in the face of employment and parental obligations, he requested no accommodation from the Tribunal and has communicated nothing further to the Tribunal with regard to those issues. Finally, the Complainant has provided no response to this motion to dismiss.\n[17] At this point, more than 3 \u00bd years since this matter was referred to the Tribunal for an inquiry, very little has been done to move this matter toward a hearing and there is little to indicate it will move toward a hearing at any point in the near future. This delay has occurred despite express directions from the Tribunal regarding the Complainant\u2019s required participation.\n[18] It is not necessary to consider the Respondent\u2019s arguments for a dismissal of this complaint based on prejudice incurred, as the motion has been decided on the basis of abuse of process.\nIV. Ruling\n[19] The Tribunal finds that the Complainant\u2019s failure to actively pursue the complaint and his failure to adhere to directions of this Tribunal constitute an abuse of process. As a result, the within complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nRicki T. Johnston\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 28, 2015\n",

Background\n[1] On June 3, 2011, the Complainant filed a complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against the then Department of Fisheries and Oceans (now Fisheries and Oceans Canada) (\u201cDFO\u201d). The Complainant alleges that DFO discriminated against him by failing and\/or refusing to accommodate his disability, treating him in an adverse differential manner by engaging in a discriminatory policy or practice, thereby denying him an employment opportunity, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cHuman Rights Act\u201d). The Complaint was amended so that the Respondent became \u201cthe Attorney General of Canada, representing DFO and the Public Service Commission of Canada\u201d (\u201cPSC\u201d) (collectively, \u201cRespondent\u201d).\nII. The Complainant\u2019s Motion\n[2] The Complainant has brought a Motion seeking further documentary disclosure from the Respondent. This Ruling groups the requested documents into like categories and analyzes and decides on each category.\nIII. Portions of the Complaint relevant to this Motion\n[3] The allegations in the Complaint which are relevant to this Motion, are set out below:\nThe Complainant has a medical condition which he states is a disability under the Act.\nIn June 2008, he submitted an application pursuant to Selection Process 08-DFO-IA-NCR-929466 (\u201cthe ENG-05 Job Competition) for a not-yet-established ENG-05 position with DFO (\u201cENG-05 position), without self-identifying as disabled and without requesting accommodation.\nIn April 2009, after completing the assessment process, which included an interview, DFO placed him in the pool of candidates qualified for the position. The pool had an effective date of April 20, 2009 to October 20, 2010.\nThe Complainant was told that his interview was just \u201cOK\u201d, and that he would not be considered for the position once it was established.\nThe Complainant felt his disability had hindered him in the interview and decided to self-identify as a person with a disability requiring accommodation. He did so in August 2009. In September 2009, he submitted an \u201cAccommodation Request\u201d form to DFO.\nDFO offered to re-do the assessment phase of the ENG-05 Job Competition after it received information on specific appropriate accommodation modes from PSC. DFO asked the Complainant to attend at the PSC Psychology Centre (\u201cPPC\u201d) to be assessed for appropriate modes of accommodation.\nThe Complainant disagreed and did not attend at PPC. He proposed to DFO that the appropriate accommodation was to appoint him to the ENG-05 position because:\nhe had successfully already been placed in the pool of qualified candidates based on objective criteria and was not assured of qualifying again;\nthe \u201cright fit\u201d standard and practice the PSC developed and DFO used and uses in its job competition process to assess candidates is inherently discriminatory against the Complainant and others with his disability;\nthe employer\u2019s duty to accommodate applies throughout the selection process, up to and including appointment; and\nhis proposed mode of accommodation would not cause DFO undue hardship and would close a representational gap in the Respondent\u2019s employment equity (\u201cEE\u201d) plan.\nDFO declined the Complainant\u2019s proposal.\nI will now address the various categories of requested documents, having regard to the above allegations.\nIV. The Disclosure Process\nA. Statutory Law and Tribunal Rules of Procedure\n[4] Subsection 50(1) of the Act states:\nAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\n[5] Rule 6 of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-05) (\u201cRules\u201d), requires parties to a complaint to provide a Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d), which includes documentary disclosure, names of witnesses,a detailed summary of each witness\u2019 proposed testimony (\u201cwill-say\u201d) and procedures regarding expert reports.\n[6] For the purposes of this Motion, Rule 6(1)(d) is particularly relevant. It states:\nWithin the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n[7] Rule 6(5) essentially provides that the disclosure obligation is ongoing.\nB. Standard for disclosure of documents\n[8] The Respondent\u2019s position is as set out below:\nThe document must be \u201carguably relevant\u201d to an issue in the Complaint.\nTo be arguably relevant, there must be a nexus or rational connection between the document sought to be disclosed and a fact or form of relief or issue sought or identified by other parties (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (Can LII) (\u201cSeeley\u201d), at para. 6.\nRequests for disclosure \u201c\u2026must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (Johanne Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (Can LII) (\u201cGuay\u201d), at para. 43.\nThe description of the documents should not be too broad or general and should be identified with reasonable particularity (ibid).\n[9] The Complainant\u2019s position is as set out below:\nIn addition to the arguable relevance standard, there should be a higher level of disclosure when there is a higher requirement for procedural fairness. The Complainant relies on both the Supreme Court of Canada case of Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R.817 (SCC) (\u201cBaker\u201d) and on the article titled \u201cDisclosure Issues in Administrative Proceedings\u201d, by law firmPinto Wray James, LLP (\u201cPinto article\u201d).\n\u201cThe five non-exhaustive Baker factors\u201d, as quoted on pages 4 and 5 of the Pinto article are as set out below:\n\u201cthe closer the administrative proceeding is to judicial decision-making, the more likely\u2026\u201d the required \u201cprocedural protections\u201d are closer to those required at a civil trial;\nthe nature of the statutory scheme and the enabling statute\u2019s terms \u2013 if there is no appeal procedure or the decision determines the issue;\nthe \u201cgreater the impact the decision has, the more stringent are the procedural protections;\nthe \u201cdoctrine of legitimate expectations is part of the doctrine of procedural fairness; i.e. the tribunal should follow the procedure that an individual legitimately expects; and\nthe procedures the agency itself chooses, \u201c\u2026particularly where the statute\u201d authorizes the decision-maker the right to \u201c\u2026choose its own procedures\u201d.\n[10] The Complainant submits that Baker factors 5, 4, 3 and 1 apply to the Complaint, as it is a \u201cdiscriminatory course of conduct type of case\u201d (as discussed in the Pinto article).\n[11] The Pinto article at page 5 posits that:\n[I]n practice, an analysis of the disclosure obligation in an administrative proceeding should begin with the fifth Baker factor. . . . However, Baker reminds us that the tribunal\u2019s own rules and procedures are not the final word [in] determining whether the disclosure provided is sufficient to ensure a fair process. It is always open to a party to argue that a heightened level of disclosure is required in light of the remaining Baker factors.\nC. Analysis\n[12] The administrative decision appealed in Baker was made pursuant to the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 and the Immigration Regulations, 1978, SOR\/78-172 (collectively, \u201cImmigration Act\u201d). Mavis Baker was ordered deported from Canada. Her application for exemption from deportation was denied in a letter, without reasons.\n[13] Mrs. Baker challenged the decision on the basis that she was not accorded procedural fairness. The lack of procedural fairness included that there were no reasons in the letter denying her application.\n[14] Mrs. Baker\u2019s lawyer later obtained the investigating immigration officer\u2019s notes, which the Court found the senior officer had used to make his decision.\n[15] Mrs. Baker\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d was that because of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, Mrs. Baker could legitimately expect that her Canadian-born children\u2019s interests would be a primary consideration in the immigration decision (Baker, supra, at para 8). The Baker Court cautioned that the doctrine of legitimate expectations cannot lead to substantive rights outside the procedural domain (Baker, supra, at para. 26).\n[16] In what I interpret as an application of the fifth Baker factor, the Court placed significance on the Minister of Immigration\u2019s Guidelines setting out the criteria which an immigration officer should take into account when making a decision on the type of grounds in the Baker situation.\n[17] I read the main theme of the Pinto article as being: the higher the level of procedural fairness required in administrative proceedings, the higher the level of disclosure required. I read the secondary theme as being: just because a party or tribunal has complied with that tribunal\u2019s own disclosure rules does not mean that it has provided all the disclosure required in the context of the particular proceeding.\n[18] It is the Pinto article, and not Baker, which links the concept of procedural fairness to the pre-hearing disclosure of documents.\n[19] The disclosure at issue in Baker was the disclosure of the decision-maker\u2019s reasons for his decision, not pre-hearing disclosure within the meaning of Rule 6. The Tribunal gives reasons for the vast majority of its decisions, unless the decision is on consent, which is usually also noted.\n[20] With respect to the first four Baker factors, the Tribunal is a quasi-judicial administrative body created by section 48.1(1) of the Human Rights Act. It is not a court of civil jurisdiction. The Federal Courts Act, RSC 1985, c. F-7, provides for appeals from Tribunal decisions. Subsection 50(1) of the Act recognizes the importance of the decision to the parties in a human rights complaint, by providing for the \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present their evidence and make their representations during the inquiry. This is the audi alterem partem maxim of natural justice \u2013 \u201chear the other side\u201d - enshrined in the Act. The legitimate expectation for parties regarding pre-hearing disclosure in a human rights complaint at the Tribunal is that subsection 50(1) should be followed and interpreted to ensure disclosure in accordance with the Rules and the case law interpreting them.\n[21] In addition to subsection 50(1) of the Act, Rule 3 provides the opportunity for a party to bring motions, including for further documentary disclosure. Rule 6 provides for pre-hearing documentary disclosure. The fact that Rule 6(5) makes the disclosure obligation ongoing also ensures procedural fairness.\n[22] The Act also authorizes the Tribunal to formulate its own procedures \u2013 for example, in subsection 48.9(2), the Chairperson is authorized to make rules of procedure governing practice and procedure before the Tribunal. Similarly, subsection 50(3)(e) authorizes the member or panel at a hearing to \u201cdecide any procedural or evidentiary question arising during the hearing.\u201d\n[23] The doctrine of arguable relevance as the standard for the disclosure of documents has been well-established by the case law. \u201cArguable relevance\u201d means that a document, which may or may not be relevant or admissible in evidence, but which has a connection or nexus to an issue, fact or remedy in the Complaint, should be disclosed in the pre-hearing disclosure process. This case law has interpreted Rule 6, subsection 50(1) of the Act and the requirements of natural justice to arrive at the standard of arguable relevance.\n[24] I conclude that the Human Rights Act, the Rules, the case law interpreting them and the standard of \u201carguable relevance\u201d provide for the liberal but not unlimited level of pre-hearing disclosure to which parties in a human rights complaint are deemed entitled, so that they have the \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present their case. It is therefore the fifth Baker factor \u2013 the Tribunal\u2019s procedures and standards - which govern the disclosure of documents.\n[25] The Complainant also relies on the Pinto article\u2019s discussion of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 22 (\u201cSPPA\u201d) as requiring a higher standard of disclosure in certain situations, including disciplinary hearings.\n[26] The SPPA is legislation of the Province of Ontario which applies to any administrative proceeding in Ontario in which a hearing is required. The SPPA has no jurisdiction over or application to federal administrative proceedings. The Human Rights Act is federal legislation which has created the Tribunal as a federal administrative body. The SPPA is therefore not applicable in this Complaint.\nV. Emails, Briefing Notes, Minutes, Memos in Table 1 in the Notice of Motion\n[27] The Complainant seeks disclosure of all emails, briefing notes, minutes and memos held in official DFO records, including in its information management system and corporate computer email records, during specified time periods, to or from 9 named individuals, many of whom are listed as witnesses by both parties, including documents where the individuals are copied or blind-copied.\n[28] The Respondent opposes this request because:\nit has already disclosed documents which were either in the possession of or created by the individuals in Table 1;\nthe Complainant\u2019s request is overly broad, speculative and amounts to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d; and\nthe Complainant does not identify with adequate specificity the documents he seeks in his request that the Respondent search further in its \u201ccorporate records\u201d \u2013 this \u201cextremely broad category of documents\u201d is \u201cwithout any reasonable parameters.\u201d\n[29] The Complainant replies that the only way he could be more specific would be if the documents requested were already in his possession.\nAnalysis\n[30] Rule 6(1)(d) limits disclosure to \u201cdocuments\u2026that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule.\u201d\n[31] The fact that records are \u201ccorporate records\u201d or \u201cpersonally held records\u201d is not significant in terms of the disclosure obligation attaching to them. So long as the records are in the possession or control of the Respondent, they are subject to disclosure, provided they are arguably relevant. The fact that the records are stored in the mailbox of an individual employee or elsewhere among that individual employee\u2019s records, as opposed to a corporate folder or directory, makes no difference.\n[32] The Respondent has apparently already disclosed information that was either in the possession of, or created by, the individuals named in Table 1 and it is unclear what other documents the Complainant seeks.\n[33] It is not sufficient for a party to specify time periods, authors or parties with respect to the documents requested. A party requesting disclosure needs to relate its request to facts, issues or forms of relief set out in one of the Statements of Particulars (\u201cSOPs\u201d). The Complainant has not done so.\n[34] If the Complainant is able to formulate a more specific request that clearly demonstrates why the disclosure he has received thus far is inadequate and how any further disclosure request complies with Rule 6, then, after submissions from the other parties, the Tribunal would assess and decide on the request.\nVI. Harassment\n[35] The Complainant seeks from DFO all documents \u201crelated to any harassment investigation or discussion by senior DFO management in regards to Michael Gardiner and\/or [the Complainant].\u201d He submits that the Complaint and his SOP allege both the harassment and the Complainant\u2019s requests to senior management that the harassment stop.\n[36] The Respondent objects on the ground that harassment, within the meaning of the Act, is not within the scope of this Complaint - it was not in the summary of the Complaint which the Commission sent to the Tribunal. To include allegations of harassment in the Complaint, the Complainant needs to bring a motion to amend the Complaint.\n[37] Further, the Respondent submits that because the alleged harassment stopped, the reason it stopped is irrelevant.\n[38] The Respondent\u2019s position has raised the two following issues: 1. Is harassment within the meaning of the Act within the scope of the Complaint?; 2. Even if it is within the scope of the Complaint (which the Respondent denies), why the alleged harassment stopped is not relevant to the Complaint.\nAnalysis\nIs harassment within the meaning of the Act within the scope of the Complaint?\n[39] Paragraph 73 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP describes actions the Complainant alleges constitute harassment under the Act. Specifically, part of paragraph 73 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP states \u201cContrary to the CHRA [the Act]\u201d, and after that phrase, footnote 20 is inserted. Footnote 20 quotes subsection 14(1)(c) and section 59 of the Act.\n[40] In footnote 22 to the first sentence of para. 74 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP, the Complainant again quotes section 59 of the Act in full, in reference to the alleged lack of response or complicity of senior people at DFO in the intimidation and harassment he alleges.\n[41] Section 59 of the Act states as follows:\nNo person shall threaten, intimidate or discriminate against an individual because that individual has made a complaint or given evidence or assisted in any way in respect of the initiation or prosecution of a complaint or other proceeding under this Part, or because that individual proposes to do so.\n[42] Subsection 60(1) of the Act makes a person who is found to have contravened section 59 \u201cguilty of an offence.\u201d Subsection 60(2) provides that a person \u201c. . . guilty of an offence under subsection (1) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000.00.\u201d Other subsections of section 60 prescribe the time limit for bringing a prosecution, the requirement that the Attorney General of Canada either bring the prosecution, or consent to it, and describe the right of an employer or employee organization to bring a prosecution or be prosecuted.\n[43] Section 60 is the enforcement section of section 59. If a person is alleged to have threatened, intimidated or discriminated against an individual in the circumstances in section 59, that person must be prosecuted in a court of summary jurisdiction \u2013 a criminal court. That court also has the power to enforce the penalty in subsection 60(2).\n[44] For the above reasons, I find that the wording of section 60 means that section 59 deals with the criminal concept of threatening, intimidating or discriminating in the circumstances therein. The Tribunal is not a criminal court of summary jurisdiction and does not have the jurisdiction to enforce section 59. This means that in a human rights complaint at the Tribunal, an allegation of harassment or intimidation or discrimination cannot be brought under section 59.\n[45] Subsection 14(1) of the Act is the applicable subsection pursuant to which a complainant can allege harassment. The Complainant\u2019s SOP, at footnote 20, cites subsection 14(1)(c) of the Act, which reads as follows:\nIt is a discriminatory practice,\n(c) in matters related to employment, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[46] In alleging harassment, the Complainant has referred to two sections of the Act, one of which, section 59, the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to administer and enforce. It is in the parties\u2019 interests that they know whether the allegation of harassment is included in this Complaint.\n[47] The Tribunal must decide the issue of the scope of a complaint before it can decide on disclosure. Therefore, the Tribunal needs to decide whether the Complaint includes harassment as defined in the Act.\n[48] I will seek submissions from the parties on whether the Complaint includes a section 14 allegation of harassment, and if not, their positions on amending the Complaint to include it. The timetable for these submissions will be decided at the next Case Management Conference Call.\nVII. Mr. Gardiner\u2019s November 25, 2009 email to the Complainant\n[49] The Complainant states he sent an email to Mr. Gardiner \u201c. . . describing the problems [Complainant] was experiencing having his Accommodation Request responded to by management.\u201d The Complainant alleges that Mr. Gardiner withdrew a November 25, 2009 email (\u201cNovember 25, 2009 Gardiner email\u201d) almost immediately after he sent it to the Complainant in response. The Motion seeks disclosure of the withdrawn email.\n[50] The Respondent does not know if its computer system can retrieve a withdrawn email.\nAnalysis\n[51] The November 25, 2009 Gardiner email may be part of the narrative of the Complaint and may be related to the issue of accommodation. As such, I find that this email is arguably relevant.\n[52] The Respondent shall use its best efforts to retrieve the November 25, 2009 Gardiner email. If the Respondent can retrieve the email, the Respondent shall disclose it. If the Respondent cannot retrieve it, the Respondent shall so inform the other parties in writing.\nVIII. Accommodation measures in other job competitions: PSC accommodation records\n[53] The Complainant seeks disclosure of all documents on his file pertaining to him regarding accommodation measures in each of the following job competitions:\nCorrectional Services Canada:Staffing Process Number 08-PEN-EA-NCR-NHQ-2853.\nDFO:Staffing Process Number 10-DFO-INA-NCR-939827.\nDepartment of Transport (\u201cTransport\u201d):Staffing Process Number 09-MOT-IA-OTT-69796.\nThe Complainant also seeks disclosure of all documentation held by the PSC\u2019s Personnel Psychology Centre (\u201cPPC\u201d) pertaining to accommodation measures for the Complainant, including \u201call PSC analysis documents to support the accommodation measures that were ever proposed for or offered to the Complainant.\u201d\n[54] The Complainant\u2019s position is that these documents are arguably relevant to counter the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Complainant refused to participate in the accommodation process. The documents will also provide \u201cinsight\u201d into how the PPC determines appropriate accommodation and will allow a more informed argument as to whether the PPC can in fact determine accommodation measures, as related to the test established in British Columbia (Public Service Employees Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (SCC) (\u201cMeorin\u201d). This disclosure will also justify the Complainant\u2019s decision not to request assessment accommodation. Further, the disclosure will address the \u201cright fit\u201d standard or practice and when and how individuals can be most reasonably accommodated with respect to it.\n[55] The Respondent opposes this request because whether the Complainant was accommodated in other job applications is not relevant to the accommodation issue in this Complaint. That issue is whether the Respondent reasonably accommodated the Complainant in the ENG-05 Job Competition.\n[56] I find that these requested documents are arguably relevant to the issues of accommodation and \u201cright fit\u201d, as well as being arguably relevant to PSC\u2019s and PPC\u2019s procedures and involvement with accommodation measures.\n[57] The Respondent shall disclose the above-named documents, to the extent that it has not already done so.\nIX. Complainant\u2019s signed self-identification form\n[58] The Complainant self-identified as a person with a disability in September 2009. He has disclosed an unsigned copy of the form. He seeks disclosure of the signed form to use as evidence. The Complainant consents to the release of the form he signed.\n[59] The Respondent\u2019s position is that it cannot release the signed form because the fact that someone signs the form is confidential, pursuant to subsection 9(3) of the Employment Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c. 44 (\u201cEE Act\u201d). Further, the Respondent does not dispute \u201c. . . that the Complainant self-identified as a person with a disability.\u201d The Respondent also submits that the fact that Complainant did so is not relevant to the issues in the Complaint.\n[60] I find that the fact that the Complainant self-identified as a person with a disability is arguably relevant to the factual allegations in the Complaint. As the Complainant has consented to the release of the form to him, he has waived confidentiality to that extent. For completeness of the record, it would be preferable that the signed form or a true copy thereof is disclosed to the Complainant.\n[61] Therefore, the Respondent shall disclose the signed form or a true copy thereof to the Complainant, if reasonably possible. The Complainant shall cooperate with the Respondent by signing any consent the relevant authority may require to release the form.\nX. DFO\u2019s \u201cStrategic Plan for the Implementation of the Employment Equity Management Action Plan (EE MAP) for 2008 \u2013 2011\u201d\n[62] The Complainant requests disclosure of a copy of the above-named document. The Respondent submits that it is not aware of this document and that it has disclosed to the Complainant a copy of a document titled \u201cEmployment Equity Management Action Plan \u2013 January 2008 to March 31, 2011.\u201d\n[63] The Respondent shall make a search for the document the Complainant requests, and if the Respondent cannot find it, the Respondent shall provide written confirmation to the parties that it does not have the document in its possession or control.\nXI. Applications and resumes for 2 named candidates for ENG-05 position\n[64] The Complainant seeks disclosure from DFO of the applications and resumes of Tracey Clarke and Darren Gould, two of the unsuccessful candidates in the ENG-05 Job Competition, in order to correlate screening results.\n[65] The Respondent\u2019s position is that this information is not relevant - the issue in the Complaint is whether the Respondent failed to accommodate the Complainant by not appointing him to the ENG-05 position. The information requested does not assist the Complainant in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The only information required to do that sets out the \u201cComplainant\u2019s qualifications and that of the successful candidate\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, paras. 37-38). The test for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination in this Complaint \u201c. . . is whether the Complainant was qualified and not hired, and whether someone no better qualified was subsequently appointed to the position.\u201d (Ibid)\nAnalysis\n[66] The Respondent does not specifically cite Shakes v. Rex Pax Limited (1981), 3 C.H.RR.D\/1001 (Ont.Bd.Inq.) (\u201cShakes\u201d) as authority for its position. But Shakes articulates the test for the establishment of a prima facie case as posited by the Respondent. The Commission also intended to rely on the Shakes line of jurisprudence: \u201c. . . particularly in connection to the comparative test.\u201d (Commission\u2019s SOP, at para. 59)\n[67] The Federal Court of Appeal has cautioned against using the Shakes test \u201cautomatically\u201d, \u201c. . . in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case: rather, the circumstances in each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate\u201d (Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18, quoting Premakumar v. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 3 (\u201cPremakumar\u201d), at para. 77). The phrase \u201ceither of the tests\u201d refers to both the Shakes test, and the test in Israeli v. Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616. Israeli stands for a different test for prima facie case, to be applied in different circumstances.\n[68] The Federal Court of Appeal reiterated the need for flexibility in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (Can LII). The Court essentially stated that the test for whether a complainant has made out a prima facie case in an employment case should be flexible and not formulaic. The Court considered Shakes as only an example of the guidance provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC) (\u201cO\u2019Malley\u201d), which sets out a more general and flexible test for the establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[69] Further, this Complaint is not just about whether there was discrimination within the meaning of subsection 7(b) of the Act and issues regarding accommodation. It is also about whether, within the meaning of section 10 of the Act, the policy or standard of \u201cright fit\u201d is systemically discriminatory against the Complainant and those who share his disability.\n[70] The Complainant\u2019s position is that this information will allow him \u201c. . . to correlate the candidates\u2019 screening results to the essential and asset qualifications\u201d, which he can use for his \u201cright fit argument\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Reply to Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion).\n[71] The Complainant has linked these documents to the \u201cright fit\u201d issue in the Complaint and they should be disclosed to him subject to their confidentiality, which I consider appropriate to protect as set out below.\n[72] Other than their names, I direct the Respondent to redact any other personal identifying information from each of the resumes and applications, including, without limitation, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, Social Insurance Numbers, work phone numbers and addresses. The Respondent shall then disclose the redacted versions of the applications and resumes of Tracey Clarke and Darren Gould to the Complainant and the Commission.\nXII. Executive Performance Agreements related to Employment Equity\n[73] The Complainant seeks executive performance agreements (\u201cExecutive Performance Agreements\u201d or \u201cAgreements\u201d) and\/or documents pertaining to compensation \u201c. . . related in any way to Employment Equity, for Michael Gardiner and Derek Buxton for the years 2008\/2009 and 2009\/2010.\u201d The Complainant \u201cwishes to see\u201d whether the named individuals \u201c. . . had specific EE objectives to achieve and whether they received recognition in any way (including financial)\u201d or \u201cbrownie points\u201d for achieving those objectives and whether they \u201cwere incentivized in regards to [the EE appointee, a woman] but not in regards to the Complainant\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion and Complainant\u2019s Reply to Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion).\n[74] The Lincoln case, specifically paragraphs 26 and 27 thereof, is the basis for the Respondent\u2019s position that \u201cany issues\u201d the Complainant has raised with respect to the EE Act and the Respondent\u2019s obligations under it \u201c. . . are irrelevant to the context of this complaint. The Federal Court of Appeal has clearly stated that the EE Act operates independently from the [Human Rights] Act.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, at para. 33)\n[75] Specifically regarding the Executive Performance Agreements, the Respondent objects to their disclosure on the grounds that they are irrelevant to the issues in this Complaint, because the successful candidate in the ENG-05 Job Competition did not belong to any Employment Equity (\u201cEE\u201d) group. I note that the foregoing statement seems to conflict with the Respondent\u2019s SOP, which I discuss below. Even if incentives existed, they would have had no effect on the selection process.\nAnalysis\n[76] The complainant in Lincoln relied upon the EE Act for a specific purpose:\n. . . He [complainant] also argues that both the Tribunal and Dawson J. erred by not addressing his contention that the failure of the respondent to comply with section 5 of the Employment Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c.44 itself supported the existence of a prima facie case of discrimination. (Lincoln, supra, at para. 11)\nParagraph 13 of Lincoln says in part:\nThe final issue concerns the relevance of the Employment Equity Act in the context of a complaint under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act . . .\n[77] I conclude that paragraph 27 of Lincoln stands for the proposition that the fact of a respondent\u2019s non-compliance with the EE Act is not itself determinative of discrimination within the meaning of section 7 of the Human Rights Act.\n[78] The application of paragraph 27 of Lincoln to human rights cases was discussed in Khiamal v. Canada, 2009 FC 495 (\u201cKhiamal\u201d). That complainant sought to introduce into evidence statistical data the respondent collected pursuant to the EE Act. The Tribunal did not permit him to do so.\n[79] The Federal Court distinguished the way the complainant wished to use \u201c. . . statistical data contained in the Employment Equity Report\u201d from the way the complainant in Khiamal wished to use the EE Act. The Court found that the Khiamal complainant:\n. . . [Was not] speaking to the operation or enforcement of the [EE Act]. It is the inference that may be drawn from the data which is of significance. The weight to be attributed to it is to be determined by the Tribunal. Whether the statistical data submitted by the [complainant] was relevant to the issue and supported the allegation of discrimination is a finding to be made by the Tribunal. (Khiamal, supra, at para. 96)\n[80] Similarly, in Kanags Premakumar v. Air Canada, 2002 Can LII 23561 (CHRT) (\u201cPremakumar\u201d), then Tribunal Chairperson MacTavish admitted statistical data into evidence with respect to \u201c. . . the extent to which visible minorities were represented within the [respondent company\u2019s] workforce.\u201d (Premakumar, supra, at para. 62)\n[81] Khiamal and Premakumar are cases which stand for the proposition that paragraph 27 of Lincoln should be interpreted in accordance with its terms, and not so broadly as to automatically exclude any and all Employment Equity evidence on the basis that it is irrelevant to a complaint under section 7 of the Act. Such evidence, if admitted by the Tribunal, must be evaluated as to credibility and weight by that Tribunal.\nIn his Complaint and in his SOP, the Complainant includes EE in his outline of events and factual allegations. For example, in paragraph 30 of his SOP, he states how he described to the Respondent and \u201c. . . provided the rationale for why [Complainant\u2019s] request to be selected from the qualified pool for the employment position would constitute reasonable accommodation and assist the Respondent in meeting its EE objectives.\u201d\n[82] In its SOP, the Respondent\u2019s list of witnesses names Heather McDonald (Skaarup), describing her in part as \u201c. . . the successful EE candidate in the ENG-05 appointment process.\u201d The Respondent also lists Kenneth Hill as a witness, describing him as \u201c. . . the successful non-EE candidate in the ENG-05 competition.\u201d In its SOP, the Respondent also counters the Complainant\u2019s EE argument.\n[83] It seems to me that Employment Equity is a part of the narrative of this Complaint.\n[84] Having said that, this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide whether the Respondent is in compliance with its obligations under the EE Act, or with the 2008-2011 EE MAP, or any other policy under Employment Equity (Lincoln, supra, at para. 27). This Tribunal also does not have jurisdiction to remedy breaches of the EE Act (Ibid).\n[85] It appears from the Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion that the basis of his belief that these executives were receiving \u201cbounties\u201d or \u201cbrownie points\u201d or incentives for meeting EE objectives is a statement from the Coast Guard\u2019s Strategic Human Resources Plan 2009-2012 that \u201c[I]mproving diversity\u201d will be a \u201c. . . commitment in the executive performance agreements of all Directors General . . . and they will need to demonstrate concrete evidence of their efforts to recruit designated group members\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion, at footnote 1).\n[86] With respect to whether the Executive Performance Agreements are arguably relevant to the Complaint, and therefore should be disclosed, the issue in this request is the nature of the documents sought.\n[87] My understanding of what the Complainant wishes to establish from the Executive Performance Agreements is that in its implementation of the EE Act, specifically in increasing a perceived under-representation of women, the Respondent adversely affected and discriminated against the Complainant and others sharing his disability. This is not the same as seeking to establish non-compliance with the EE Act,the EE MAP or EE policies in order to establish a prima facie case.\n[88] In this context, I conclude that those portions of the Executive Performance Agreements related to employment equity are arguably relevant to an issue in the Complaint.\n[89] However, to require disclosure of these Executive Performance Agreements in their entirety is not arguably relevant to the issue and is unnecessarily intrusive of the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals\u2019 personnel files. Only the Employment Equity-related portions are arguably relevant.\n[90] Therefore, I direct the Respondent to redact all portions of the Executive Performance Agreements, including, without limitation, monetary amounts, leaving intact only each individual\u2019s name, the year or years the Agreements are in effect and all Employment Equity-related portions. The Respondent shall then disclose the redacted versions of the Executive Performance Agreements to the Complainant and the Commission.\n[91] I conclude that documents related to compensation with respect to these individuals and EE are not arguably relevant. What is arguably relevant is whether there were incentives with respect to a certain EE group or groups, not the amounts of any financial incentives. As well, it would be unnecessarily intrusive to disclose the particular individuals\u2019 financial details.\nXIII. The Complainant\u2019s request regarding the determination of arguable relevance\n[92] In his Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, the Complainant requests that Respondent counsel, Commission counsel or Tribunal or Commission staff be ordered to decide what is arguably relevant. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to order Commission staff to provide services. Tribunal staff does not provide legal advice, which is what the decision about arguable relevance entails. The usual procedure regarding disclosure is for a party which is represented by counsel, to gather all documents related to a complaint, pursuant to its counsel\u2019s instructions, and for counsel to decide what is arguably relevant. Counsel are officers of the Court. As such, they must abide by not only the rules of their own governing professional body and the Court or Tribunal rules, but they must also conduct themselves ethically towards the other parties and the Court or Tribunal. Counsel also have a professional responsibility to explain the rules of the Court or Tribunal to their clients, and advise them of the consequences of breaching those rules. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to make this type of order.\nXIV. Disclosure and Admissibility\n[93] With respect to the documents that this Ruling orders disclosed, I wish to note that this does not mean that they are automatically admissible into evidence at the hearing. The standard for admissibility of documents at the hearing is different than that for disclosure.\nXV. Confidentiality Ruling\n[94] The Confidentiality Ruling previously issued for this Complaint remains in effect.\nXVI. Ruling\n[95] The Respondent shall make its best efforts to retrieve the November 25, 2009 email which Mr. Michael Gardiner sent to the Complainant and then withdrew. If the Respondent can retrieve the email, the Respondent shall disclose it to the other parties. If the Respondent cannot retrieve the email, the Respondent shall inform the other parties in writing.\n[96] With respect to:\nCorrectional Services Canada Staffing Process Number 08-PEN-EA-NCR-NHQ-2853;\nDFO Staffing Process Number 10-DFO-INA-NCR-939827; and\nDepartment of Transport Staffing Process Number 09-MOT-IA-OTT-69796,\nto the extent that the Respondent has not already done so, the Respondent shall disclose all documentation on each of the foregoing files pertaining to Brian William Carter in regards to accommodation measures in the identified job competition.\n[97] To the extent that the Respondent has not already done so, the Respondent shall disclose all documentation held by the Public Service Commission and its Personnel Psychology Centre pertaining to accommodation measures for Brian William Carter, including, without limitation, all Public Service Commission and Personnel Psychology Centre analysis documents to support the accommodation measures that were ever proposed for or offered to Brian William Carter.\n[98] If reasonably possible, the Respondent shall disclose the Complainant\u2019s signed form dated September 2009, in which he self-identified as a person with a disability with respect to the ENG-05 Job Selection Competition. The Complainant shall sign any consent the relevant authority may reasonably require to release the form.\n[99] The Respondent shall search for a document titled \u201cStrategic Plan for the Implementation of the Employment Equity Management Action Plan (EE MAP) for 2008 to 2011\u201d and if it cannot find it, the Respondent shall provide written confirmation to the Complainant and the Commission that the Respondent does not have the document. If the Respondent can find the document, the Respondent shall disclose it.\n[100] The Respondent shall redact from the applications and resumes of Tracey Clarke and Darren Gould, which they used to apply for the ENG-05 position, all personal identifying information, except for their names. For the purposes of this Ruling, \u201cpersonal identifying information\u201d includes, without limitation, dates of birth, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, email addresses, Social Insurance Numbers, employer names, employer phone numbers and addresses.\n[101] The Respondent shall then disclose to the other parties the redacted versions of the said applications and resumes.\n[102] The Respondent shall redact from the Executive Performance Agreements of Michael Gardiner and Derek Buxton for the years 2008\/2009 and 2009\/2010 everything except each individual\u2019s name, the year or years to which each Agreement applies, and all parts related to Employment Equity, which shall remain intact, provided that if there are any monetary amounts related to the Employment Equity parts, the Respondent shall also redact such amounts.\n[103] The Respondent shall then disclose the redacted versions of the Executive Performance Agreements to the other parties.\n[104] Timelines for the disclosure in this Ruling shall be discussed and dealt with in the next Case Management Conference Call.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 29, 2015\n",

Context\n[1] The Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), have filed a human rights Complaint (the Complaint) against the Respondent, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), formerly known as Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amounts to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c. H-6 (the CHRA or the Act). The Complaint was referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on October 14, 2008 and, on November 3, 2008, the Commission requested that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the Complaint.\n[2] On December 22, 2009, Dr. Cindy Blackstock, on behalf of the Caring Society, served a notice of motion to amend the Complaint to include allegations of retaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act (the motion to amend the Complaint). The Tribunal granted the motion in a ruling dated October 16, 2012 (2012 CHRT 24), finding that the allegations of retaliation emanated from the same factual matrix as the initial Complaint and that the fair administration of justice supported granting the amendment rather than creating an artificial separation of the allegations in multiple proceedings. The Tribunal held a hearing on the allegations of retaliation on February 28, 2013, March 1, 2013, July 15, 16, 17, 19, 22 and 24, 2013 and August 7, 2013, in Ottawa. For the purposes of the present decision, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s name will be used when reffering to events involving herself and the Caring Society will be referenced as the Complainant. The evidence heard during this hearing, along with the parties\u2019 subsequent written submissions, inform the present decision.\nII. The Law on Retaliation\nA. Overview of the Relevant Case Law\n[3] Section 14.1 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[4] As is the case with other discrimination complaints, the onus of establishing retaliation first rests on the complainant who must demonstrate a prima facie case. That is, the complainant must provide evidence which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict that the respondent retaliated against him or her (see Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536, at para. 28 [O\u2019Malley]). Where a complaint is based on a prohibited ground of discrimination, complainants are required to show that they have a charateristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA, that they experienced an adverse impact and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, at para. 33).\n[5] Retaliation complaints, however, are not founded on a prohibited ground of dicrimination. Rather, it is a complainant\u2019s previous human rights complaint that is substituted for the prohibited ground of discrimination. Therefore, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, complainants are required to show that they previously filed a human rights complaint under the CHRA, that they experienced an adverse impact following the filing of their complaint and that the human rights complaint was a factor in the adverse impact. That said, there is some debate in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence as to how a complainant can establish that their human rights complaint was a factor in the adverse impact suffered.\n[6] In Virk v. Bell Canada (2005 CHRT 2 [Virk]), the Tribunal stated: \u201c[r]etaliation implies some form of willful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint\u201d (Virk, at para. 156). According to this view, a complainant must show that the alleged retaliator knew of the existence of the complaint, acted in an inopportune way and that its actions were motivated by the filing of the complaint (see Virk, at para. 158). In some Tribunal cases, Virk has been interpreted as requiring the complainant to prove an intention to retaliate (see for example Malec, Malec, Kaltush, Ishpatao, Tettaut, Malec, Mest\u00e9pap\u00e9o, Kaltush v. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 CHRT 2; and Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation & Raj Thambirajah, 2012 CHRT 29).\n[7] Another approach was outlined in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (No. 7), (1995), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/213; aff'd (1998) O.A.C. 188 (Div. Ct.); varied on other grounds (2000), 50 O.R. 3(d) 18 (C.A.); and adopted by the Tribunal in Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (CHRT) [Wong]. Under this approach, to prove retaliation there only need be a link between the alleged act of retaliation and the enforcement of the complainant\u2019s rights under the CHRA. While intent to retaliate would obviously establish this link, the complainant\u2019s \u201creasonable perception\u201d that the act is retaliatory could also establish this link.\n[8] In applying the Wong approach, the reasonableness of the complainant\u2019s perception is measured so as not to hold the respondent accountable for unreasonable anxiety or undue reaction by the complainant (see Wong, at para. 219). In this regard, where there is a history of conflict between the complainant and the respondent, it can be difficult to discern the reasonableness of the complainant\u2019s perception of retliation. To assist in this analysis, in Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40, at paras. 48-61 [Bressette], the Tribunal adopted an approach whereby it first determined whether it could accept, on a prima facie basis, that the human rights complaint was at least one of the factors influencing the alleged differential treatment. If a prima facie case is established, then the respondent is asked to provide a reasonable explanation for the treatment.\n[9] Similar to Virk, some provincial human rights Tribunals and Commissions require proof of intent, whether by direct evidence or by inference, to substantiate a retaliation complaint (see Walsh v. Mobil Oil Canada, 2008 ABCA 268; and Noble v. York University, 2010 HRTO 878). Others follow the Entrop, Wong and Bressette approach, relying on a complainant\u2019s reasonable perception of retaliation (see Bissonnette v. School District No. 62 and Frizzell, 2006 BCHRT 447),or simply a connection between the human rights complaint and a subsequent adverse treatment (see Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Ville de Nicolet, 2001 CanLII 88 (QC TDP)).\n[10] The parties in this case have each argued that the Tribunal ought to prefer one of these two approaches. The Complainant suggests that the Wong approach currently prevails and that it is unnecessary for the Complainant to prove specific intent on the part of the Respondent; rather, the Complainant must show that Dr. Blackstock reasonably perceived the Respondent\u2019s conduct to be in retaliation to the human rights Complaint. The Respondent, on the other hand, submits that, as stated by the Tribunal in Virk and Cassidy, there must be a conscious aspect to retaliation and that the Complainant must demonstrate that the Respondent knew of the Complaint and responded to it negatively by way of reprisal or other punitive conduct. However, both the Complainant and the Respondent argue that regardless of the approach the Tribunal adopts, the evidence of the present case supports their respective positions.\n[11] In our view, the Wong and Bressette approach is the correct approach to analyzing complaints of retaliation. To require intent in order to establish retaliation places a higher burden to substantiate this discriminatory practice than any of the other ones outlined in the CHRA. This is not consistent with an interpretation of the CHRA or human rights legislation in general.\n[12] The basic rule of statutory interpretation is that \u201cthe words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\u201d (Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p. 87; see also Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 SCR 27, at para. 21).\n[13] The special nature of human rights legislation is also taken into account in its interpretation:\nHuman rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n(CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114, at p. 1134)\nSimilarly, in B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66, at para. 44, the Supreme Court reiterated:\nMore generally, this Court has repeatedly reiterated the view that human rights legislation has a unique quasi-constitutional nature and ought to be interpreted in a liberal and purposive manner in order to advance the broad policy considerations underlying it: see, for example, Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571, at para. 120; University of British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 353, at p. 370; Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84, at pp. 89-90; Insurance Corp. of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 157-58.\n(B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66, at para. 44)\n[14] To retaliate is to \u201crespond to an injury, insult, assault, etc. in likemanner\u201d (Canadian Oxford Dictionnary, 2d ed., s.v. \u201cretaliate\u201d). In French, the word \u201crepr\u00e9sailles\u201d means \u201c[r]endre le mal pour le mal\u201d (Le Petit Robert 2013, s.v. \u201crepr\u00e9sailles\u201d). While the grammatical or ordinary sense of the words \u201cretaliate\u201d or \u201crepr\u00e9sailles\u201d assist in understanding the basic action at issue, these defintions are not totally transferrable to the scheme, object and intention of the CHRA.\n[15] First, applying the above definitions literally in the context of the CHRA would amount to characterizing a human rights complaint as something that is wrong (injury, insult, assault, mal). This obviously does not fit with the purpose of the CHRA:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect\u2026to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices\u2026\nIn filing complaints of discriminatory practices to protect this purpose, the public is exercising its \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cquasi-constitutional\u201d rights (see Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. v. Gibbs, [1996] 3 SCR 566, at p. 577). These rights, \u201c\u2026and the values it endeavours to buttress and protect, are, save their constitutional laws, more important than all other\u201d (Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 SCR 145, at p.158). Therefore, the filing of complaints to protect human rights should not be viewed as a wrong, but as something noble, safe and fair.\n[16] Second, while the definitions of the words retaliate and repr\u00e9sailles imply some sort of conscious, intentional action on the part of the person retaliating, the same can also be said about the action of discriminating. In English, to discriminate means to \u201cmake a distinction, esp. unjustly and on the basis of race, age, sex, etc.\u201d (Canadian Oxford Dictionnary, 2d ed., s.v. \u201cdiscriminate\u201d). In French, \u201cdiscrimination\u201d means \u201c[t]raitement in\u00e9gal et d\u00e9favorable appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines personnes (notamment en raison de leur origine, leur sexe, leur age, leurs croyances religieuses\u2026) (Le Petit Robert 2013, s.v. \u201cdiscrimination\u201d). Despite these definitions of the action of discriminating, when the nature and purpose of human rights legislation is taken into account, the Supreme Court of Canada has found that proof of intent is not needed in order to substantiate a discrimination claim.\n[17] In Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), 1987 CanLII 73 (SCC), at para. 9 [Robichaud], the Supreme Court noted that the CHRA \u201c\u2026seeks \u201cto give effect\u201d to the principle of equal opportunity for individuals by eradicating discrimination.\u201d That is, the CHRA is primarily aimed at eliminating discrimination, not punishing those who discrirmnate. In this regard, the Supreme Court went on to state:\nSince the Act is essentially concerned with the removal of discrimination, as opposed to punishing anti\u2011social behaviour, it follows that the motives or intention of those who discriminate are not central to its concerns. Rather, the Act is directed to redressing socially undesirable conditions quite apart from the reasons for their existence.\n(Robichaud, at para. 10)\n[18] Similarly, in O\u2019Malley, at paragraph 14, the Supreme Court stated:\nTo take the narrower view and hold that intent is a required element of discrimination under the Code would seem to me to place a virtually insuperable barrier in the way of a complainant seeking a remedy. It would be extremely difficult in most circumstances to prove motive, and motive would be easy to cloak in the formation of rules which, though imposing equal standards, could create, as in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), injustice and discrimination by the equal treatment of those who are unequal (Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 (1950), at p. 184). Furthermore, as I have endeavoured to show, we are dealing here with consequences of conduct rather than with punishment for misbehaviour. In other words, we are considering what are essentially civil remedies. The proof of intent, a necessary requirement in our approach to criminal and punitive legislation, should not be a governing factor in construing human rights legislation aimed at the elimination of discrimination. It is my view that the courts below were in error in finding an intent to discriminate to be a necessary element of proof.\n[19] Pursuant to Robichaud and O\u2019Malley, intent is not a necessary element of proof to establish a discriminatory practice under the CHRA. In this regard, we note the CHRA does not differentiate between discriminatory practices, including retaliation at section 14.1:\n4. A discriminatory practice, as described in sections 5 to 14.1, may be the subject of a complaint under Part III and anyone found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice may be made subject to an order as provided in section 53.\n39. For the purposes of this Part, a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d means any practice that is a discriminatory practice within the meaning of sections 5 to 14.1.\n[20] There is also no requirement of intent specifically mentioned in section 14.1:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[21] The concept of intent only arises in the CHRA when a complaint has been substantiated, as something to consider in making an order under section 53:\n53. (3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[22] The analysis adopted by Tribunal members under 53(3) and the corresponding awards or lack thereof may be indicative of this higher threshold present in the requirement of intent.\nThe Federal Court has interpreted this section as being a \u201c\u2026punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate\u201d (Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113, at para. 155, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 110 [Johnstone FC]). A finding of wilfulness requires \u201c\u2026the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional\u201d (Johnstone FC, at para. 155). Recklessness involves \u201c\u2026acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly\u201d (Johnstone FC, at para. 155). The Tribunal has not often made awards in the higher range of this section, which may be indicative of the application of the requirement for intent. Interestingly, in Bressette, the Tribunal substantiated the retaliation complaint, but it did not award any amount under section 53(3) of the CHRA.\n[23] Furthermore, the Federal Court of Appeal recently stated: \u201c[t]here should be no hierarchies of human rights\u201d (Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2014 FCA 110, at para. 81 [Johnstone FCA]). In determing that the prohibited ground of family status should not entail a higher threshold for a finding of prima facie discrimination than for the other prohibited grounds set out in the CHRA, the Court stated:\nWe agree that the test that should apply to a finding of prima facie discrimination on the prohibited ground of family status should be substantially the same as that which applies to the other enumerated grounds of discrimination.\n(Johnstone FCA, at para. 81)\n[24] The same reasoning can be applied to section 14.1 of the CHRA. While retaliation does not entail the application of a prohibited ground of discrimination, it employs a complaint of discrimination in its place. Pursuant to Johnstone FCA, the prima facie test for section 14.1 should be substantially the same as those for the other discriminatory practices. As mentioned above, none of the other discriminatory practices require a complainant to establish intent.\n[25] This interpretation is also consistent with the important policy considerations underlying section 14.1. A prohibition on retaliation for having filed a complaint safeguards the integrity of the CHRA complaint process by providing protection for complainants who may be hesitant to exercise their rights under the CHRA for fear of reprisal. It also provides an assurance that, if reprisal is taken against them as a result of the filing of a complaint, redress will be provided. This section may also serve to deter those who might retaliate.\n[26] Requiring intent to establish retaliation may defeat the purposes of section 14.1, because, as the Tribunal has stated many times: \u201c[d]iscrimination is not a practise which one would expect to see displayed overtly\u201d (Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT)). Therefore, a requirement to establish intent would make it very hard to ever substantiate a retaliation complaint.\n[27] In fact, prior to the inclusion of section 14.1, retaliation was only covered under sections 59 and 60 of CHRA. Those sections make it a summary conviction offence to threaten, intimidate or discriminate against an individual because they have made a complaint under the CHRA. Prior to the adoption of section 14.1 in 1998, there had been few retaliation prosecutions, and those launched had generally been unsucessful. That was because it was difficult to meet the criminal requirements needed to secure a conviction in those cases: proof beyond a reasonable doubt that action was taken against a complainant with the intent to force the abandonment of his or her human rights complaint. As a result, Parliament decided the anti-discrimination system created by the CHRA would be better suited than the criminal courts to deal with retaliation cases (see Parliament of Canada, Legislative Summary-298E, Bill S-5: An Act to Amend the Canada Evidence Act, the Criminal Code, and the Canadian Human Rights Act by Nancy Holmes (Law and Governance Division, 1998), at C3, online: Parliament of Canada http:\/\/www.parl.gc.ca\/About\/Parliament\/LegislativeSummaries\/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&ls=S5&Parl=36&Ses=1).\n[28] For these reasons, we do not believe a complainant should be required to show proof of intent to substantiate a retaliation claim under the CHRA. In our view, the central purpose of the CHRA is \u201c\u2026to eradicate anti-social conditions without regard to the motives or intention of those who cause them\u201d (Robichaud, at para. 11). To require a complainant to prove intent in order to substantiate a retaliation complaint minimizes the protection against retaliation under the CHRA and enfeebles the proper impact of having included section 14.1 in the CHRA.\n[29] That said, while a complainant does not have to prove intent to substantiate a retaliation complaint, he or she must still present sufficient evidence to justify that his or her human rights complaint was a factor in any alleged adverse treatment he or she received from a respondent following the filing of his or her complaint, whether based on a reasonable perception thereof or otherwise. In this regard, we note that a prima facie case does not require a party to adduce any particular type of evidence. Rather, in each case, it is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation (see Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154, at para. 27). If sufficient evidence is presented to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, it is then the Tribunal\u2019s role to consider the complainant\u2019s evidence, alongside any evidence presented by the respondent, to determine whether it is more probable than not that retaliation has occurred.\n[30] It is with this in mind that we now turn to examine the facts specific to the present case.\nIII. The Retaliation Complaint\n[31] The Complainant argues that prior to the filing of the 2007 human rights Complaint against the Respondent, Dr. Blackstock and the Caring Society had strong collaborative ties with the Respondent. Following the 2000 National Policy Review, which examined the funding formula used by the Government of Canada to fund First Nations child and family services on reserve (known as Directive 20-1), the Respondent commissioned the Caring Society to engage a team of experts to identify at least three funding formula alternatives for First Nations child and family service agencies. The Complainant argues that in the course of this research and the resulting three reports (known as the Wen:De Reports), the parties worked in a concerted manner. However, once the Complaint was filed, there was a noticeable shift in the Respondent\u2019s attitude towards the Complainant, which the Complainant argues was unquestionably motivated by the human rights Complaint.\n[32] The Respondent, for its part, recognizes that AANDC engages many organizations, like the Caring Society, and experts for their expertise in the field of child welfare funding on Indian Reserves in Canada. In fact, AANDC also engages provincial governments and numerous international organizations on related issues. While the Respondent and the Caring Society admittedly possessed a working relationship for a number of years, this relationship changed in 2006, upon the completion of the Wen:De report and its presentation. However, this change in the relationship pre-dates the filing of the Complaint. The Respondent takes the position that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s perception that the Respondent retaliated against her as a result of her filing of her human rights Complaint is unfounded and unreasonable.\n[33] The Retaliation Complaint is grounded in a series of specific incidents where it is alleged the Respondent took actions of a retaliatory nature. Dr. Blackstock, on behalf of the Caring Society (Complainant), alleges that the following incidents occurred due to her filing of the Complaint: (A.) she was not hired by the Respondent as a casual employee on a working group, despite her qualifications (The British Columbia Working Group); (B.) she was excluded from a meeting with the Minister and the Chiefs of Ontario (Chiefs of Ontario Meeting at the Minister\u2019s Office); (C.) the Respondent monitored her public appearances (Monitoring of Complainant\u2019s Public Appearances); (D.) the Respondent monitored the Caring Society\u2019s and \u201cI am a Witness\u201d campaign Facebook pages as well as her personal Facebook page (Monitoring of Facebook Pages); and (E.) the Respondent inappropriately accessed her Indian Registrar Record on two occasions (Access to the Complainant\u2019s Indian Registrar Record).\n[34] The present decision will examine each of these alleged incidents in turn.\nA. The British Columbia Working Group\n[35] In 2008, the Respondent formed a Working Group in British Columbia with First Nations organizations to develop and implement a new Enhanced Funding Formula for the province for the funding of First Nations child welfare services. The Working Group grew out of the Partnership Table, a group comprised of representatives from B.C. First Nations agencies, B.C. Ministry for Children representatives and Federal representatives from the AANDC B.C. Region, which met approximately four times a year.\n[36] At one of the Partnership Table meetings, an AANDC official from the Alberta Child and Family Services office presented Alberta\u2019s funding model, which was described as a renovated Directive 20-1 formula. Following these discussions, the group decided that they would use the Alberta funding model as the basis for a \u201cmade-in-B.C.\u201d approach, which would be tailored to meet the needs of B.C. First Nations and reflect requirements of B.C. legislation.\n[37] This led to the formation of the Working Group, a tripartite process which was composed of representatives from the B.C. First Nations agencies, the B.C. provincial government and from AANDC Headquarters. The AANDC Child and Family Services B.C. Regional office provided funding to hire a casual employee to manage the process and help develop the document that the Working Group would produce. This employee was to attend the meetings, prepare drafts, manage the input of the Working Group members, write briefing notes to AANDC senior management and develop communications pieces for the use of the agencies so as to enable them to explain the model to their various Chiefs, councils and communities.\n[38] During one of the Working Group\u2019s preliminary meetings, Mary Teegee, from the Carrier Sekani Family Services in Prince George, B.C., suggested to the Working Group that Dr. Blackstock should be retained for this position, in light of her background and expertise in the area of child welfare in B.C.. Linda Stiller, who at the time managed the AANDC Child and Family program in the B.C. region, rejected the idea, allegedly because Dr. Blackstock had been openly quite critical of the new Alberta funding model which B.C. was planning on following. The Working Group chose instead to hire someone named Jeffrey Lyons, who had previously worked in the AANDC Manitoba Region as a social worker and had been involved in the national review of Directive 20-1 as an AANDC Headquarters representative.\n[39] The Working Group continued to meet over a period of nine to twelve months to establish the B.C. funding model and prepared a document entitled \u201cEnhanced Prevention Services Model for B.C. Advisory and Steering Committee workshop.\u201d According to Ms. Stiller, the BC funding model was approved by the members of the Partnership Table, as well as by the Board of Directors of all the B.C. child welfare agencies, but was never adopted by the Federal Government.\n(i) Parties\u2019 positions\n[40] The Complainant argues that the Respondent\u2019s opposition to the Working Group retaining Dr. Blackstock as a consultant was grounded in the filing of the Complaint. Dr. Blackstock testified that Mary Teegee informed her that, in addition to refusing to hire for the consultant position, the Working Group had taken the view that they would not have discussions if Dr. Blackstock participated.\n[41] In the Complainant\u2019s view, the explanation given by Linda Stiller, the Respondent\u2019s witness, for the refusal to hire Dr. Blackstock, namely that she had been critical of the new Alberta funding model, is pretextual. Ms. Stiller admitted that she did not know Dr. Blackstock\u2019s specific criticisms and did not contact her to discuss her views on the Alberta funding model; the views that the Complainant argues are also supported by the Auditor General of Canada\u2019s 2008 report. Ms. Stiller also acknowledged that the Complaint was regularly discussed in her meetings with AANDC National Headquarters. Combined with the fact that the consultant hired by the Working Group was from out of province and lacked Dr. Blackstock\u2019s credentials and specific knowledge of B.C., the Complainant argues that the decision not to hire Dr. Blackstock, whose expertise in child welfare in B.C. is well known and respected, was based on her filing of the Complaint.\n[42] The Respondent argues that its witness, Ms. Stiller, provided a clear explanation as to why Dr. Blackstock was not considered an appropriate choice for the casual employee position with the Working Group. The employee hired was to \u201chold the pen\u201d for the Working Group and undertake the drafting of the group\u2019s work, as well as provide internal support and develop communication documents explaining the chosen model to Chiefs, councils and communities. The B.C. Working Group had planned to use the Alberta model as a basis for its own B.C. approach and tailor it to meet the needs of the B.C. First Nations and reflect the requirements of the provincial legislation. Given the Complainant\u2019s vocal and public criticisms of the Alberta model and her view that the Wen:De approach would have been more appropriate, Ms. Stiller testified that she felt the Dr. Blackstock would have a conflict of interest as she did not support the model which was to constitute the foundation of the Working Group\u2019s approach. Ms. Stiller testified that contrary to the Dr. Blackstock contentions, Mr. Lyons possessed specific knowledge of B.C. and had worked on several contracts for the B.C. provincial ministry as well as for a number of B.C. First Nations agencies.\n[43] The Respondent argues that the decision to hire Mr. Lyons instead of the Dr. Blackstock was not retaliatory and that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s perception in this regard is not reasonable. While Ms. Stiller acknowledged that she was aware of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s and the Complainant\u2019s human rights Complaint, she expressed that this was not a relevant factor in her decision.\n(ii) Analysis\n[44] Dr. Blackstock has an undeniable expertise in the area of focus of the Working Group. Combined with the fact that these events occurred soon after the filing of her human rights Complaint, the Tribunal finds that in the absence of an explanation by the Respondent, the Complainant has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Respondent\u2019s objection to hiring Dr. Blackstock for the position was retaliatory. As such, on a prima facie basis, the Complainant has demonstrated that Dr. Blackstock was adversely differentiated in this regard.\n[45] However, the Respondent has provided an explanation for this differentiation. Respondent witness Linda Stiller was credible and the Tribunal accepts her evidence that she did not prevent the Dr. Blackstock from attending the Working Group meetings generally, but objected to hiring her to help develop the document that the Working Group was to produce.\n[46] The Tribunal also accepts the explanation provided for this objection, namely that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s publicly expressed negative views with regard to the Alberta child welfare funding model were in direct conflict with the objective that the Working Group was trying to achieve. Dr. Blackstock was supportive of the Wen:De report, which advocates for a large investment of funds across the country, whereas according to Ms. Stiller\u2019s evidence, the Alberta model worked with the provinces\u2019 current levels of spending and attempted to improve the delivery of services by the on-reserve agencies to the level of the province with these existing funds.\n[47] It is reasonable, in a hiring decision such as this one, for the Respondent to refuse to hire an individual that has previously expressed views indicating the presence of a conflict of interest with the work that would be undertaken. We found nothing in this evidence which could indicate that the Respondent\u2019s explanation is pretextual. While it is true that Ms. Stiller mentioned that, at the time, she may have been aware of the existence of the Complaint, she also pointed out that, as a regional manager, she had no involvement in these types of matters. The Tribunal finds that, in light of the credibility of the explanation provided for the adverse differentiation, Ms. Stiller\u2019s awareness of the Complaint alone is insufficient to conclude that it was a factor in her decision.\n[48] For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that this particular series of events does not demonstrate that the Respondent retaliated against the Complainant.\nB. Chiefs of Ontario Meeting at the Minister\u2019s Office\n[49] On December 9, 2009, Dr. Blackstock was invited by the Chiefs of Ontario to attend a meeting with David McArthur, a special assistant to the Honourable Chuck Strahl, Minister of AANDC (at the time known as INAC). The meeting was convened on short notice, as many of the Chiefs were in Ottawa to attend a meeting with the AFN. The goal of the meeting was to discuss issues surrounding child welfare policy and funding in Ontario and was scheduled to take place in the offices of the Minister in Gatineau, Quebec. Dr. Blackstock testified that Grand Chief Randall Phillips, from the Allied Iroquois and Algonquin Nation, invited her to attend, in light of her expertise in this area. She was one of several individuals who had been invited by the Chiefs of Ontario to attend the meeting as a technical aid.\n[50] Upon arrival at the Minister\u2019s office building, Dr. Blackstock, along with the 10 to 14 other individuals accompanying Grand Chief Phillips, proceeded through security and took the elevator to the floor of the Minister\u2019s office. There, they sat and waited in the reception area, outside of the meeting room. Mr. McArthur appeared and following a brief discussion with Grand Chief Phillips regarding the number of delegates, proceeded to allow the delegates to enter the meeting room one by one, greeting them individually as they went in.\n[51] When it was Dr. Blackstock\u2019s turn to enter the room, Mr. McArthur asked her to identify herself. When she did, he blocked access to the room, stating \u201c[w]ell, we\u2019ll meet with you at another time, \u2026I understand that you have a number of issues, and we\u2019ll meet with you at another time\u201d (see StenoTran Services Inc.\u2019s transcript of February 28, 2013, vol. 4, at p. 16, lines 8-11). Dr. Blackstock clarified that she was not there to discuss the Complaint and that she was attending the meeting as a technical advisor for the Chiefs of Ontario.\n[52] Grand Chief Phillips intervened in support of Dr. Blackstock confirming her role as a technical advisor. After some back and forth between them, Mr. McArthur said to Grand Chief Phillips: \u201c\u2018Chief\u2019, he said, \u2018[i]f she comes in, there\u2019s no meeting. It\u2019s as simple as that\u2019\u201d (see StenoTran Services Inc.\u2019s transcript of July 15, 2013, vol. 13, at page 80, lines 19-20). Grand Chief Phillips therefore yielded to Mr. McArthur\u2019s request and entered the meeting room, leaving Dr. Blackstock in the waiting area. As the meeting started, she remained there alone for 10 to 15 minutes, under the watch of a security guard. Dr. Blackstock testified she left before the meeting concluded. Grand Chief Phillips and Mr. McArthur both testified that, in the end, the meeting had been fruitful for both parties.\n[53] Following the meeting, in a letter dated December 15, 2009, Dr. Blackstock wrote to Minister Strahl requesting an explanation for her exclusion from the meeting. She added that \u201c[t]he only reasonable explanation is that I am involved in the filing of a Human Rights complaint against INAC\u201d (see StenoTran Services Inc.\u2019s transcript of July 17, 2013, vol. 15, at page 66, lines 7-11). She received a letter in response on January 29, 2010, signed by Laurie Throness, Minister Strahl\u2019s Chief of Staff. The letter explained that Dr. Blackstock was excluded from the meeting as she was not originally listed as one of the participants and that the Minister\u2019s office had a practice of obtaining briefings prior to any meetings, something which had not been done for Dr. Blackstock. The letter stated that, as a result, Mr. McArthur felt that meeting with her at that time would not have been appropriate. Mr. Throness reminded Dr. Blackstock that Mr. McArthur had expressed that he was, however, willing to meet with her on a separate occasion and reiterated this offer in the letter. Dr. Blackstock never availed herself of this offer.\n(i) Parties\u2019 Positions\n[54] The Complainant argues that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s exclusion from the meeting was based on her filing of the Complaint and constitutes retaliation. As Grand Chief Phillips testified, Dr. Blackstock was present as a technical aid to him, in light of her knowledge on statistics and funding levels and both he and Dr. Blackstock clearly indicated to Mr. McArthur that she was not there to discuss the Complaint.\n[55] The Complainant rejects the Respondent\u2019s explanation for excluding Dr. Blackstock, which is that she was not on the list of invitees and because Mr. McArthur had not received a prior briefing on her. Dr. Blackstock was the only person excluded from the meeting, even though many others who were present were not on the invitee list. In fact, the evidence revealed that although five people were expected at the meeting, approximately 10 to 14 people were present. Mr. McArthur also admitted that he had not received briefings on the invitees whom he knew were scheduled to attend. Mr. McArthur\u2019s unfriendly tone and demeanour, along with the order for a security guard to stand and watch over Dr. Blackstock as she sat in the waiting area, compounded her feelings of shame and humiliation, all of which constituted retaliatory action, according to the Complainant.\n[56] The Respondent is of the view that it has provided a reasonable explanation for the decision to exclude Dr. Blackstock from the meeting and that this event does not support the retaliation Complaint. Mr. McArthur testified that meetings of this kind were usually planned a long time in advance and accompanied by comprehensive briefing packages by AANDC. This meeting, scheduled just a day before, was an aberration in this respect and was only agreed upon as a courtesy to the Chiefs of Ontario, who were already in Ottawa, in the interest of strengthening the relationship with the AFN. Mr. McArthur testified that he only learned of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s planned attendance shortly before the meeting and that, while he was aware of the Complaint, his reason for excluding her was because he needed to be properly briefed before meeting with someone of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s stature. Mr. McArthur expressed that he was concerned that a wide range of other issues, including the Complaint, could arise during the meeting and that he was not in a position to address them at this time.\n[57] The Respondent submits that the evidence fails to demonstrate that the Respondent intended to retaliate against Dr. Blackstock and that her perception of retaliation is unreasonable. Mr. McArthur was firm towards Dr. Blackstock, but also apologetic, and offered to meet with her at another time, an invitation which Dr. Blackstock never acted upon. As for the Commissionaire who remained in the reception area with Dr. Blackstock while the meeting was taking place, the Respondent maintains that the Commissionaire was present because a security breach had occurred when the Chiefs and the other participants had entered the office building. The Commissionaire was also present because the offices of the Deputy Minister and Associate Deputy Minister were adjacent to the reception area where Dr. Blackstock was sitting.\n(ii) Analysis\n[58] On a prima facie basis, the Tribunal finds that Dr. Blackstock has demonstrated that she was adversely differentiated when she was excluded from the meeting with the Chiefs of Ontario and Mr. McArthur. Of the 10 to 14 individuals present, Dr. Blackstock was the only person who was excluded from the meeting. Moreover, Mr. McArthur\u2019s statement that he would not meet with her because \u201cshe had a number of issues\u201d which needed to be discussed at another time, is a clear indication that the Complaint was at least a factor forming the basis for her exclusion. Combined with the fact that a Commissionaire appeared to stand guard over her while she sat alone in the waiting room as the meeting took place, compounding her feelings of shame, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s perception that these actions were in retaliation to the filing of her human rights complaint is reasonable.\n[59] The Respondent\u2019s explanation for Dr. Blackstock\u2019s exclusion is grounded in the fact that it is general practice for the Respondent to put together comprehensive briefing packages in preparation for meetings with First Nation groups, particularly when meeting with an individual of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s prominence. With respect, the Tribunal does not find this explanation plausible. While obtaining prior briefings may have been the Respondent\u2019s general practice in organizing meetings of this kind, this practice was not applied to the other individuals present. The list of attendees was initially composed of 5 individuals and yet 10 to 14 were able to enter the meeting room. Most of these individuals had not been identified ahead of time. Mr. McArthur also acknowledged that he did not personally know any of the Chiefs or other individuals present at this meeting and, despite this, all of them with the exception of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s were allowed to attend.\n[60] Dr. Blackstock\u2019s expertise in the field of child welfare is well established and the Tribunal accepts the explanation that the basis for her attendance at the meeting was to provide technical advice to the Chiefs. Both Dr. Blackstock\u2019s and Grand Chief Phillips communicated this purpose clearly to Mr. McArthur, to no avail. Mr. McArthur also acknowledged that he was aware of the Complaint and did not deny that in excluding her, he was concerned that he might end up in a discussion about the Complaint (see StenoTran Services Inc.\u2019s transcript of July 17, 2013, vol. 15, at p. 78, lines 9-13). This admission supports the conclusion that the Complaint formed the basis for her exclusion and in the Tribunal\u2019s view, constitutes a retaliatory act. Moreover, Mr. McArthur\u2019s offer to meet with Dr. Blackstock\u2019s at a later date was unhelpful and rendered moot by the fact that the parties to the meeting were able to resolve the issues at hand. Since Dr. Blackstock\u2019s aim in attending the meeting was to assist the Chiefs, there was no reason for her to request a subsequent meeting with Mr. McArthur.\n[61] On the issue of the presence of the Commissionaire who was standing guard as Dr. Blackstock sat in the waiting area, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did provide a reasonable explanation for this aspect of the incidents which took place that day. The Tribunal heard compelling evidence describing the origins of the security incident which resulted in the presence of the Commissionaire. While Dr. Blackstock\u2019s perception of intimidation and feelings of shame were understandable under these circumstances, it appears that this particular aspect of the incident was due to a misunderstanding. However, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s previous finding that the Respondent has not provided a reasonable explanation for her exclusion from the meeting, this finding has no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the Respondent has retaliated against the Complainant.\nC. Monitoring of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Public Appearances\n[62] Dr. Blackstock\u2019s obtained a number of documents, pursuant to her requests under the Privacy Act, which indicate that following the filing of the Complaint, the Respondent was monitoring her professional activities. According to the evidence, government officials reported back on the presentations that she delivered at the New Brunswick Child and Family Services Symposium in the Fall of 2009, at an international working group in March 2010 in North Vancouver whose aim was to prepare a report for the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), as well as a presentation she delivered at the July 27-29, 2010 National Conference in Alice Springs, Australia. Dr. Blackstock\u2019s November 23, 2009 interview with the CBC was also transcribed and circulated within AANDC. It is alleged that some documents even highlighted her absence at an event. Dr. Blackstock stated that she found this surveillance very disturbing.\n[63] These allegations were part of the basis for Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Complaint to the Privacy Commissioner on March 6, 2012. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) conducted an investigation into these events and released its report of findings on May 28, 2013. The report concluded that no breach of privacy had occurred.\n(i) Parties\u2019 Positions\n[64] The Complainant argues that the close and proactive monitoring of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s appearances, speeches and interviews by the Respondent constitutes retaliation for filing the Complaint, particularly given that there is no evidence that such type of monitoring of Dr. Blackstock occurred prior to the filing of the Complaint. The Complainant submits that the Respondent\u2019s only witness, called to explain the many reports of monitoring, was present at solely one of the events in question and that his testimony was unhelpful. In the absence of further evidence explaining the purpose of the monitoring, the Tribunal should draw an adverse inference from this behaviour. The Complainant notes that the Complaint was filed on behalf of First Nations children and not Dr. Blackstock personally. In light of this, it is difficult to understand the relevance of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal public appearances to the litigation and, as such, it was reasonable for Dr. Blackstock to perceive this scrutiny as retaliation for filing the Complaint.\n[65] The Respondent submits that reporting on Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public speaking engagements, particularly when they pertain to issues relating to child welfare, the work undertaken by the Caring Society and the Complaint, does not constitute retaliatory conduct. It is to be expected that these activities of public advocacy would interest the Respondent, in light of its related operations and programs, as well as the ongoing litigation. The Respondent did not retaliate against Dr. Blackstock and is of the view that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s perception that this was unwelcomed scrutiny is unreasonable.\n(ii) Analysis\n[66] While the Complainant argues that Dr. Blackstock was inappropriately singled out by the Respondent in these monitoring activities, a review of the evidence suggests otherwise. Many of the documents entered into evidence consist of summaries prepared by AANDC officials who attended conferences where Dr. Blackstock was speaking. These summaries cover Dr. Blackstock\u2019s presentation but also cover the presentations of other panelists. For example, at a child welfare workshop during the AFN Special Chiefs Assembly in 2011, an AANDC official produced a summary of those who were presenting. The summary detailed the presentation of Dr. Blackstock, but also that of McGill professor Vandna Sinha as well as Jonathon Thompson of the AFN, also a co-complainant in the present matter. The evidence indicates that AANDC employees attended these conferences and prepared these summaries with the aim of formulating media lines and Questions and Answers to respond to questions from the press.\n[67] Dr. Blackstock recognized that, prior to filing the Complaint, she had a close relationship with the Respondent. In addition to working together on the Wen:De reports, Dr. Blackstock and the Respondent appeared at conferences of this kind together. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is not surprising that the Respondent would continue to attend these conferences following the filing of the Complaint and nothing indicates that it did so with the sole purpose of monitoring her in retaliation for her filing of the Complaint.\n[68] During many of her public appearances at conferences, on the radio and on television, Dr. Blackstock discussed the Complaint and Tribunal proceedings as well as her views on issues relating to the alleged inequality of services for First Nations and their underfunding. The evidence supports that this aspect was of particular interest for the Respondent. For example, in internally distributing a transcript of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s November 23, 2009 CBC interview, AANDC officials highlight that the radio segment begins with a discussion of the Tribunal and the recent adjournment of the hearing (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 14).\n[69] In March 2010, Dr. Blackstock presented at an international working group which was to prepare a report for the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. An AANDC official attended the conferences and communicated a summary of her presentation and paper to other AANDC officials. The summary highlights Dr. Blackstock\u2019s statements on the Complaint and her call on the UN to appoint a Special Observer to follow the Tribunal proceedings. In the email chain discussing Dr. Blackstock\u2019s presentation, one AANDC official asks: \u201c[s]eparate from what we might say later at the UN permanent Forum, do we have coms lines addressing her presentation if it gets some coverage ?\u201d (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 14, email chain entitled \u201c(11\/4\/2010) Keith Smith-Rep. : Re: Cindy Blackstock Presentation\u201d, at p. 1).\n[70] In exercizing this right to freedom of speech, Dr. Blackstock invited a significant amount of media and public attention. The \u201cI am a Witness\u201d campaign, for example, has thousands of subscribers. Throughout these frequent public appearances and statements, Dr. Blackstock openly criticised the Respondent for its actions and position with regard to the Complaint, placing the Respondent in a position where it was asked to explain and defend some of its actions and decisions. On one occasion, for example, a radio station called the Respondent in preparation for an interview with Dr. Blackstock scheduled for the following day, in order to obtain comments from the Minister on the Complaint. The evidence indicates that the Respondent\u2019s interest in Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public appearances is often related to its desire to be aware of these statements and allegations so as to be in a position to respond where necessary.\n[71] The Tribunal notes that some of the emails between government officials did refer to Dr. Blackstock in an unprofessional manner. There is, however, no indication that in having its representatives attend these events, the Respondent was attempting to intimidate the Complainant. All of the events that were monitored were public appearances. While Dr. Blackstock states that she found the surveillance disturbing, she testified that she only became aware of it as a result of her requests under the Privacy Act. This fact pattern differs from the one in the Cassidy case, for example, where Ms. Cassidy saw the Respondent staring at her and perceived this behaviour as intimidation, in retaliation for the filing of her human rights complaint against him (see Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation & Raj Thambirajah, 2012 CHRT 29).\n[72] Having said this, the filing of the Complaint appears to have been a factor behind the Respondent\u2019s actions in this regard. In fact, the Respondent does not dispute that the Complaint was one of the reasons behind its monitoring of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public appearances. However, the Respondent has stated that it took these actions in preparation for the present litigation. In publicly discussing the Complaint and these proceedings, Dr. Blackstock opened the door for the Respondent to keep track of her allegations so as to be in a position to defend itself before the Tribunal. The right to a defence is a fundamental common law principle, pursuant to which a party has the ability to gather information that may be helpful to its case. While this right is limited by procedural fairness and by the other parties\u2019 competing right to privacy, neither has been infringed in the present case. In light of the aforementioned, the Tribunal finds that in taking these actions, the Respondent was not retaliating against Dr. Blackstock or the Complainant.\nD. Monitoring of Facebook Pages\n[73] Dr. Blackstock\u2019s requests under the Privacy Act also revealed that subsequent to the filing of the Complaint, the Respondent had monitored three Facebook pages: Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page, the Caring Society\u2019s Facebook page and the \u201cI am a Witness\u201d Campaign Facebook page, which were all administered by Dr. Blackstock. The monitoring was done by Ms. Natalia Strelkova, a paralegal with the Department of Justice litigation team assigned to this file, at the instruction of senior counsel. According to Ms. Strelkova\u2019s testimony, she received instructions to monitor the pages and report if Dr. Blackstock posted anything pertaining to the ongoing litigation. As access to the Facebook website was restricted by the governmental Internet filtering system, Ms. Strelkova made a Website Access Request, with the approval of her immediate supervisor, to the IT department to obtain access to the website. She obtained the necessary authorization on or around February 20, 2010 for the remainder of the calendar year, ending on December 31, 2010. She did not ask for an extension.\n[74] Both the Caring Society\u2019s and the \u201cI am a Witness\u201d Campaign\u2019s Facebook pages are public pages and were readily accessible during this time by Ms. Strelkova. The evidence revealed that from May 2010 until July 2011, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page was also publicly available due to the fact that Facebook had reset its privacy settings. Ms. Strelkova monitored all three sites, through her own personal Facebook account, checking them a few times a week to see if there were any new posts. She reported her findings by periodically sending screenshots of the pages to her client, AANDC, and to the client\u2019s legal team. She never received feedback from these reports. Ms. Strelkova\u2019s focus in reviewing these Facebook pages was on any posts relating to the litigation and she testified that she tried to skim over any information of a personal nature. However, despite her efforts in this regard, the evidence revealed that a few of the screen shots she captured did contain information of a personal nature. She monitored the websites until she left her position in August 2011.\n[75] These allegations were also the subject of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s March 6, 2012 complaint to the Privacy Commissioner, who concluded that the allegations were well-founded, insofar as the respondents, AANDC and the Department of Justice Canada, did \u201ccollect select sets of personal information, unrelated to their ordinary operating activities, in the course of monitoring social media related to the complainant.\u201d The report also noted that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner \u201cdid not however find sufficient evidence to support the allegation that those records were widely distributed to a vast number of personnel within both departments\u201d (see Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Report of Findings, dated May 28, 2013, at para. 82). The report concluded with a series of recommendations and states that the respondents accepted them in full.\n(i) Parties\u2019 Positions\n[76] Along the same lines as the surreptitious monitoring of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public appearances, the Complainant argues that the Respondent\u2019s access to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page, as conceded by the Respondent during the hearing, was not relevant to the Complaint and constitutes retaliation. The evidence suggests that the Respondent was accessing the Facebook page to try to find adverse personal information about Dr. Blackstock to discredit her, an approach which is further confirmed by the Respondent counsel deeply troubling line of questioning to Dr. Blackstock in the jurisdiction motion when she was asked about her religion and whether she had been in care as a minor. The Complainant argues that the Respondent\u2019s attitude and approach in this regard is retaliatory and that Dr. Blackstock rightfully felt targeted by these actions.\n[77] The Respondent acknowledged that it monitored Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page during the period of February 2010 until approximately August 2011, when it was accessible to the public, as well as the Caring Society\u2019s and the \u201cI am a Witness\u201d Facebook pages. The Respondent argues that the monitoring was not done in a surreptitious manner and was done as part of its preparation for the litigation before the Tribunal. While the Respondent was only interested in information relating to the human rights Complaint, unrelated pieces of personal information were incidentally collected. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s report took note of this and issued recommendations to the Respondent, which the Respondent accepted. The Respondent submits that it is entirely appropriate for parties that are engaged in litigation to seek information about each other, including motivation for pursuing the litigation. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s report (OPC report) acknowledged this and noted that \u201ccourts have held that a party initiating litigation provides implied consent to a certain amount of probing of their private affairs for the proper determination of the litigation\u201d (see Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Report of Findings, dated May 28, 2013, at para. 76). The Respondent submits that the evidence fails to show any intent to retaliate on the part of the Respondent and that the Complainant\u2019s perception in this regard is not reasonable in light of the circumstances of the litigation.\n[78] With regard to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s assertion that the Respondent asked \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d questions during cross-examination on a jurisdiction motion, the Respondent submits that Dr. Blackstock chose to be affirmed for her cross-examination on an affidavit and that the line of questioning sought to ascertain that she was committed to telling the truth. The Respondent also notes that counsel for the Complainant raised no objection at that time.\n[79] The Commission is of the view that these allegations raise a novel question, namely whether the routine online surveillance of the personal life of an individual who has filed a human rights complaint, or is the alleged victim for the purposes of litigation, could constitute retaliation pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act. It has therefore chosen to limit its final written and oral arguments to this issue, examining whether the Complainant has established discrimination on a prima facie case in this regard and, if so, if the Respondent has provided a reasonable explanation or justification for its actions.\n[80] The Commission notes that the evidence revealed that the Respondent sought to monitor Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Facebook page for reasons directly linked to the Complaint. Ms. Strelkova stated that her mandate was to monitor what was being communicated on the Facebook page so as to identify information relevant for the purposes of cross-examination. The evidence also revealed that some of the information collected was incidental personal information, unrelated to the issues of the case and the Respondent\u2019s stated purpose for accessing the Facebook page.\n[81] The Commission submits that there is no question that in monitoring Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page and subjecting no other witness or complainant to such surveillance, the Respondent singled her out, due to her active role in the Complaint. Having said this, the monitoring began after the Complaint was referred to the Tribunal and the litigation had begun. The litigation and Dr. Blackstock\u2019s role had been highly publicised and the information collected was gathered during a time when it was publicly accessible, due to Dr. Blackstock security settings. In the Commission\u2019s view, litigants must unfortunately frequently face a reduced expectation of privacy in litigation that is so public in nature. While the systematic collection of information from Dr. Blackstock page is problematic due to the personal information that was also incidentally gathered, the Commission argues that it does not, in the context of this case, constitute a prima facie case of retaliation pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act.\n[82] However, the Commission notes that while the Respondent\u2019s actions may not have constituted retaliation or harassment, their intrusive nature was unnecessary and can reasonably be seen to have a potentially chilling effect on this litigation.\n(ii) Analysis\n[83] During the hearing, Dr. Blackstock and her counsel drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to a number of examples in the documentary evidence, where the Respondent captured information of a personal nature on Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Facebook page as part of its screen shots. These examples included the comments and compliments of a teacher, who expressed to Dr. Blackstock her interest and desire to support her in her initiatives. They also included the statements of a 12-year-old child, expressing his support, as well as the comments of friends of Dr. Blackstock complimenting her on her baking abilities, in response to a post by Dr. Blackstock announcing that cookies would be distributed at the hearing.\n[84] At that time that these screen shots were captured, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Facebook privacy settings were low, rendering them visible to the public. She later increased her settings to prevent the public from accessing her personal Facebook page. While, at first glance, the capturing of these personal comments appears problematic, a closer review of this evidence reveals that in all of the 44 screen shots of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal Facebook page, only the one which captured the teacher\u2019s comments on Dr. Blackstock\u2019s work is devoid of any other post or comment relating to the Complaint before the Tribunal. All 43 other screen shots capture posts containing some sort of reference or discussion of the Tribunal proceedings.\n[85] The post relating to the cookies, for example, was part of a broader discussion where Dr. Blackstock advertised her \u201chaveaheartcampaign\u201d, which coincided with Valentine\u2019s Day and the Federal Court hearing of the Complainant\u2019s judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s March 14, 2011 decision to dismiss the Complaint. In this post, Dr. Blackstock urged her supporters to send Valentine letters to their MPs, as well as to the Minister. The post ends with her mention, once again, of the Valentine\u2019s Day cookies.\n[86] In another Facebook post, Dr. Blackstock posted hearing transcripts from the cross-examination of Odette Johnston, one of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, who was cross-examined on her affidavit which supported the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the Complaint. The transcripts were not sealed, but had not yet been made accessible to the public. Dr. Blackstock\u2019s decision to post them led the Respondent to write to the Tribunal to bring this to the Tribunal\u2019s attention. The Tribunal ultimately sent a letter to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s counsel, indicating that the posting of the transcript was inappropriate.\n[87] On a separate occasion, Dr. Blackstock also posted a CBC radio transcript where she discussed the Complaint, the government\u2019s actions in this regard, as well as the recent determinations of the Tribunal\u2019s former Chairs Sinclair and Chotalia in this matter. Dr. Blackstock mentioned that while Chair Sinclair had announced an imminent start to the hearing, the newly appointed Chair Chotalia had cancelled the hearing dates. Dr. Blackstock expressed her concern with the canceling of the hearing dates. Further evidence demonstrates that the Respondent chose to respond to these statements and clarify that it had not requested that the Tribunal cancel the hearing dates.\n[88] In summary, the evidence as a whole demonstrates that the vast majority of the Facebook pages captured by Ms. Strelkova contained information about the Tribunal, the Federal Court proceedings and\/or allegations made against the Respondent with regard to the Complaint. This information was publicly available on social media and, on at least one occasion, gave the public access to information that was not yet publicly available.\n[89] The evidence supports the Respondent\u2019s position that its interest in Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Facebook posts is related to these comments in particular. As was the case in the monitoring of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public appearances, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent has the right, in preparing for litigation, to be aware of a Complainant\u2019s public statements so as to prepare its defence.\n[90] Ms. Strelkova explained she is not a lawyer and that she took screenshots of information that she believed was relevant. There is no question that the capturing of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal information was inappropriate. The Privacy Commissioner concluded as much and the Respondent accepted responsibility in this regard. The Tribunal is not, however, examining these allegations in light of the Privacy Act but rather in light of the CHRA. The question before us is whether the Respondent\u2019s actions in this regard amount to retaliation contrary to section 14.1 of the CHRA. In view of the context of the Facebook monitoring discussed above, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that they do not.\nE. Access to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Indian Registration Record\n[91] In the period from 2010 to 2011, Dr. Blackstock filed three separate Privacy Act requests with the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate of AANDC. The first was filed on October 19, 2010 and requested \u201c[a]ny document or communication with personal information regarding Cindy Blackstock a.k.a. Cynthia Blackstock)\u2026 produced between 2005 to present\u201d (the first request). The second was filed on June 22, 2011 and requested \u201c[a]ny information relating to Cindy Blackstock also known as Cynthia Blackstock or Dr. Blackstock dated, or likely to be dated, from June 9, 2010 to June 22, 2011\u201d (the second request). The third request was filed on December 12, 2011 and requested \u201c[a]ny information on {Cindy Blackstock} also known as (aka) {Cynthia Blackstock} aka {Dr. Blackstock} dated, or likely to be dated, from July 9, 2011 to December 12, 2011\u201d (the third request).\n[92] Upon receipt of these requests, the ATIP Directorate of AANDC has a 30-day statutory period within which it must process the request. With the exception of the first request where the Department availed itself of the time extension permitted pursuant to subsection 15(a) of the Privacy Act, it appears that Dr. Blackstock received a response to her requests, with enclosures, within this 30-day timeframe.\n[93] As part of the package of records contained in these enclosures, Dr. Blackstock received two copies of her Registered Indian Record (the Record) in the Indian Registry System (IRS). The IRS is the official system of record for the identification of all Status Indians in Canada. The Record contained Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal information, as well as the personal information of some of her family members. The copies indicated that the Record had been accessed on November 4, 2010, as well as on November 17, 2011.\n[94] In light of the fact that Dr. Blackstock had not made any personal inquiries regarding her Indian Status or her Record in the IRS since 2008, she could not understand why, or by whom, the Record had been accessed on those dates. She testified that there were no active Privacy Act requests when her Record was pulled on November 17, 2011. She also found that, although she had made a number of other requests under the Privacy Act, the fact that the Record did not appear in every request was unusual.\n[95] In an interview on the CBC program \u201cThe Current\u201d, on the morning of November 17, 2011, Dr. Blackstock publicly expressed her concern regarding what appeared to her to be the inappropriate access of her Indian Status information:\nOne of the things that concerned me is, in the documents they have pulled my status application. And for your listeners, they may not know that on the application it not only has your name, your date of birth, it also has your parents and your sisters and brothers. And they had pulled that information on two occasions and I have absolutely no idea why they would have pulled that. Because I certainly had not asked them to do it, nor had I ever made any inquiries about my status during that timeframe.\n[96] Dr. Blackstock\u2019s interview and the allegations therein contained came to the attention of Ms. Monica Fuijkschot, who at the time was the Director of the ATIP Directorate at AANDC. Ms. Fuijkschot testified that what she understood from these allegations was that Dr. Blackstock was questioning the operational process of the Office of the Indian Registrar and its supply of information under the Privacy Act. Ms. Fuijkschot recognized that Dr. Blackstock had not filed a formal complaint into this matter, despite the fact that this recourse was made available to her in the letters which responded to her Privacy Act requests and enclosed the copies of her Record. Nevertheless, Ms. Fuijkschot felt that it was her responsibility to ensure that the personal information that was collected and under the control of the Directorate under the Privacy Act was properly protected by the institution. In light of the seriousness of these allegations, Ms. Fuijkschot decided to conduct an internal review of the matter so as to determine if improper disclosure had occurred and, if so, to put into place a mitigation strategy to ensure that it does not happen again.\n[97] On November 17, 2011, following the CBC interview, Ms. Fuijkschot accessed Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record as part of this investigation. While there was no way for her to track who had accessed the record in the system, the investigation indicated that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record had been accessed for the purposes of responding to her first request under the Privacy Act in which she sought \u201c[a]ny document or communication with personal information regarding Cindy Blackstock a.k.a. Cynthia Blackstock)\u2026 produced between 2005 to present.\u201d Ms. Fuijkschot concluded, as a result, that there had been no breach of the Privacy Act. Ms. Fuijkschot kept the file containing the results of her internal review locked in her office.\n[98] On November 22, 2011, the Honourable John Duncan, PC, MP, upon having been briefed by the Deputy Minister of AANDC, sent a letter to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, bringing to her attention the fact that Dr. Blackstock had publicly claimed that her Indian Registration file was improperly accessed on two occasions. The letter noted that AANDC did not believe that a breach had occurred, but nonetheless wished to bring the matter to the Commissioner\u2019s attention, inviting her to conduct her own investigation. The letter enclosed a package of documents, relating to the releases under the Privacy Act, as well as recent media reports.\n[99] The Assistant Privacy Commissioner of Canada replied, in a letter dated December 5, 2011, returning the package of documents, stating that they could not receive them without the consent of the individual involved. The letter highlighted the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s ability to initiate a complaint, should she determine that there are reasonable grounds to investigate whether a government institution has contravened a provision of the Privacy Act, and expressed that they \u201c[w]ere in the process of examining the possibility of initiating an investigation on the basis of publicly available information and in accordance with established procedures and our authorities under the Act.\u201d\n[100] Dr. Blackstock filed a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on March 6, 2012. In addition to alleging that the Respondent had contravened to sections 7 and 8 of the Privacy Act in its monitoring of her public speaking engagements, as well as by accessing and monitoring her social media feeds, in particular her personal Facebook page, Dr. Blackstock alleged that \u201c[o]fficials from AANDC \u2018repeatedly accessed her Indian status records from the Government of Canada\u2019s Indian status registration database, which contained not only her personal information but also that of a number of family members, where no issues relating to her Indian status existed\u2019\u201d (see summary of complaint in OPC report found at Exhibit R-12, Tab 48, para. 85).\n[101] The Office of the Privacy Commissioner conducted an investigation into these events and, in its report, concluded that the allegations relating to the inappropriate access of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Registered Indian Record were not well-founded (see OPC report at para. 106).\n(i) Parties\u2019 Positions\n[102] The Complainant concedes that, ultimately, there was insufficient evidence to support its fear that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Indian Registration Records were being accessed in an attempt to find out about her personal life for information to use against her. However, the Complainant argues that the evidence of Ms. Fuijkschot demonstrates that she treated Dr. Blackstock differently because she had filed a human rights complaint. Ms. Fuijkschot failed to document her review, did not contact Dr. Blackstock and, unsolicited, sent her personal information to the Privacy Commissioner without authority or Dr. Blackstock\u2019s lawful consent. The Complainant recognizes that while this allegation may not meet the test for retaliation under Virk, it does meet the test for retaliation set out in the Wong and Bressette cases.\n[103] The Respondent submits that the evidence fails to support Dr. Blackstock\u2019s allegation that her Record was inappropriately accessed by AANDC officials. As demonstrated by the evidence, there are rigorous security protocols which govern access to the IRS. Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record was provided to her on two occasions, pursuant to her own Privacy Act requests. There was no evidence which would support the contention that AANDC officials otherwise accessed the Record for any other reason. The investigation initiated by Ms. Fuijkschot following Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public allegations of misconduct in this regard was appropriate, valid and revealed no inappropriate accessing of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record. The Respondent submits that there is nothing that demonstrates an intention on the part of the Respondent to retaliate against the Complainant and that, when viewed objectively, the evidence as a whole does not support a finding of retaliation.\n(ii) Analysis\n[104] The administrative process which follows the filing of a request under the Privacy Act or Access to Information Act is a technical and methodical procedure. However, to better understand the events that transpired following the filing of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s requests, its examination is important. Mr. Kent-Daniel Glowinski, the current Director of the ATIP Directorate at AANDC, went over this process in his testimony before the Tribunal.\n[105] According to this evidence, once a request under the Privacy Act or the Access to Information Act is received by the Department, it goes through the following steps:\n(a) The request is received by the Triage and Intake Group, the administrative arm of the operations unit of the ATIP Directorate, in charge of the reception of documents. There it is date-stamped, marking the start of the statutory 30-day period which the Department possesses to provide a response to the request;\n(b) The intake team places a sheet on top of the request, called an intake tasking sheet. The sheet lists a number of acronyms, referring to various Offices of Primary Interest (OPI). An OPI refers to an area within the Department that has the greatest interest and likelihood to have the requested records within the scope of the request;\n(c) In light of the fact that the public sometimes misuses the form, all requests are sent to the Director for review, so that he or she may determine if the request is appropriately categorized as a privacy request or an access to information request. In conducting this review, based on the wording of the request, the Director determines to which OPI or OPIs the request should be tasked with fulfilling the request;\n(d) Once the Director has made this determination, triage team sends the request with the completed tasking sheet to the ATIP representatives in the different OPIs. These representatives will then consult with the specific Program Areas within those OPIs to obtain the requested records. It is up to the Program Areas themselves to conduct due diligence to find the records.\n(e) Sometimes a request can be sent back to the ATIP Directorate for clarification. In these cases, the request may sometimes go back to the requestor to seek a specific date range or to clarify their search.\n(f) Once the Program Area has obtained the records and sent them to the OPI, the OPI assesses the content of the records and determines if they contain, for example, third-party information or information that may be subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege. The OPI then fills out an impact statement, containing its recommendations regarding the records and the information they contain, and sends it back to the ATIP Directorate.\n(g) All the records found come together from the different Program Areas and OPIs to the ATIP Directorate, where they are scanned into an ATIP software called Redaction. The software assembles the different files into one cohesive chunk of records and they are given a naming convention. Requests under the Privacy Act start with a \u201cP\u201d, whereas requests under the Access to Information Act start with a \u201cA\u201d. This is followed by the year and a consecutive number. This can look something like \u201cA-2013-0001\u201d.\n(h) Once the records have been entered into the software, the ATIP analyst who is assigned with responding to the request goes through the records and determines if any consultations should occur with third parties. If the analyst determines that this is the case, the Directorate will avail itself of a time extension. If no consultations are necessary, the analyst reviews the file to determine whether there are any applicable exemptions or exclusions.\n(i) Once this process is completed, the records are assembled and sent to the requester.\n[106] Mr. Glowinski explained that, since one of the Department\u2019s main business lines is to deal with Registered Indian Records (the Records) and registration, where an individual makes a Privacy Act request to the AANDC ATIP Directorate seeking information about himself or herself, as was the case with Dr. Blackstock\u2019s requests, one of the logical OPIs is the Resolutions and Individual Affairs (RIA) sector. The RIA is the sector which, under the purview of the Office of the Indian Registrar, holds the IRS and the Records. According to Mr. Glowinski, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s first request would have been referred there.\n[107] Ms. McLenachan, a Protest, Appeals and Litigation Officer in the Office of the Indian Registrar, provided testimony which helped to elucidate the manner in which the IRS and the Records are accessed. According to her evidence, the IRS access is limited to officers of AANDC, specifically to those working in the Office of the Indian Registrar, the AANDC regional staff working in the Indian Registration and Band Lists areas, the Indian Registry Administrators (IRAs) which are employees of the Band and Tribunal Councils, as well as to some departments with which AANDC has a Memorandum of Understanding.\n[108] In order to access the IRS, an individual must complete a form entitled \u201cAccess to the Indian Registry System and its information.\u201d In filling out this form, the individual accepts that he or she can only use the information for the purpose for which it is needed and recognizes that it is protected under the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. The individual\u2019s immediate supervisor will then sign the form, confirming the request for access.\n[109] In the case of the IRAs, the access form is sent to the staff of the AANDC regional office, who will ensure that the Band office has proper security measures in place before forwarding the request to the information specialist at AANDC headquarters who possesses the delegated authority, on behalf of the Indian Registrar, to authorize the access.\n[110] In all cases, the level of access provided is dependant upon the role that the individual occupies. There are 40 levels of access, ranging from simple paper access to various levels of access to the electronic IRS. Certain levels allow a read-only ability, while others allow a partial read and write access allowing for the adding of amendments, or a full read and write access. Access can also be restricted to certain Records. The IRA of a Tribal Council, for example, will only be granted access to the IRS records relating to the Bands that he or she administers.\n[111] Ms. McLenachan testified that approximately 600 people currently have access to the IRS.\n[112] Ms. McLenachan also described the access to the IRS in response to an individual\u2019s Privacy Act request, such as the requests made by Dr. Blackstock. Once a request is transmitted to the Office of the Indian Registrar by the ATIP Directorate, it is assigned to an officer with the appropriate level and type of access who will conduct a search to locate the records which correspond to the request. The officer then makes copies of the documentation, including, if applicable, the IRS Record of the requestor. A risk-analysis of the documents is completed and, if the officer determines that the file should be released, it is transmitted back to the ATIP Directorate or to the individual or party who made the request. In the case of a request emanating from the ATIP Directorate, its office will then make the final determination as to what should or should not be released to the requestor.\n[113] Combined with the testimony of Ms. Fuijkschot, this evidence helps to clarify the process which followed Dr. Blackstock\u2019s requests under the Privacy Act. Ms. McLenachan stated that the IRS did not maintain a log of the individuals who have accessed the Records. This evidence is consistent with Ms. Fuijkschot\u2019s conclusions following her internal review. Despite this, the evidence provided by these witnesses, as well as by Mr. Glowinski, was that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record was accessed on November 4, 2010 in response to her first Privacy Act request, as well as on November 17, 2011, by Ms. Fuijkschot as part of her internal review. Ms. Fuijkschot\u2019s internal review file, containing the Indian Registration Record, was subject to requests under the Privacy Act and was also provided to Dr. Blackstock following her December 12, 2011 Privacy Act request. The Tribunal found the evidence of all three of these witnesses to be credible.\n[114] While Dr. Blackstock indicated that she suspected that her records were inappropriately accessed, suggesting that the Respondent could have attempted to try and discredit her in this manner, none of the evidence presented supports this claim. Access to the IRS is restricted and only those with the requisite level of authorization are able to access the Records. Ms. McLenachan was asked if the Litigation Management Resolution Branch of AANDC had made a request under the Privacy Act to access IRS information relating to the present Complaint. She replied that it had not.\n[115] The Respondent also addressed Dr. Blackstock\u2019s confusion surrounding her receipt of copies of her Record in response to only some, but not all of her requests under the Privacy Act. Ms. Fuijkschot explained that when the Registry receives more than one application from an individual, in processing the second application, they review the documents provided in the course of the first application and avoid duplications.\n[116] The Complainant has argued that Ms. Fuijkschot\u2019s internal review and her decision not to communicate with Dr. Blackstock and to forward Dr. Blackstock\u2019s personal information to the Privacy Commissioner unlawfully, demonstrates that she treated Dr. Blackstock differently because she had filed a human rights complaint.\n[117] When asked why she had not communicated these findings directly to Dr. Blackstock, Ms. Fuijkschot explained that in going directly to the media without indicating her concerns to their office via the formal complaints process, Dr. Blackstock gave them a clear indication that she did not want to work with them. Combined with the ongoing litigation before the Tribunal, Ms. Fuijkschot felt that she had to approach the matter carefully so as to not cause or provoke any situation that could be misconstrued. Moreover, once the matter of the alleged privacy breach was referred to the Privacy Commissioner, the case was no longer in her control and the institution may no longer contact the requester.\n[118] The Tribunal need not determine the legitimacy of this internal review or the lawfulness of her decision to forward the information she obtained as a result to the Privacy Commissioner. The Tribunal must simply determine whether or not Ms. Fuijkschot\u2019s actions in this regard amount to retaliation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Ms. Fuijkschot\u2019s desire to determine whether or not her office was responsible for the alleged inappropriate access of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record is not grounded in the Complaint, but rather in Dr. Blackstock\u2019s public allegations. Moreover, the Tribunal does not view these actions as constituting a form of adverse differentiation. The internal review was documented and revealed that there had been a misunderstanding on the part of Dr. Blackstock as no breach of security had occurred. The Complainant\u2019s allegation that this amounts to retaliatory conduct is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, unsupported by the evidence.\n[119] In conclusion, given the general operational process and the manner in which Dr. Blackstock\u2019s file was accessed, the Tribunal concludes that the explanation provided by the Respondent is reasonable. The Tribunal therefore finds that there was no retaliation with regard to the access of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s Record.\n[120] The Tribunal notes that it appears from the evidence that Dr. Blackstock, on November 17, 2011, was not in a position to allege that \u201cthey had pulled that information on two occasions.\u201d At the time of her interview with CBC, it appears that her Record had only been accessed once on November 4, 2011 and that this was done pursuant to her request under the Privacy Act so as to send her a copy. Only later could she have learned that her Record was accessed a second time on November 11, 2011, the same day as her interview, but only once the interview (which was in the morning) was over. The Tribunal has not been able to reconcile this evidentiary discrepency. However, since none of the above conclusions hinge on this allegation, the Tribunal has simply not awarded any weight to this evidence.\nIV. Decision and Remedy\n[121] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Complaint is substantiated on the basis of the Respondent\u2019s retaliatory actions relating to the exclusion of Dr. Blackstock from the Chiefs of Ontario Meeting at the Minister\u2019s Office.\n[122] Complainant counsel argues that the facts of the present case support that the Tribunal award, pursuant to section 53(2) and 53(3) of the Act, the statutory maximum of $20 000 for pain and suffering, as well as for wilful and reckless conduct. The Tribunal\u2019s case law when it comes to awarding amounts of monetary damages is not consistent, but the cases where a Tribunal member has chosen to award the statutory maximum of $20 000 reveal a trend which suggests that such awards are reserved for the very worst cases (see Premakumar v. Air Canada, (2002) 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63; and Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan, [1992] 2 F.C. 401. (F.C.A.)). For example, the Tribunal has awarded maximum compensation under section 53(3) in the following cases: Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20, aff\u2019d 2013 FC 113, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 110; Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2010 CHRT 23, aff\u2019d 2013 FC 117, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 111; and Hicks v. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 20, aff\u2019d 2015 FC 599. Respondent counsel argues that the retaliation Complaint is part of the main human rights Complaint and, therefore, that awarding a separate sum in compensatory damages would be inappropriate and not within the Tribunal\u2019s statutory authority. Morevover, the Respondent contends that an award of damages on the retaliation Complaint would preclude any potential finding of damages on the main human rights Complaint.\n[123] As stated above, section 14.1 of the CHRA is a separate, specialized \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d and it calls for the consideration of a separate head of damages. (see Cassidy, at para. 196). See also, Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 2001 CanLII 8492 (CHRT) at para. 292; and, Gainer v. Export Development Canada, 2006 FC 814 (CanLII) at para. 36).\n[124] In the present case, Dr. Blackstock\u2019s feelings of shame and humiliation resulting from this public professional rejection, in front of the Chiefs of Ontario whom she was seeking to advise, are understandable and warrants some form of compensation. Moral pain and suffering is difficult to quantify. This being said, when evidence establishes pain and suffering, an attempt to compensate for it must be made (see Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10, at para. 115). The Tribunal finds that $10 000 constitutes a reasonable award for the prejudice Dr. Blackstock experienced.\n[125] As for the section 53(3) of the Act, there is no doubt that the Respondent\u2019s actions had a wilful and reckless nature. Dr. Blackstock was the only individual excluded from the meeting, which supports her contention that she was singled out. Not only did Mr. McArthur admit that he was aware of the Complaint, but he expressed that he was afraid that it would be discussed during the meeting if Dr. Blackstock was allowed to attend. His testimony revealed a desire to exclude her because she had filed a human rights complaint and a disregard for the rights protected in the Act. These are precisely the kinds of circumstances which section 14.1 of the Act seeks to deter. In the Panel\u2019s view, this conduct also warrants a $10 000 award.\n[126] For these reasons, the Tribunal orders the following:\n(a) Pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent compensate the Complainant for $10 000 for pain and suffering.\n(b) Pursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent compensate the Complainant for $10 000 for its wilful and reckless conduct.\n[127] In the event of a finding of liability, the Tribunal has been requested by the Complainant to order the Respondent to participate, in consultation with the Commission, in a training program for its employees pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the Act. The Tribunal is obviously supportive of improving, on a continuous basis, the degree of human rights knowledge and sensitivity of individuals, be they employees or, management and supervisory personnel. In this case, the event that gave rise to the finding of retaliation was the exclusion by Mr. McArthur of Dr. Blackstock from a meeting that she was entitled to attend, on account of her filing of the Complaint. His actions, though clearly wrong, were not necessarily representative of what any other managers employed by the Respondent would have done under the circumstances. As such, the Tribunal does not feel that granting the request of the Commission is necessary.\n[128] The Complainant requested that the Tribunal issue an order directing the Minister of AANDC to issue a written and public apology to Dr. Blackstock and the Caring Society. However, in Canada (Attorney General) v. Stevenson, 2003 FCT 341, at paras. 27-35, the Federal Court found that the Act does not empower the Tribunal to make such an order. The Complainant\u2019s request for a public apology is therefore denied.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nEdward P.

Introduction\n[1] The Complainant, Karen McIlroy, has filed a motion challenging the end date of her Eligible Work period as determined by her former employer, Employment and Social Development Canada (\u201cESDC\u201d), formerly Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (\u201cHRSDC\u201d) and Social Development Canada (\u201cSDC\u201d), as part of the implementation of the Memorandum of Agreement of July 3, 2012 between Ruth Walden et al. and the Attorney General of Canada (\u201cMOA\u201d). For the reasons that follow, the motion is dismissed.\nII. Main Proceeding: Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada\n[2] The MOA is the result of human rights complaints filed by Ruth Walden and 416 other Complainants between 2004 and 2007, challenging the classification of Medical Adjudicators (\u201cMAs\u201d), a group made up predominantly of female nurses involved in the assessment\/adjudication of applications for Canada Pension Plan (\u201cCPP\u201d) disability benefits, when compared to Medical Advisors, a group made up predominantly of male doctors working alongside the MAs. The Complainants alleged that, as a result of their classification, Medical Advisors received better compensation, benefits, training, professional recognition and opportunities for advancement than MAs despite the fact that both groups performed similar work in the assessment\/adjudication of CPP disability benefit applications.\n[3] In a decision dated December 13, 2007 (Walden et al. v. Attorney General, 2007 CHRT 56 (\u201cLiability Decision\u201d)), the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) found that while there were some differences in the day-to-day responsibilities of Medical Advisors and MAs, the \u201ccore function\u201d of each position was the same and both positions required the application of professional knowledge and expertise in determining applicants\u2019 eligibility for CPP disability benefits. The Tribunal concluded that the Government\u2019s refusal to recognize the professional nature of the work performed by MAs in a manner proportionate to the professional recognition awarded to the work of Medical Advisors amounted to adverse differentiation on the ground of sex and violated both sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d). This decision was upheld by the Federal Court on judicial review: Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490.\n[4] The Tribunal made a separate award on remedies in a decision dated May 25, 2009: Walden et al. v. Attorney General, 2009 CHRT 16 (\u201cRemedy Decision\u201d). In this decision, the Tribunal concluded that the creation of a new Nursing (NU) Sub-Group within the SH [Health Services] Occupational Group for the Medical Adjudication position would recognize suitably MAs as health care professionals, thereby acknowledging that they apply their comprehensive knowledge of the professional specialty of nursing to their work. The Tribunal found that this would be the most appropriate way to redress the discriminatory practice identified in the Liability Decision and ordered that work on the creation of the new NU Sub-Group commence within 60 days of the date of the decision. The Tribunal did not otherwise award any compensation for wage loss and ordered compensation for pain and suffering to two individuals only.\n[5] On judicial review of the Remedy Decision (see Walden v. Canada, 2010 FC 1135), the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions regarding the creation of the new Sub-Group, but set aside the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions vis-\u00e0-vis compensation for lost wages and pain and suffering. The Court remitted both of these matters back to a new panel of the Tribunal for redetermination. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld this decision: Attorney General v. Walden et al., 2011 FCA 202. I was assigned the matter as the new \u201cpanel\u201d by the Chair of the Tribunal in December of 2010.\n[6] Following these decisions, the Respondent created the MA NU Sub-Group as part of the Public Service Nursing Classification Standard. It is defined as: \u201cPositions responsible for determining the medical eligibility of applicants for a government program or for the provision of expert advice related to medical adjudication\u201d and includes two levels of Medical Adjudication nursing positions: the NU-EMA-01 which involves \u201cthe assessment of medical information for the purposes of determining the eligibility of applicants for a federal government program\u201d and the NU-EMA-02 which \u201caccommodates supervisory medical adjudication nursing positions or technical specialist and\/or expert positions in headquarters and\/or the Regions\u201d.\n[7] The parties also negotiated settlements on appropriate remedies to redress the discriminatory practice: first dealing with compensation for pain and suffering and expressed in an Order on consent dated October 26, 2011; then on July 3, 2012, concluding the MOA which sought to resolve all remaining issues, including lost wages\/benefits. It is the MOA that forms the subject matter of this motion.\n[8] The MOA awards $16,500 per year to individuals who are determined to have performed \u201cEligible Work\u201d during the \u201cEligibility Period\u201d which spans from December 1, 1999 to September 30, 2011. The MOA also provides for the payment of interest, other compensation for individuals who completed Eligible Work for periods prior to December 1, 1999, as well as additional compensation for pain and suffering as per s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA.\n[9] Eligible Work is defined under Section 1, \u201cDefinition of Terms\u201d of the MOA:\n\u201cEligible Work\u201d is defined as described in paragraph 4 of the Tribunal\u2019s order dated October 26, 2011, that is, the individual was primarily employed in the CPP Disability Program in Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) either conducting adjudications (i.e. assessing medical information for the purposes of determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits and, in doing so, was required to use knowledge associated with being a registered nurse) or providing expert advice to or directly supervising those who did conduct adjudications.\n[10] On July 31, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Consent Order implementing the terms of the MOA. The Tribunal retained full jurisdiction to deal with any dispute or controversy surrounding the meaning or interpretation of the MOA upon the application of any party, or individual who may have performed Eligible Work as defined in the MOA. The Tribunal initially retained this jurisdiction until June 30, 2014 but has since extended this date to March 31, 2015, and then on consent to June 30, 2015 with respect to the issue of gross\u2013up payments only.\nIII. Motion for Redetermination of Eligible Work\n[11] On August 21, 2014, the Complainant brought a motion challenging the end date of Eligible Work determined for her by the Respondent pursuant to the MOA. The Respondent has compensated the Complainant for the Eligible Work she performed as a MA between January 22, 1996 and September 4, 2006. This time period and compensation amount are not in dispute. The Complainant requests that the Tribunal make an Order to have the Respondent recognize her work activities as Eligible Work during the period of December 17, 2007 to September 30, 2011 (\u201cDisputed Period\u201d). The Complainant alleges that from December 17, 2007 until January 23, 2011 when she worked as a PM-05 Program Manager in the AA Division of the CPP Disability (\u201cCPPD\u201d) Directorate, as well as from January 24, 2011 until September 30, 2011 when she worked as a PM-06 Senior Policy Advisor in this Division, she was \u201cproviding expert advice to\u201d and\/or \u201cdirectly supervising those who did conduct adjudications\u201d as per the MOA Eligible Work definition.\n[12] The Respondent opposes this motion.\nIV. The CPP and Institutional Structure\n[13] In examining the Complainant\u2019s work during the Disputed Period, it is helpful to have a clear understanding of the role of the AA Division and how this role falls within the broader allocation of responsibilities with regard to the administration of the CPPD Program as a whole. For this reason, I have provided an overview of the CPP, and in particular its subset CPPD Program and explain how and by whom this program has been developed and delivered. This will provide important context to the MOA and to the role of the MAs which it seeks to compensate in the Walden human rights litigation.\nA. The CPP and CPPD\n[14] The CPP is a contributory, earnings-related social insurance program which seeks to ensure a measure of protection to a contributor and his or her family against the loss of income due to retirement, disability and death. It is a $37 billion program, the Government of Canada\u2019s biggest program.\n[15] The CPPD is a program within the CPP that is intended to provide protection against loss of earnings due to disability for eligible CPP contributors. CPPD benefits are paid to claimants with severe and prolonged physical and mental disabilities, who have made sufficient contributions to the CPP. The CPPD program provides $4 billion in benefits to over 330,000 applicants each year, making it the biggest disability benefits insurer by far in the country.\n[16] Eligibility for CPPD benefits is determined through a multi-stage process. Both the MAs and Medical Advisors have the primary responsibility and function of determining this eligibility. The Tribunal has previously summarized this process as follows (Liability Decision at para. 36): [1]\na) an individual makes an application for benefits;\nb) an initial determination is made about whether to grant the benefits on the basis of the eligibility criteria;\nc) if the application is denied, the applicant may apply for a reconsideration of the decision;\nd) if benefits are denied at the reconsideration stage, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Review Tribunal (RT) (formerly known as the Review Committee);\ne) if benefits are again denied at the RT stage, the applicant may apply for leave to appeal to the Pension Appeals Board (PAB);\nf) if the applicant is granted benefits at the RT stage, the Minister in charge of the CPP program may apply for leave to appeal the RT decision;\ng) both the applicant and the Minister may apply to the Federal Court of Appeal for judicial review of the PAB decision;\nh) at any stage of the process, an applicant may submit additional or new medical or non-medical information. The decision-maker at that particular stage considers the information in determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits.\n[17] It is worth mentioning that over ninety percent of all applications for CPP disability benefits are conclusively determined at the initial or reconsideration levels and that relatively few cases are appealed to the RT or PAB. Even fewer numbers of cases are the subject of applications for judicial review: Liability Decision at para. 37.\n[18] The CPP and the CPPD are currently administered by ESDC (HRSDC during the Disputed Period) as well as Service Canada (\u201cSC\u201d). ESDC is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. SC was created within HRSDC in 2005 to operate as a primary access point for the general public to many Government of Canada programs and services. It is the delivery arm of ESDC and other federal departments and is a part of ESDC.\n[19] Prior to the creation of SC in 2005, the CPPD Program was administered by HRSDC through the CPPD Directorate. The Respondent recognizes that during this period, the Directorate included positions which performed Eligible Work, including the provision of expert advice to those conducting adjudications. Ms. McIlroy was compensated for this type of Eligible Work up to September 2006 for this reason. The Respondent\u2019s position, however, is that since SC came into existence, the vast majority of the positions performing Eligible Work (i.e., approximately 400 MAs) fall under the purview of SC and are no longer a part of the CPPD Directorate.\n[20] In December 2008, HRSDC and SC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMoU\u201d) which, among other things, defines the roles and responsibilities of each of the parties vis-\u00e0-vis the CPP. According to section 7.4 of the MoU, HRSDC retains the full accountability for the legislation, regulations and policy design of the CPP Account, while SC administers and delivers the CPP to ensure it is efficient, responsive, and economical.\n[21] Pursuant to the MoU, the responsibility for the CPPD Program is shared between the Income Security and Social Development Branch (\u201cISSD\u201d) of HRSDC (which houses the CPPD Directorate) and SC. The Operations Branch of SC subsequently became the Processing and Payment Services Branch (\u201cPPSB\u201d). The PPSB is composed of: (i) the National Headquarters (\u201cNHQ\u201d) - the \u201ccentral hub\u201d - which is responsible for, among other things, providing operational direction\/guidance to, supervising and supporting, and liaising with, the MAs in the Regions; and (ii) the Regional offices, where the vast majority of MAs are situated and conduct the adjudications. There is also a small number of MAs situated at NHQ. [2]\n[22] In 2006\u20132007, following the creation of SC, the vast majority of the MA positions responsible for adjudicating disability claims and the positions supervising those MAs who did the adjudications, moved to the SC side of HRSDC. The majority of the PM-04 and PM-05 level positions in PPSB NHQ were subsequently converted to NU-EMA-02 positions. The PM-04 level MA positions were converted to NU-EMA-01 positions. It is undisputed that the vast majority of Complainants and non-Complainants in the Walden proceeding are, or were, employed on the SC side of HRSDC (now ESDC).\nB. CPPD Directorate\n[23] The ISSD Branch of ESDC houses the CPPD Directorate, which is a separate organization from SC\u2019s PPSB (NHQ and Regions). Since 2005, the CPPD Directorate has provided national leadership in the development and ongoing management of the CPPD Program. The Directorate develops legislation, regulations and policy, and translates policy intent into functional direction to the PPSB.\n[24] During the Disputed Period, the CPPD Directorate had four divisions: the Policy Division; the Program Design Division; the Medical Expertise Division (\u201cME Division\u201d); and the Adjudication and Appeals Division (\u201cAA Division\u201d). The evidence and argument in this motion focussed on the latter two Divisions.\n[25] The ME Division reviewed all RT decisions and prepared recommendations to the Litigation Committee regarding any Minister\u2019s appeals to the PAB. It presented the Minister\u2019s position before the PAB. It also provided medical expertise to all areas of CPPD including to SC MAs. According to the Respondent, the small number of MAs who remained within the CPPD Directorate worked in this Division to support work on case files for appeals to the PAB. The Respondent has stated that all of these individuals occupied positions with job titles of either \u201cMA\u201d or \u201cManager, MA\u201d and performed work that was consistent with the definition of work in the NU classification standard. These positions were converted to NU-EMA positions.\n[26] The AA Division, where the Complainant worked during the Disputed Period, performed the following role and function:\na) Provides functional support, national direction and development of process related to Review Tribunal appeals;\nb) Serves as the branch liaison with the Office of the Commissioner of Review Tribunals;\nc) Supports strategic management of CPPD appeals; and\nd) Provides expert advice and functional direction related to CPPD adjudication.\n[27] The above role includes providing expert advice to SC relating to complex CPPD adjudication and appeals. More specifically, it incorporates the following tasks:\n(1) Responding to Regional inquiries relating to adjudication, including with regard to initial applications and reconsiderations as well as relating to appeals;\n(2) Consulting with medical, legal and other experts relating to CPPD adjudication and appeal cases;\n(3) Providing functional direction and expert advice on complex appeal cases to SC; and\n(4) Reviewing for policy consistency SC training materials, procedures and tools.\n[28] In this motion, the Complainant has argued that the work that she completed as a PM-05 and PM-06 in the AA Division constitutes Eligible Work pursuant to the MOA as a primary portion of her work involved \u201cproviding expert advice to or directly supervising those who did conduct adjudications\u201d as per the MOA Eligible Work definition.\nV. Parties\u2019 Positions\nA. Complainant\u2019s Work Tasks as a PM-05 in the AA Division\n[29] On September 5, 2006, the Complainant left the CPPD Directorate where she had been working as a PM-04 to take a job promotion as a PM-05 in another Department. On December 17, 2007, at the beginning of the Disputed Period, the Complainant returned to HRSDC to work in the CPPD Directorate in the AA Division, as a PM-05, with a job title of Program Manager (listed as Senior Project Officer in the AA Division Chart).\n[30] The Complainant alleges that during this time, a primary portion of her work involved the provision of expert advice to MAs working in the PPSB Regional offices, PPSB NHQ and also within the AA Division itself. The Complainant alleges that part of her work activities involved answering and assisting her PM-05 colleagues in responding to case-specific inquiries that the Division would receive from MAs working in the Regional offices and at NHQ. In so doing, the Complainant would review the details of the file and use her policy and programming knowledge as well as her expertise as a former nurse and MA to provide a response. While the MAs made the final decision on the files, the Complainant argued that they did so with the benefit of the expert advice that she provided.\n[31] In addition to providing this type of case-specific expert advice, the Complainant averred that she also provided general policy advice to the MAs in her Division - Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire - as well as to the MAs working at SC, mainly in the Regions, and to the PM-05s at NHQ. The Complainant argues that in her development of policies and in providing guidelines to the MAs to support them in their role of adjudicating files, she was also providing expert advice pursuant to the MOA. In order for MAs to make disability determinations, the Complainant submits that they must have knowledge of both nursing and CPPD policies as both of these areas are interlinked and necessary to ensure the consistent and fair application of CPP legislation in the adjudication of CPPD claims.\n[32] The Complainant argues that this is supported by the overall role of the AA Division which is to provide expert advice to MAs on issues related to medical adjudication. The Complainant disputes the contention that the expert advice envisaged under the MOA excludes general policy advice. The Complainant relies in this regard on the Tribunal\u2019s Liability Decision where, at para. 65, the Tribunal recognized that :\nBoth medical advisors and adjudicators may be involved in outreach and policy development work. Dr. Gregory works with other medical advisors on policy development and analysis. Ruth Walden testified that she knew of at least one MA who is working in the policy development area. The MA's job description stipulates that adjudicators may participate in or lead teams engaged in training and policy development.\n[33] The Complainant further notes that there is no mention of the type of \u201cexpert advice\u201d that must be provided in the MOA. According to the Oxford Dictionary, an expert is defined as someone trained by practice, who possesses special skill or knowledge. There is no question that with her 20 years of nursing experience, 10 years of experience as a MA as well as her policy experience, the Complainant qualifies as possessing special skill and knowledge. She argues that in advising the MAs on policy and on specific cases, she was applying this knowledge to their benefit.\n[34] The Complainant maintains that she continued to provide both case-specific and general expert policy advice to Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire, as well as to the MAs at the NHQ and in the Regional offices of SC when she became a PM-06 in January 2011. She argues that as a result, she provided expert advice pursuant to the MOA during the entirety of the Disputed Period.\n[35] The Respondent roots its opposing position in two main arguments. First, the Respondent advocates for a narrower interpretation of \u201cexpert advice\u201d pursuant to the MOA, arguing that its definition is limited to the provision of direct advice to MAs in adjudicating specific cases and does not extend to policy work or expert advice that is \u201ctwice-removed\u201d. Second, according to this interpretation, the Respondent submits that while the Complainant may have performed some Eligible Work in responding to case-specific inquiries by MAs, the Complainant did not provide expert advice as a primary part of her work, as the definition requires.\n[36] With respect to the Respondent\u2019s first argument, it submits that the Complainant\u2019s main or primary role was to develop and provide national policy direction for the CPPD program, with a focus on adjudication and appeal policy issues. The purpose of the Complainant\u2019s advice was to ensure the development and consistent application of CPPD policies so as to create a framework for the nationally consistent delivery of the CPPD program, including adjudication of applications and review of cases on appeal. This included offering advice on how, for example, to interpret the legislation, regulations and policy in the case of complex disability claims.\n[37] The type of expert advice the Complainant provided dealt with program policy advice that was in line with the CPPD Directorate\u2019s role to ensure that the legislation and policy was sufficiently clear and properly applied. This is not, according to the Respondent, the same as the expert medical adjudication advice intended in the MOA. Indeed, with the exception of the one example in the footnote below, ESDC has not paid compensation for Eligible Work during the Disputed Period in which an individual occupied a substantive program manager\/project officer position in the CPPD Directorate\u2019s AA Division. [3]\n[38] The Respondent also argues that most of the expert medical adjudication advice that the Complainant did perform was not provided directly to the MAs, but was provided to their supervisors or to Business Experts (formerly called Team Leads), who were providing expert advice to the MAs directly. The majority of the MAs worked in the SC Regional offices and generally went through NHQ to obtain any expert advice not available in their respective Regions. The Complainant\u2019s primary function was to provide overall policy advice to NHQ and in this respect, her advice was rarely directly provided to the Regional MAs. The Respondent is of the view that this type of indirect or twice-removed expert advice falls outside the MOA definition of Eligible Work.\n[39] Turning to the Respondent\u2019s second argument, while the Respondent recognizes that the Complainant occasionally directly provided expert advice to individuals conducting adjudications, the Respondent argues that this did not constitute a primary part of her job. According to the Respondent, primary is defined as more than fifty percent. Even if we accept the Complainant\u2019s description of her own work activities, the few activities where she provided expert advice on specific case files and met the Eligible Work definition did not amount to more than fifty percent of her overall workload.\n[40] It is for these reasons that the Respondent determined that the Complainant was not performing Eligible Work during her work as a PM-05 in the AA Division during the Disputed Period and decided not to compensate her as a result.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Work Tasks as a PM-06 in the AA Division\n[41] On January 24, 2011, the Complainant was offered a PM-06 position, with the job title of Senior Policy Advisor (the Respondent also termed it Senior Policy Analyst). The Complainant alleges that this title did not accurately reflect her actual work activities because rather than create a new position, the Respondent transferred this position from another Division of the CPPD Directorate. The Complainant submits that notwithstanding this job title, she continued to provide expert advice to MAs in the Regions, NHQ and the AA Division. She alleges that in this capacity, she also frequently supervised the MAs in the AA Division as well as the other PM-05s in the absence of the Director, thereby \u201cdirectly supervising those who did conduct adjudications\u201d as per the MOA definition.\n[42] According to the Complainant, the two MAs in the AA Division, Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire, did not work on first level, initial applications or files at the reconsideration stage, but did work on files appealed to the Review Tribunal. In so doing, the Complainant alleges that Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire had to review all of the medical files so as to provide an explanation for the denial of the application at the reconsideration stage. The Complainant argues that this work is akin to the work of medical adjudication and therefore, Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire conducted similar work to the MAs in the Regions. She notes that Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire were recognized as nurses and classified as MAs. In 2012, they were converted to the NU-EMA classification. Both Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire were compensated for having performed Eligible Work during the time that they worked in the AA Division.\n[43] The Respondent argues on the contrary, that Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire did not perform MA work in their positions at the AA Division. They performed work that included putting together reports and providing evaluations for Review Tribunal cases. They also made recommendations to the MAs in the Regions. However, unlike the MAs working in the Regions, they possessed no authority to settle and did not conduct adjudications. Nevertheless, the Respondent took a liberal approach to the MOA and chose to compensate both Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire because their substantive or \u201chome\u201d positions were as MAs in the ME Division.\n[44] In the event that the Tribunal accepts that the work of Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire was medical adjudication work as per the MOA, the Respondent also argues that the Complainant\u2019s supervision of these employees did not constitute the primary part of her job. As a PM-06 she would have supervised a number of other PM-04 and PM-05 positions too. In the periods that she replaced the Division Director, she would have been supervising the entire AA Division which, during the Disputed Period, would have amounted to approximately fifteen individuals in addition to Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire. The Respondent also notes that, much like the Complainant, Mr. Dub\u00e9, the Senior Manager PM-06, also replaced the Division Director but did not receive any compensation under the MOA for having supervised MAs.\n[45] The Respondent argues that for these reasons, the Complainant cannot be said to have performed Eligible Work during her time as a PM-06.\nC. Eligible Work of Other PM-05s at PPSB NHQ\n[46] The Complainant alleges that, the fact the Respondent concluded that other individuals who worked at SC\u2019s PPSB NHQ (like Marjorie Martin, a Project Manager with whom the Complainant worked closely) and who performed similar work to the Complainant were providing expert advice to those who conducted adjudications, further supports her claim. The Complainant notes that she possessed a similar background and conducted work that was comparable to that of the other PM-05 employees working at NHQ who were classified as NU-EMA-02 and were considered to be performing Eligible Work. She argues that the PM-05 employees at NHQ often came to her or her colleagues with inquiries related to medical adjudication from the Regional MAs because they required her expert advice. The Complainant describes their relationship as \u201ccollaborative\u201d, and one of \u201cshared expertise\u201d.\n[47] The Respondent disagrees with the Complainant\u2019s contention that her work was the same as her PM-05 counterparts working at NHQ. As reflected in the MoU, there were important differences between the nature of the work conducted by the ISSD Branch, including the AA Division, and SC\u2019s PPSB. The individuals occupying PM-05 positions at PPSB who received compensation under the MOA performed as either Program Managers\/Project Officers, Business Experts (formerly Team Leads) or senior MAs. Unlike the Complainant\u2019s position, they were the MAs\u2019 first point-of-contact, either providing them with expert advice on medical adjudications or directly supervising them. These positions also all required nursing knowledge and experience as an essential qualification and were subsequently converted to NU-EMA-02 positions on this basis.\nD. Complainant\u2019s Job Description\n[48] The Complainant submits that she did not possess an accurate job description for either the PM-05 or the PM-06 position that she occupied during the Disputed Period. Both the job offer and the position number listed on the job description that were initially provided to the Complainant in September 2014 were inaccurate. While she subsequently obtained a job description for the PM-05 position in November 2014 which contained the correct position number, the list of duties did not accurately reflect the work she performed. Furthermore, the Complainant alleges that the PM-06 position she occupied was transferred from another Division and she never obtained a job description. She also notes that none was filed during this motion-hearing. The Complainant maintains that as a result, in examining her work activities so as to determine whether she was in fact performing Eligible Work, the Tribunal should place no weight on the job descriptions entered into evidence.\n[49] The Respondent concedes that there were \u201cissues\u201d regarding the accuracy of job descriptions during the Disputed Period, but notes that these are typically customized with Addendums that provide greater precision. Having said this, while the three generic job descriptions (\u201cminus the Addendums\u201d which were incorrect) that were entered into evidence may not precisely reflect the Complainant\u2019s work, they do provide an overview of the work that her and her colleagues in the AA Division were undertaking. Furthermore, the Respondent notes that while reference was made to the work descriptions in determining who performed Eligible Work, they were not the sole basis upon which these determinations were made. The Respondent also considered the overall role of the Division as well as the actual work performed by the employees, as communicated by the Division Directors and detailed in ongoing work reports.\nE. Complainant\u2019s Status as a Registered Nurse\n[50] The Respondent notes that the definition of Eligible Work under the MOA requires those conducting adjudications to employ \u201cthe use of knowledge associated with being a registered nurse\u201d and submits that this requirement also applies to those providing expert advice and directly supervising those who conduct adjudications. Being a Registered Nurse must, according to the Respondent, constitute an essential or \u201crequired\u201d qualification of the individual\u2019s position if he or she is to be found to have performed Eligible Work.\n[51] The Respondent submits that the MOA, in this regard, must be interpreted in light of the broader litigation context from which it emanated. The MOA sought to compensate the Complainants and non-Complainant \u201cvictims\u201d (per the language of the CHRA) [4] for their losses from the adverse differential treatment that they suffered in relation to their Medical Advisor counterparts. Almost all of those compensated were Registered Nurses. This requirement is also reflected in the fact that the NU-EMA Sub-Group definitions, which are the result of the Tribunal\u2019s Liability Decision, require the qualification of being a Registered Nurse. [5] The development of the NU-EMA work descriptions and the determinations of the positions which were converted to NU-EMA positions were carefully considered, following numerous consultations and discussions among human resources professionals. The Respondent argues that in concluding the MOA, the parties\u2019 underlying intent was to compensate individuals who were required to be Registered Nurses as part of their positions. This includes those providing expert advice and supervising those conducting adjudications. The Respondent argues that this requirement should be read into the MOA Eligible Work definition for the individuals in those two categories.\n[52] The Respondent recognizes that the Complainant\u2019s nursing and medical adjudication knowledge, skills and expertise were certainly an asset to her position, but argues that this did not constitute an essential qualification of her position. The majority of the Complainant\u2019s tasks involved the provision of legal, analytical or generic policy advice, none of which required a Registered Nurse background. If such expertise was required, employees within the AA Division could consult the ME Division. The Respondent argues that this further supports its position that the Complainant was not performing Eligible Work during the Disputed Period.\n[53] The Complainant disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s assessment of her position and alleges that her numerous years of prior experience as a nurse and as a MA were key in her ability to perform her work, both as a PM-05 and PM-06. The fact that all of the PM-05 project officers in the AA Division had nursing and medical adjudication backgrounds supports her argument that this was a requirement of her position. The Complainant argues that the Respondent implicitly acknowledged that this experience was a requirement when it agreed to reimburse her for her Registered Nurse licensing and registration fees. The decision to make this reimbursement was made as part of the Programs and Administrative Services (PA) Collective Agreement to those \u201cwho as a regular part of their work, rely on the medical knowledge obtained through education and training and\/or registration as a Registered Nurse\u201d. Therefore, in agreeing to reimburse these fees, the Respondent recognized that the Complainant was applying her nursing knowledge in performing her work activities. The Complainant argues that this same fact should be considered in determining her dates for Eligible Work.\n[54] The Complainant also objects to the Respondent\u2019s submission that it is implicit in the definition of Eligible Work that a Complainant must be a Registered Nurse as part of the requirements for his or her position. In fact, the Complainant challenges the relevance of possessing the status of Registered Nurse in the interpretation of the MOA. The Tribunal first ordered the creation of the NU Sub-Group in the Remedy Decision in 2009. The parties subsequently took active steps to implement the Tribunal\u2019s Order in this regard and created the NU-EMA categories as a result. Despite this, the MOA, which was concluded in 2012, makes no mention of the new categories, their definitions, or the requirement of being a Registered Nurse. In light of this, the Complainant argues that it is difficult to accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that adding this requirement to the Eligible Work definition was part of the parties\u2019 underlying intent in drafting the MOA.\nVI. Analysis\n[55] In determining this motion, I must look at the MOA, including the plain, ordinary meaning of the words therein, the parties\u2019 intentions, and by way of contextual analysis, the broader litigation at hand. The \u201cbroader litigation\u201d encompasses the actual Complaints filed, the Liability and Remedy Decisions of the Tribunal and any relevant findings\/comments from the Courts on judicial review\/appeal. The MOA is rooted in the discrimination Complaints filed by over 400 MAs and states that the MOA\u2019s aim is to \u201csettle all outstanding issues arising out of the Complaint[s]\u201d. It was not negotiated and agreed to in a vacuum.\n[56] Having said this, in defining Eligible Work, the MOA effectively also extends the remedy as it was initially constructed by the Tribunal in the Liability and Remedy Decisions. Member Jensen found that the MAs had been adversely differentiated when compared to their Medical Advisor counterparts. The Tribunal did not, however, conclude that those providing expert advice to or supervising the MAs equally suffered the same differential treatment. In agreeing to include these additional individuals as part of those eligible for compensation under the MOA, the parties went beyond the Tribunal\u2019s initial Order.\n[57] While the jurisdiction-retention provisions of the MOA and subsequent Consent Order are broad, they cannot confer jurisdiction that does not find a basis in the CHRA. The two Consent Orders contain a preamble that acknowledges that the Complaints have been \u201csubstantiated\u201d (mirroring language from the CHRA), per the Liability Decision. Any remedy flowing from those findings, including in the Remedy Decision itself, agreements between the parties like the MOA, or further Orders by the Tribunal, must be connected to the Liability Decision and have a nexus with the subject-matter of the Complaints. Motions like the instant one are not to be construed as simply and only an exercise of contractual interpretation.\n[58] Ms. McIlroy has the legal burden to prove her remedy on a balance of probabilities. Although she is a named Complainant in the Walden et al. matter and received compensation as such for a 10-year-period (1996-2006) as a MA and is identified as a \u201cComplainant\u201d in this Decision, in reality, her claim for compensation in the present motion for the 4-year Disputed Period is as a non-Complainant \u201cvictim\u201d seeking to fall within the second and third category or \u201cclass\u201d of individuals in the MOA\u2019s definition of \u201cEligible Work\u201d.\nA. What Did the Parties Intend in Extending the Remedy?\n[59] A central question becomes: What did the parties to the MOA (i.e., the Complainants, as represented by the law firm of Armstrong Wellman, and the Respondent) [6] intend in extending the remedy to the two additional groups of individuals?\n[60] The parties made submissions on this point. I note that the only witness heard by the Tribunal in this regard was the Respondent\u2019s sole witness, Mary Pichette, Acting Senior Assistant Deputy Minister, ESDC, ISSD Branch. She joined the CPPD Directorate in 2009. By May 2010 she was the Acting Director-General and made permanent in the position in August 2010. While Ms. Pichette did not directly negotiate the MOA (counsel to the Respondent did that), she was involved in the negotiations and was present during discussions regarding its implementation. She was also one of the key management executives involved with the review of all relevant jobs in the CPPD Directorate and SC as a result of the Walden litigation, the resulting Tribunal Orders, including the new classification and which jobs would be reclassified in the NU-EMA-01 and -02 categories. I find that Ms. Pichette was quite credible as a witness and her evidence reliable, particularly on the issue of the parties\u2019 intention in creating the second and third categories of Eligible Work individuals under the MOA. I have considered the evidence and submissions on this topic and am mindful that the Complainant bears the onus of demonstrating on a balance of probabilities that she performed Eligible Work during the Disputed Period.\n[61] Ms. Pichette testified that the MAs\u2019 \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d if they had a complex question\/issue was to go to their supervisor within their own Region (i.e., manager, Team Lead). If the issue was unresolved, it would be bumped to NHQ and then through the electronic inquiry box that was managed by the Program Design Division of CPPD Directorate. They would decide who best to deal with the question\/issue (e.g., ME Division, Policy Division, AA Division, etc.). Ms. McIlroy testified that the AA Division received the majority of such inquiries. Ms. Pichette averred:\nThese inquiries were not specifically about medical adjudication, they were about \u201cHow do I apply the policy? When it\u2019s a late applicant, how do I know whether it\u2019s a new fact?\u201d They [the inquiries] would be case-specific, but it would be about \u201cHow do we apply the policy in this case?\u201d\u2026These cases never came to our division to say, \u201cPlease adjudicate this case for us\u201d, it was \u201cWe have a question\u201d. Often cases are the best way to demonstrate the gaps in the policies.\n[62] Ms. Pichette stated that \u201cadjudication\u201d is just one part of the overall CPPD Program; it deals with various elements of eligibility. She remarked that the AA Division\u2019s role was to apply the jurisprudence and legislation\/regulations in the \u201cevolution of policies\u201d in relation to adjudication and appeals. An \u201cadditional part\u201d, but not the main part or primary role, was providing expert advice to individual cases in the medical adjudication of CPPD applications derived from the electronic inquiry box.\n[63] Ms. Pichette also indicated that she looked at 110 positions in the exercise of job- conversion to the NU-EMA categories in 2011 discussed earlier in this Decision. She worked with Nancy Lawand, her predecessor as Director-General. She disagrees with Ms. McIlroy\u2019s characterization of the expert advice that she provided:\nWe were program policy experts providing that expertise to program experts in PPSB [NHQ] who then translated that into tools and guidelines and training materials for the front lines\u2026Regional Medical Adjudicators [under Service Canada]\u2026Ms. McIlroy yesterday indicated that it was her view that the work she did was essentially the same as the work of her counterpart Marjorie Martin in PPSB. And she indicated that Ms. Martin\u2019s position was converted from being a PM-5 to an NU-EMA[-02]\u2026I disagree with that and importantly my predecessor Nancy Lawand who was very familiar with the work disagreed with that and Sharon Shanks, who was the Director-General responsible for PPSB, disagreed with that. There were important differences between the work that was done in PPSB and the work that was done in our branch [ISSD, which includes the CPPD Directorate] and we were careful to make sure that the roles reflected the roles that were set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.\nMs. Pichette later testified similarly:\nIt was expert advice to the experts who then provided it to the Medical Adjudicators. And on occasion, through the inquiry box, inquiries would be filtered up through PPSB. Program Design Division fed out to various individuals across, and in those cases was expertise provided directly to Medical Adjudicators? We heard yesterday it was and I don\u2019t dispute that.\n[64] I asked Ms. Pichette whether they contemplated that the MOA definition of \u201cexpert advice\u201d would include that the advice be given directly to MAs, or if it would be \u201cfiltered\u201d to them or \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the Regional MAs eventually. The witness replied:\nIn my view, as someone who worked on the Memorandum of Agreement, that\u2019s not what was contemplated and in fact it was very much not contemplated. There are what\u2019s called Business Experts in Service Canada in PPSB [NHQ] and in the Regions who were subsequently converted to NU-EMA-2 positions and that reference was in respect to those positions\u2026In the Memorandum of Agreement when we talk about expert advice and then we talk about those that are directly supervising, the reason for that is because in Service Canada there were two types of positions that ultimately could be converted.\u2026The twice removed expert advice was not considered to be within the scope of the Memorandum of Agreement\u2026Two types of expert advice were foreseen at that time, one was the Business Experts in the Regions, so the \u201cgo-to\u201d persons that the Regional Medical Adjudicators would go to for complex issues as well as people like Marjorie Martin who were their first point-of-contact if they couldn\u2019t resolve the issue\u2026Sometimes they weren\u2019t supervisors and that\u2019s why you have the distinction of those providing expert advice and those directly supervising. Because in some Regions the supervisors were the experts and in some cases they were outside of the supervision duties.\n[65] As for the category of those \u201cdirectly supervising and providing expert advice to those conducting adjudications\u201d, Ms. Pichette testified that the Government had in mind to include for Walden compensation Business Experts and senior MAs (PM-05) supervising MAs (PM-04). She later stated:\nAnd we specifically excluded the policy expertise because there were PM-05s who were not Medical Adjudicators who were giving policy advice to Service Canada\u2026I was very much involved in looking at what was the intent of those words\u2026The intent [behind the \u201cEligible Work\u201d definition] was to encapsulate the Business Experts and Team Leads within Service Canada at the Regional level and at NHQ...It was not to include the policy expertise that resided in my Directorate [CPPD]. It was not intended to encompass that. Had it been intended to encompass that, we would have ended up with individuals who were in PM-5 positions who were not nurses who would have been compensated\u2026\n[66] She said that even if being a registered nurse was an asset, it was not a requirement of the position. The witness remarked: \u201cThe context of this was for the Medical Adjudicators, and the Complainants and non-Complainants who were Registered Nurses. It wasn\u2019t contemplated that expert advice would include broader policy or legislative expertise.\u201d Interpreting the MOA otherwise, she opined, would result in other employees in the CPPD Directorate and potentially in other sections of the Department, such as human resources professionals or legal counsel, being able to claim compensation as they too were providing \u201cexpert advice\u201d to the MAs.\n[67] Further on this topic, Ms. Pichette stated that the above determination was made after careful thought and \u201cdiscussions\u201d with several people, including management personnel in PPSB, Ms. Shanks and herself. They determined that the advice of PM-05s in the AA Division (like Ms. McIlroy and her three PM-05 colleagues) was \u201cpolicy advice at least one, more often two, steps removed from medical adjudication.\u201d\n[68] I accept Ms. Pichette\u2019s evidence on this point. While Ms. McIlroy was certainly a credible witness in the motion-hearing in general, she had no evidence to provide on the intent of the parties to the MOA. She could have summonsed Mr. Armstrong or Ms. Wellman, who were counsel to, and negotiated the MOA on behalf of, the vast majority of Complainants in the Walden proceeding, or for that matter, counsel to the Respondent who negotiated the MOA on behalf of their client. It seems clear to me that the parties to the MOA did not intend to include the work of PM-05s in the AA Division, like Ms. McIlroy, in the two extended categories of \u201cEligible Work\u201d in the MOA.\nB. Was the Complainant Providing Expert Advice to MAs?\n[69] The contention on this point lies essentially in the interpretation of the term \u201cexpert advice\u201d, which the MOA has not defined. In examining the broader litigation context which underlies the MOA, I agree with the Respondent that the interpretation of \u201cexpert advice\u201d must be linked to the medical adjudication of cases and does not extend to general policy advice.\n[70] As previously stated, the Complaints were filed by MAs and pertained to the recognition of their work in relation to the work undertaken by the Medical Advisors. In examining the similarity of the work between the two groups, the Tribunal found that \u201cthe primary responsibility and function of both the medical advisors and the medical adjudicators has been to use their professional expertise and knowledge to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits at all stages of the process, and\/or to prepare for, and represent the Minister in appeals\u201d: Liability Decision at para. 68.\n[71] The Tribunal then examined the functions of both groups more specifically, and concluded the following at paras. 69-72:\nSpecifically, both advisors and adjudicators have performed the following functions at various points throughout the three time periods in this complaint:\ni. making recommendations and decisions on initial applications involving varying degrees of complexity and difficulty in terms of the medical and legal issues involved;\nii. making recommendations and decisions on reconsideration applications that were also varied in terms of their level of complexity and difficulty;\niii. preparing case summaries for the Review Committee, or as it was later called, the Review Tribunal;\niv. requesting additional medical and non-medical information from applicants and others on an application for CPP disability benefits;\nv. preparing a file for the Pension Appeals Board;\nvi. making an offer to settle or a recommendation to settle (without prior approval);\nvii. working on policy and outreach.\nOver the three time periods, the amount of time spent by the advisors and the adjudicators performing the overlapping functions has shifted. However, the evidence established that from 1972 until 1999, there were medical advisors and medical adjudicators whose primary function was to make recommendations or final determinations on initial and reconsideration applications and to prepare case summaries for the Review Committee. The work on initial applications and reconsiderations represented a considerable amount of the advisors' and adjudicators' workloads since over 90% of all applications are conclusively determined at one of those two levels...\nSince 1999, medical adjudicators in the Regions have been doing substantially the same work that advisors performed from 1972-1999: the final determination of eligibility for CPP disability benefits at the initial and reconsideration levels.\n[Italics added.]\n[72] I agree with the Complainant that the Tribunal recognized at sub-para. 69(vii) that policy work was one of the tasks undertaken by MAs. However, when read alongside the remainder of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions regarding the functions performed by the Medical Advisors and MAs which are at the root of the discrimination, it becomes clear that the tasks primarily at issue pertained to the MAs\u2019 work on initial and reconsideration applications. This view is further supported by the wording of the Eligible Work definition in the MOA which does not use the term \u201cMedical Adjudicators\u201d, but rather, refers to individuals who are \u201cconducting adjudications (i.e. assessing medical information for the purposes of determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits\u2026)\u201d. The act of adjudicating, paired with the assessment of medical information, is therefore at the core of the definition of \u201cEligible Work\u201d and thus, central to the awarding of compensation flowing from Member Jensen\u2019s Order and the subsequent MOA and Orders signed by me. In my view, individuals seeking compensation for either \u201cproviding expert advice to\u201d or \u201cdirectly supervising\u201d MAs must demonstrate that their tasks are closely tied to the performance of these medical adjudicative functions.\n[73] In light of this, I accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that expert advice was meant to cover the Business Experts\/Team Leads and the supervisors of the MAs who were the MAs\u2019 first point-of-contact and who directly provided advice to them as they conducted the adjudications, as well as the individuals working at SC NHQ who \u201ctranslated\u201d the advice provided by the AA Division directly to the MAs. The Complainant\u2019s main or primary role in the AA Division was as a program policy expert, providing expert advice to program experts at PPSB. I also agree with Ms. Pichette\u2019s statement that many of the Complainant\u2019s examples illustrated \u201cprogram policy work\u201d geared to a broad range of audiences, such as senior management, legal services, other colleagues within HRSDC (including CPPD Directorate), etc. and not primarily to MAs. For example, Ms. McIlroy filed written materials and testified about her work (\u201cmore in the nature of general expert advice\u201d) for the Litigation Committee Secretariat. She prepared agendas, background and records of decision, in collaboration with Legal Services and the ME Division. This type of task, while important, does not fall within the MOA\u2019s Eligible Work definition category of \u201cproviding expert advice\u2026to those conducting adjudications\u201d. I say this in terms of the nature of the task and the audiences to which it is directed.\n[74] I do not dispute that the Complainant possessed expertise, or that she was providing advice. I do not doubt that she was an exemplary public servant. I also do not dispute that policy informed the work of those conducting adjudications. However, I find that the general policy expert advice described by the Complainant, for the most part, does not contain a sufficiently strong nexus to the case-specific medical adjudicative work of the MAs. It is not, in my view, what the parties to the MOA intended to include as \u201cEligible Work\u201d for compensation.\n[75] Were I to extend the interpretation of expert advice in the manner sought by the Complainant, the Respondent argues that I would be opening the door to compensation to a large number of other individuals working in various parts of the CPPD Directorate and SC, something which was not intended by the parties to the MOA. Human resources or legal advisors, for example, could come forward and claim that they too were \u201cproviding expert advice to those conducting adjudications.\u201d I agree that this would not reflect the parties\u2019 intention in concluding the MOA.\n[76] Bearing in mind this interpretation of expert advice, I note that the Respondent has recognized, and I agree, that the Complainant did provide some expert advice (i.e., to MAs on case-specific files) as per the MOA in her positions as a PM-05 and PM-06 in the AA Division. However, the Respondent argues that while the Complainant provided this expert advice to MAs, she did not do so as the primary portion of her positions as the MOA requires. Consequently, said expert advice is not compensable under the MOA.\n[77] In examining the specific nature of the Complainant\u2019s tasks to determine if this Eligible Work may have constituted the primary portion of her work, I take note of the Commission\u2019s position. It did not participate in the motion-hearing, but did file written submissions that warned against \u201creliance solely on job titles, information on jobs\u2019 current position in the hierarchy, and salary data which may themselves reflect gender-based stereotypes.\u201d It took no position as to whether the Complainant had made out her case for compensation. I agree with the principles enunciated by the Commission. While the above elements listed are factors to consider individually and in the aggregate, they should not be used solely or too much emphasis placed on them. Rather, the actual duties performed by the employee should be given significant consideration. I find that HRSDC did so and I have placed paramount importance on this factor of actual duties performed in my findings.\n[78] In this regard, I also note the Complainant\u2019s challenge of the Respondent\u2019s use of job descriptions in determining an individual\u2019s Eligible Work. Combined with the Respondent\u2019s own admission that these often did not provide an accurate or up-to-date depiction of the work performed and that there were \u201cissues\u201d with the ones for McIlroy\u2019s positions (the Addendums in particular), I have accorded little weight to these documents that were entered into evidence which purportedly correspond to the Complainant\u2019s PM-05 and PM-06 positions. My conclusions regarding the Complainant\u2019s tasks, and whether or not she provided expert advice as the primary portion of her positions, are chiefly founded on the Complainant\u2019s own description of her work tasks, which the Respondent did not dispute generally.\n[79] On the basis of the Complainant\u2019s description of her work tasks, I asked the Complainant to provide an estimate of the percentage of her work that constituted case-specific expert advice versus the more general policy expert advice. The Complainant estimated that during her time as a PM-05, sixty percent of her work was policy-related and forty percent was case-specific. As for her time as a PM-06, she estimated that forty percent was policy-related and twenty percent was case-specific (and forty percent \u201cdirectly supervising\u201d). I have reviewed the list of tasks enumerated in the Complainant\u2019s Motion Record and Joint Book of Documents (exhibits filed) and described during her testimony, and conclude that the estimate she provided is a reasonably accurate reflection of her work during the Disputed Period.\n[80] In light of the fact that expert advice pursuant to the MOA does not include general policy advice, the Respondent argues that the Complainant\u2019s estimate confirms that she did not provide expert advice as the primary part of her work. However, the meaning of the term \u201cprimary\u201d, which is also not defined in the MOA, is at issue in this motion too. Whereas the Respondent defines it as meaning fifty percent or more, the Complainant argues that the term is not limited to the percentage of work, but rather, should be associated with the importance of the work or task undertaken.\n[81] The Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cPrimary\u201d as \u201cOf chief importance; principal\u201d. Other dictionaries attach similar meanings to \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cprimarily\u201d as Oxford\u2019s. Both of the parties\u2019 interpretations are consistent with this definition in this regard. I am therefore of the view that both the importance of the work undertaken, as a reflection of an individual\u2019s overall job and importance of the task to the particular organization, as well as the percentage of the work to which he or she devotes his or her time to that task, help to determine whether a task qualifying as Eligible Work under the MOA can be said to constitute the primary portion of their work.\n[82] In this instance however, the Complainant fails to meet this test on both levels. She did not perform Eligible Work for more than fifty percent of her job and the evidence surrounding the role of the CPPD Directorate (and the AA Division in particular) and SC with regard to the administration of the CPPD Program under the MoU does not support the Complainant\u2019s contention that this case-specific work was the most important part of her job. As indicated earlier and defined clearly in the MoU, there are important differences between the ISSD and SC\u2019s PPSB and while it is possible that individuals working in ISSD performed Eligible Work as the primary portion of their positions, the nature of these distinctions renders these types of cases exceptional. It is because of these differences that I did not find examining the work of the other PM-05s working at PPSB NHQ, like Ms. Martin, which the Complainant argued was similar to her own, helpful to the Complainant\u2019s case. Ms. Pichette testified that contrary to Ms. McIlroy\u2019s evidence and submission, Ms. Pichette and Ms. Lawand determined that Ms. McIlroy and Ms. Martin did not do the same work: They did \u201cdifferent things\u201d. In this regard, I have accepted the Respondent\u2019s evidence that the nature of the work of these individuals, who worked directly with the MAs as the primary portion of their positions, was different from the Complainant\u2019s.\n[83] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Complainant was not providing expert advice pursuant to the MOA during the Disputed Period.\n[84] The parties also made submissions on the requirement of possessing the status of Registered Nurse for an individual\u2019s position to meet the definition of Eligible Work. The Respondent requested, more generally, that I read this requirement into the Eligible Work definition so as to ensure its application to the individuals who provide expert advice to and who supervise those conducting adjudications. Since I have already determined that the Complainant was not providing case-specific expert advice as the primary portion of her work and that the policy advice of general application that she provided did not qualify as \u201cexpert advice\u201d under the MOA, it is unnecessary that I make a finding as to whether or not using \u201cknowledge associated with being a registered nurse\u201d was a requirement of her position and the second and third categories of Eligible Work under the MOA.\nC. Was the Complainant Directly Supervising MAs?\n[85] The Complainant alleged that in supervising Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire as part of her role as a PM-06, she was directly supervising MAs pursuant to the MOA and therefore performing MOA-compensable Eligible Work.\n[86] The Respondent compensated both Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire for their work in the AA Division during the Disputed Period. Why were they compensated? The Respondent explained that despite the fact that these individuals were not conducting work that met the Eligible Work definition, their job titles and descriptions included medical adjudication and their substantive positions were as MAs in the ME Division. As stated earlier, the ME Division is, according to the Respondent, the only Division within the CPPD Directorate where there remained a small number of MAs who supported work on case files for appeals to the PAB. This was in keeping with the Respondent\u2019s practice, for administrative\/logistical reasons, to compensate substantive \u201chome-positioned\u201d MAs even if they in fact were not conducting medical adjudications.\n[87] I note that the MOA does not require that an individual possess the title of MA for his or her work to qualify as Eligible Work. Rather, an individual must demonstrate that he or she is conducting adjudications which the MOA describes as \u201cassessing medical information for the purposes of determining eligibility for CPP disability benefits and, in doing so, was required to use knowledge associated with being a registered nurse\u201d. When applied to the work of Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire in the AA Division during the Disputed Period, it does not appear that these individuals were performing Eligible Work. As the Complainant recognized, neither Ms. Boland nor Ms. McGuire was conducting adjudications, the primary work tasks of MAs. Rather, their work consisted of providing explanations for cases at the Review Tribunal stage and to make recommendations to Regional MAs. They possessed no authority to decide or settle cases.\n[88] The Respondent\u2019s approach to compensating individuals who held a substantive or \u201chome\u201d MA position, regardless of whether they performed any actual \u201cmedical adjudication\u201d work, resulted in individuals, like Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire, receiving such compensation. I note that this is not provided for in the MOA and that it does not appear that the parties intended for this to be applied outside of these exceptions. Since I have been tasked with interpreting the MOA, in light of the parties\u2019 intent, I do not feel that it is appropriate to extend the Respondent\u2019s approach to compensation to individuals, like the Complainant, who supervised Ms. Boland and Ms. McGuire. The Respondent is, of course, free to do so on its own accord.\n[89] Furthermore, when asked how much of her time was allocated to this supervisory responsibility, the Complainant estimated that as a PM-06, she would spend approximately forty percent of her time directly supervising the two MAs, even though she was also supervising other employees during those times that her Director was absent. The other forty percent of her time was spent providing more general policy advice, and roughly twenty percent was spent responding to case-specific inquiries or assisting the PM-05s in her Division in responding to these inquiries. Combined with the overarching role of the AA Division and the nature of the tasks of the PM-04s and PM-05s that she was supervising, this estimate once again demonstrates that the Complainant did not directly supervise (or indeed provide expert advice to) those conducting adjudications as the primary part of her job.\n[90] For these reasons, I find that the Complainant was not directly supervising MAs as required in the MOA\u2019s definition of Eligible Work.\nVII. Conclusion\n[91] I know that Ms. McIlroy will be disappointed with this Decision. My findings and comments are not to be construed as a denigration or diminution of her dedication and work as an erstwhile public servant.\nSigned by\nMatthew D. Garfield\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 22, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1111\/9205, T1112\/9305 & T1113\/9405\nStyle of Cause:\nRuth Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada\nDecision of the Tribunal Dated:\nJune 22, 2015\nDate and Place of Hearing:\nJanuary 15 and 16, 2015\nOttawa, Ontario\nAppearances:\nKaren McIlroy , for\nherself\nNo one appearing , for the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nLynn Marchildon , for\nthe Respondent\n[1] There have been statutory changes since then, including the creation of the Social Security Tribunal thereby replacing the Review Tribunals and the Pension Appeals Board.\n[2] In the motion-hearing, the witnesses sometimes spoke of \u201cPPSB\u201d and \u201cNHQ\u201d interchangeably. I agree with Ms. McIlroy\u2019s explanation for this: \u201c\u2026although PPSB covers both the Regions and NHQ, the Regions are usually referred to by the location of the Region; i.e. the Atlantic Region not the PPSB Atlantic Region, whereas PPSB NHQ may have been referred to as either PPSB or just NHQ depending on the context.\u201d\n[3] Ms. Pichette testified that only one individual in the AA Division, a senior project officer, received compensation for providing \u201cexpert advice\u201d under the MOA during the Disputed Period and for only two months due to \u201cspecific circumstances\u201d which she explained.\n[4] Although not ordered in this case, such Orders for non-Complainant \u201cvictims\u201d have been made by the Tribunal in other cases: Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Treasury Board), 1998 CanLII 3995; and Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Post Corporation, 2005 CHRT 39.\n[5] The Statement of Merit Criteria and Conditions of Employment for the Medical Consultant NU-EMA-02 position contains a \u201cgrandparent\u201d provision regarding the requirement of a Nursing qualification for any incumbent PM who became a NU-EMA on October 1, 2011.\n[6] After seeking the position of other Complainants not represented by Armstrong Wellman, the MOA was adopted in a Consent Order to include all Complainants and non-Complainant \u201cvictims\u201d. No non-Armstrong- represented Complainants voiced opposition to the MOA and the issuing of a Consent Order by the Tribunal.\n",

Background\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion by the Complainant dated March 9, 2015 for an Order to strike paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 27, 29, 32, 37 and 41 of the Respondent's Statement of Particulars, dated February 13, 2015, on the basis that \"...those paragraphs pertain to matters which fall outside the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) jurisdiction or are entirely irrelevant to the present inquiry.\"\n[2] The Complainant's motion also requested a similar Order with respect to the Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCommission\u201d) Statement of Particulars, dated January 23, 2015, but that request is now moot as the Commission withdrew its Statement of Particulars and advised it was no longer fully participating in the case by way of a letter dated May 8, 2105. The Commission is not responding to the motion and will not appear at a hearing of this matter.\n[3] The Complaints in this matter, dated March 30, 2012, were filed with the Commission on April 4, 2012. The Commission requested the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Complaints on a consolidated basis on October 1, 2013 pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \"CHRA\").\n[4] The Complainant brought the Complaints on behalf of three named victims (one of whom is his spouse), who have given him consent to bring the Complaints forward and act as their representative. The three named victims are each registered Indians under the Indian Act (the \"Act\").\n[5] In his Complaints and in his Statement of Particulars dated January 4, 2015 the Complainant alleges that contrary to section 21 of the Act, the Respondent refused to register (enter) in the Indian Reserve Land Register, which is administered on behalf of the Respondent under the Act by the Registrar of Indian Lands, certain documents involving transactions between the three Indian victims - namely leases of Lots 170-1 and 175 on the Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1 in British Columbia and a lease assignment of Lot 175. The Complainant contends that the registering (entering) of these documents in the Indian Reserve Land Register is a service to be provided by the Respondent mandatorily and in a non-discriminatory manner, upon the submission of the documents to the Registrar of Indian Lands. The Complainant says that the wording of section 21 of the Act, as part of the Indian Lands Registry System (ILRS) of administrative policies and practices published by the Respondent in its Indian Lands Registration Manual, did not authorise or permit the Registrar of Indian Lands to refuse to register (enter) the documents submitted to him in this case in the Indian Reserve Land Register.\nRegister\n21. There shall be kept in the Department a register, to be known as the Reserve Land Register, in which shall be entered particulars relating Certificates of Possession and Certificates of Occupation and other transactions respecting lands in a reserve.\n[6] The Complainant alleges that the refusal by the Respondent between July 29, 2011 and September 30, 2013 to register (enter) these documents in the Indian Reserve Land Register, is an infringement of section 5 of the CHRA, in that it constitutes a denial of service and adverse differentiation by the Respondent in the provision of a service customarily available to the general public, on the basis of a prohibited ground under section 3 of the CHRA - namely on the basis of racial, national or ethnic origin.\n[7] In its Statement of Particulars, the Respondent denies the Complainant's allegations. The Respondent points out that, subject to surrender (which is not an issue in this case), legal title to the lands on a reserve at all times remains with the Crown, pursuant to subsections 2(1) and 18(1) of the Act. The Respondent contends that for the lands in this case to be leased, the Minister of the Respondent, on behalf of the Crown, must be the Lessor pursuant to subsection 58(3) of the Act. The leases in question did not include the Minister and, as such, according to the Respondent, are not legally valid documents and therefore cannot be registered by the Registrar in as much as they are not \"transactions respecting land in a reserve\" as required by section 21 of the Act.\n58(3). Lease at the request of occupant - The Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on the application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being designated.\n[8] The Respondent argues that the Complaint in this case is a challenge to legislation, in as much as section 21 of the Act must be read as being informed, as part of the statutory scheme of the Act, by subsection 58(3) and its requirement that the Minister be named as lessor. The Respondent says that, absent amending legislation, it cannot ignore subsection 58(3) and is mandated to refuse to register the documents that it says are invalid without the Minister as lessor. In taking this position in its defence of the Complaint, the Respondent says that it is following the Federal Court of Appeal as \"... stated in Murphy that a challenge directed at specific provisions of legislation falls outside of the scope of the CHRA if it is aimed at legislation per se and nothing else.\": See Public Service Alliance of Canada v Canada (Revenue Agency), 2012 FCA 7 (\u201cMurphy\u201d).\n[9] In his Reply dated February 19, 2015 the Complainant denies that the Complaints directly challenge the Act. Rather, he argues that the Complaints seek i) \"...nothing more than the enforcement of the existing wording of s. 21 of the Indian Act.\"; and that ii) the \"...plain and ordinary meaning and the entirely obvious intent of the wording of s. 21 is not affected in any manner whatsoever by any other provisions of the Indian Act...\". It is the defence position \"... taken by the Respondent which raises a jurisdictional question pursuant to Murphy. In refusing to apply section 21 as it is drafted, it is the Respondent who challenges the legislation. This raises the question of whether the Complainant is himself entitled to rely on the principles established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Murphy and applied by the Tribunal to the Indian Act in Matson and Andrews\" in order to prevent the Respondent from challenging the existing wording of section 21 (See Matson et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 13, Andrews et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21, aff\u2019d Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FC 398).\nII. The Motion to Strike\n[10] The submissions on the motion by both the Complainant and the Respondent centre on the principle enunciated in Murphy, Matson and Andrews that legislation cannot be directly challenged pursuant to the CHRA. According to the Complainant, section 21 of the Act is a service customarily available to the general public to be provided in a non-discriminatory manner mandating the registration of documents covering land transactions between registered Indians of reserve land, without reference to other conditions or provisions of the Act. The Complainant argues that on a plain and ordinary reading of the words in section 21, the Indian Land Registrar was mandated to register the documents submitted to it in this case, without any reference to whether the transactions described in the documents were \"legally valid\" by virtue of other sections of the Act as interpreted by the Respondent that are not mentioned in section 21. For the Complainant, the engagement by the Respondent of the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle as a defence to the Complaints is irrelevant and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as his case represents the enforcement of, not a challenge to, mandatory legislation - namely section 21. Hence, the Complainant requests the Tribunal to strike from the Respondent's Statement of Particulars the paragraphs that he says refer to this principle.\n[11] According to the Respondent, section 21 of the Act is part of a statutory scheme that cannot be read alone without engaging other sections of the Act. Reading this section together with the other sections of the Act, including subsection 58(3), informs the proper interpretation of section 21. The service offered to the public is really the entire registration process which includes the step of registration detailed at section 21. The service is not limited to the step of registration alone. The Respondent argues that this process is provided for by mandatory legislation that the Registrar of Indian Lands cannot ignore. By registering documents pursuant to section 21 that are rendered invalid by other sections of the Act, the Registrar would act in violation of the legislation. As such, the Respondent takes the position that the Complaints seek to challenge mandatory legislation and nothing else, thereby invoking the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle that is a legitimate and key defence to the Complaints. The Respondent\u2019s position that it is erroneous to interpret section 21 in the absence of other provisions of the Indian Act does not constitute a challenge to legislation and the Respondent submits that, contrary to the Complainant\u2019s argument, the Murphy, Matson and Andrews principle does not apply in this regard. The Respondent further submits that pursuant to the principle, if the Complainant wants to challenge the legislative process, on the basis that is discriminatory, he must do so in a court as a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge, as the current legislation is mandatory and can only be changed by an amendment of the legislation, not by a decision of the Tribunal.\nIII. Issue\n[12] Should the Tribunal strike the paragraphs from the Respondent's Statement of Particulars as requested by the Complainant?\nIV. Legal framework governing motions to strike particulars\n[13] As the moving party, it is incumbent upon the Complainant to persuade the Tribunal that it should grant the motion to strike and deprive the Respondent, on a preliminary basis, from bringing forward the argument that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the Complaints as they constitute a direct challenge to legislation pursuant to the Murphy, Matson and Andrews decisions.\n[14] The Tribunal is master of its own proceedings (Subsection 50(3)(e) of the CHRA) and has the ability to reject portions of a complaint where appropriate. However, when asked to do so on a preliminary basis in the absence of a hearing, the Tribunal must exercise this discretion cautiously and only in the clearest of cases: Buffet v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 16 at para. 39. See also Desmarais v. Correctional Services of Canada, 2014 CHRT 5 at paras 82 - 84.\n[15] The CHRA already includes a screening function, performed by the Commission, and the Tribunal has the statutory obligation to provide parties with a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present evidence and make legal representations on the matters raised in the complaint (Subsection 50(1) of the CHRA). The Tribunal must also render its decision in compliance with the rules of natural justice: See Buffet at paras. 38-40; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (FNCFCS) aff\u2019d in Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2013 FCA 75 at paras. 125, 131-132,140.\n[16] These are the considerations which the Tribunal must weigh in determining whether or not the Complainant\u2019s motion to strike ought to be granted.\nV. Analysis\n[17] It is clear that the Complainant and the Respondent take completely opposite positions in their submissions on this motion about a fundamental issue. The fact that both parties have argued the merits of this issue rather than the motion to strike, supports the need for oral argument on this point. I am not persuaded by the Complainant that it would be fair, on a preliminary basis, in the absence of a hearing, to strike the paragraphs requested in the motion from the Respondent's Statement of Particulars, as they constitute a primary defence in this case worthy of being heard. To do so, in my view, would deprive the Respondent of its right to a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make legal representations on the matters raised in the Complaint.\nVI. Order\n[18] For the foregoing reasons the Complainant's motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P. Lustig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 23, 2015\n",

Confidentiality\n[1] During a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) held on October 6, 2014, I issued an Order of Confidentiality which read as follows:\nAs this motion raises issues about the confidential settlement process, I hereby order, pursuant to s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act that this case management call and all documents filed in this matter since the notice of settlement will be treated as confidential.\nI further order that parties are not to disclose any documents filed or received except in any judicial review proceedings taken under the Federal Courts Act. All documents filed on this motion as well as the recording of this call will be treated as confidential by the Tribunal. Of particular importance is the need to protect the confidentiality of the settlement agreement. No party shall disclose the settlement agreement, or any contents thereof, to anyone unless permission from the Tribunal has been obtained in advance.\n[2] In light of this Order which was intended to maintain confidentiality of the Minutes of Settlement, this Ruling will not delve into those details except to the extent necessary to rule upon the Motion. The Minutes of Settlement remain sealed by the Tribunal.\n[3] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant, Douglas George Cawson, on October 19, 2011, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). On December 7, 2012, the Commission, pursuant to s. 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the complaint. For the purposes of this decision, the allegations in the underlying complaint are not necessary for the Tribunal to delve into at this point in time. Prior to an Inquiry being held, this matter was settled by the parties via the Tribunal\u2019s voluntary mediation process.\n[4] This is a ruling concerning a Motion filed by the Complainant, seeking an order to re-open this case. The Complainant\u2019s grounds for the motion are that the Complainant alleges there was a breach of contract vis a vis the implementation of the Minutes of Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) and that he was pressured and\/or under duress during the Mediation process.\n[5] For the reasons given below, I am denying the Complainant's request.\nII. Background and Summary\n[6] On July 23, 2013, a Mediation was held between the Complainant, the Respondent and the Commission. This Mediation was conducted with the assistance of a Member of the Tribunal acting as Mediator.\n[7] At the conclusion of the Mediation, Minutes of Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) were signed by all parties.\n[8] The Settlement Agreement contained terms requiring the Respondent to pay specified amounts to the Complainant, upon the parties having received written confirmation from the Commission of approval of the settlement, within a defined period of time from that date.\n[9] By letter dated August 30, 2013, received by the Respondent on September 5, 2013, the Commission wrote to the Respondent indicating that the Settlement Agreement had been approved. The copy of the Settlement Agreement filed as part of this motion indicates the Settlement Agreement was signed and approved by the Commission on August 14, 2013.\n[10] On September 6, 2013, the Tribunal wrote to the parties noting that as the Settlement Agreement had been approved by the Commission, the Tribunal\u2019s file would be closed.\n[11] In a letter dated October 1 and 2, 2013 (Note: the Complainant wrote two letters, one dated October 1, 2013 and then a second dated October 2, 2013 which continued numbering from the first letter), the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal indicating that the Respondent has missed its deadlines for sending payment as had been specified in the Settlement Agreement. The Complainant alleged a breach of the contract, ie. the Settement Agreement, and that he felt the Mediator took sides, and further that the Complainant had had only 3 hours sleep the night before the Mediation which impacted him during the Mediation. The letter also went into depth on the substantive merits of his human rights complaint. The Complainant indicated he would like his file re-opened. This letter was not sent by the Complainant to the Respondent or the Commission.\n[12] In a letter dated November 4, 2013, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal, alleging that he felt he was not represented by the Mediator as well as he could have been, and that he felt the Mediator was in favour of the Respondent\u2019s interests. Again, he indicated that he and his wife had had minimal sleep the night before the Mediation. The Complainant also described how the Settlement Agreement and the Mediation process made him feel. The Complainant again made assertions and argument about the merits of his human rights complaint. Finally, the Complainant indicated that he did cash the first check he received from the Respondent and that he did not cash the second check received as it was late and he was \u201cglad when the second Air Canada check was late as it gave me the opportunity to express my view of my outcome \u2013 as to my mediation meeting. They slipped up. Good for me l (I Hope).\u201d Finally, the Complainant indicated he would like another chance at a Mediation or a Hearing. This letter was not provided to the Respondent or the Commission.\n[13] By letter dated February 12, 2014, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal indicating he would like to file a motion to re-open his case. This was the first time the Complainant advised the Tribunal he was bringing a Motion. The Complainant again mentioned that he felt he was not \u201crepresented\u201d fairly by the Mediator and how the process made him feel. He repeated some of the allegations contained in his previous letters and again argued the merits of his human rights complaints. He indicated that he did cash the first check received from the Respondent pursuant to the Settlement Agreement as it was for \u201cexpenses I had occurred etc. leading up to mediation hearing\u201d.\n[14] The Registrar of the Tribunal subsequently provided a copy of the Complainant\u2019s February 12, 2014 Notice of Motion to the Respondent and the Commission. The Tribunal set out a schedule for response submissions with all parties.\n[15] The Respondent filed their Response Submissions on March 17, 2014. Within those submissions, the Respondent opposed the Complainant\u2019s Motion on several grounds including that the Mediation process was followed, a valid settlement had been reached, the terms of the settlement had been adhered to, the Tribunal was functus officio, and that finality of a settlement must take precedence, ie. that there is a strong public policy interest in upholding the terms of a mutually agreed upon settlement.\n[16] The Complainant filed Reply submissions on March 27, 2014. Within those submissions, the Complainant went into details about the substance of his human rights complaint. Further, he states that he was not scared or afraid, but simply nervous and had not slept much the night before the Mediation. He goes on to assert that the Mediator was biased because the Mediator may have been involved in cases with the Respondent previously. He goes on to state that he was not happy with the outcome and analogized the Mediation process of negotiating to similar negotiations that occur when one is buying a car.\n[17] The Commission notified the Tribunal and all parties that it would not be making submissions on the Motion.\n[18] On October 6, 2014, a CMCC was held with all of the parties. A number of issues were addressed including the provision of the Settlement Agreement to the Tribunal, the aforementioned Confidentiality Order, and the provision to the Respondent of the pre-February 12, 2014 communications from the Complainant. Finally, the Respondent was given an opportunity to review those pre-February 2014 letters and then provide additional submissions.\n[19] The Respondent provided additional submissions on October 29, 2014. Among the additional arguments set forward were the Respondent\u2019s position that the Complainant had miscalculated the time limits in the Settlement Agreement for the Respondent to complete its obligations, that the Complainant cannot accept part of the Settlement Agreement and then goes on to argue the Settlement Agreement is void, and that the Complainant has not met the legal burden to show duress.\nIII. Analysis and Findings\n[20] The issues that I must determine are as follows:\nA) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over disputes relating to settlement agreements that have been approved by the Commission pursuant to section 48 of the CHRA?\nIf the Tribunal has jursidiction, then:\nB) Was there duress such that the Settlement Agreement should be voided?\nC) Was there a breach of the Settlement Agreement resulting in its nullity?\nA. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal over disputes relating to settlement agreements that have been approved by the Commission pursuant to section 48 of the CHRA\n[21] In its submissions, the Respondent questioned the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide the issues raised by the Complainant. Given the Tribunal had closed its file following the Commission\u2019s approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Respondent claims the Tribunal is functus officio. In general, I find the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over disputes relating to settlement agreements that have been approved by the Commission pursuant to section 48 of the CHRA.\n[22] The Tribunal\u2019s role under the CHRA is to institute inquiries into complaints referred to it by the Commission (ss. 49(2), 50) and determine whether a complaint is substantiated or not (s.53). As opposed to the Commission (see s. 47), the Tribunal does not have an explicit statutory mandate to conduct mediations. It offers mediation to parties on an informal and voluntary basis. That said, the Tribunal has seen much benefit in offering mediation to parties. With the human rights expertise and knowledge of a Tribunal Member acting as the mediator, parties can explore settlement possibilities that satisfactorily resolve a complaint for both parties, while saving the time, energy and cost of a hearing for both the parties and the Tribunal. If a case does not settle, a mediation session may nonetheless serve to narrow the issues in dispute or resolve procedural issues. Overall, mediation is an important tool the Tribunal utilizes to manage its case load and resolve human rights complaints informally and expeditiously (see s. 48.9(1)).\n[23] While the Tribunal does not have an explicit statutory mandate to conduct mediations, the CHRA does contemplate the possibility of settlements being reached prior to a hearing before the Tribunal:\n48. (1) When, at any stage after the filing of a complaint and before the commencement of a hearing before a Human Rights Tribunal in respect thereof, a settlement is agreed on by the parties, the terms of the settlement shall be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection.\n(2) If the Commission approves or rejects the terms of a settlement referred to in subsection (1), it shall so certify and notify the parties.\n(3) A settlement approved under this section may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court on application to that Court by the Commission or a party to the settlement.\n[24] Under the scheme of section 48 of the CHRA, the Commission\u2019s decision to approve the terms of a settlement has the effect of bringing an end to the human rights complaint and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over that complaint. It is also a decision that is subject to judicial review (see for example Johnson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FC 1021). Subsection 48(3) also provides for the Federal Court to resolve disputes over settlement agreements that have been approved by the Commission. Therefore, in my view, once a settlement agreement has been approved by the Commission, the Tribunal no longer has jurisdiction to deal with the human rights complaint that is the subject of the settlement, nor does it have jurisdiction to deal with disputes regarding that settlement agreement.\n[25] I also note that the willingness of parties to participate in mediation with the Tribunal may be undermined if parties who entered into a settlement of their human rights complaint were permitted to come forward, following approval of the settlement before the Commission, and attempt to pursue their settled complaint before the Tribunal. I agree with the following passage from Nolan v Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, 2014 HRTO 1604, at para. 43:\n\u2026 When two parties agree to settle a legal dispute, the principle of finality demands that the contract be given effect and prevents parties from litigating settled matters, unless there are compelling reasons to set the contract aside. Most litigation ends in settlements and almost all settlements include a provision by which a claimant fully releases the respondent from future claims relating to the subject matter of the settlement. To be effective, settlements must be final. Otherwise, parties would have no incentive to enter into settlements to end litigation. \u2026\n[26] While this paragraph of Nolan dealt with whether seeking to reopen a case that had been settled with a full and final release was an abuse of process, I find it also speaks well to the importance of Tribunals and courts upholding the finality of settlement agreements where there are no compelling reasons to set aside such settlement agreements.\n[27] In this case, following mediation with the Tribunal, the Complainant did not raise any issues with regard to the validity of the settlement agreement. The Commission then examined the settlement and approved it. The Complainant did not judicially review the Commission\u2019s decision to approve the settlement. If the Complainant has issues with the settlement agreement, or alternatively, if the Respondent wishes to have the agreement enforced, they are both at liberty to pursue the matter in Federal Court, as provided in the CHRA.\n[28] While there are cases where it has been recognized that administrative tribunals have jurisdiction over disputes relating to settlement agreements, (see for example Amos v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 38), I believe the specific statutory scheme of the CHRA distiniguishes the Tribunal in this regard (specifically s. 48).\n[29] For the reasons above, I do not believe the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the matters raised by the Complainant with regard to the settlement agreement.\n[30] In any event, and as explained in the following pages, I do not accept that the Settlement Agreement was agreed to under duress or that the Respondent breached its terms.\nB. Was there duress such that the Settlement Agreement should be voided?\n[31] The parties entered into a Settlement Agreement conducted by a Tribunal Member. The Commission was represented at the Mediation by an ADR Practitioner. The Mediation and the signing of the Settlement Agreement occurred on July 23, 2013.\n[32] The Complainant indicates in his letters to the Tribunal and his motion application that he felt the Mediator took sides and that he was not represented fairly by the Mediator. He also indicated that he was not scared or afraid, but simply nervous and had only slept 3 hours the night before the Mediation, which impacted him during the Mediation. He goes on to state that he was not happy with the outcome.\n[33] Dealing first with the role of the Mediator, the Tribunal\u2019s Evaluative Mediation Procedures clearly indicate that the role of a Tribunal Mediator is to assist and facilitate a Settlement Agreement amongst the parties. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluative Mediation Procedures were provided to all of the parties before the Mediation was conducted. Within those procedures, it quite clearly explains that the Tribunal Mediator is not there to represent either of the parties, and furthermore indicates that unrepresented parties have seven days from the signing of the Settlement Agreement to obtain legal advice and\/or withdraw from the Settlement. The Mediator\u2019s role is to facilitate discussions towards a settlement, not to provide legal advice to the parties. The Mediator and the Tribunal have no personal interest in the outcome of such Mediation nor is the Mediator a representative, lay representative or legal representative, of either of the parties. All parties are aware that the Mediator does not have the power to impose a settlement and\/or any conditions within a settlement. At the end of the day, the Complainant had the option of walking away from the Mediation and proceeding to a Hearing. Nowhere in the Complainant\u2019s materials does he assert that he was misled as to the role of the Mediator.\n[34] The Complainant in this case did not have legal counsel present with him during the Mediation. He was accompanied by his wife on July 23, 2013. The Complainant did not indicate in his materials whether he did or did not seek legal advice after July 23, 2013. It is clear that October 1 and 2, 2013 was the first time he contacted the Tribunal seeking to withdraw from the Settlement Agreement. Well after the 7 day cooling-off period provided for to unrepresented parties at a Tribunal Mediation.\n[35] That said, I must still consider whether the events during the Mediation amounted to duress. The legal threshold has been set out in the case of Taber v Paris Boutique & Bridal Inc, 2010 ONCA 157 at paragraph 9 which reads, referring to duress that can serve to make an agreement unenforceable against a party who was compelled by the duress to enter into it:\nHowever, not all pressure, economic or otherwise, can constitute duress sufficient to carry these legal consequences. It must have two elements: it must be pressure that the law regards as illegitimate; and it must be applied to such a degree as to amount to a \u201ca coercion of the will\u201d of the party relying on the concept.\n[36] There is nothing in the Complainant\u2019s materials that demonstrate he was under any illegitimate pressure to resolve, to accept the agreement being offered or negotiated with the Respondent or that he had no other alternative. He may have felt tired or not at his best because of the lack of sleep and most likely was nervous as many litigants do feel be they represented or not. This does not rise to the level of illegitimate pressure.\n[37] Mediation is a process that is designed to encourage parties to think about their options and sometimes doing a cost-benefit analysis of what is in their best interests. That the Mediator may have highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the Complainant\u2019s case to the Complainant, the length of time to get to a Hearing and the possible continued stress throughout the process until a decision is rendered are factors a Mediator may highlight in order to assist a party in considering his or her course of action. Highlighting those factors does not amount to coercion of the will such that the Complainant was left with no choice but to settle. Such explanations or highlighting by the Mediator cannot be construed as placing someone under illegitimate duress. In fact, a benefit of a Tribunal Mediation conducted by Tribunal Members, is that a party in mediation has the benefit of hearing about the strengths, weaknesses and challenges in their case from a Member familiar with Tribunal jurisprudence. This can assist the party in making an informed decision about how to proceed with their case. A party may find it difficult to hear the opinion of their case, especially if there are more weaknesses than strengths; ultimately, the party still has the power to decide whether to proceed to a Hearing.\n[38] It must be noted that under the Tribubal\u2019s Evaluative Mediation Procedures, in most cases, the Member who mediates a case is not the Member who will preside at the Hearing. In only those cases where all parties consent would the Tribunal Member who mediated a case then go on to be the Member who adjudicates at the Hearing. Without all parties\u2019 consent, a different Member would be assigned to adjudicate at the Hearing. Furthermore, the Tribunal\u2019s Mediation process is entirely confidential such that all information exchanged and communicated during the Mediation process (including the exchange of documents prior to and during a Mediation) do not get shared with any other Tribunal Members should the Mediation not result in a Settlement Agreement. This provides the parties with the confidence that should they choose to proceed to a Hearing, they will be protected by having an independent and impartial decision maker who comes to the Hearing without any prior knowledge of information exchanged during the Mediation process.\n[39] Thus, I conclude that the examples of pressure referred to by the Complainant do not amount to or reach the threshold of duress according to the jurisprudence previously cited. While the Complainant felt pressure during the Mediation, he has not alleged that he could not have rejected the Settlement terms that were offered to him by the Respondent. Furthermore, the procedures at Tribunal Mediations are specifically structured to give an unrepresented Complainant, as in this case, 7 days to \u201ccool down\u201d and make a final decision outside the pressures of the Mediation room.\nC. Was there a breach of the settlement agreement resulting in a nullity?\n[40] The Complainant alleges that the Respondent missed its deadlines for sending payment as had been specified in the Settlement Agreement. Specifically, the Complainant argues (in his letter to the Tribunal of October 1) that he received Check #1 on September 25, 2013 which he had calculated as being 65 days after the signing of the Settlement Agreement. He indicates that Check #2 arrived on October 2, 2013 and in his February 12, 2014 Motion alleges it was this, the second check, which was late thus causing a breach of the contract.\n[41] Numbered paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement reads as follows:\n1) Within fourty-five (45) days of receipt of the letter from the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) advising that it has approved this settlement, the Respondent shall:\nA) Give to the Complainant $XX [1] number of dollars as payment for pain and suffering against which no taxable deductions will be applied.\nB) Give to the Complainant $XX [2] number of dollars as wages against which statutory deductions will be applied.\n[emphasis added]\n[42] While the Settlement Agreement was approved by the Commission on August 14, 2013, neither of the parties asserted that it was aware of the approval on that date.\n[43] In fact, communication of the approval did not occur until September 4, 2013 from the Commission\u2019s counsel. The Commission approved the Settlement Agreement and a cover letter dated August 30, 2013 was received by the Respondent on September 5, 2013.\n[44] The obligation upon the Respondent to comply with paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement only started the clock ticking upon the Respondent having received a letter from the Commission advising the Respondent that the Commission had approved the Settlement. It is clear to me then that the clock in this case for the purposes of calculating the 45 days agreed to between the Complainant and the Respondent, is September 5, 2013.\n[45] Check #1 according to the Complainant arrived on September 25, 2013. Twenty days after the Respondent received notification of the Commission\u2019s approval of the Settlement Agreement. Check #2 arrived on October 2, 2013, which is 27 days after the Commission notified the Respondent, in writing, of the Commission\u2019s approval of the Settlement Agreement.\n[46] Clearly, the Respondent did not breach the contract as it did provide the checks within the 45 days agreed to.\n[47] The Complainant was mistaken in calculating the 45 day time limit from either the date the Settlement Agreement was signed between the Complainant and the Respondent and\/or calculating from the date the Commission actually approved the Settlement Agreement. The clock only began once the parties had received written notification of the approval.\n[48] Even if the clock were to have begun on September 4, 2013, the date on which Commission Counsel notified the Respondent that the Commission had approved the Settlement Agreement or if August 30, 2013 were used, the date on which the Commission sent their letter, the two checks arrived within 45 calendar days to what had been agreed to.\n[49] Thus, I find that there was no breach of the Settlement Agreement.\n[50] I find it necessary to comment upon the fact that the Complainant chose to accept partial satisfaction of the Settlement Agreement and then subsequently seeks to void the entire Settlement Agreement. Specifically, the Complainant indicated that he received the first check from the Respondent agreed to in Paragraph 1 A) of the Settlement Agreement. The Complainant indicated in his materials that it he had cashed it for it was for \u201cexpenses I had occurred etc. leading up to mediation hearing\u201d. The Settlement Agreement quite clearly states that the first check was for \u201cpain and suffering\u201d presumably referring to the damages the Tribunal may award pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. The Complainant cannot take active steps to accept part of the Settlement Agreement, in this case, depositing and cashing the check, and then later on attempt to claim the entire Settlement Agreement is void. His positive steps further demonstrated that he had accepted the Settlement Agreement.\n[51] Accordingly, this motion to reopen the case is denied.\n[52] There remains one issue that must be addressed. As recounted above, the Settlement Agreement provided for the provision of two checks to the Complainant. The Complainant acknowledges he received both checks, but only cashed the first one. It is my understanding that checks are valid in Canada for a period of 6 months from the date on such checks. As such, due to the passage of time in this case, the second check would now have expired. Thus, it will be necessary for the Respondent to provide a new check in the same amounts of the second check to the Complainant.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 21, 2015\n[1] Note that the actual amount stipulated in the Settlement Agreement is confidential as per the agreement between the Parties and the Confidentiality Order described earlier in this Ruling.\n[2] Ibid.\n",

Complaint & Background\n[1] On May 21, 2008, Ms. Tabor filed a complaint alleging Millbrook First Nation (Millbrook) had a practice of depriving women, including herself, employment opportunities in its fishery pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). She also alleged Millbrook denied her employment opportunities because of her marital status.\n[2] On January 16, 2009, Ms. Tabor filed a subsequent complaint under section 14.1 of the CHRA alleging Millbrook retaliated against her for having filed her first complaint.\n[3] Both complaints were referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) on March 7, 2011. On April 10, 2013, the Tribunal rendered a ruling to amend the complaint to add further allegations of retaliation (see Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2013 CHRT 9). The complaints were heard together in Truro, Nova Scotia from July 28 to August 7, 2014; and, on September 16, 2014. In Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2015 CHRT 9 (Tabor #1), I found Ms. Tabor\u2019s section 7 and 10 complaint to be substantiated. The following decision deals with Ms. Tabor\u2019s retaliation complaint.\n[4] After hearing from the parties and reviewing all the evidence before me, I find the retaliation complaint is also substantiated in part.\nII. Analysis\nA. Legal Framework\n[5] Section 14.1 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[6] The onus of establishing retaliation rests on the complainant, who must present a prima facie case. That is, the complainant must provide evidence which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict that the respondent retaliated against him or her (see Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28 [O\u2019Malley]). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, complainants are required to show that they have made a complaint under the CHRA; that they experienced adverse treatment following the filing of their complaint from the person they filed a complaint against or any person acting on their behalf; and, that the human rights complaint was a factor in the adverse treatment (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33).\n[7] To prove a previous human rights complaint was a factor in any adverse treatment a complainant suffered, the Tribunal has sometimes required the complainant to establish proof of an intention to retaliate (see Virk v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 2; Malec, Malec, Kaltush, Ishpatao, Tettaut, Malec, Mest\u00e9pap\u00e9o, Kaltush v. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 CHRT 2; and, Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation & Raj Thambirajah, 2012 CHRT 29). Others have examined a complainant\u2019s reasonable perception that the act is retaliatory instead of requiring proof of intent (see Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (CHRT); and Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40). In the second group of cases, the reasonableness of the complainant\u2019s perception is measured so as not to hold the respondent accountable for unreasonable anxiety or undue reaction by the complainant.\n[8] In my view, to require proof of intent in order to establish retaliation places a higher burden to substantiate this discriminatory practice than for any of the others outlined in the CHRA. This is not consistent with a broad and liberal interpretation of the CHRA or human rights legislation in general (see First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2015 CHRT 14 at paras. 3-28).\n[9] Retaliation is a discriminatory practice under the CHRA (see sections 4 and 39 of the CHRA). The CHRA is primarily aimed at eliminating discrimination, not punishing those who discriminate. Therefore, \u201cthe motives or intention of those who discriminate are not central to its concerns\u201d (Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), 1987 CanLII 73 (SCC) at para. 10 [Robichaud]) Rather, the CHRA is \u201c\u2026directed to redressing socially undesirable conditions quite apart from the reasons for their existence\u201d (Robichaud at para. 10). Furthermore, to require proof of intent to establish discrimination would \u201c\u2026place a virtually insuperable barrier in the way of a complainant seeking a remedy\u201d as \u201c[i]t would be extremely difficult in most circumstances to prove motive\u2026\u201d (O\u2019Malley at paragraph 14). As the Tribunal has stated many times: \u201cDiscrimination is not a practise which one would expect to see displayed overtly\u201d (Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT)).\n[10] There are also important policy considerations underlying section 14.1 of the CHRA that militate against requiring proof of intent in order to substantiate a retaliation claim. A prohibition on retaliation safeguards the integrity of the CHRA complaint process by providing protection for complainants who may be hesitant to exercise their rights under the CHRA for fear of reprisal. It also provides an assurance that, if reprisal is taken against them as a result of the filing of a complaint, redress will be provided. This section may also serve to deter those who might retaliate. Requiring intent to establish retaliation may defeat these purposes behind section 14.1.\n[11] In fact, prior to the inclusion of section 14.1, retaliation was treated as a summary conviction offence under sections 59 and 60 of CHRA. Under those sections, there were few retaliation prosecutions, and those launched had generally been unsucessful. That was because it was hard to meet the criminal requirements needed to secure a conviction in those cases: proof beyond a reasonable doubt that action was taken against a complainant with the intent to retaliate. As a result, Parliament decided the CHRA would be better suited than the criminal courts to deal with retaliation cases (see Parliament of Canada, Legislative Summary-298E, Bill S-5: An Act to Amend the Canada Evidence Act, the Criminal Code, and the Canadian Human Rights Act by Nancy Holmes (Law and Governance Division, 1998) at C3, online: Parliament of Canada <http:\/\/www.parl.gc.ca\/About\/Parliament\/LegislativeSummaries\/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&ls=S5&Parl=36&Ses=1>).\n[12] For these reasons, I do not believe a complainant should be required to prove intent in order to substantiate a retaliation claim under the CHRA. In my view, a complainant must simply present sufficient evidence to justify that their human rights complaint was a factor in any alleged adverse treatment they received from a respondent following the filing of their complaint, whether based on a reasonable perception thereof or otherwise. If sufficient evidence is presented to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, it is then the Tribunal\u2019s role to consider the complainant\u2019s evidence, alongside any evidence presented by the respondent, to determine whether it is more probable than not that retaliation has occurred.\nB. Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegations of retaliation\n[13] Ms. Tabor presented a series of allegations of retaliation. She claims Millbrook (1) interfered with her fisheries research position; (2) took improper action against her under its social welfare system; (3) delayed issuing a possession certificate, and subsequently took improper action against her and her family, with regard to her late father\u2019s residence on Millbrook First Nation; (4) charged her for the cost of a new stove when it usually pays for this cost; (5) held her accountable for cheques issued in her name, to be held in trust for a minor, but which were fraudultently cashed by another person; (6) refused to pay her power bill when it usually pays for this cost; (7) denied her travel funds to take a job exam in Halifax when it usually pays for this cost; (8) required her to pay rent; and, (9) denied her a work placement at Millbrook\u2019s Health Centre.\n[14] I find the allegations regarding the fisheries research position and the denial of travel funds to be substantiated. The other allegations are dismissed.\n(i) Substantiated allegations\n(a) Interference with fisheries research position\n[15] On June 23, 2008, Ms. Tabor applied for a research position in the project: \u201cA Study of the Critical Success Factors in the First Nation Fishery in Atlantic Canada\u201d. The position was offered as a partnership between the Atlantic Policy Congress Council of First Nations Chiefs and Memorial University. Millbrook\u2019s Chief at the time, Chief Lawrence Paul, was a Co-Chair of the Atlantic Policy Congress\u2019 Executive Committee during this time.\n[16] On June 26, 2008, Ms. Tabor was hired by Dr. Tom Cooper to work on the research project. Mr. Terrence Hickey was also working on the project with Dr. Cooper. The project required them, amongst other things, to travel to First Nation communities to meet with fishers to collect data and record their views on the research topic.\n[17] Given that Millbrook was on the list of communities to be visited for the research project, Ms. Tabor informed Dr. Cooper, by email on July 27, 2008, of the discrimination complaint she had recently filed against the First Nation. Ms. Tabor\u2018s evidence is that Dr. Cooper did not anticipate any issues, but would discuss it with Mr. Hickey.\n[18] No issues arose until Dr. Cooper and Mr. Hickey arrived in Nova Scotia to begin the interviews. When Ms. Tabor met with both Dr. Cooper and Mr. Hickey in Truro on September 4, 2008, they informed her that Millbrook Chief Lawrence Paul had communicated to them his reluctance to allow Millbrook\u2019s Fishery to participate in the research project should Ms. Tabor be on their team. Ms. Tabor described Dr. Cooper\u2019s statement to her as being that she should get out of Millbrook because they do not like her there. Ms. Tabor told Dr. Cooper that she did not want to jeopardize the project and would resign if need be. Dr. Cooper and Mr. Hickey told her she could stay on the research team and that their boss would not accept Dr. Cooper and Mr. Hickey`s behaviour should they accept her resignation for this reason.\n[19] However, on September 17, 2008, Dr. Cooper called Ms. Tabor to inform her that he was now willing to accept her previous offer to resign given Millbrook would not participate in the research study if she remained on their team. Ms. Tabor did not work on the research project after this date.\n[20] As a result, Ms. Tabor believes that the filing of her complaint was a factor that led to the termination of her contract with the fisheries research project.\n[21] Mr. Alex Cope, a Band Councilor and the Band Administrator for Millbrook, testified on this issue. He claims to have never spoken to either Dr. Cooper or Mr. Hickey, nor was he aware of any negative communications made to them about Ms. Tabor. He also states Millbrook did not encourage fishers to resist participating in the study because of Ms. Tabor\u2019s involvement.\n[22] Neither Mr. Hickey nor Dr. Cooper testified before the Tribunal. Rather, Mr. Hickey provided an affidavit, which was attached as an exhibit to Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit; and, Dr. Cooper provided an affidavit that was presented as an exhibit at the hearing. Neither affidavit was tendered for the truth of its contents.\n[23] In his affidavit, Mr. Hickey states that, while he and Dr. Cooper were initially supposed to meet with Millbrook Fisheries on September 4, 2008, the meeting was canceled.\n[24] Mr. Hickey states that when he and Dr. Cooper met with Ms. Tabor later that day, there was no conversation about anything that was said by Chief Lawrence Paul. Rather, he states Ms. Tabor spontaneously said that if either he or Dr. Cooper wished to dismiss her she would walk away right there and then and nothing would ever be mentioned. According to Mr. Hickey, Ms. Tabor\u2019s comment was made without any prior context and as such he disregarded it. On September 17, 2008, Dr. Cooper told Mr. Hickey that he had informed Ms. Tabor that her services were no longer required.\n[25] Dr. Cooper\u2019s affidavit has some additional information then that of Mr. Hickey\u2019s affidavit, however, certain paragraphs are identically worded. Around July 2, 2008, Dr. Cooper states that he spoke with Ms. Tabor on the phone at which time she informed him that she currently had a lawsuit ongoing against the Millbrook Chief and council. According to Dr. Cooper, he therefore advised Ms. Tabor that she would be responsible for the Pictou Landing and Indian Brook First Nations interviews and, because of her lawsuit, he informed her that he did not want her to contact or be involved with Millbrook Fisheries.\n[26] Exactly like Mr. Hickey, Dr. Cooper states that, while he and Mr. Hickey met with Ms. Tabor on September 4, 2008, there was no conversation about anything that was said by Chief Lawrence Paul. Rather, Ms. Tabor spontaneously said that if either he or Mr. Hickey wished to dismiss her she would walk away right there and then and nothing would ever be mentioned. Again, like Mr. Hickey, Dr. Cooper states this comment was made without any prior context and as such he disregarded it.\n[27] With regard to Ms. Tabor\u2019s termination, Dr. Cooper states:\n12. THAT after returning from Nova Scotia I was informed [\u2026] that Stacey Tabor went to the Millbrook Chief Council and informed them that she worked for the Atlantic Policy Congress and that she needed to set up meetings to interview Millbrook Fishermen.\n13. THAT upon hearing that Ms. Tabor contacted the Millbrook Fisheries after being told that she was dealing with Pictou Landing and Indian Brook Fisheries only, I called Ms. Tabor on or about September 17, 2008 and reminded her that she should not have contacted the Millbrook Fisheries and told her that her services were no longer required and thanked her for the work done.\n[28] I find Mr. Hickey and Dr. Cooper\u2019s affidavits bear little weight given they were not called to elaborate or clarify their affidavits, nor were their statements tested under cross-examination. However, aside from the fact that Mr. Hickey and Dr. Cooper did not appear before the Tribunal, their statements are not consistent with the preponderance of evidence on this issue of retaliation.\n[29] First, Ms. Tabor filed in evidence a chain of emails between her and Mr. Hickey, which contradict Dr. Cooper\u2019s statement about him not wanting Ms. Tabor to contact or be involved with Millbrook Fisheries. On August 28, 2008, Mr. Hickey wrote to Ms. Tabor and Dr. Cooper:\nGood afternoon Tom and Stacy, Adrian Gloade of Millbrook has asked that we gi [words cut off] Pictou Landing. Email does not work well when it comes to communicating. Nei [words cut off].\n[30] Later that same day, Ms. Tabor wrote back to Mr. Hickey:\nhi terry,\nif you wish i could give adrian a briefing about the survey and inform him of your intentions for next week. give me a call in the morning or email me. stacy\n[31] Again that same day, Mr. Hickey responded to Ms. Tabor:\nHi Stacy,\nPlease feel free-we would very much appreciate it!\nThanks\n[32] On September 4, 2008 Mr. Hickey wrote to Ms. Tabor:\nHi Stacy,\nJust checking to see if Adrian had mentioned if there was a particular time which would be good for him to meet with us?\nAlso what is your schedule like for the day?\nThanks\nTerry\n[33] If Mr. Hickey instructed Ms. Tabor to contact Millbrook, why would he then accept that as a reasonable basis for Dr. Cooper to no longer keep her on the research team. This email chain contradicts Dr. Cooper\u2019s affidavit and Mr. Hickey says nothing about it in his affidavit. Therefore, I find Mr. Hickey and Dr. Cooper\u2019s statements regarding the termination of Ms. Tabor\u2019s services to the research team to be unreliable.\n[34] Second, both Mr. Hickey and Dr. Cooper state Ms. Tabor spontaneously said that if either of them wished to dismiss her she would walk away right there and then and nothing would ever be mentioned. They say this comment was made without any prior context and as such they disregarded it. I also find this statement to be unreliable. Why would Ms. Tabor, who just started as a Research Assistant, volunteer to be dismissed for no apparent reason. Similarly, why would Mr. Hickey and Dr. Cooper simply disregard a comment of this nature, especially given both were aware of Ms. Tabor\u2019s human rights complaint against Millbrook. This explanation is simply not reasonable, especially given that Ms. Tabor confirmed she offered to resign from her position on the research team if her involvement became a stumbling block.\n[35] Overall, I believe Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence about Millbrook interfering with her work on the fisheries research team and this interference ultimately being a factor in Dr. Cooper no longer requiring her services. Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence on this issue was detailed and credible, and was not challenged under cross-examination.\n[36] Millbrook\u2019s evidence in response to her allegations was of little value and, for the reasons outlined above, I found that evidence to be unreliable and unreasonable. I find it more probable than not that Millbrook refused to participate in the research project if Ms. Tabor remained involved. Ultimately, this was a factor in Ms. Tabor losing her role as a Research Assistant on the project. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find Millbrook retaliated against Ms. Tabor pursuant to section 14.1 of the CHRA.\n(b) Denial of travel funds\n[37] Ms. Tabor alleges Millbrook made it difficult for her to access funding to upgrade her job qualifications and education.\n[38] In 2009, she applied to Millbrook for funding for her and her husband, Mr. Craig Tabor, to travel to Halifax to take an exam for qualification as a Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Officer. Ms. Tabor explained that such an officer is responsible for patrolling shore lines for illegal fishing and performs research on such things as habitat and migration.\n[39] Ms. Tabor contacted Mr. Bill Pictou, Millbrook\u2019s Employment Training Officer, to request these funds. According to Ms. Tabor, Mr. Pictou told her that she was not entitled to funds because she was already a student at Nova Scotia Community College.\n[40] Ms. Tabor subsequently contacted Ms. Margaret Poulette, a welfare clerk for Millbrook Social Developement, and asked her if there was anything that her department could do to fund her travel to Halifax. Ms. Poulette indicated to Ms. Tabor that she contact the fisheries office and speak with Michelle Gloade.\n[41] When Ms. Tabor contacted the fisheries office, she claims Mr. Thomas Gloade hung up on her after she identified herself. She called Ms. Poulette back and explained what had occurred. Ms. Poulette contacted the fisheries office and had them call Ms. Tabor back.\n[42] Michelle Gloade, from the fisheries office, called Ms. Tabor back and apologized for Mr. Gloade\u2019s actions. Ms. Gloade indicated that she would present Ms. Tabor\u2019s request for funding to Mr. Adrian Gloade, Millbrook\u2019s Fisheries Manager.\n[43] A few days later, Ms. Tabor contacted Ms. Gloade and asked whether a decision had been made regarding her request for funding. Ms. Gloade told Ms. Tabor that her request had been denied.\n[44] Ms. Tabor then contacted Ms. Poulette again to see if there was anything else she could do. Ms. Poulette offered to put Ms. Tabor in contact with Mr. Barry Martin, Social Development Administrator for Millbrook Social Development.\n[45] Mr. Martin contacted Ms. Tabor and allocated funds from her house maintenance budget to pay her travel to Halifax.\n[46] Ms. Tabor argues she in effect paid for her travel to Halifax herself by sacrificing a portion of her entitlement to house maintenance. She claims Millbrook should therefore reimburse her house maintenance fund.\n[47] According to Mr. Cope, it is accurate that Millbrook has made it difficult for Ms. Tabor to access funding for education and training. This is because Ms. Tabor has a history of commencing training but failing to complete all or various stages of it. As a result, any training Ms. Tabor applies for receives a higher degree of scrutiny. According to Mr. Cope, Ms. Tabor\u2019s treatment had nothing to do with her human rights complaint, but is based on her record of performance. In testimony, he added that Millbrook follows Service Canada\u2019s standards and guidelines for funding courses. Based on those standards and as funds are limited, a person cannot receive funding as a \u201cprofessional student\u201d. They must chose one trade, and cannot study many trades. As Ms. Tabor was already studying as an medical assistant at the time, Millbrook would not fund her travel to take the DFO exam.\n[48] Millbrook\u2019s response here is almost identical to its response in Tabor #1 regarding Ms. Tabor\u2019s difficulty in getting funding for captain\u2019s training. That is, Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit stated Millbrook was reluctant to pay for Ms. Tabor\u2019s captain\u2019s training course in 1998 because she had previously enrolled in the training in 1997, but did not finish it. However, in his testimony, Mr. Cope came up with an entirely different reason for initially denying her funding in 1998. I found this new explanation was in response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony as to why she did not complete the course in 1997: it was to take care of her father who was ill. This explanation was not challenged by Millbrook and I found it to be a legitimate reason for dropping out of the course in 1997. Overall, I found Millbrook\u2019s explanation for Ms. Tabor\u2019s difficulty in getting funding for her captain\u2019s training to be unreliable and unconvincing (see Tabor #1 at paras. 72-82).\n[49] Millbrook advances a similar argument in response to this retaliation allegation. In my view, this reponse is again pretextual.\n[50] Aside from when she did not complete her captain\u2019s training in 1997 to take care of her ill father, the overall evidence does not support Mr. Cope\u2019s assertion that Ms. Tabor has a history of commencing training but failing to complete all or various stages of it. Rather, the evidence presented to the Tribunal on Ms. Tabor\u2019s training was that she successfully completed a Master Limited certificate in 1998, along with other marine training certificates in simulated electronic navigation, marine emergency duties, and proficiency in radio. The Tribunal also heard how Ms. Tabor completed a Medical Office Assistant program in 2010.\n[51] Interestingly, in his affidavit, Mr. Cope states Mr. Tabor also has a history of applying for funding and not commencing or finishing the training. Again, the evidence does not support this statement. In response, Mr. Tabor testified that on one occasion he was denied funding for a crane course on the basis of not having completed a previous course. In reality, Mr. Tabor had completed the previous course. When he contacted Millbrook to address the issue, it was determined that the First Nation had mistaken Mr. Tabor for his brother. Ultimately, Mr. Tabor received funding for the crane course from another source and completed the training.\n[52] In my view, Ms. Tabor\u2019s human rights complaint was a factor in Millbrook\u2019s denial of travel funds to her. This situation arose after the filing of her complaint and Millbrook had knowledge of the complaint. Furthermore, Ms. Tabor testified that she felt blocked by Millbrook at every turn by it continually denying her opportunities. In my view, Ms. Tabor\u2019s perception is reasonable given she was also denied the opportunity to fish, which was found to be discriminatory in Tabor #1, and the opportunity to participate in fisheries research, which was found to be a retaliatory action earlier in this decision. Mr. Tabor\u2019s experience also reinforces Ms. Tabor\u2019s perception.\n[53] Mr. Cope\u2019s explanation for why Millbrook denied travel funds to Ms. Tabor also reinforces her perception of retaliation. As mentioned above, the evidence does not support Mr. Cope\u2019s claim that Ms. Tabor has a history of commencing training but failing to complete all or various stages of it. In fact, the evidence presented to the Tribunal on Ms. Tabor\u2019s training indicates the opposite. Furthermore, no documentation was filed to support Millbrook\u2019s assertion that the denial of funds was based on the application of Service Canada guidelines or standards. Ultimately, I do not find Millbrook\u2019s explanation in response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegation to be reliable. Therefore, on this issue, when Millbrook\u2019s evidence is weighed against that of Ms. Tabor, I find it more probable than not that Millbrook retaliated against Ms. Tabor.\n(ii) Unsubstantiated allegations\n[54] Often, when someone has experienced discrimination over a long period of time, and it is exacerbated by retaliation for filing a complaint, that person may perceive all actions that impact them negatively as retaliation, especially when they involve the same people named in the discrimination complaint or people connected to them. However, it is not necessarily the case that every adverse situation following the filing of a complaint is in the nature of retaliation. I find this to be the case with regard to Ms. Tabor\u2019s remaining allegations of retaliation. As outlined in Tabor #1, there is a history of conflict between the parties. I believe some of Ms. Tabor\u2019s remaining allegations of retaliation may have arisen out of that history of conflict. Others appear to be a simple misunderstanding or a result of human error. This summarizes my reasons for finding Ms. Tabor\u2019s remaining allegations of retaliation to be unsubstantiated. I will now address each allegation in turn.\n(a) Improper action under social welfare system\n[55] Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook retaliated against her by miscalculating her social assistance payments and then claiming she repay some of those payments in the amount of $10,447.87.\n[56] On her 2010 application for social assistance, Ms. Tabor claimed she had no income when in fact she had been working part-time. She explained that she had been informed that if an applicant works two days or less a week then, they did not have to disclose the income for it. Additionally, the income was from a work term that arose from an administrative assistant course she was taking. This also led her to believe that she was not required to claim it as income on her social assistance application.\n[57] Millbrook claimed both Ms. Tabor and her husband were not entitled to collect social assistance in 2010 as they were working at the time and had a combined household income exceeding the entitlement to collect social assistance.\n[58] Ms. Tabor appealed Millbrook\u2019s decision to the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada Income Assistance Appeal Board (the Board). The Board found that Millbrook, in the absence of a detailed verification of Ms. Tabor\u2019s earnings by pay period, used estimates of earned income to determine her eligibility for social assistance. As Ms. Tabor had an onus to produce those records to Millbrook, the Board granted Ms. Tabor 30 days to produce the records to Millbrook. If she did not, the income estimates initially used by Millbrook would be the basis for calculating her eligibility.\n[59] Ms. Tabor provided Millbrook with the records identified by the Board within 30 days. However, Millbrook initially wrote to the Board stating Ms. Tabor had not provided the records. In correspondence to the Tribunal dated August 28, 2012, Millbrook stated this was an \u201cerror\u201d on its part and, in a letter of the same date, forwarded Ms. Tabor\u2019s records to the Board. Based on the records provided by Ms. Tabor, Millbrook maintained she was overpayed social assistance payments, but reduced the amount to $10,148.00.\n[60] Ms. Tabor has again appealed Millbrook\u2019s decision to the Board claiming Millbrook did not take into account certain income deductions.\n[61] Millbrook claims Ms. Tabor knowingly misrepresented her earnings in 2010 in order to apply and qualify for social assitance. Although there was an error in the original audit of Ms. Tabor\u2019s social assistance payments, based on a mistake in a T4 issued to Mr. Tabor from the Native Council of Nova Scotia, that error did not change the end result: Ms. Tabor was not eligible for social assistance in 2010. Millbrook argues Ms. Tabor has conceded she made misrepresentations on her social assistance application, but qualifies them as mistakes. According to Millbrook, Ms. Tabor was caught in a routine audit that was fair and transparent and compelled to repay money for valid reasons. Therefore, in its view, there is no merit to her allegations of retaliation on this issue.\n[62] At the hearing, the parties presented much argument on the merits of this social welfare dispute. However, it is not for the Tribunal to determine whether Ms. Tabor was or was not entitled to social assistance payments or in what amount. There is a specialized board and appeal process for dealing with that issue and the parties are currently pursuing that option. The Tribunal\u2019s role is to assess Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegations that Millbrook subjected her to an audit and miscalculated her social assistance payments in retaliation for her human rights complaint.\n[63] While Millbrook made an error in calculating Ms. Tabor\u2019s social assistance payments based on Mr. Tabor\u2019s T4, that error was based on a mistake by the Native Council of Nova Scotia. The fact that Ms. Tabor attributes that mistake to Millbrook leads me to believe that Ms. Tabor\u2019s perception of retaliation on this issue is unreasonable and, in my view, is an effect of the deteriorating relationship between the parties over the past years, including discrimination. I am also not convinced that Millbrook audited Ms. Tabor in retaliation for her human rights complaint. Insufficient evidence was led to establish any retaliatory purpose behind Millbrook\u2019s actions, and Ms. Tabor\u2019s misrepresentation of her income does not assist her case here. I believe Ms. Tabor when she says her misrepresentations were an honest mistake based on an erroneous understanding of her income reporting obligations. However, this does not convince me that Millbrook retaliated against Ms. Tabor.\n(b) Refusal to pay power bill\n[64] Related to the allegation of improper action by Millbrook against Ms. Tabor under the First Nation\u2019s social welfare system, Ms. Tabor explained that in 2008, when the Tabors needed assistance to pay their bills, she also forwarded her Nova Scotia power bill to Millbrook Social Development for payment. She stated that she and other members of the community had done this in the past and Millbrook had paid the bills. In her testimony, Ms. Tabor even suggested she knew of some members of the community who were not on social assistance, but were working, and still had their power bills paid for by Millbrook.\n[65] On May 1, 2008, Ms. Tabor received the following letter from Millbrook Social Development:\nWhile Millbrook Social Development has generously provided assistance to you in the past for your Nova Scotia Power account, assistance in the future cannot be expected on a regular basis. Unfortunately, several of you have become too accustomed to simply forwarding your bills to our office, with no explanation as to why you require assistance paying your bills, or any appreciation for previous payment on your behalf.\nPlease be advised that, effective immediately, you are required to provide your request for assistance in writing, or in person, to Barry Martin, Social Development Administrator. You are also required to make some efforts of your own, and proof of these efforts (with original receipts showing your payments), along with your request prior to requests for additional assistance from our department. Remember, it is a courtesy of this department to assist you, on occasion. We are not obligated to make any of your payments.\n[66] I note the May 1, 2008 letter pre-dates Ms. Tabor\u2019s section 7 and 10 complaint, which was filed later on May 20, 2008. This is enough to dispose of this allegation given Millbrook\u2019s refusal to pay the power bill could not have been in response to the complaint. In any event, insufficient evidence was presented to support Ms. Tabor\u2019s claim that, while other members of the community had their power bills paid for, Millbrook refused to pay hers. Presumably, if she knew this was the case, further evidence in the form of witness testimony or documentation could have been provided. Ms. Tabor\u2019s generalized statement to this effect is not sufficient to convince me of any retaliation on behalf of Millbrook on this issue.\n(c) Late father\u2019s residence\n[67] Ms. Tabor claims that, when her father died, he asked Millbrook that his home be held in trust by Ms. Tabor for his eldest grandson, Ms. Tabor\u2019s son, until he came of age. Millbrook agreed to the request and made an arrangement with Ms. Tabor whereby it would give her a certificate of possession under which she would hold the property in trust for her son. Until her son came of age, Ms. Tabor was to rent out the house and place the money in a trust fund for him.\n[68] Millbrook did not issue a certificate of possession for the property for approximately two years. However, Ms. Tabor allowed some members of Millbrook, who were on social assistance, to live in the house in the meantime. These occupants did not have a set rent and only paid what they could. Given that social assistance recipients receive a housing allowance, Millbrook required Ms. Tabor to pay back portions of those tenants\u2019 social assistance benefits. Also, prior to the certificate of possession being issued, Millbrook required Ms. Tabor to maintain the yard of the property.\n[69] Ms. Tabor claims she was not responsible for rentals or maintenance at the property until the certificate of possession was issued. By requiring her to pay back social assistance benefits, maintain the yard and, in the meantime, delaying issuance of the certificate of possession, Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook retaliated against her.\n[70] In relation to this allegation, Ms. Tabor also claims oil deliveries were made to her father\u2019s home and were billed to her even though there was a person residing in the home who was receiving social assistance. She believes Millbrook\u2019s social assistance program should have been billed for those deliveries. In this regard, Ms. Tabor notes oil deliveries were also made to her own home and were billed to Millbrook\u2019s social assistance program despite her not being on social assistance at the time.\n[71] Mr. Cope testified that, it is the person who is applying for the certificate of possession that is responsible to request a Band Council resolution approving the allocation. According to him, Ms. Tabor did not apply for a certificate of possession until May 2011. From then, it took only two months for the certificate of possession to be issued. Millbrook argues, even without the certificate of possession, Ms. Tabor had use and control of the property.\n[72] On this issue, I find Millbrook\u2019s actions were not retaliatory. Ms. Tabor\u2019s father\u2019s wishes, to have Ms. Tabor in charge of his home and maintain it until her son comes of age, were honoured by Millbrook. In honouring his wishes, an agreement was entered into by the parties for possession of his home by Ms. Tabor in trust for her son. No written agreement was presented to me; however, Ms. Tabor and Mr. Cope testified about it. Implicit in the agreement was that Ms. Tabor would only rent out the home to rent-paying members of Millbrook First Nation. Otherwise, she would not receive any rent to put in trust for her son. While Ms. Tabor\u2019s understanding was that the agreement was not effective until a certificate of possession was issued, she nonetheless made use of the property, including renting it out and letting family members live there. She even filed documents wherein she is identified as the landlord of the property.\n[73] In my view, these actions demonstrate Ms. Tabor knew she had use and possession of the home. She acted on the agreement with Millbrook, without the issuance of a certificate of possession, but disregarded the term about not renting it out to social welfare recipients. She also did not maintain the property. For these reasons, I believe Millbrook\u2019s actions were reasonable and not retaliatory. While there was some delay in issuing the certificate of possession, I fail to see how this had an adverse impact on Ms. Tabor given it did not affect her use of the home.\n[74] With respect to the oil deliveries, Ms. Tabor presented an email chain between her and Chief Bob Gloade, the owner of the oil delivery company. In the email chain, Chief Gloade responds to Ms. Tabor\u2019s questions about the oil deliveries and clarifies the deliveries made to the properties. The oil delivery to Ms. Tabor\u2019s father\u2019s home was done at Ms. Tabor\u2019s request during the winter months to avoid pipes freezing. Ms. Tabor did not pay this bill. Chief Gloade offerred to erase the debt as a favour to her. The oil deliveries made to her own home seem to have been made in error. Otherwise, the email chain provides no insight into whether or not Millbrook\u2019s social assistance program should have paid for the oil deliveries at Ms. Tabor\u2019s father\u2019s home. Nor was there other sufficient evidence to substantiate this claim.\n[75] Having reviewed Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence and testimony on this issue, I am not convinced there was any adverse treatement here, let alone that Ms. Tabor\u2019s human rights complaint was a factor in that treatment.\n(d) Cost to replace stove\n[76] According to Ms. Tabor, every Band-owned home is supplied with a stove. In January 2011, the stove in Ms. Tabor\u2019s Band-owned home stopped working and she ordered a new one and sought reimbursment from Millbrook. Millbrook did not reimburse Ms. Tabor for the cost of the new stove.\n[77] Mr. Cope testified that while the First Nation does pay to replace broken appliances, the purchase must be pre-approved and it will not pay when the Band Member has ordered a non-approved model. The stove Ms. Tabor ordered was a non-approved model and, therefore, Millbrook did not pay for it.\n[78] Millbrook\u2019s explanation in response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegation is reasonable. Having purchases of this nature pre-approved makes sense. This allows the First Nation to either attempt to repair the appliance or replace it with an approved model. It is unclear if Ms. Tabor notifed Millbrook when her stove broke. Ms. Tabor went ahead before approval and ordered a new one and sought reimbursment. It is also unclear what happened to the old stove, whether it could have been repaired or where it went. While Ms. Tabor was not reimbursed the cost difference between her new stove and the pre-approved models, I find this is due to a disagreement between the parties on the application of Millbrook\u2019s practice. In any event, Ms. Tabor did not lead sufficient evidence to convince me that her human rights complaint was a factor in Millbrook\u2019s decision not to reimburse her the cost of the new stove.\n(e) Fraudulently cashed cheques\n[79] In August 2011, Ms. Tabor was caring for a minor who did not have a home. The minor was receving welfare payments, which were issued to Ms. Tabor in trust by Millbrook. The minor eventually left Ms. Tabor\u2019s care and she notified the First Nation accordingly. However, cheques continued to be issued to Ms. Tabor in trust. Two of those cheques were cashed without Ms. Tabor\u2019s signature. The matter was reported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), but according to Ms. Tabor, not resolved. Despite notifying Millbrook that the minor was no longer in her care, and despite not signing the two additional cheques, Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook is holding her responsible for paying the amount back.\n[80] Millbrook argues a trustee is responsible for monies paid to them in trust for a third-party minor. Millbrook does not know who signed the two additional cheques issued in Ms. Tabor\u2019s name in trust, but it contends Ms. Tabor\u2019s claim is against that individual.\n[81] It is unclear why cheques continued to be issued in Ms Tabor\u2019s name after she advised Millbrook she was no longer caring for the minor. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest Millbrook issued the additional cheques in Ms. Tabor\u2019s name in retaliation for her human rights complaint. It also unclear why, despite the circumstances of the situation, Millbrook is holding Ms. Tabor responsible for paying the money back. However, again, there is insufficient evidence to suggest Millbrook\u2019s stance on this issue is influenced by Ms. Tabor\u2019s human rights complaint. Rather, it seems to be influenced by the involvement of an unknown fraudulent third party. While this is an unfortunate situation for Ms. Tabor, in my view, it does not amount to retaliation.\n(f) Requirement to pay rent\n[82] Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook required her to pay rent on the property she lived at on the First Nation. According to her, Band members do not pay rent.\n[83] Mr. Cope explained that welfare recipients are given a housing allowance from Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC). This amount is withheld by Millbrook Social Development, and paid to the First Nation\u2019s corporate housing entity, before social assistance payments are issued to members. At the time Ms. Tabor claims she was being charged rent, Millbrook argues it was simply withholding the housing allowance from her social assistance payments.\n[84] At the hearing, Ms. Tabor stated she was unaware that social assistance recipients are provided a housing allowance from AANDC. In any event, she testified that the payment for her rent was not being taken out of her social assistance payments, but from her treaty grant cheque.\n[85] Millbrook\u2019s witholding of housing allowances from Ms. Tabor\u2019s social assistance payments was clearly a misunderstanding between the parties. While Ms. Tabor goes further to allege Millbrook should not have been deducting her housing allowance from her treaty grant cheque, it is unclear how her human rights complaint was a factor in this treatment. In my view, this situation stems from a misunderstanding and lack of communication between the parties, and not from retaliation for Ms. Tabor\u2019s human rights complaint.\n(g) Denial of work placement at Health Centre\n[86] In 2010, Ms. Tabor was enrolled in a Medical Office Assistant program. One of the requirements of the program was to complete a work placement. She approached Dr. Murdo Ferguson, a physician at the Millbrook Health Centre, about the possibility of completing her placement at the Millbrook Health Centre. According to Ms. Tabor, Dr. Ferguson said she would explore the possibility and get back to her.\n[87] Subsequently, Ms. Tabor stated that Dr. Ferguson indicated to her that Ms. Elizabeth Paul, the Director of the Health Centre, had informed Dr. Ferguson that the Health Centre does not accept students. Dr. Ferguson offered to have Ms. Tabor complete her placement at her Truro clinic, which Ms. Tabor accepted.\n[88] Ms. Tabor claims the Millbrook Health Centre had accepted students from her program the previous academic year. While Ms. Tabor believes the final decision about the placement was made by Ms. Paul, she also believes Ms. Paul may have been influenced by Millbrook\u2019s negative views towards her.\n[89] Ms. Paul testified before the Tribunal. Although she sometimes consults with Millbrook\u2019s Band Council, including Mr. Cope, on issues related to hiring, she stated final decisions on hiring for the Health Centre are hers to make. With specific regard to student placements, Ms. Paul stated she would notify Band Council \u201cafter the fact if appropriate\u201d, but emphasized that she does not seek Council\u2019s approval beforehand.\n[90] With respect to Ms. Tabor, Ms. Paul did not recall speaking to her directly about a placement, nor could she recall Dr. Ferguson specifically asking about her or student placements in general. Ms. Paul stated that, if Dr. Ferguson had asked her about student placements in 2010, she would have said that they did not have room for students because there were already two full time administrative employees working at the Health Centre.\n[91] With regard to Ms. Tabor\u2019s assertion that the Health Centre had accepted students from her program the previous academic year, Ms. Paul indicated that there was indeed a student the previous year. Ms. Paul explained that the student finished the last week of her placement at the Health Centre because she could not finish the placement where she originally started. Also, at that time, there was only one full time administrative employee. Apart from this one student, for one week, Ms. Paul did not recall any other administrative student placements at the Health Centre.\n[92] Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony on this issue was unconvincing. On cross-examination, she indicated she could not know for sure whether Millbrook influenced Ms. Paul\u2019s decision not to provide her with a placement at the Health Centre. In contrast, I found Ms. Paul\u2019s evidence to be credible and reliable and her explanation in response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegations to be reasonable. In weighing all this evidence on a balance of probabilities, I find that Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint was not a factor in the denial of a placement at the Health Centre.\nIII. Order\n[93] As the complaint has been substantiated in part, I may make an order against Millbrook First Nation pursuant to section 53(2) of the CHRA. However, the parties agreed to bifurcate argument on remedy from the merits of the complaint. Following Tabor #1, I invited the parties to begin settlement discussions in response to the findings in that decision and would seek an update from them thereon following the release of this decision (see Tabor #1 at para. 148). The parties have subsequently indicated that settlement discussions have not been successful. As a result, the Tribunal will be in contact with the parties shortly to obtain submissions from them on the issue of remedy resulting from both decisions.\n[94] Until such time as the issue of remedy is finally resolved in both Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaints, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction in both matters.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 23, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1658\/01311 & T1659\/1411\nStyle of Cause:\nStacy Lee Tabor v Millbrook First Nation\nDecision of the Tribunal Dated:\nJuly 23, 2015\nDate and Place of Hearing: July 28 to 30, 2014\nAugust 1, 2014\nAugust 5 to 7, 2014\nSeptember 16, 2014\nTruro, Nova Scotia\nAppearances:\nGary A.

The Complaint\n[1] Sharon Tanner (\u201cthe Complainant\u201d or \u201cMs. Tanner\u201d), filed a complaint against Gambler First Nation (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d or \u201cthe Nation\u201d), of which she is a member, on May 22, 2012. She alleges that the Nation has discriminated against her on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, and\/or family status, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cthe CHRA\u201d), when it created and enforced against her a rule seeking to prevent all persons who are not blood descendants of John Falcon Tanner from running in elections for the positions of Chief or Councillor of the Nation (\u201cthe Descent Rule\u201d) (Issue 1: The Descent Rule). The Complainant alleges that the Respondent has also discriminated against her in denying her access to a number of services including income assistance, the use of the medical van, snow removal service and in banishing her from Band facilities and activities (Issue 2: Other Differential Treatment).\n[2] Lastly, the Complainant alleges that, following the filing of her complaint, the Respondent engaged in retaliatory actions. According to the Complainant, the Respondent terminated her employment as an Economic Development Officer for the Band Council because she had filed a human rights complaint against them (Issue 3: Retaliation).\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), determined that an inquiry into the complaint was warranted and referred the complaint to this Tribunal on October 3, 2013.\nII. Issue 1: The Descent Rule\nA. Relevant Facts\n[4] The Complainant is an Aboriginal woman, registered as an \u201cIndian\u201d pursuant to the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. She was born a member of the Sagkeeng First Nation, also known as the Fort Alexander First Nation, in Manitoba.\n[5] In 1981, Ms. Tanner married her late husband, Alex Tanner, who was a member of the Nation. As a consequence of this marriage, pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act in force at the time, Ms. Tanner ceased to be a member of the Sagkeeng First Nation and became a member of the Nation. Since that time, Ms. Tanner has lived in the Nation. Ms. Tanner\u2019s husband passed away in 1985. However, she still lives in the Nation with her daughter, Charlene Tanner, who was born in 1982 and is also a member of the Nation.\n[6] Since 1985, membership in the Nation has been governed by section 10 of the Indian Act. This section recognizes the ability for a First Nation to assume control over its own membership list by adopting written community membership rules that define who is eligible to be added to the list. The Nation has availed itself of this discretion and has, reportedly, enacted its own membership code. The membership code was not filed into evidence at the hearing before the Tribunal.\n[7] Since the mid-1970s, the Nation has also selected its Chief and Council pursuant to its own customary election procedures. It has, since this time, been governed by a Council consisting of one elected Chief, and two elected Councillors.\n[8] In 1993, the Nation drafted a document called \u201c1993 Custom Regulations\u201d which sought to formalize this practice. The Custom Regulations required that a candidate seeking office as Chief and\/or Councillor be:\n(i) a registered member that ordinarily resides in Gamblers First Nation;\n(ii) be 18 years of age or older;\n(iii) not have been convicted of an indictable offence within the year leading up to the nomination; and,\n(iv) have their nomination moved and seconded in accordance with the 1993 Custom Regulations.\n[9] The 1993 Custom Regulations document indicates that it passed a second reading on November 2, 1993 but does not, however, indicate if it ever passed a third reading. The document was also never signed. It is unclear whether the Custom Regulations ever came into force or whether its provisions reflect a broad consensus among the Nation\u2019s members concerning customary election practices.\n[10] In 2006-2007, the Nation sought to codify its customary election practices, along with a new membership law and constitution. The Chief and Council hired Mr. Larry Catagas, Governance Advisor and Policy Development Officer with the West Region Tribal Council, as an independent third party to help with the development of an election code and to conduct a referendum so as to allow the Band membership to vote on its adoption. The Nation created three documents, the Band Custom Election Law (the Election Law), the Gambler First Nation Membership Law (the Membership Law), and the Gambler First Nation Constitution (the Gambler Constitution).\n[11] Section 4.2 of the Election Law enumerates the eligibility requirements for the positions of Chief and Councillor. It reads as follows:\nA Candidate for Chief or Councillor is a person who is:\na) a member of the Gambler First Nation and a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner signatory to Treaty 4 (1874). See family tree.\nb) at least eighteen years of age up as of the date of nominations\nc) resident for a continuous period of six months preceding the date of nominations\nd) must have a minimum 2 years Leadership of Administrative experience or training\ne) has not been convicted for an indictable offence, for three years preceding the date of nominations, and\nf) files a police record check clearance within one week after the nomination date, in which failure will result in the nomination being declared void.\ng) Candidates must produce all of the above to the Chief Electoral Officer within one week from the date of the nomination.\n[12] Section 22 of the Election Law enunciates the terms of its coming into force:\nThese regulations come into force the day they are approved by the simple majority of electors as per the referendum process of Gambler First Nation.\n[13] On May 17, 2007, a referendum vote took place on the adoption of the Election Law, the Membership Law and the Gambler Constitution. The legitimacy of this referendum, the adoption of the Election Law, and its purported reflection of the Nation\u2019s past customary practices (particularly the practice of limiting candidates for the positions of Chief and Councillors to blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner: \u201cthe Descent Rule\u201d at section 4.2(a) of the Election Law), are disputed.\n[14] However, according to the evidence, on November 5, 2010, Chief G. LeDoux and Councillors Roy Vermette and Ronnie Ducharme signed a one-page document which appears to indicate the official adoption of the 2007 Election Law. This document contained the following text:\nSection 23 Official Adoption\nThis Custom Election Law is hereby adopted according to the results of the Band Referendum on this in 2007\/08 Sworn Under Oath by Larry Catagas this 5th day of November 2010.\n[15] On February 29, 2012, the Nation held a nomination meeting for the position of Chief and the positions of Councillors for elections scheduled to take place on or around March 30, 2012. The Complainant was nominated to run for the position of Chief. Mr. Larry Catagas, the Nation\u2019s Chief Electoral Officer, informed the Complainant that she was, however, ineligible for the position of Chief as she was not a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner and therefore did not comply with section 4.2(a) of the Election Law. When the 2012 elections were eventually held, David LeDoux was elected Chief, and Councillors Roy Vermette and Ronnie Ducharme were re-elected.\nB. Issues\n[16] The allegations surrounding the adoption of the Descent Rule and its application by the Respondent to Ms. Tanner raise the following issues:\nPreliminary Issue: Does the complaint include the positions of Councillors as well as the position of Chief?\nMs. Tanner\u2019s case of discrimination: does the Descent Rule and its application by the Nation to the Complainant, denying her the right to be a candidate for the position of Chief, constitute a prima facie case of discrimination?\nIs ancestry a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA?\nDid Ms. Tanner suffer an adverse impact in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA?\nWas ancestry a factor in the adverse impact?\nWas the Descent Rule adopted for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor for the Respondent?\nWas the Descent Rule adopted in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose or goal?\nIs the Descent Rule reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose or goal, in the sense that the Respondent cannot accommodate persons who are not blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner without incurring undue hardship?\nBona fide justification: If the Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, has the Respondent shown that the practice has a bona fide justification?\nC. Parties Submissions and Analysis\n(i) Preliminary Issue: Does the complaint include the positions of Councillors as well as the position of Chief?\n[17] In her complaint, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent discriminated against her when she was prevented from running for Chief of the Nation due to the fact that she was not a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner, pursuant to the Descent Rule. The Respondent objects to the scope of the complaint also extending to the application of the Descent Rule to Councillors.\n[18] The Respondent argues that the complaint did not include any references to the position of Councillor and that the Complainant tendered no evidence at the hearing to support the contention that she had applied to be a candidate for Councillor, or that she was denied such an opportunity on the basis of the Descent Rule. The present matter should, according to the Respondent, be limited to the allegation that the Complainant was prohibited from running for the position of Chief of the Nation.\n[19] Despite the Respondent\u2019s submissions on this point, there does not appear to be any real contention with regard to the scope of the complaint. The Commission made no submissions in this regard and the Respondent is correct in stating that no evidence was tendered to support the assertion that the Complainant was denied from running for the position of Councillor due to the application of the Descent Rule. In fact, the Complainant does not even make such an allegation. At paragraph 36 of her Statement of Particulars, the Complainant discusses when she alleges that the Descent Rule was enforced against her:\nOn February 29th, 2012, the Complainant was nominated to run for Chief. It was after she was nominated that she was told that she did not qualify to run for elected office because she was not a blood descendant of John Falcon Tanner. This was the first that the Complainant had heard that she was disqualified from running.\n[Emphasis mine]\n[20] Any references to the position of Councillor by either the Commission or the Complainant appear in the context of the wording of the Descent Rule which suggests that it would apply to anyone who is not a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner and seeks to run for Chief or for Councillor. The Complainant and the Commission have, in this regard, led evidence to suggest that the rule has not, in the past, been applied consistently as there are allegedly former Councillors, including the Complainant, who were allowed to run despite the fact that they were not blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner. This argument is one which seeks to challenge the validity of the Descent Rule, and it is open to the Commission and the Complainant to make it. This does not, in my view, affect or alter the scope of the Complaint which pertains to the Respondent\u2019s application of the Descent Rule to the Complainant when she sought to run for Chief in the 2012 elections.\n(ii) Ms. Tanner\u2019s case of discrimination: Does the Descent Rule and its application by the Nation to the Complainant, denying her the right to be a candidate for the position of Chief, constitute a prima facie case of discrimination?\n[21] The onus is on the Complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. For this, the Complainant must advance a case which, if believed, is sufficient and complete enough to justify a decision in her favour in the absence of an answer by the Respondent (see Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 [O\u2019Malley]. More precisely, and in the context of this case, Ms. Tanner must demonstrate that ancestry is a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA; that the Nation adversely differentiated against her in the provision of a service; and, that her ancestry was a factor in her being adversely differentiated against in the provision of the service (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33).\n[22] For reasons detailed in the following pages, I find the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination.\nIs ancestry a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA?\n[23] The Descent Rule distinguishes between individuals on the basis of their blood relation to John (Falcon) Tanner. The parties have qualified this distinction as one which is founded on a \u201cdescent line\u201d or \u201cancestry\u201d. Neither \u201cdescent line\u201d nor \u201cancestry\u201d is specifically listed as a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 3 of the CHRA. The resulting question is whether \u201cancestry\u201d or \u201cdescent line\u201d can be said to fall under one of the existing prohibited grounds of discrimination?\n[24] The Commission\u2019s position, also adopted by the Complainant, can be summarized in the following manner: since the grounds of \u201crace\u201d, \u201cnational or ethnic origin\u201d and \u201cfamily status\u201d are not defined by the CHRA, a broad and liberal interpretation of the CHRA, as mandated by the Supreme Court in decisions like Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321and Insurance Corp. Of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145, supports the inclusion of ancestry. The courts have shown a strong desire for uniformity across Canadian human rights statutes and several provincial human rights statutes have included ancestry as one of their prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Commission relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in University of British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2 SCR 353 [Berg] wherein the Court states at para. 372:\nIf human rights legislation is to be interpreted in a purposive manner, differences in wording between provinces should not obscure the essentially similar purposes of such provisions, unless the wording clearly evinces a different purpose on behalf of a particular provincial legislature.\n[25] The Commission argues that interpreting the CHRA in a manner that excludes ancestry from the grounds of discrimination would lead to situations where an individual could be discriminated against on the basis of ancestry in some jurisdictions but not in others, and runs contrary to the objectives of the Act.\n[26] The Respondent, for its part, submits the requirement that a Chief be a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner falls squarely within definition of ancestry, which the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as \u201cline of descent\u201d. Numerous provinces have, however, explicitly included ancestry as a ground in their respective human rights legislation. The Respondent argues that this suggests that ancestry is, in fact, distinguishable from the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, as well as family status. To interpret section 3 so broadly as to encompass ancestry would not only trivialize these prohibited grounds, but would also be inconsistent with human rights legislation across the country. A purposive approach to interpreting human rights legislation cannot, according to the Respondent, go so far as to allow reading into the CHRA a ground that does not exist.\n[27] In essence, the Respondent argues that ancestry falls within the exception to the purposive interpretive approach described in Berg, namely that this choice of wording clearly evinces a different purpose on behalf of the provincial legislatures that have adopted this ground. Therefore, to include ancestry in the CHRA, which has not adopted this ground, would amount to circumventing Parliament\u2019s intent.\n[28] As the parties have highlighted in their submissions, the issue which I must now address is whether ancestry, as it exists as a separate ground in provincial human rights legislation (see for example the Alberta Human Rights Act, 2000 c A-25.5, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, RRS c S-24.1, the Ontario Human Rights Code, RSO 1990, c H.19 the New Brunswick Human Rights Act, RSNB 2011, c.171 and the British Columbia Human Rights Code, RSBC 1996, c. 210), is nevertheless protected by the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, and\/or family status under to the CHRA. In other words, can ancestry or line of descent, be considered to fall within their ambit? For reasons that follow, I answer this question in the affirmative.\n[29] A number of legal instruments expressly link the notion of ancestry with that of race. In certain provincial human rights statutes where ancestry is explicitly mentioned, it can be found alongside the grounds of race and colour. Section 9(2) of the Manitoba Human Rights Code, which lists the prohibited grounds, includes at paragraph (a): \u201cancestry, including colour and perceived race\u201d. Section 7(a) of the Yukon Human Rights Act is also drafted in an identical fashion. At the international level, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, 660 U.N.T.S. 195, adopted by the United Nations in 1965 and ratified by Canada in 1970, includes \u201cdescent\u201d as part of the definition of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d. It defines this type of discrimination as:\na \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference\u201d which is \u201cbased on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin\u201d and \u201cwhich has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d.\n[Emphasis mine]\n[30] In light of Canada\u2019s adhesion to this Convention, Canadian human rights statutes should be interpreted as possessing a similar scope (see Walter S. Tarnopolsky, Discrimination and the Law (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2004) at 5-9) and militates against the fragmented approach to interpreting ancestry proposed by the Respondent in this case.\n[31] Ancestry is also linked to ethnic origin. The meaning of the phrase \u201cethnic group\u201d was discussed by the House of Lords in Mandla v. Dowell Lee, (1993) 1 All E.R. 1062 [Mandla]. In that case, the House of Lords found that one of the essential characteristics that a group must possess to constitute an \u201cethnic group\u201d, for the purposes of the legislation at issue in that case, was \u201ceither a common geographic origin or descent from a small number of common ancestors\u201d. This Tribunal relied on Mandla and its definition of \u201cethnic group\u201d in Rivers v. Squamish Indian Band Council, 1994 CanLII 1217 (CHRT) [Rivers], when it came to the conclusion that being of Gitksan or Squamish birth could be regarded as possessing different ethnic or national origins. As such, in my view, ancestry also forms a part of ethnicity.\n[32] Finally, ancestry has also been considered to fall within the ambit of the ground of family status. As noted by the Commission, the Tribunal has already recognized that ancestry is included in the ground of family status in Schaap v. Canadian Armed Forces, 1988 CanLII 4504 (CHRT) [Schaap], rev'd on other grounds (1988), 56 D.L.R. (4th) 105 (Fed. C.A.) (see also Rivers at pp.40-41).\n[33] In Schaap at pages 26-27, the Tribunal relied on Professor Tarnopolsky\u2019s analysis of the ground of family status, finding that\nThe natural and ordinary meaning of the word \"family status\" I believe would include the inter- relationship that arises from bonds of marriage, consanguinity, legal adoption and including to use the words of Professor Tarnopolsky, the ancestoral relationship whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption as well as the relationships between spouses, siblings, in- laws, uncles or aunts and nephews or nieces, cousins, etc. I have not found any authority which would extend the meaning of \"family\" beyond the above described types of relationships.\n[34] The Respondent draws this Tribunal\u2019s attention to the last sentence of this quotation. The Respondent argues that the term \u201cancestoral relationship\u201d, as referred to by the Tribunal in this decision, is limited to the relationships between \u201cspouses, siblings, in-laws, uncles or aunts and nephews or nieces, cousins, etc.\u201d and does not extend to an ancestor who died approximately 170 years ago.\n[35] With respect, I cannot agree with this interpretation. Indeed, a plain reading of the definition supports a different conclusion. The use of the words \u201cas well as\u201d, in between \u201cthe ancestoral relationship whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption\u201d and the enumerated relationships that follow clearly indicates that \u201cancestoral relationship\u201d is to be considered in addition to the other enumerated relationships and is not limited by them. Moreover, the use of the term \u201cetc.\u201d at the end of the enumerated relationships indicates that this list is not exhaustive.\n[36] The Federal Court of Appeal also recognized that family status could include ancestral relationships in Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop, [1991] 1 F.C. 18 (Fed. C.A.); aff'd [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554. In this decision, Stone J.A. examined the legislative history of the amendment adding \"family status\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination to the CHRA and stated:\nIn testifying before a Standing Committee of the House of Commons which was studying the proposed change, the then Minister of Justice pointed to the above-noted mischief and added the following with respect to the \"family status\" concept proposed for adoption:\n\u2026this concept prohibits discrimination on the basis of relationships arising from marriage, consanguinity or legal adoption. It could include ancestral relationships, whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption, as well as relationships between spouses, siblings, in-laws, uncles or aunts, nephews or nieces, cousins, etc. It will be up to the Commission, the Tribunal appoints, and in the final cases, the courts, to ascertain in a given case the meaning to be given to these concepts. [Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Issue No. 114, at page 17. (Appeal Book, Volume 3, at page 326]\nIn my view, this evidence furnishes a strong indication that it was the intention of Parliament to limit the new prohibited ground of discrimination in a way which did not include discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n[Emphasis mine]\n[37] What these cases and laws demonstrate is that ancestry, while it has standing as a separate ground in several provincial human rights statues, is a concept, which can also be characterized as forming part of all three of the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, and family status. In light of this, I find ancestry, whether framed in terms of racial ancestry, national or ethnic ancestry, or family ancestry, is a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA.\n[38] In the circumstances of this case, the Nation submits racial ancestry and national or ethnic ancestry are not at issue. Instead, it submits the Descent Rule is focused on whether or not an individual has the specific ancestry of John (Falcon) Tanner. While the Commission argued John (Falcon) Tanner was a White man and, therefore, the Descent Rule creates a distinction based on race, no further evidence or argument was lead to suggest Ms. Tanner is of a different race, nationality or ethnicity from John (Falcon) Tanner. Indeed, race and ethnicity can be, from an anthropological, archaeological and ethnological perspective, complex issues to determine without specific expertise (see for example Rivers).\n[39] In my view, the context of this case most appropriately fits under the ground of family status. That is, as the Nation argues, the Descent Rule is aimed at the specific identity of a family member\/ancestor. The wording of the Descent Rule itself even refers to a \u201cfamily tree\u201d. As the ground of family status encompasses complaints based on the particular identity of a family member (see B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66 at paras. 39-41), I believe this matter should be analyzed as a family status complaint.\nDid Ms. Tanner suffer an adverse impact in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA?\n[40] Section 5 of the CHRA prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the public:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[41] There is no dispute that Ms. Tanner was adversely impacted by the application of the Descent Rule found in the Election Law. The Descent Rule disqualified her from being able to pursue a position with the Nation\u2019s government. The question is whether the creation and application of the Descent Rule\/Election Law is a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA.\n[42] As defined in Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170 [Watkin], a \u201cservice\u201d, pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA, is \u201c\u2026something of benefit being \u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered\u201d to the public\u2026\u201d and which are the result of a process taking place \u201c\u2026in the context of a public relationship\u2026\u201d (Watkin at para. 31).\n[43] According to the Commission, in determining whether a nominee is eligible to run for the position of Chief or Councillor, through the creation and application of the Election Law, and through the decision-making of its Chief Electoral Officer, the Nation was providing a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA. The Commission submits the approval of the Chief Electoral Officer confers the benefit of being able to pursue a position that will allow a candidate to contribute to the good governance of their community and which provides a source of income. In addition, the Commission submits that election processes form a critical part of the public relationship between governments and the community that is to be governed.\n[44] The Respondent did not provide submissions on this issue or respond to the Commission\u2019s arguments.\n[45] In my view, a legitimate question could be raised about whether the creation and application of the Election Law is a \u201cservice\u201d (see Matson et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 13; and, Andrews et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21, aff\u2019d 2015 FC 398). However, the Respondent did not provide submissions on this issue. Therefore, I have no argument or evidence that contradicts the Commission\u2019s submissions. As a result, for the purposes of this decision, I accept the position of the Commission that the Nation was engaged in the provision of a service in its creation and application of the Election Law and, specifically, the Descent Rule.\nWas ancestry a factor in the adverse impact?\n[46] Seeing as Ms. Tanner was excluded from running for Chief on the sole basis of the application of the Descent Rule \u2013 a rule which differentiates on the basis of ancestry, which I have found to be a protected characteristic under the CHRA \u2013 I find ancestry was a factor in Ms. Tanner\u2019s adverse treatment. As a result, I find Ms. Tanner has established a prima facie case of discrimination, pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA.\n(iii) Bona fide justification: if the Complainant has demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, has the Respondent shown that the practice has a bona fide justification?\n[47] Having determined that the Complainant has demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, the analysis now turns to the Respondent\u2019s case. In response to the prima facie case, the Respondent can avoid an adverse finding by calling evidence to show its actions were not discriminatory; and\/or, by establishing a statutory defence that justifies the discrimination. In this case, pursuant to section 15(1)(g) of the CHRA, the Respondent advances that there exists a bona fide justification for the creation and application of the Descent Rule. To establish this bona fide justification, the Respondent must establish that:\n(1) it adopted the Descent Rule for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor;\n(2) it adopted the Descent Rule in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose or goal; and,\n(3) the Descent Rule is reasonably necessary to accomplish its purpose or goal, in the sense that the Respondent cannot accommodate persons who are not blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner without incurring undue hardship.\n(see British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 SCR 3 at paras. 54-68; and, British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 SCR 868 at paras. 20-22)\nWas the Descent Rule adopted for a purpose or goal that is rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor?\n[48] The Respondent submits that introducing the Election Law is rationally connected to the governance of Gambler First Nation. Eugene Tanner, a member of the Nation, and Larry Catagas both testified that Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (\u201cINAC\u201d) specifically recommended that the First Nation enact an election law, along with a constitution and membership code.\n[49] According to the Commission, the Respondent\u2019s submissions do not explain how the Descent Rule is rationally connected to good governance. Ms. Tanner and other non-blood descendants have been elected as Councillors and contributed to the good governance of the First Nation.\n[50] In general, I agree with the Respondent that adopting an Election Law, along with a constitution and membership code, is rationally connected to the good governance of the Nation. However, the general provisions of the Election Law are not the focus of this complaint. Rather, it is the specific requirement of the Descent Rule that is at issue in this matter. In this regard, insufficient evidence was presented to support the assertion that being a blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner contributes to the good governance of the Nation. While the Nation has a unique historical connection to John (Falcon) Tanner, which is discussed in more detail later in this decision, I do not find there to be a connection between this history and the \u201cgood\u201d governance of the Nation. In fact, as the Commission pointed out, Ms. Tanner and other non-blood descendants have been elected as Councillors and have contributed to the governance of Gambler First Nation.\n[51] As a result, I find the Descent Rule is not rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor of the Nation and, therefore, cannot be bona fide justified. While this finding alone substantiates the complaint, I will nonetheless address the remainder of the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\nWas the Descent Rule adopted in good faith, in the belief that it is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose or goal?\n[52] The Respondent submits the Election Law was adopted in good faith. It was voted on by the membership of Gambler First Nation in a referendum and approved by a simple majority. On the other hand, the Complainant and Commission submit the Descent Rule was adopted as a means of specifically excluding Ms. Tanner from the First Nation\u2019s governance.\n[53] The facts surrounding the development and adoption of the Election Law are disputed and were difficult to ascertain. Witnesses provided contradictory testimonies, and some appeared tainted by underlying tensions stemming from past feuds. Others, like Albert Tanner, the only elder called to testify, were in visibly poor mental health. Much of the documentary evidence was also generally unreliable.\n[54] This being said, I found Ms. Tanner was overall a credible witness. She was forthcoming in giving her evidence and did not seem to embellish or appear vindictive. I found her testimony, along with most of the evidence provided by Larry Catagas, the Receiving Officer for the 2007 referendum, the most helpful in ascertaining the facts surrounding the Nation's decision to implement a blood descendancy requirement for the positions of Chief and Council. I note that while I found that Mr. Catagas was an impartial and overall a credible witness, parts of his testimony contradicted his affidavit dated November 5, 2010, three years after the Referendum vote (Exhibit C1, Tab 1), which described the events surrounding the Referendum. The confusion resulting from these contradictions led the parties to inquire into Mr. Catagas\u2019 health. He revealed that he had suffered two strokes and two heart attacks in the last four years and had suffered memory loss as a result. As highlighted below, I have awarded little weight to these portions of his evidence.\n[55] For reasons that follow, I have concluded that the Respondent did not adopt the Descent Rule in good faith.\n2007 Referendum\n[56] Mr. Catagas testified that he was retained by the Chief and Council of the Respondent, then composed of Gordon LeDoux, Ron Vermette and Ronnie Ducharme, in late 2006 and given the mandate to develop the Nation\u2019s Membership law, Constitution and the Election Law, as well as act as the Returning Officer for the referendum process which would determine their adoption by the membership. Mr. Catagas stated that he started with a generic set of laws, and then received feedback from the Nation to adapt the content to its needs. Mr. Catagas testified that he organized three or four public consultations with the Band membership during which they discussed, among other items, the Election Law. Sharon and Charlene Tanner both testified that they had no knowledge that these consultations had taken place.\n[57] With regard to the Referendum, Mr. Catagas testified that he obtained the list of voting members of Gambler First Nation from INAC and modified the list with the input from the members to determine the eligible voters. Once the final list was prepared, Mr. Catagas mailed the election packages, which included the election ballots, via priority post to the members of the Nation who did not live in the community. Members living in the community were notified of the Referendum by a notice, which was mailed to all whose addresses were known by the Band, and posted in key locations in the community, namely at the Band Office, the Band Hall and at the Health Centre. Members who informed Mr. Catagas that they would not be available on the day of the referendum were provided with election packages for advance voting and could mail their ballot. Return ballots were mailed to Mr. Catagas directly and placed in a locked location.\n[58] Sharon and Charlene Tanner both testified that they never saw or received a notice informing them of the Referendum. Sharon Tanner stated that she learned that the Referendum had occurred through speaking with members of the community, many of whom were not happy as they had not known that it was taking place. Mr. Catagas also testified that some members called to tell him that they had not received their Referendum packages. He conceded that since he had not sent the packages by registered mail or courier, there had been no way of tracking those who had and had not received the packages. Mr. Catagas could not recall how many Referendum packages were mailed, or how many were returned. He testified that he believed that there were approximately 75 Band members living outside the community. Mr. Catagas recognized that according to Exhibit R-1, Tab 2, a copy of the voter\u2019s list that appeared to have been used by an individual seated with Mr. Catagas on the day of the Referendum, 32 ballots were mailed in. Eugene Tanner testified that he believed approximately 90 packages were mailed out and that approximately 60 of them were returned.\n[59] On May 17, 2007, the day of the Referendum, Mr. Catagas counted the ballots himself, in the presence of other individuals, including Eugene Tanner. Mr. Catagas used the final voter\u2019s list he had prepared and tracked the individuals who voted by crossing out their names. According to the voter\u2019s list found at Exhibit R-1, Tab 2, out of the 124 eligible voters that were identified at the time of the Referendum, 32 people mailed in their ballots, and 19 people voted in person, for a total of 51 participating voters. Out of these, 29 voted in favour of the Election Law; and 20 voted against it.\n[60] According to this voter\u2019s list, it would appear that all three documents, the Membership Law, the Constitution and the Election Law, passed with a simple majority, which the Election Law defines as \u201c50 percent plus one of those that participate in a vote\u201d. Mr. Catagas testified that the Election Law only required a simple majority vote as a double majority is very difficult to attain due to the challenges associated with getting enough eligible voters to participate: \u201cotherwise, you\u2019d be continuing to do that over and over again without ever getting to the point of rejecting or accepting a certain document\u201d: Transcript at p. 594. Mr. Catagas stated that in his experience conducting elections for First Nations, there would usually be a simple majority vote.\n[61] Mr. Catagas stated that the voter\u2019s list at Exhibit R-1, Tab 2 confused him and that he did not recognize this document. He confirmed that it was not the official tracking list. Contrary to what Exhibit R-1, Tab 2 indicates, Mr. Catagas recalled that only the Election Law passed at this referendum. He testified that in light of this, and due to the fact that all three documents still contained ambiguities, he advised that the Chief and Council go through a review and amendment process and to hold a second referendum. Although Mr. Catagas believed that a second referendum had taken place, during which the Election Law also passed, he could not recall when that would have been. No evidence supporting this referendum was tendered.\n[62] The reliability of Exhibit R-1, Tab 2 was further brought into question by the testimony of Harlene Swain, who stated that she had voted in the referendum and yet her name had not been struck out. Moreover, while the list indicates that the total of participating voters amounts to 51, a manual count of the names crossed off on the list adds up to 52. I share the Commission\u2019s view that the reliability of this document is problematic. The official tracking list was not part of the evidence before the Tribunal.\n[63] Three years after the Referendum, on November 5, 2010, Mr. Catagas swore an Affidavit at the request of Chief David Albert LeDoux. Paragraph 3 of this Affidavit reads:\n\u201cThat due to missing records, I have provided on or about this date that Council sign the documents, and hereby confirm their validity. This is done in the hope of putting to rest the contentious issues and that the Government of Gambler First Nation (as represented by Chief Gordon Ledoux, and Councilors Roy Vermette, and Ronnie Ducharme) be recognized and to move forward in their capacities, recognizant of the expectations of the people (membership) through the Election Law and the Constitution; ie regular Band meetings, transparency, redress and complete communication amongst all parties.\n[64] In swearing this Affidavit, Mr. Catagas attempted to resolve the contention surrounding the validity of the Nation\u2019s Membership Law, Constitution and Election Law. Unfortunately, the document fails to resolve any of these issues and, in fact, further confused matters when Mr. Catagas stated at paragraph 2:\n\u201cThat the Band Constitution is a valid document, wherein the advisory role of the Council of Elders is recognized. The Constitution further stipulates the authority of Chief and Council and the people of Gambler First Nation. That the document initially failed its first referendum, due to the requirement of a double majority, but passed the second referendum requiring a simple majority. The exact dates are not known due to missing records at the Gambler Band Office\u201d.\n[65] Despite this statement, the Constitution contains no reference to a double majority. Only the Election Law refers to achieving a double majority, and only for the purposes of amending the Election Law following its initial adoption. The Election Law defines \u201cdouble majority\u201d at section 2(o) as \u201c50% plus 1 of all eligible voters as per the VOTERS\u2019 LIST\u201d. Mr. Catagas could not explain this discrepancy.\n[66] I accept that, according to the Election Law, a simple majority vote, composed of those that participated in the vote, is sufficient for its adoption. I am not however satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that this was obtained. In addition to the questionable reliability of Exhibit R-1, Tab 2, which is the only document indicating the supposed results of the 2007 referendum, the referendum was otherwise fraught with procedural problems which include the lack of proof of service upon members, adequate postings informing the membership of the referendum and lack of records.\nOther evidence regarding the adoption of the Descent Rule\n[67] Sharon Tanner testified that the first time she heard of a blood descendent requirement for the positions of Chief and Councillors was in 2005-2006, when she started to become more politically active. She alleges that the Descent Rule was brought forward because she represented a threat to the leadership of Gambler First Nation, due to the fact that she benefited from the trust and support of many of the Band members.\n[68] Ms. Tanner explained that the Councillors at the time, Gordon LeDoux, who is the brother of Chief David LeDoux, and Donna McGillivray, the Chief\u2019s first cousin, were suspected of abusing funds. On November 1, 2006, growing dissatisfaction by the Band membership with their leadership resulted in a march of over 50 members to the Band office, requesting a meeting with the Chief and Council. The Chief and Council refused this request and the members therefore held a meeting of their own during which they adopted a Band resolution ousting Donna McGillivray. Ms. Tanner alleged that the Band resolution was sent to INAC and when, on November 9, 2006, the members conducted a bi-election to find a replacement, INAC sent a representative, Mr. McDougall, to act as Chief Electoral Officer. Ms. Tanner testified that she was elected as Councillor by acclamation. This is supported by the list of Gambler First Nation Chiefs and Councillors from 1885 to 2008 found at Exhibit R-1, Tab 36, which lists Ms. Tanner as Councillor on this date.\n[69] When Ms. Tanner presented herself to the Band office the next day, the office was locked. Gordon LeDoux and Ms. McGillivray informed Ms. Tanner that they did not recognize her as Councillor and that Ms. McGillivray was still Councillor of Gambler First Nation. Ms. Tanner was unable to serve as Councillor.\n[70] This same day, Gordon LeDoux and Donna McGillivray passed a Band council resolution, denying Ms. Tanner access to the Band office, health office (unless in the case of an emergency), the multipurpose building, and the construction job site. The resolution stated that Ms. Tanner had approached the Band\u2019s employees at the job site, with \u201cthreats of firing and hiring which is jeopardizing our ability to function as a Band\u201d and that they \u201cfeel that in order for us to carry out our duties as leaders of our First Nation, we need to avoid any dissidents that wish to create turmoil and disfunction [sic] here at the workplace\u201d: Exhibit R-1, Tab 23. Ms. Tanner testified that the events described in the Band council resolution never happened, and that she was targeted because she was viewed by the Councillors as a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d.\n[71] The community\u2019s dissatisfaction with its leadership continued in the years that followed. Ms. Tanner testified that in 2008, Gambler First Nation received 3 million dollars and that over 1 million went missing. On August 9, 2010, the Council of Elders held a meeting with the membership to discuss these issues. According to the minutes of the meeting (Exhibit HRC-1, Tab 4), over 50 people were present. 62 Band members voted for the removal of Chief Gordon LeDoux and Councillor Donna McGillivray and appointed Ms. Tanner as acting Chief and Rose Demontigny as acting Councillor. Ms. Tanner also alleges that the members appointed her, Eugene Tanner and Harlene Swain to go to the Vanguard Credit Union and look into what had happened to the missing funds.\n[72] The Respondent has challenged the Complainant\u2019s testimony regarding her appointment as acting Chief, suggesting that the signatures that appear on Exhibit HRC-1, Tab 4 are fraudulent. Eugene Tanner and Harlene Swain both testified that Ms. Tanner had not been appointed as acting Chief, but recognized that there had been a petition to remove the Chief and Council from their positions. They claim no one was elected acting Chief at the time and stated they would not have voted for Ms. Tanner as she is not a blood descendent of John (Falcon) Tanner. However, they did confirm that they accompanied Ms. Tanner to the Vanguard Credit Union on August 10, 2010.\n[73] The Complainant has argued that her political involvement is at the root of the decision to implement a blood descendancy requirement. She argues that it is no coincidence that on November 5, 2010, less than three months following the Elders\u2019 meeting where she contends that she was appointed acting Chief, Chief Gordon LeDoux requested that Larry Catagas swear an affidavit affirming that:\nI further state with respect to the matter of contentious issue over the Election Law, & Band Constitution and the authorities of Chief & Council, including the authority of the Elders Council;\n1. That I did attend to the Election Law referendum concerning these documents and that it did pass in the fiscal year of 2007-2008.\n(Exhibit C-1, Tab 1)\n[74] This affirmation by Mr. Catagas was then included in the Election Law at Section 23:\nThis Custom Election Law is hereby adopted according to the results of the Band Referendum on this in 2007\/08. Sworn Under Oath by Larry Catagas this 5th day of November, 2010.\n(Exhibit HRC-1, Tab 7)\n[75] The Respondent denies the Complainant\u2019s assertion about the adoption of the Election Law. It argues the enactment of the Election Law was recommended by INAC; that the Nation contracted a third party to develop the Election Law, in order to ensure that the election was handled properly; that the third party met with the membership on three or four occasions; and, the third party developed the Election Law based on feedback he had received from the membership as a whole. According to the Respondent, the allegation that the Election Law was developed as a ploy essentially amounts to a suggestion that the retention of a third party developer, the entire consultation process, and the actual Referendum were all done with the ulterior motive of excluding the Complainant from governance, despite the fact that as of the time of the Referendum, the Complainant had never run for Chief and was prior to the Complainant participating in the rally to remove the Chief and Council in 2006.\n[76] Ms. Tanner benefits from the trust and support of many of the members of her community as exemplified by her election as Councillor in 2006 and her appointment to go to the Vanguard Credit Union to look into what had happened to missing Band funds in 2010. In my view, the leadership of the Nation, particularly under Gordon LeDoux when the majority of these events took place, felt threatened by Ms. Tanner\u2019s political involvement. The 2006 Band council resolution, issued the day after Ms. Tanner was elected Councillor, is a clear indication of this fear and of a desire to prevent Ms. Tanner from further disrupting their leadership. While I cannot conclusively determine that the primary driving force for the development of the Descent Rule was to prevent her from accessing the leadership, the adoption of the Election Law three years after the initial referendum on the issue casts a long shadow in this regard.\n[77] The Respondent was unable to provide a credible explanation as to why it decided, in 2010, to move forward with the adoption of the Election Law. While Eugene Tanner stated that its development was motivated by a deadline set by INAC, Larry Catagas denied such a deadline had been imposed and, despite reference to a letter in this regard, no such documentation was brought forward at the hearing. Moreover, when Larry Catagas was asked why the Election Law was adopted three years after the referendum, he could not provide an explanation. This evidence only further adds to the irregularities and contradicting evidence surrounding the enactment of the Election Law. It also leads me to believe that it is more probable than not that, while the Election Law\/Descent Rule may have initially been developed in good faith, its official adoption in 2010 was, at least in part, to prevent Ms. Tanner from running for Chief.\n[78] As a result, in addition to my finding that the Descent Rule is not rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor of the Nation, I also find it was not adopted in good faith. I will now address the Respondent\u2019s remaining arguments regarding undue hardship.\nIs the Descent Rule reasonably necessary, in the sense that the Respondent cannot accommodate persons who are not blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner without incurring undue hardship\n[79] The Respondent submits that the question of whether the Descent Rule in the Election Law is reasonably necessary raises two issues:\nThe extent of a First Nation\u2019s right of self-government and in particular, whether a First Nation\u2019s right to self-government includes the right to determine who is eligible to govern the First Nation; and,\nThe operation of section 1.2 of An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 2008, c. 30, and the impact of First Nations\u2019 legal traditions and customary laws on the interpretation of the CHRA\nRight to Self-Government\n[80] According to the Respondent, a First Nation has an inherent right to self-government and this right is vital (reasonably necessary) to the future and self-sufficiency of First Nations. It argues the Government of Canada has pursued a policy approach which includes aboriginal self-government as an inherent right under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Furthermore, it notes this policy approach is consistent with articles 3 and 4 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Respondent submits it is the development of policies and procedures unique to the First Nation that is important to the right of self-government. If a First Nation does not have the right to develop policies in accordance with the First Nation\u2019s unique culture, but instead is required to develop internal policies consistent with the existing laws of Canada, then the right to self-government is meaningless. In this regard, the Nation contends policies and processes for elections are especially important because an election of leaders is, by its very nature, an integral part of self-government.\n[81] As the Respondent noted in its submissions, an inherent right to self-government has not been recognized as necessarily forming part of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. In this regard, I note the Supreme Court of Canada stated in R. v. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 SCR 821 at para. 27, that \u201c[a]boriginal rights, including any asserted right to self-government, must be looked at in light of the specific circumstances of each case and, in particular, in light of the specific history and culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right\u201d. Aside from general policy arguments, the Respondent did not lead evidence to establish that it has a right to self-government based on its specific history and culture.\n[82] Furthermore, even if the Nation had established such a right to self-government, that does not necessarily shield its actions from regulation under the laws of Canada, including the CHRA. An infringement of the right must first be established pursuant to the test set out in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 SCR 1075 at page 1112 [Sparrow]. In addition, if an infringement is found, it is subject to justification by the Crown (see Sparrow at pp. 1113-1119). No such argument or evidence was brought forward by the Respondent.\n[83] As a result, I find the Respondent\u2019s argument regarding its right to self-government, and its application to the Nation\u2019s bona fide justification argument in this case, to be without merit.\nSection 1.2 of An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act\n[84] Section 1.2 of An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act provides:\n1.2 In relation to a complaint made under the Canadian Human Rights Act against a First Nation government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs and services under the Indian Act, this Act shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that gives due regard to First Nations legal traditions and customary laws, particularly the balancing of individual rights and interests against collective rights and interests, to the extent that they are consistent with the principle of gender equality.\n[85] The Respondent submits that the requirement in this section to consider First Nations legal traditions and customary laws suggests that culturally specific rationales (i.e. a rationale grounded in a First Nation\u2019s customs, traditions, procedures and\/or practices) should now be considered in determining whether a discriminatory practice is reasonably necessary. In this regard, the Respondent argues that the evidence in this case demonstrates that all Chiefs of Gambler First Nation have been blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner and that it is reasonably necessary that this tradition be continued.\n[86] In determining what application section 1.2 has in this case, the first question to examine is whether Gambler First Nation has a custom or tradition of having blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner act as Chief.\n[87] \u201cCustom\u201d was defined in Bigstone v. Big Eagle, [1992] F.C.J. No. 16 (QL) [Bigstone] as including \u201cpractices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the Band and upon which there is a broad consensus\u201d. Where a dispute arises regarding a custom, the onus is upon the party who relies on the custom, in this case the Respondent, to establish its existence, elements, and to demonstrate that it is indeed supported by a broad consensus of the Band members (Francis v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, [2003] 4 FCR 1133 at paras. 21-24 [Francis]; and, see also McArthur v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1992 CanLII 8090 (Sask. Q.B.)).\n[88] In Bigstone, Strayer J. (as he then was) found that in examining the validity of a custom or constitution governing the composition and selection of a Band council, the real question is one of political, rather than legal, legitimacy. It is incumbent upon Courts faced with this issue to answer the question: \u201cis the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band?\u201d In so doing, a Court should, however, apply discernable legal criteria.\n[89] These legal criteria are summarized in Francis at paras. 22-24, and 26 (see also Shotclose v. Stoney First nation, 2011 FC 750 at para. 69). A custom must include: (1) \u201cpractices\u201d for the choices of a council; (2) practices must be \u201cgenerally acceptable to members of the band\u201d; and (3) practices upon which there is a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d. \u201cPractices\u201d may be established either through repetitive acts in time, or through a single act, such as with the adoption of an electoral code. For a practice to be \u201cgenerally acceptable to members of the band\u201d, it must reflect \u201cthe manifestation of the will of those interested in rules for determining the electoral process of band council membership to be bound by the rule of practice\u201d.\n[90] What constitutes a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d was further defined in Francis at paras. 36-37, where Justice Martineau writes:\nFor a rule to become custom, the practice pertaining to a particular issue or situation contemplated by that rule must be firmly established, generalized and followed consistently and conscientiously by a majority of the community, thus evidencing a \"broad consensus\" as to its applicability. This would exclude sporadic behaviours which may tentatively arise to remedy certain exceptional difficulties of implementation at a particular moment in time as well as other practices which are clearly understood within the community as being followed on a trial basis. If present, such a \"broad consensus\" will evidence the will of the community at a given time not to consider the adopted electoral code as having an exhaustive and exclusive character. Its effect will be to exclude from the equation an insignificant number of band members who persistently objected to the adoption of a particular rule governing band elections as a customary one.\nIn my view, in light of all the abovementioned cases, the real question as to whether a particular band resolution, decision or an adopted electoral code reflects the custom of the band can be framed as follows: is the resolution, decision or code based on a majority consensus of all those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band, regardless of residency?\n[Emphasis mine]\n[91] While these cases provide a broad legal framework pursuant to which we can examine the Election Law and its Descent Rule in the case at hand, the determination of whether the Descent Rule \u201cenunciates practices that are generally acceptable to members of the Band and upon which there is broad consensus\u201d remains a very fact-specific inquiry.\n[92] In this regard, the Election Law was not Gambler First Nation\u2019s first attempt to codify its election process. Over a decade prior to the Referendum, the Nation drafted the 1993 Custom Regulations with the aim of achieving a similar codification. The rationale for this effort is explained in the document\u2019s preamble:\nThe Gambler First Nation historically has functioned quite adequately without written rules and procedures. Within the contemporary society it is necessary to record all transactions and to develop rules and procedures in writing for the purposes of law and order. It has been apparent to the Gambler First Nation membership that they too must develop written rules and procedures, especially in view of complex, complexity of issues that arise on a daily basis. It is therefore agreed that the membership adopt the following rules and procedures for the benefit and betterment of Gambler First Nation.\n[93] A number of witnesses confirmed the existence of the Custom Regulations, including Sharon Tanner and Larry Catagas and their testimony was not challenged in this regard. The document states that the Custom Regulations passed a first and second reading on October 4 and November 4, 1993. The evidence did not confirm however, whether they had passed a third reading. It is therefore unclear if they were ever adopted.\n[94] These Custom Regulations support Sharon Tanner\u2019s testimony, where she recognized that Gambler First Nation possessed practices that could be regarded as constituting customary laws or traditions. For example, the Custom Regulations recognized the importance of elders:\nCouncil of Elders: The Gambler First Nation has recognized and respected the role of elders for their wisdom, spiritual guidance and decisions towards the betterment of Gambler First Nation. The Council of Elders shall be present at all Council meetings.\n[95] The Custom Regulations did not, in contrast, contain any reference to a rule limiting the position of Chief to the descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner and Sharon Tanner testified that to her knowledge, there had been no mention of this limitation in the 1980s and 1990s. This view was contradicted by a number of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, who testified that the requirement for the Chief and Council to be part of the John (Falcon) Tanner bloodline had long constituted an essential part of their heritage and identity.\n[96] Throughout these proceedings, the Tribunal heard evidence confirming the unique history of John (Falcon) Tanner and its importance to the cultural identity of the Nation. The testimony of Rose LeDoux, the wife of Chief David LeDoux and a non-blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner, is worth noting in this regard. Rose LeDoux, Chief David LeDoux, Roxanne Brass and Eugene Tanner all testified that the richness of their history and the uniqueness of their shared bloodline was a source of pride.\n[97] Sharon Tanner did not dispute the importance of the heritage of John (Falcon) Tanner. Her husband, children and grand-children are all his descendants. Ms. Tanner testified that she has spent 30 years in Gambler First Nation community and that she considers it her home. She does however, dispute that this heritage translates to a requirement for Chiefs and Councillors to be blood descendants. I note that when asked whether it was possible for a non-blood descendant to possess the qualities of wisdom, fairness, patience and a solid understanding of the Nation\u2019s legal traditions and customary laws, good qualities for the positions of Chief and Council, the Respondent\u2019s witnesses all agreed that it was possible.\n[98] Furthermore, the evidence presented did not conclusively determine that all of the Nation\u2019s Chiefs were blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner. Roxanne Brass testified that she believed this was the case \u201cunless one snuck in that I don\u2019t know of\u201d and Exhibit R-1, Tab 36, which contains the list of past Chiefs and Councillors possesses a significant gap in time where there is no history at all as to who occupied these positions. Chief David LeDoux and his wife Rose LeDoux testified that experts had published on the history of John (Falcon) Tanner and commented on the uniqueness of the Gambler First Nation but none of these publications were brought forward as evidence. The community\u2019s Elders would arguably have been in the best position to provide a historical perspective on the Descent Rule and parties all agreed that they played a key role within the community. However, the only witness who could reasonably be classified as an Elder was Albert Tanner, and he gave no evidence on this point.\n[99] The Tribunal is therefore left with the conflicting evidence of the Complainant, who has the longest continued relationship and residency with the Band and the community, and that of Roxanne Brass, who moved to the community in the 1990s, Eugene Tanner, who only recently moved to the community, and David and Rose LeDoux who moved to the community in 2009. I find the Complainant\u2019s evidence more persuasive in this regard.\n[100] Even if I could make a finding that all of the Nation\u2019s past Chiefs were descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner, I do not find that this would be determinative of the existence of a \u201ccustom\u201d. Of the Nation\u2019s 256 members, only 4 or 5 are non-bloodline. In view of this, it would not be surprising that no non-blood descendant served as Chief. In other words, while there may be a practice of having Chiefs that are bloodline, this reality may simply exist due to the demographics of the Nation and does not lead to the conclusion that there is a broad consensus amongst the members of the Band that non-bloodline members are ineligible for this position.\n[101] I am further persuaded that the Election Law is not \u201cfirmly established, generalized, and followed consistently and conscientiously by a majority of the community\u201d by the fact that it requires that candidates for both the positions of Chief and Councillors be blood descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner. The evidence demonstrated quite clearly that Councillors could be non-bloodline. In addition to Ms. Tanner, whom was appointed to this position in 2006, her mother, Patricia Tanner, as well as Darlene Tanner served as Councillors and neither were blood descendants.\n[102] Finally, given the irregularities and contradicting evidence surrounding the 2007 Referendum on the Election Law, I am not convinced that the practice of limiting the position of Chief to descendants of John (Falcon) Tanner benefits from a broad consensus. In this regard, I note only 51 of the approximately 124 eligible voters voted in the election, and of those who voted, only 57% voted in favour of the adoption of the Election Law.\n[103] In response, the Respondent relies on the decision in Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation v. Chapman, 1998 CanLII 8004 (FC) [Chapman], where, despite a 28 percent voter turnout and where approximately 21 percent of the total eligible voters voted in favour of a custom leadership selection code, the Court held that there was a sufficiently broad consensus to conclude that the code constituted a custom. However, in that case, the Court noted the unique situation of the members of that First Nation: out of its 300 members eligible to vote, the location of only approximately 130 of these members was known (Chapman at para. 29). Furthermore, the Court noted that there was a pattern of general voter non-participation in that community, even by known members who were eligible to vote (Chapman at para. 29). As a result, the Court found that:\nthe participation of 86 voting members which resulted in 73 votes being counted, out of which 64 votes were in favour of the Selection Code and 7 were against with one \"no opinion\" and one spoiled, constitutes a broad consensus sufficient in these special circumstances to consider the Selection Code to now constitute Band Custom.\n(Chapman at para. 29)\n[104] The vote in Chapman resulted in an 87% approval of the selection code. In contrast, the Election Law in this case only received a 57% approval rating and there was low voter turnout. No such special circumstances were brought forward by the Respondent in this case to explain the low voter turnout or the narrow majority adoption of the Election Code. As a result, I believe the Chapman case is distinguishable for the circumstances of the present case, where I am not convinced that there is a broad consensus that the Election Law, including the Descent Rule, is a custom of Gambler First Nation.\n[105] For all these reasons, I find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Descent Rule is a \u201ccustomary law or legal tradition\u201d as per section 1.2 of An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act. As a result of this finding it is not necessary for me to consider whether the application of section 1.2 supports an expanded approach of the undue hardship factors under section 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[106] The Respondent did not otherwise advance any other arguments of undue hardship. Therefore, it has not satisfied me that the Descent Rule is reasonably necessary.\nD. Conclusion on Issue 1: Complaint Substantiated\n[107] The Respondent did not provide a bona fide justification to the Complainant\u2019s prima facie case of discrimination. For the reasons above, I find the Descent Rule is not rationally connected to the function of being Chief or Councillor; was not adopted in good faith; and, is not reasonably necessary. As a result, the Descent Rule complaint is substantiated.\nIII. Issue 2: Other Alleged Differential Treatment\n[108] The Complainant alleges that the Descent Rule is not the only manifestation of the Respondent\u2019s differential treatment towards her due to the fact that she is not a descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner. In April 2011, the Complainant saw her request for income assistance denied and lost her housing allowance as a result (A. Denial of Income Assistance). She also alleges that she was denied the use of the medical van (B. Denial of Use of Medical Van). Finally, she contends that she has been banned from attending the Band Council office, as well as the Band\u2019s medical facilities and community center, and excluded from community activities and services (C. Banishment from Band Facilities and Exclusion from Activities and Services).\n[109] Prior to examining each of these allegations, it is important to note that the parties\u2019 relationship has been fraught for many years. The Tribunal heard evidence of two Band council resolutions that were adopted in March 2000 seeking to remove the Complainant from the community as well as from her position with the Band as a Community Health Representative and as a worker for the Native Alcohol Drug Abuse Program, positions that the Complainant had occupied for 12 years. This was due to a violent altercation that took place involving the Complainant, her daughter and her daughter\u2019s boyfriend against other members of the community. In the end, the Complainant was not removed from the community but did lose her positions with the Band. The Complainant was also involved in a dispute with Roxanne Brass, the Chief\u2019s sister, in 2004 at a corn festival, and the evidence indicated that tensions existed between the two women, as well as between Ms. Tanner and the LeDoux family. In this context, it was at times difficult to discern whether certain incidents regarding the Complainant arose simply as a result of this ongoing conflict, or whether they were linked to her status as a non-blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner.\nA. Denial of Income Assistance\n(i) Relevant Facts\n[110] On April 1, 2011, Ms. Tanner submitted an application for income assistance to the Social Assistance Administrator, Terry Tanner. Ms. Tanner testified that Terry Tanner filled out the form for her and that she signed the application. She indicated that she was the only resident living in her home. At line 205, after the question \u201cIs the applicant eligible to receive assistance?\u201d, Terry Tanner put an \u201cX\u201d beside the \u201cYes\u201d. Ms. Tanner stated that she expected that she would be receiving income assistance. She had previously been receiving income assistance since approximately 2001.\n[111] In April 2011, sometime after Ms. Tanner submitted her application, Terry Tanner contacted Ms. Tanner and informed her that she did not qualify for income assistance. Terry Tanner did not provide a reason for the refusal.\n[112] On June 10, 2011, Ms. Tanner once again completed an application for income assistance with the help of Terry Tanner. On the recommendation of Terry Tanner, the Complainant indicated that she possessed a car valued at $17,000. Furthermore, despite the Complainant\u2019s affirmation that her friend, Fernand Barthelette, did not reside with her, Terry Tanner informed her that he needed to include the income information of anyone who was in her house. For this reason, the form included Mr. Barthelette\u2019s monthly income.\n[113] In a letter entitled \u201cRejection Letter\u201d, dated July 5, 2011, Terry Tanner, in his capacity as Income Assistance Administrator, stated that Ms. Tanner did not qualify for income assistance at this time for the following reason:\n\u201cFern Barthelette receives $1000.00 old age pension which, will cover your (Sharon Tanner) cost of Basic needs, Diet, Rend & User fees. IA will cover for hydro when it exceeds the amount of your (Sharon Tanner) basic needs\u201d.\n[114] Ms. Tanner testified that she never received this letter and that the first time that she saw it was in preparation for the Tribunal hearing. She testified that all of her conversations with Terry Tanner were verbal. Ms. Tanner found out that she did not qualify for income assistance when, at some point during this period, it was being given out and Terry Tanner told her daughter, Charlene, that she did not qualify.\n[115] Ms. Tanner alleged that shortly thereafter, she had a conversation with former Chief Gordon LeDoux about the fact that she was being denied income assistance. Ms. Tanner testified that Gordon LeDoux responded with words to the effect of \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you go back to Sagkeeng where you come from? You\u2019ll get Social Assistance there\u201d: Transcript at p. 85.\n[116] Ms. Tanner also spoke to Chief David LeDoux, who told her to call INAC. Ms. Tanner testified that she did call INAC but that nothing was ever done. Ms. Tanner re-applied once again for income assistance on September 25, 2013 and listed Mr. Barthelette as her spouse, again under the advice of Terry Tanner. At the time of the hearing, Ms. Tanner had still not received any income assistance. She testified that she was being financially supported by her daughter Charlene.\n(ii) Parties Submissions and Analysis\n[117] The parties provided extensive testimony and submissions regarding the issue of whether the Complainant was in a common-law relationship with Mr. Barthelette. The Complainant argues that she had never shared anything more than a friendship with Mr. Barthelette, whom she has known since her college years and that she was, in fact, in a relationship with another man during a part of this period. The only reason that Ms. Tanner added Mr. Barthelette as a resident of her home and later as her spouse in her income assistance applications is because Terry Tanner advised her to do so. The Complainant testified that Mr. Barthelette stayed with her a few times a year, during the Christmas season and in the spring to help her with her garden. Ms. Tanner estimated that he stayed with her for a total of approximately three months a year. She denied calling him her \u201cold man\u201d and stated that he did not provide her with any financial assistance.\n[118] The Complainant also argues that the Tribunal should draw an adverse inference from the fact that Terry Tanner was not called to testify. The Respondent\u2019s witness, Charles Baptiste, a Social Advisor for the West Region Tribunal Council who was called to speak to the issue of the eligibility for income assistance, never had any contact with the Complainant and did not deal with her applications for income assistance.\n[119] The Respondent argues that the evidence supports the conclusion that the Complainant was in conjugal relationship with Mr. Barthelette and that in these circumstances, as Mr. Baptiste testified, they are considered by INAC to be legally married for the purpose of income assistance eligibility. Moreover, given the fact that INAC conducted an investigation and determined that there were no problems with the way that the Complainant\u2019s case was handled, the Respondent submits that the evidence supports a finding that the Complainant was properly denied income assistance. The Respondent highlights that regardless of the validity of this decision, the denial of her application was not in any way linked to the fact that she is not a descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner and therefore, cannot be said to be discriminatory.\n[120] Mr. Baptiste testified that, in examining the Complainant\u2019s First Nation Tenant Profile Form, wherein she lists Mr. Barthelette as a resident of her household; the Complainant\u2019s and Mr. Barthelette\u2019s Manitoba Health Registration Cards, which have the same mailing address; as well as her June 10, 2011 application for income assistance, which list Mr. Barthelette\u2019s pension as part of her \u201cunearned income\u201d, she would not qualify for income assistance. This is due to the fact that this evidence would lead Mr. Baptiste to conclude that the Complainant and Mr. Barthelette were in a common law relationship and since Mr. Barthelette receives an old age pension, Ms. Tanner would not qualify for social assistance.\n[121] On cross-examination, Complainant Counsel asked the witness to comment on a document produced by INAC as part of its \u201cIncome Assistance Policy and Procedures\u201d entitled \u201cChecklist 3: Dependency Relationships\u201d. The document states that the checklist contains\n\u201cfactors that may indicate an applicant is living with another person as either a common-law or same-sex partner. It is not mandatory to use, but income assistance administrators and their staff may find it useful in administering the Income Assistance Program in a fair and objective manner\u201d.\nIt further states that \u201cFinancial interdependence is the most important factor. Evidence of two of these three factors must be present to establish a common-law union\u201d. In addition to the financial interdependence factor, which can be established by affirming the existence of one or many of the sub-factors listed, the other determining factors are \u201cFamily Interdependence\u201d and \u201cPlace of Residence\u201d.\n[122] Mr. Baptiste maintained that he had knowledge of these factors and that on its face, the application and related documents would lead the worker to conclude the existence of a common-law relationship between Ms. Tanner and Mr. Barthelette. Mr. Baptiste noted that he did not personally know either Ms. Tanner or Mr. Barthelette.\n[123] Ms. Tanner testified that Mr. Barthelette was a friend who occasionally came to stay with her, and who provided her with no financial assistance. Roxanne Brass contradicted the fact that Mr. Barthelette was just a friend of Ms. Tanner\u2019s and testified that she had heard Ms. Tanner refer to him as her old man and that Charlene referred to him as her mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n[124] Ms. Tanner indicated that the only reason that she listed Mr. Barthelette as a resident of her household and later as her spouse was because Terry Tanner advised that she do so. Her testimony is unchallenged in this regard, as Terry Tanner, despite the fact that he was on the witness list, did not testify.\n[125] However, as highlighted by the Respondent, the issue here is not whether Ms. Tanner was appropriately denied income assistance, or even whether she was in a common-law relationship with Mr. Barthelette, but whether Terry Tanner\u2019s advice to her in completing her income assistance application was influenced by the fact that she is a non-blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner; or, as submitted by the Complainant, on the basis of her family status.\n[126] Therein lies the weakness of the Complainant\u2019s position. While Terry Tanner\u2019s advice may indeed have resulted in the denial of the Complainant\u2019s social assistance application, the evidence does not indicate that his advice was in any way linked to the Complainant\u2019s status as a non-descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner; or, that his advice was even wrong. The evidence indicates that there is a legitimate dispute over whether Ms. Tanner was in a common-law relationship with Mr. Barthelette. However, it is not for the Tribunal to determine the Complainant\u2019s relationship status. Rather, the Tribunal must determine whether there was a discriminatory practice. In this regard, there was insufficient evidence to establish that ancestry was a factor in Terry Tanner\u2019s advice to the Complainant or the ultimate denial of her social assistance application. Overall, on a balance of probabilities, I conclude that the Complainant has failed to demonstrate that the Respondent\u2019s actions leading to the denial of her social assistance application were in any way discriminatory.\nB. Denial of Use of Medical Van\n[127] In February 2012, the Complainant was diagnosed with cancer and later, the prognosis was that it was terminal cancer. The Complainant testified that she sought the use of the Nation\u2019s medical van for trips to medical appointments and was advised it was booked or otherwise unavailable.\n[128] The Complainant\u2019s daughter, Charlene Tanner, testified that other individuals had told her she could not use the van, but further testified that this did not come from the Chief or Councillors directly. She added that she drove her mother to different medical appointments on 79 occasions, at approximately $40.00 per trip, for a total of $3,160.00. Counsel for the Complainant submitted that the action of denying the medical van was a callous disregard for the Complainant.\n[129] Chief David LeDoux testified that any member of the Nation could use the medical van and use is not limited to being a blood descendant.\n[130] Aside for stating she was denied use of the medical van, and that this was callous, Ms. Tanner\u2019s allegations here do not demonstrate that a prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in her being denied the use of the medical van, whether based on ancestry or otherwise. Nor was there evidence to refute the lack of availability of the medical van. For these reasons, I find the complainant has not established a prima facie case for this aspect of her complaint.\nC. Banishment from Band Facilities and Exclusion from Activities and Services\n[131] The Complainant alleges the Nation has tried to banish her from the community and denied her various services offered to other Band members, including garden supplies, home improvements, snow removal and lawn cutting.\n[132] With regard to banishment, two Band council resolutions were at issue. One dated March 2, 2000 provides:\nWhereas, the on-reserve membership of Gamblers First Nation are taking a stand against violence in the community.\nWhereas, the membership will not tolerate the gang-like actions against the members, especially the elderly here on Gamblers First Nation Reserve.\nWhereas, the membership are in agreement to take action so that we can live at home without fear.\nBe It Resolved that, the majority of the Gamblers First Nation membership are removing you, Sharon J. Tanner, Treaty #2940017602, from residency here on Gamblers First Nation.\nBe It Resolved that, the majority of the Band Membership living on reserve and of legal voting are, are in agreement to have you, Sharon J. Tanner, removed permanently from Gamblers First Nation Reserve.\n[133] The other resolution dated March 3, 2000 provides:\nWhereas, the on-reserve membership of Gamblers First Nation are taking a stand against violence in the community.\nWhereas, the membership will not tolerate the gang-like actions against the members, especially the elderly here on Gamblers First Nation Reserve.\nWhereas, as your job is to help people in need by way of health positions as CHR and NNADAP jobs.\nBe It Resolved that, the majority of the Band Members living on-reserve and of legal voting age, are in agreement to release you Sharon J. Tanner from your CHR job and your NNADAP job.\n[134] The Respondent submits these Band council resolutions were a result of the Complainant\u2019s violent actions and are unrelated to the Complainant\u2019s status as a non-blood descendant of John (Falcon) Tanner. They were entered into four days after the Complainant was involved in the violent incident with other Band members. Given the timing of the Band council resolutions and the specific references to \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cgang-like actions\u201d, the Respondent submits the evidence supports a finding that the Complainant\u2019s banishment was as a result of her violence and is unrelated to her status as a non-blood descendant.\n[135] The evidence indicated that the Band council resolutions in 2000 were indeed in response to a violent incident involving the Complainant. Furthermore, the evidence disclosed that over the years Ms. Tanner was not the only individual who was banished from the Nation. Even blood descendants had been banished. Overall, the Complainant did not demonstrate that her ancestry was a factor in this treatment.\n[136] With regard to the services of garden supplies, home improvements, snow removal and lawn cutting, the Complainant did not establish that she was treated differently from other members of the community, let alone that her ancestry was a factor in any adverse treatment. Chief LeDoux responded to these allegations and indicated that INAC only provides funding to clear main roads and houses with water tanks; members are responsible for cutting their own lawns; garden supplies are provided to all members who request them; and, home improvements have been provided to the Complainant\u2019s home. As a result, this aspect of the complaint is also dismissed.\nIV. Issue 3: Retaliation\n[137] In addition to alleging the Respondent discriminated against her in its application of the Descent Rule, the Complainant alleges the Respondent retaliated against her for the filing of her complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the CHRA. Section 14.1 reads:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[138] To establish a breach of this section, as is the case with other discriminatory practices, the Complainant must demonstrate a prima facie case. Applying the Moore test in the context of retaliation, the Complainant must present sufficient evidence to justify that her human rights complaint was a factor in any adverse treatment she suffered following the filing of her complaint. The Tribunal has previously recognized a complainant\u2019s perception of retaliation, as long as it is reasonable, may constitute sufficient evidence in this regard (see Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (CHRT) at paras. 218-223 [Wong]). As is the case for other discriminatory practices, there is also no requirement for the Complainant to establish any intent to retaliate on the part of the Respondent to establish a prima facie case (see Wong at paras. 221-222; and, First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2015 CHRT 14 at paras. 3-27). If a prima facie case of retaliation is established, the Tribunal will consider whether, on the basis of the evidence presented by both parties, it is more probable than not that retaliation has occurred.\n[139] It is with this legal framework in mind that I examine the allegations of retaliation in the present case.\nA. Summary of the Relevant Facts\n[140] On June 26, 2012, a little over one month after the filing of the complaint, the Complainant applied to the position of Economic Development Officer for Gambler First Nation and was invited to an interview. On July 4, 2012, Ms. Tanner was verbally informed by Councillor Ron Ducharme that she had been hired for the position. The contract, although it was never drafted, was to run until the end of the fiscal year (March 29, 2013), subject to renewal for future years. Ms. Tanner was to start work on July 9, 2012, with a wage of $12 per hour for 80 hours on a bi-weekly basis.\n[141] Two days later, on July 6, 2012, the Chief and Council received a copy of Ms. Tanner\u2019s human rights complaint.\n[142] In a letter dated July 9, 2012, drafted by the Chief\u2019s wife Rose LeDoux and signed by the Chief, the Chief informed Ms. Tanner that she had been awarded the position of Economic Development Officer on the condition that she agree to withdraw her human rights complaint. The letter reads:\nDear Ms Tanner,\nYou have been awarded the position of Economic Development Officer for Gambler First Nation with a start date of July 9, 2012; conditional on releasing Gambler First Nation, Chief David LeDoux and Councilor Roy Vermette of any action against them in the complaint you submitted to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Discussion of this matter was held with Councilor Ronnie Ducharme, Councilor Roy Vermette, Financial Manager Harlene Swain and Chief David LeDoux on July 6, 2012.\nMr. Harold Cochrane, Lawyer will be drawing up a letter of release to this effect.\nThe position of Economic Development Officer is a contractual position and is subject to renewal on a yearly basis. Your position for this fiscal year will run from July 9, 2012 till March 29, 2013 and [sic] eight (8) month period. You will be on probation for the first three (3) months; job description pending.\nSincerely,\nChief David LeDoux\n[143] Following the receipt of this letter, Sharon Tanner met with Chief LeDoux, Rose LeDoux, and Harlene Swain. During this meeting, Rose LeDoux presented Ms. Tanner with copies of a Release and Waiver of Independent Legal Advice. Chief LeDoux informed Ms. Tanner that she could still keep her job if she signed the documents. She refused on the basis that Councillors Roy Vermette and Ron Ducharme were absent and therefore, that the meeting did not have quorum.\n[144] Ms. Tanner was nevertheless awarded the position. She performed in this capacity for a period of three months, during which she worked primarily on a proposal for the Home Adaptations for Senior Independence (HASI) program, which provides for the funding of minor home adaptations to allow seniors to remain in their homes and live independently. She also alleges that, upon the Chief\u2019s request, she worked on a project to build a skating rink as well as on a few other projects for individuals who wished to return to school or those like Doreen Mitchell, who were looking for work.\n[145] In August, Ms. Tanner was informed that it was not appropriate for Harlene Swain, as Financial Manager, to share an office with her and since there were no other working spaces at the Band office, Ms. Tanner set up her office at home with the help of Councillors Roy Vermette and Ron Ducharme. She worked from home until she was terminated\n[146] On September 24, 2012, Harlene Swain sent a letter to the Complainant, on behalf of the Chief, requesting that she attend a meeting on October 1st to evaluate her performance as the end of her probationary period was up. The letter also requested that Ms. Tanner bring her \u201cMonthly Activity Reports, Funding Reports and copies of Submitted Proposals\u201d.\n[147] Ms. Tanner testified that, upon its receipt, she showed the letter to Councillors Roy Vermette and Ron Ducharme. Neither of them had any knowledge of this meeting and expressed that they were satisfied with her work. The Councillors allegedly told the Complainant that since the two of them constituted a quorum, which was all that was necessary for the Band council to render a decision, she did not have to attend the meeting. Ms. Tanner did not attend the meeting.\n[148] On October 2, 2012, the Complainant received a letter from Gambler First Nation, signed by Harlene Swain. The letter stated that, in light of the fact that the Complainant did not attend her evaluation, attend regular staff meetings as required, or submit her monthly activity reports, spending reports and copies of submitted proposals, it would be recommended that her employment be terminated. The letter stated that a Band meeting would be held for this purpose at the Gambler First Nation Band office at 10:00 a.m. on October 9, 2012. The Complainant once again discussed the letter with Councillors Roy Vermette and Ron Ducharme, who had not received a copy of the letter nor possessed prior knowledge of the meeting. They assured Ms. Tanner that the Chief needed a quorum to make such a decision.\n[149] On October 9, 2012, the Chief held a Band meeting to discuss, amongst other things, the termination of Ms. Tanner\u2019s employment. Ms. Tanner did not attend this meeting, however Ms. Tanner\u2019s daughter, Charlene Tanner, was present, and when the termination was discussed, spoke in her defense. Councillor Roy Vermette was also in attendance.\n[150] In a letter dated October 9, 2012, Chief David LeDoux informed the Complainant: \u201cAs you are on probation, as you did not attend your evaluation you are here by terminated from your position\u201d. The Complainant testified that she showed the letter to the Councillors and that they expressed to her that they had no knowledge of it and that the Chief had taken this decision in the absence of a quorum.\n[151] On November 13, 2012, the Complainant filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code. Despite the fact that her employment was allegedly terminated for cause, Ms. Tanner subsequently received $5,672.00 and an additional $1,221.12 as holiday pay and pay in lieu of notice.\nB. Parties\u2019 Submissions and Analysis\n[152] The Respondent has taken the position that the decision to terminate the Complainant was based on her performance. Ashley Smith, the daughter of Chief David LeDoux and a volunteer on the housing committee during this period, testified that a HASI proposal essentially consists of completing a checklist and takes approximately one hour to complete. The Respondent argues that this evidence contradicts the Complainant\u2019s testimony that she worked on this proposal for the majority of her three months of employment and supports the decision to terminate her employment. Moreover, according to Chief LeDoux, the HASI Program is a Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Program and falls under the housing portfolio, for which Ronnie Ducharme is responsible and is not part of the Economic Development Officer responsibilities. The Complainant\u2019s failure to perform the duties of Economic Development Officer, combined with her failure to attend her performance evaluation and provide her monthly activity reports, funding reports and copies of her submitted proposals, formed the basis for her dismissal.\n[153] Ms. Tanner testified that her work on the HASI proposal involved much more than completing a checklist. She stated that once the funding came through, she had to bring in the carpenters to do the renovation work and have the work evaluated to ensure it had been done correctly. Ms. Tanner claimed that she received instructions from Cindy McCabe from the West Region Tribal Council as well as from the Councillors, to whom she reported, and that all were satisfied with her work. Her decision not to attend the performance evaluation and subsequent meetings was founded on her conversations with the Councillors and the apparent lack of quorum. The Complainant refutes the Respondent\u2019s position that she was properly terminated due to her lack of performance, and argues that the fact that she received pay in lieu of notice as well as holiday pay, contradicts the Respondent\u2019s submission that she was fired for cause.\n[154] There is no question that the parameters of the Complainant\u2019s employment with Gambler First Nation as the Economic Development Officer were ill-defined. No contract was drafted and the Complainant never received a job description. Ms. Tanner received instructions from Cindy McCabe, as well as from the Councillors, and testified that she had little contact with the Chief during this period. In this context, it is difficult to accept the Chief\u2019s contention that she erred in working on the HASI Program as it allegedly fell outside of her responsibilities. It is also difficult to accept that Ms. Tanner\u2019s failure to provide the requested Monthly Activity and Funding Reports supports the decision to terminate her employment when the Chief could not remember whether or not Ms. Tanner had been informed that the completion of the reports were a part of her job: Transcript at pp. 752-753.\n[155] Having said this, parts of Ms. Tanner\u2019s testimony regarding the work she performed were contradictory and lacked credibility. At one point, Ms. Tanner expressed that she had interpreted the decision that she could not share Harlene Swain\u2019s office as the termination of her employment: \u201cI didn\u2019t have an office to work at. I was more or less fired already\u201d (Transcript at p. 134). It was not clear if, at this point, she really continued to work from home: \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to work on the other one [other proposal than the HASI proposal]. Like I said I was removed from my office. So this was the only one I got completed\u201d (Transcript at p. 134). Ms. Tanner stated that the Councillors, to whom she reported, were satisfied with her performance. This is perhaps unsurprising as the only house approved pursuant to the HASI proposal on which she worked during this period was the home of Councillor Roy Vermette. Roy Vermette has since deceased and while Ronnie Ducharme produced an affidavit which supports the Complainant\u2019s submission that her dismissal did not have \u201cquorum\u201d, he did not testify at the hearing.\n[156] The issue of the existence of a \u201cquorum\u201d, as a requirement for the Band\u2019s decision-making is at the root of much of the contention surrounding these events. Ms. Tanner testified at numerous occasions that she did not recognize the Chief\u2019s decisions due to the fact that they were made without the knowledge and consent of the Councillors, and therefore without a \u201cquorum\u201d or majority. According to his affidavit, this view appears to be supported by Councillor Ronnie Ducharme. Chief David LeDoux also testified to the fact that both Councillors believed that they had \u201cquorum\u201d:\nMR. TOUET: Can you discuss the governance in the first year when Ronnie and Roy were both involved?\nMR. LEDOUX: They basically did not like the way that I tried to make it fair for everybody on Gambler. They always said they had quorum which means two out of the three elected officials have the say I guess, final say.\n[157] Chief David LeDoux expressed that he had a different view on the necessity of a quorum:\nMR. TOUET: Okay. What do you understand quorum to be necessary for?\nMR. LEDOUX: Quorum would be something that needs to be dealt with that affects the membership. For instance removal of Chief-in-Council, you need more than a quorum, you\u2019ve got to have whatever the conviction, whatever. My idea back then was getting the membership involved and making decisions. I don\u2019t really like the idea of being run by a Chief or a councillor making my decisions for me, so, I tried to bring the membership in and deal with the issues through the membership. They [Roy Vermette and Ronnie Ducharme] didn\u2019t like that at all, not one bit.\n[\u2026]\nMR. TOUET: Your understanding of quorum. Is quorum necessary for day-to-day decisions?\nMR. LEDOUX: No, we have our policies and procedures in place. Our administration policy, conduct policy, confidentiality and that was already voted on. It\u2019s up to the staff to deal with the employees as our policies and procedures.\nMR. TOUET: So for calling meetings with staff, would quorum be necessary for something like that?\nMR. LEDOUX: No.\nTranscript at pp. 695-696, 700-701\n[158] Chief David LeDoux testified that he did not \u201chave the same ideas as a lot of our past administration or Chief-in-Council\u201d: Transcript at p. 688-689, which includes Councillors Roy Vermette and Ronnie Ducharme. According to the minutes of the October 9, 2012, Band meeting led by Chief LeDoux, the same meeting where the decision to terminate Ms. Tanner\u2019s employment was made, Ronnie Ducharme was stripped of his signing rights and his portfolio, and his honorarium was given to Roy Vermette. The tension among the members of the Band council became evident in Chief LeDoux\u2019s testimony and the contention regarding the necessity for a quorum is only further evidence of this. In light of the existence of this conflict, it is difficult to hold Ms. Tanner, as an employee of the Band, responsible for following the directions of the two Councillors rather than the Chief\u2019s, who appeared to know little of the work completed by Ms. Tanner and testified that he had not read the proposal she had given him.\n[159] Nevertheless, the question at hand is not whether Ms. Tanner was appropriately fired for cause but rather, if her filing of a human rights complaint against the Respondent was a factor in the decision to terminate her employment. The Respondent\u2019s letter, informing Ms. Tanner that her employment with the Band was conditional upon her signing a release relating to her human rights complaint looms large in this regard. The Respondent has admitted this fact:\nMR. TOUET: We\u2019ve heard evidence that Ms. Tanner was asked to sign a release relating to her Human Rights complaint?\nMR. LEDOUX: Yes, at that time we were dealing with complaints for the other ones I had dismissed so the lawyer Cochrane I think, Sonny Cochrane advised that it\u2019s not good to hire somebody who has a complaint against you, so, let\u2019s see if we can get that out of the way. I don\u2019t know what other company would hire somebody that has a complaint against them. So that\u2019s the reason.\nThe letter also formed part of the evidentiary record.\n[160] While the Complainant was awarded the position, despite the fact that she refused to sign the release, the Respondent\u2019s initial response to hiring Ms. Tanner is troubling and in and of itself, constitutes quite clearly a threat of retaliation, contrary to section 14.1. I agree with the Commission that this response also provides a lens through which the Tribunal should examine the question of why Ms. Tanner was subsequently terminated. The human rights complaint may not have been the only factor in the decision to terminate Ms. Tanner, but the letter, combined with the Chief\u2019s subsequent lack of involvement regarding Ms. Tanner\u2019s work as the Economic Development Officer and the weakness of a number of the reasons explaining the termination, makes it difficult to believe that it was not one of the factors which informed this decision. Therefore, I find that the termination constitutes retaliation and is in violation of section 14.1 of the CHRA.\nV. Order\n[161] Having found the Descent Rule and retaliation complaints to be substantiated, I may make an order against Gambler First Nation pursuant to section 53(2) of the CHRA. The aim in making an order under subsection 53(2) is not to punish the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, but to eliminate - as much as possible - the discriminatory effects of the practice (see Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13). To accomplish this, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\n[162] The Complainant requests compensation for pain and suffering pursuant to section 53(2)(e); special compensation pursuant to section 53(3); and, compensation for lost wages, pursuant to section 53(2)(c), for the termination of her Economic Development Officer position. In addition, the Commission requests that the Nation stop declaring election candidates ineligible based on the Descent Rule and review its Election Law to remove references to the Descent Rule. The Commission asks that this review be completed within one year of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\nA. Cease and desist order\n[163] Section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA provides the Tribunal with the authority to order:\nthat the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future\n[164] In this regard, the Commission requests the following orders from the Tribunal:\n(a) That the Nation cease and desist from declaring candidates for office ineligible based on the Descent Rule.\n(b) That the Nation review its current written customary election code and take such steps as may be necessary to remove references to the Descent Rule from that written customary election code.\n(c) That the steps described in paragraph (b) above be completed within one year of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n[165] Given my finding that the application of the Descent Rule is discriminatory, I find the Commission\u2019s request for an order under section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA to be necessary to prevent the discrimination that Ms. Tanner endured from occurring again in the future. I therefore order the Respondent to cease applying the Descent Rule and to review is Election Law to remove references to the Descent Rule. The review of the Election Law should be completed within one year of this decision, subject to my order at paragraph 180 below.\nB. Compensation for pain and suffering\n[166] The Complainant seeks up to $20,000 in compensation for pain and suffering as a result of each of the discriminatory practices. This is the maximum amount of compensation the Tribunal can award under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. The Tribunal only awards the maximum amount in the most egregious of circumstances: where the extent and duration of the complainant\u2019s suffering as a result of the discriminatory practice warrants the full amount.\n[167] With respect to the Complainant\u2019s inability to run for Chief, the Respondent submits the Complainant presented no evidence as to the likelihood of the Complainant being elected Chief of the First Nation. It notes that there were five other candidates for Chief in the 2012 election. It adds that the term of office is for a period of eight months at an annual salary of approximately $20,000, which equates to $13,333 over the eight month period. Assuming the Complainant had an equal chance as any other candidate in the election, the Respondent submits her share of the Chief\u2019s salary for 2012 would be $2,666.66. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this is the maximum amount of damages that the Complainant should be entitled to for pain and suffering related to taking away her opportunity to be a candidate for the position of Chief. With regard to retaliation, the Respondent submits the Complainant has failed to establish that she is entitled to compensation for losing her job as Economic Development Officer.\n[168] Ms. Tanner has been an activist in her community for many years, trying to bring about order and good government. She is a respected member of the Nation as indicated by her nomination for Councillor and Chief on different occasions, as well as being appointed to examine the Nation\u2019s finances. She indicated that her exclusion from the leadership of the Nation, based on the Descent Rule, and after more than 30 years of living as a member of the community, made her feel alienated, sad, isolated and embarrassed. Pain she continues to feel to this day. Taking this all into account, I believe an award of $12,500 is appropriate for the pain and suffering the Complainant endured as a result of the application of the Descent Rule. The Respondent\u2019s submissions regarding the Chief\u2019s salary and loss of opportunity are not relevant to assessing the Complainant\u2019s pain and suffering. They more appropriately relate to an award for wage loss, which the Complainant did not claim in the relation to the Descent Rule complaint.\n[169] Similarly, the circumstances surrounding the retaliation complaint further contributed to the Complainant\u2019s degradation within the community. She was not permitted to work at the Band Council Office and her work ethic was publicly and unmeritoriously criticized by the Chief at a Band Council meeting. This was hurtful and embarrassing for the Complainant. Therefore, I award $2,500 as compensation for the pain and suffering the Complainant endured as a result of the retaliation by the Respondent.\nC. Special compensation\n[170] The Complainant seeks up to $20,000 as compensation from the Respondent for having engaged in retaliation wilfully or recklessly, pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA. The Commission believes an award under this section for the Descent Rule complaint is also in order.\n[171] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 110, at paragraph 154, the Federal Court stated the following with regard to section 53(3):\nThis is a punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate. A finding of wilfulness requires the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional. Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly.\n[172] Again, as $20,000 is the maximum amount that can be awarded under section 53(3) of the CHRA, the maximum award should be reserved for the very worst cases.\n[173] With regard to the Descent Rule, the Respondent submits the First Nation did not enact the Election Law with disregard to the consequences. It was developed by Larry Catagas with input from members of Gambler First Nation and was put to a vote of the members in a Referendum and received approval by a majority of electors. Again, with regard to retaliation, the Respondent submits the Complainant has failed to establish that she is entitled to compensation for losing her job as Economic Development Officer.\n[174] On the Descent Rule complaint, I found the Respondent was unable to provide a credible explanation as to why it decided, in 2010, to move forward with the adoption of the Election Law. This was three years after the initial referendum on the issue, which I noted had many irregularities, and around a time where Ms. Tanner was expressing interest in being a part of the leadership of the Nation. This led me to find that it is more probable than not that the Election Law was adopted in 2010, at least in part, to prevent Ms. Tanner from running for Chief. That said, I cannot conclusively say that the Respondent\u2019s actions were intentionally discriminatory. However, based on the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Respondent showed disregard and indifference towards the Complainant. Therefore, I award $10,000 as special compensation for the Descent Rule complaint.\n[175] With regard to the retaliation complaint, I find the Respondent\u2019s actions strike at the core of the protection against retaliation found at section 14.1 of the CHRA. Making the Economic Development Officer job offer conditional on withdrawing her human rights was a blatant threat of retaliation. While the Respondent did not act on this threat, and the Complainant ultimately received the job, the initial threat, combined with the weakness of a number of the reasons explaining the termination, led me to find that Ms. Tanner\u2019s human rights complaint was at least one factor that drove the decision to terminate her contract. In my view, this evidence indicates that there was some element of deliberateness and planning in the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate the Complainant\u2019s contract as an Economic Development Officer, which merits a higher range award for special compensation. Accordingly, I award $15,000 as special compensation for the retaliation complaint.\nD. Compensation for lost wages\n[176] Pursuant to section 53(2)(c), the Complainant seeks $10,328 for unpaid wages as a result of the termination of her Economic Development Officer position.\n[177] The $10,328 in lost wages sought by the Complainant is based on the term of her contract (8 months) minus pay she has already received ($5,672.00 in wages and $1,221.12 as holiday pay and pay in lieu of notice). Having found the Respondent retaliated against the Complainant in terminating her contract as an Economic Development Officer, I order the claim for $10,328 in unpaid wages.\nE. Retention of jurisdiction\n[178] The Commission requests the Tribunal to retain jurisdiction and remain seized of this matter until the parties confirm that the remedies ordered above have been implemented. In the event the parties disagree regarding the interpretation or implementation of any relief ordered, the Commission asks the Tribunal to receive evidence, hear additional arguments and\/or make additional orders.\n[179] There may be practical issues with reviewing the Nation\u2019s written customary election code within one year, as ordered above. To ensure this aspect of my order is implemented effectively and reasonably for all parties, I will retain jurisdiction over this aspect of the order until the parties confirm that it has been implemented.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Introduction [1] The Complainant has made a motion (\u201cDisclosure Motion\u201d or \u201cMotion\u201d) that the Respondent produce:\n\u2022 \u201call arguably relevant\u201d documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession; and\n\u2022 an unredacted and complete copy of the Respondent\u2019s Simulation Exercise Administration Manual (\u201cthe Manual\u201d) including certain specified pages, set out below, and any other pages missing from the version of the Manual which the Respondent has already disclosed.\n[2] The Respondent uses the Manual in its nine-week Port of Entry Recruitment Training (\u2018POERT\u201d) program to administer simulation exercises and evaluate trainees\u2019 performance of behavioural competencies during the two testing portions of POERT.\n[3] The Notice of Motion requests disclosure of specific pages of the Manual, set out below, with the Complainant\u2019s brief general description of their topics. As the Respondent has not raised any issue regarding these descriptions, for the purposes of this Motion, the descriptions are assumed accurate.\na) Pages 20 to 87 and 269 to 277\n[4] These pages relate to the D-I testing process of the simulations.\nb) Pages 123 to 129\n[5] These pages relate to a version of the simulation evaluations called Version B.\nc) Pages 137 to 171\n[6] These pages make up a chapter related to a version of the simulation evaluation called Version C.\nd) Pages 280 to 282 and 284 \u2013 287\n[7] These pages are contained in a chapter titled \u201cD-II Recruit Simulation Background Information\u201d related to the simulations evaluation in D-II.\ne) Any other pages that may be missing from the Manual.\n[8] In paragraph 17 of its Response to the Complainant\u2019s Motion, the Respondent states that it has not produced Manual pages 102 to 115. Category e) captures these pages.\nII. Grounds for Disclosure Motion [9] The Complainant\u2019s Motion is on the following grounds:\n1. Rules 3 and 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (\u201cthe Rules\u201d);\n2. Subsection 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cAct\u201d);\n3. The requested pages (\u201cRequested Pages\u201d) are arguably relevant and relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the Complaint, specifically, to whether the Respondent has discriminated against the Complainant in the manner alleged.\nIII. Background of the Complaint [10] For the purposes of this Ruling only, the following is a very brief and general background summary of the POERT program and the Complainant\u2019s history in it.\n[11] The Complainant applied to the Respondent to become a Border Services Officer (\u201cBSO\u201d). He passed the initial screening, and the Respondent invited him to be a trainee in the POERT program.\n[12] The POERT contains two evaluation stages, called \u201cDetermination Points\u201d: Determination Point I (\u201cD-I\u201d), administered during the fourth week, and Determination Point II (\u201cD-II\u201d), administered at the end. Trainees must pass the entire POERT program in order to be placed in the pool of those eligible to be hired as BSOs.\n[13] The D-I evaluation consists of two written exams and three simulations. Each of the D-I simulations assess seven behavioural competencies: Client Service Orientation; Supporting CBSA Values; Analytical Thinking; Decisiveness; Effective Interactive Communication; Information Seeking Techniques; and Legislation, Policies and Procedures.\n[14] During D-I, the Respondent also provides feedback on the competencies of Dealing with Difficult Situations and Self-Confidence. Although these two competencies are not formally evaluated during D-I, they are evaluated at the end of D-II.\n[15] The D-II evaluation consists of another set of written tests, a Control and Defensive Tactics Simulation, and three other simulations. The simulations in D-II each assess the same competencies as assessed in D-I, plus Dealing with Difficult Situations and Self-Confidence.\n[16] The Complainant passed all the written tests and behavioural competencies evaluations in D-I. He went on to POERT\u2019s second component, and was assessed in D-II. The Complainant did not pass all the behavioural competencies in the D-II simulations, and was not placed in the pool of potential BSOs.\nIV. Amendment Ruling and Confidentiality Ruling [17] The Tribunal Ruling cited as Itty v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 33 (\u201cAmendment Ruling\u201d), granted the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend the Complaint by adding the phrase \u201cand section 10\u201d. Paragraph 1, third sentence of the Complaint. is deemed to read:\n\u201cI believe that the Canada Border Services Agency\u2019s (\u201cCBSA\u2019s\u201d) Port of Entry Recruitment Training (\u201cPOERT\u201d) program discriminated against me on the grounds of age, race and national or ethnic origin in my capacity as a candidate for employment as a Border services Officer, contrary to section 7 and section 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\u201d\n[18] A second Ruling, cited as Itty v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 34 (\u201cConfidentiality Ruling\u201d), orders the parties to keep certain documents confidential. One of those documents is the Manual.\nV. Issue in this Motion [19] Must the Respondent disclose the Requested Pages?\nVI. Statutory Law and Tribunal Rules [20] Section 7 of the Act states:\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d\n[21] Section 10 of the Act states:\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d\n[22] Subsection 50(1) of the Act states, in part:\n\u201c\u2026the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d\n[23] For the purposes of this Motion, the relevant portions of Rule 6 state:\n\u201c(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(5) A party shall provide such additional disclosure and production as is necessary\n(b) where the party discovers that its compliance with 6(1)(d)\u2026is inaccurate or incomplete.\u201d\nVII. Standard for the disclosure of documents [24] It is well-established by case law that the standard for the disclosure of documents pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and (5) is that the documents be \u201carguably relevant\u201d to a fact, issue or form of relief sought, or identified by other parties. To be arguably relevant, there must be a nexus or rational connection between the document sought to be disclosed and a fact, issue or form of relief sought or identified by other parties (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (\u201cSeeley\u201d), at para. 6. Requests for disclosure \u201c\u2026must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (Johanne Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (\u201cGuay\u201d), at para. 43.\nVIII. Complainant\u2019s Submissions [25] The Complainant submits that the Requested Pages should be disclosed because they:\n\u2022 directly relate to the main issues in dispute;\n\u2022 their disclosure will ensure the Complainant has a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to participate in the inquiry in accordance with subjection 50(1) of the Act;\n\u2022 are necessary in their entirety for the Complainant to demonstrate that the Respondent has established discriminatory practices or policies;\n\u2022 the threshold for arguable relevance is very low (Guay, supra, at para. 44), and the trend in the jurisprudence is towards more disclosure.\nIX. Respondent\u2019s Submissions [26] The Respondent submits that with respect to the Manual, it has already disclosed:\n\u2022 \u201call of the Manual materials related to the competencies tested; and\n\u2022 all of the specifics of the simulations which the Complainant failed and in which the Complainant alleges he was discriminated against\u201d (para. 15 of the Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion).\n[27] The Respondent groups the undisclosed portions of the Manual into three, and submits they have not been disclosed because they are not relevant to the Complaint. They are:\n1. simulation specifics in D-I, including:\na) those the Complainant passed; and\nb) those the Respondent did not administer to the Complainant\u2019s class;\n1. D-II simulations which the Respondent did not administer to the Complainant\u2019s class;\n2. D-II simulations which the Complainant passed.\n[28] The Respondent submits that it administered the same version of all simulation exercises to all members of the Complainant\u2019s class. Therefore, there is nothing for the Complainant to compare and there is no connection in the simulations not administered to the Complainant\u2019s class to the issues in the Complaint.\n[29] The Respondent\u2019s position on the simulations is that the Complaint is not about the simulations in D-I or D-II which the Complainant passed, but about those simulations in D-II which he did not pass [emphasis mine]. The Respondent\u2019s submission is that it could not have discriminated against the Complainant in simulations which it did not administer to him. Therefore, anything not directly related to the D-II tests which the Complainant failed is not arguably relevant to the Complaint and need not be disclosed.\nX. Analysis [30] This Ruling will not deal with the Notice of Motion\u2019s request that the Respondent produce \u201c\u2026all arguably relevant documents in its possession, with respect to the matters at issue\u2026\u201d Rule 6 already embodies that request, including the Rule\u2019s requirement that disclosure be ongoing.\n[31] I find that, generally, the Complainant wishes to prove that:\n\u2022 the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant personally throughout the POERT program on the prohibited grounds of age, race and national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 7 of the Act; and\n\u2022 in the POERT program, the Respondent has established or pursued policies and practices, or either of them, which deprived or tended to deprive the Complainant of employment opportunities on the same prohibited grounds, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[32] I further find, for the purposes of deciding this Motion, that a non-exhaustive list of examples which the Complainant wishes to use to prove the above discrimination is:\n1) the Respondent \u201cwanted [the Complainant] to fail\u201d because of his age (Complaint, para. 10), and the Respondent had a policy or practice of age discrimination in the POERT program (ibid and Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, at para. 34), contrary to section 7 and 10 of the Act;\n2) in evaluating the Complainant, the Respondent\u2019s assessors treated him differently, to his detriment, because they evaluated the Complainant at a higher standard compared to younger, white candidates, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act;\n3) the behavioural competencies used to evaluate the Complainant and other recruits during the simulations in both D-I and D-II are in and of themselves \u201chighly subjective\u201d (Complainant\u2019s SOP, para. 54) and therefore vulnerable to the prejudices of the evaluators, contrary to section 10 of the Act;\n4) the Respondent\u2019s practices in assessing the Complainant\u2019s performance of the competencies relied on aspects of the Complainant\u2019s age, race, national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[33] The Complainant does not differentiate between the simulations he passed and those he failed in the allegations he seeks to prove. There is a nexus among all the simulations, the methods used in their assessment and the issues in dispute. All the D-I and D-II simulations administered to the Complainant are therefore arguably relevant, and the Respondent should disclose them.\n[34] Paragraph 24 of the Respondent\u2019s SOP states that the Complainant passed the D-I simulations component. It also states, in part:\n\u201cWhile [Complainant] was able to pass, the assessors noted the need for improvements in various areas. In fact, [Complainant] received a mark of \u201cnot met\u201d from one of his assessors for the Effective Interactive Communication competency. While Self-Confidence and Dealing with Difficult Situations were competencies not formally evaluated at the D-1 stage, the assessors gave negative feedback with respect to both and indicated that [Complainant] would need to improve if he wished to succeed in the D-II evaluation.\u201d\n[35] The Respondent\u2019s position in this Motion is that paragraph 24 simply refers to assessors\u2019 comments during D-I about the Complainant\u2019s performance of the competencies of Self-Confidence and Dealing with Difficult Situations, and those comments are not arguably relevant because the Complaint is about D-II, not D-I.\n[36] Paragraph 14 of the Respondent\u2019s SOP describes an aspect of D-I as follows:\n\u201cCandidates are also provided with feedback regarding Dealing with Difficult Situations and Self-Confidence, though these two competencies are not formally evaluated at the D-I stage.\u201d\n[37] I find that that the Respondent\u2019s assessors gave \u201cnegative feedback\u201d on the Complainant\u2019s performance of these two competencies not as mere side commentary or by chance, but rather because it was a policy or practice of the Respondent to do so, as stated in paragraph 14 of its SOP. There is therefore a nexus between what the Complainant wishes to prove regarding individual and systemic discrimination and those parts of the Manual about the D-I simulations and the methods of assessment.\n[38] The portions of the Manual dealing with the D-I simulation components and the methods of assessment are therefore arguably relevant and the Respondent shall disclose them.\n[39] The fact that the Respondent did not administer certain simulations to the Complainant\u2019s class does not automatically exclude them from being arguably relevant, nor does the Respondent\u2019s submission that the same simulations were applied to everyone in the Complainant\u2019s class. For example, paragraph 10 of the Complaint alleges that the Respondent failed \u201c[t]wo other older gentlemen\u201d in \u201cother classes\u201d because of a policy or practice of age discrimination, contrary to section 10 of the Act. Paragraph 34 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP alleges that \u201c[m]any of the other candidates from other classes who did not pass the POERT program were middle-aged like Mr. Itty.\u201d\n[40] Another allegation the Complainant seeks to prove is that during POERT, the Respondent treated him differently than the other candidates and received unclear feedback about why he did not pass three of the competencies. This suggests to him \u201c\u2026an unreasonable threshold is required in order to meet each of the competencies being assessed\u201d (Complaint, at para. 13).\n[41] The Complainant\u2019s SOP continues that theme, but names it differently, alleging in paragraph 27 that \u201c[t]hroughout the assessment process\u2026\u201d the Respondent \u201cheld\u201d the Complainant to \u201ca higher standard than that applied to other white young trainees\u201d who made serious mistakes but nevertheless passed. On its face, this last allegation deals with the entire assessment process, including those tests which the Respondent did not apply to the Complainant.\n[42] There is therefore a nexus between what the Complainant wishes to prove regarding systemic age discrimination and discrimination based on race and those pages in the Manual containing the D-I and D-II simulations which the Respondent did not administer to the Complainant\u2019s class.\n[43] For all of the above reasons, the Respondent shall disclose all the pages of the Manual hitherto undisclosed, in unredacted form, including those pages of the Manual in the Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion.\n[44] I wish to note that the Confidentiality Ruling (Itty v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 34) remains in full force and effect. The Manual is included as one of the documents covered by it, therefore the Confidentiality Ruling also applies to the portions of the Manual hereby ordered disclosed.\n[45] I also note that the fact that a document is ordered disclosed does not mean that it is admissible in evidence at a hearing. Admissibility at the hearing is a separate, new issue to be addressed and decided at the hearing, and for which the test is different than the test for disclosure.\nXI. Ruling [46] The Respondent shall disclose forthwith to the Complainant and the Commission all of the pages of the Manual which the Respondent has not disclosed as at the date of this Ruling, in unredacted form, including, without limitation, the Requested Pages: pages 20 to 87; 269 to 277; 123 to 129; 137 to 171; 280 to 282; 284 to 287; and 102 to 115.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJanuary 14, 2015\n",

Introduction \u2013 Motion For Abeyance\n[1] The Respondent, Citizenship & Immigration Canada (\u201cCIC\u201d), requests an adjournment of the current inquiry pending the issuance of a judgment from the Federal Court of Appeal (\u201cFCA\u201d) in a different matter. CIC believes that the judgment of the Court will partly dictate the result in the current inquiry.\nII. Background\nA. Current Inquiry under the CHRA\n[2] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant, Maiia Mykolayivna Zaafrane, on April 22, 2014, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). On February 5, 2015, the Commission, pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[3] The Complainant alleges that CIC discriminated against her, on the grounds of religion, by refusing her participation in a Canadian citizenship ceremony on December 4, 2013. As a result, Ms. Zaafrane has been unable to complete the requirements to become a Canadian citizen. Ms. Zaafrane was not allowed to participate in the ceremony because she refused to remove her niqab, a garment that covers her head and face with the exception of her eyes.\n[4] CIC has a policy that requires the removal of face coverings in order to take the oath of Canadian citizenship at a citizenship ceremony (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). Ms. Zaafrane claims that she wears her niqab in public as part of her religion, and as such, CIC has wrongly discriminated against her on the grounds of religion by applying the Policy to her and denying her participation in a citizenship ceremony while wearing a niqab.\nB. The Matter Pending Before the Federal Court of Appeal: Canada (A.G.) v. Ishaq\n[5] In a similar case, a woman from Pakistan named Zunera Ishaq applied for Canadian citizenship. Ms. Ishaq also wears a niqab and claims the wearing of it forms a part of her religious beliefs. Ms. Ishaq completed all of the requirements for obtaining Canadian citizenship, except for participating in the ceremony to take the oath of Canadian citizenship. Aware of the Policy, Ms. Ishaq filed an application for judicial review in Federal Court and moved for an order enjoining CIC from applying the Policy to her at her upcoming citizenship ceremony. (Ishaq v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 156.)\n[6] On February 6, 2015, Justice Boswell of the Federal Court allowed Ms. Ishaq\u2019s application.\n[7] The Respondent has appealed Justice Boswell\u2019s decision to the FCA. The appeal is expected to be heard on an expedited basis in September 2015.\n[8] In the CHRA inquiry before me, the Respondent has brought a motion seeking an adjournment of the inquiry while the Ishaq case is heard by the FCA. Ms. Zaafrane does not object to holding her complaint in abeyance while the Ishaq appeal is heard and decided. However, the Commission objects to the delay and has filed submissions requesting that the Tribunal not hold Ms. Zaafrane\u2019s complaint in abeyance pending the resolution of the Ishaq appeal.\n[9] For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s motion.\nIII. CIC\u2019s Submissions for Abeyance\n[10] CIC has submitted that the issue of whether or not the Policy is lawful and valid is at the core of Ms. Zaafrane\u2019s complaint and that therefore a resolution of this complaint partly rests on the upcoming ruling of the FCA. CIC also argues that compelling the parties to proceed with the complaint would be contrary to the principles of natural justice.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Does Resolution Rest on the FCA Outcome?\n[11] I am not convinced by CIC\u2019s argument that the FCA\u2019s findings in the Ishaq case on the legality of the Policy will necessarily resolve Ms. Zaafrane\u2019s complaint, in whole or in part. While the decision of the FCA may indeed have an influence on CIC\u2019s position regarding a possible settlement with Ms. Zaafrane, the issues before the Tribunal are potentially quite different.\n[12] In her application to the Federal Court, Ms. Ishaq sought the following relief:\na declaration that the Policy infringes paragraph 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part 1 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11 (the \u201cCharter\u201d);\na declaration that the Policy infringes section 15(1) of the Charter;\na declaration that the Policy is inconsistent with the governing legislation and is therefore beyond the powers of CIC;\na declaration that the policy unduly fetters the discretion of citizenship judges;\nan order enjoining CIC and any officials from CIC from refusing citizenship to her on the basis of the Policy; and\nher costs.\n[13] The Federal Court allowed Ms. Ishaq\u2019s application because to the extent the Policy interferes with a citizenship judge\u2019s duty to allow candidates for citizenship the greatest possible freedom in the religious solemnization or the solemn affirmation of the oath, it is unlawful. (Ishaq, supra, paragraph 68). The Federal Court did not decide on the Charter issues raised in Ms. Ishaq\u2019s application.\n[14] While the Charter arguments may have a role in the FCA decision, they also may not be considered. The appeal is likely to be based mainly on the legality of the Policy in light of its inconsistency with the Regulations to the Citizenship Act. The questions about\nwhether or not the Policy infringes the Charter are still live in the appeal and it is possible the FCA will have to deal with them (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v Ishaq, 2015 FCA 151, para. 4).\n[15] To the extent it focuses on non-Charter issues, the opinion of the FCA on the legality of the Policy will be of little relevance to the question of whether the Policy complies with the CHRA.\n[16] Ms. Zaafrane is asking for her allegations of discrimination to be considered under the CHRA, not the Citizenship Act or its Regulations. There is a different test that will be applied in determining whether or not discrimination on a prohibited ground occurred. Furthermore, Ms. Zaafrane and the Commission may be seeking substantively different remedies from those sought by Ms. Ishaq. For example, under the s. 53(2) of CHRA the Tribunal may order the payment of compensation to the victim of a discriminatory practice. For the above reasons, I believe that the outcome of Ms. Zaafrane\u2019s case is not necessarily dependent on the Ishaq appeal and therefore it should proceed independently.\nB. Principles of Natural Justice\n[17] CIC puts forth the argument that if this complaint proceeded before the outcome of the Ishaq case, it would be contrary to the principles of natural justice. CIC argues that it would be forced to pursue its case without having all the facts at hand. Furthermore, it argues that waiting for the FCA\u2019s decision in Ishaq is necessary to understand the exact nature of this dispute. CIC also suggests that the FCA\u2019s decision may have an impact on the relief the Tribunal may grant.\n[18] The Tribunal normally strives to proceed with inquiries as expeditiously as possible. Section 48.9(1) of the CHRA reads:\n\u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d\n[19] Compelling reasons are required to justify derogating from this general principle. Typically, in order to obtain an adjournment, a respondent \u201cmust establish that allowing the proceedings before the Tribunal to follow their normal course will result in a denial to the Respondent of natural justice.\u201d (Marshall v. Cerescorp Company 2011 CHRT 5.) In this case, it is incumbent on CIC to persuade the Tribunal that natural justice would be denied if there was no adjournment. I am not so persuaded.\n[20] In fairness to the parties, the Tribunal would naturally afford the parties the opportunity to make supplementary submissions on any supervisory court judgments rendered between the commencement of the case and the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s final decision if such court judgment touches a live issue before the Tribunal. Certainly in the case at hand, I will afford the parties ample opportunity to address the FCA decision in Ishaq if it is rendered before a final decision. Therefore, there is no risk of the Respondent not knowing \u201cthe case it has to meet\u201d or being denied \u201cthe right to be heard\u201d.\n[21] I do not agree that an adjournment is necessary to obtain clarity on the factual issues, and as noted above, the legal issues to be decided at the FCA may not be the same at all. Secondly, Ms. Zaafrane\u2019s remedies under the CHRA are her remedies and not necessarily systemic in nature. On balance, I do not feel the Respondent will be prejudiced with this case moving forward at this time.\n[22] Even if the FCA finds the Policy to be invalid and unlawful, this finding may still have little impact on the issues before the Tribunal. In any event, at this point, the matter is purely speculative.\n[23] The Respondent has cited previous Tribunal decisions where an abeyance was granted pending a judgment from the superior courts in a different matter: Bailie et al v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilot Association, 2012 CHRT 6; Renaud, Sutton and Morgeau v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 30. In my view, the case at hand is distinguishable because the Tribunal is not being asked to await the outcome of another Tribunal decision or a superior court\u2019s consideration of a Tribunal decision. The adjournments in the cases cited were granted based on virtually identical issues being squarely placed before the FC or FCA in pending proceedings. In those cases, it was clear that highly relevant judicial direction would be forthcoming (see Bailie, para. 26; Renaud, paras. 16-17; see also Canadian Jewish Congress v. Henry Makow, 2010 CHRT 13, para. 8; League for Human Rights of B'nai Brith, Abrams v. Topham, Arthur, 2010 CHRT 14, para. 9). It is far from certain that the s. 15 Charter issue in Ishaq will be decided by the FCA. There are other live issues before the Court, at least one of which is a non-constitutional issue. See Ishaq Federal Court judgment, 2015 FC 156, paras. 66-67.\nV. Ruling\n[24] For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s request and the complaint will proceed as per the Tribunal\u2019s normal pre-hearing case management process.\nSigned by\nDavid L. Thomas\nTribunal Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 1, 2015\n",

Background\n[1] This is a decision regarding a complaint dated October 30, 2011 by Munglegeet \u201cPenny\u201d Kaur Siddoo, as Complainant (referred to herein at her request as \u201cMiss Siddoo\u201d), against International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502 (the \u201cILWU\u201d), as Respondent, alleging the union discriminated against her on the basis of her race, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, marital status and disability.\n[2] In her complaint, Miss Siddoo alleges harassment, differential treatment, physical assault, intimidation and death threats by the ILWU. At the hearing, Miss Siddoo also made allegations of mobbing, gang stalking, psychological terrorism and overt harassment.\n[3] On July 2, 2013, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[4] Miss Siddoo appeared and gave evidence at the hearing. She was self-represented. Miss Siddoo advised the Tribunal that she was presenting evidence about only two incidents that occurred during training in 2010. Although reference was made to events at earlier times, they were significantly separated in time from the two training sessions and not the focus of the present complaint.\n[5] The ILWU was represented by counsel, Mr. Bruce Laughton, Q.C. and one representative from the ILWU, Mr. Chris Verbeek, appeared as a witness. The Commission did not appear at the hearing.\nII. Decision\n[6] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that the complaint has not been substantiated and is therefore dismissed.\nIII. Facts\n[7] For the most part, the facts in this case are not in dispute. However, the parties have a very different perception about the events giving rise to this complaint.\n[8] Miss Siddoo self-identifies herself as a single, Indo-Canadian female with a disability. In December of 2004, she was issued an identity card by the British Columbia Maritime Employers\u2019 Association (\u201cBCMEA\u201d) which allowed her to apply for casual work through the ILWU.\n[9] The BCMEA is a multi-employer association pursuant to the Canada Labour Code that represents approximately 65 ship owners and agents, stevedores, container and terminal operators on Canada\u2019s West Coast. The BCMEA represents the employers with respect to their labour and employee relations. The ILWU is the bargaining agent for longshore workers working out of the New Westminster, B.C. dispatch hall (the \u201cHall\u201d). The Hall is owned and operated by the ILWU and the BCMEA pays the ILWU a portion of the operating expenses of the Hall. Work assignments and decisions as to who will be placed into training sessions are governed by the collective agreement between the BCMEA and the ILWU. Miss Siddoo was a casual worker under the collective agreement and was represented by the ILWU in all labour relations matters. Longshore workers, such as Miss Siddoo, are only employed by employer members of the BCMEA on a daily shift basis after being dispatched by the ILWU from the Hall.\n[10] Miss Siddoo began working out of the Hall as a labourer and in June of 2005, after receiving training, she sometimes worked as a Multi-Tractor Driver. According to Miss Siddoo, in 2006 she logged approximately 1,100 hours of employment through the Hall.\n[11] On her way to work on or about January 10, 2007, Miss Siddoo became involved in a car accident. There was a heavy snowfall in Vancouver on that day, and Miss Siddoo\u2019s car slid off the road on two separate occasions on her way to work. After the final collision with a pole, Miss Siddoo abandoned her vehicle, and upon advice from the Hall, caught a taxi for the remainder of her journey to work. Upon arrival at work, Miss Siddo attended the first aid office, and then for some time that day she drove a stacker loading vehicle. Due to her injuries sustained in the car accident, Miss Siddoo did not work again for a long time after that date. According to her testimony, Miss Siddoo attempted to work again for one or two days per week starting in November or December of 2007 until February of 2008. However, her lower back pain prevented her from driving the Multi-Tractor for any length of time and her doctor advised her against continuing to work.\n[12] In early 2010, Miss Siddoo worked as a volunteer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. It went well for her physically and she decided she felt well enough to contemplate a return to work through the ILWU. She contacted the ILWU by email on May 31, 2010 and discussed various options with Mr. Verbeek for a return to work suitable to her needs. Mr. Verbeek suggested training at the Delta Port so that Miss Siddoo could avoid demanding physical labour jobs. Miss Siddoo requested some upgrade training on the Multi-Tractor, one or two days she suggested, so that she could see how it impacted her physical injuries. About a week later, Mr. Verbeek scheduled Miss Siddoo for two days of upgrade training on the Multi-Tractor.\n[13] After two days of upgrade training, Miss Siddoo found she could not endure the jarring motion of the vehicle and the impact it was having on her spine and hip. After seeing her doctor, Miss Siddoo wrote to Mr. Verbeek on June 14, 2010 and suggested training in a different job with less physical impact.\n[14] Shortly thereafter, Miss Siddoo was set down for training as a \u201cChecker\u201d at the job site of Terminal Systems Inc. (\u201cTSI\u201d), one of the employers through the BCMEA. Miss Siddoo\u2019s training began on or about July 5, 2010. There were two trainers and Miss Siddoo was one of four employees brought in for the training. It was thought that the position of Checker was less physically demanding and therefore possibly more suitable to accommodate Miss Siddoo\u2019s needs. After completing the training, Miss Siddoo would be eligible in the future for assignments by the ILWU to work as a Checker.\n[15] On the third day of her Checker training, the two trainers concluded that Miss Siddoo\u2019s experience was far less than the other three trainees. They decided it would be better to replace Miss Siddoo with a more experienced trainee so the group would not be held back. Miss Siddoo was told that she would be rescheduled for the Checker training with a group more at her level of experience. She was rescheduled and did restart the training two months later.\n[16] However, at the time she was taken out of the Checker training on July 7, 2010, Miss Siddoo was quite upset. That evening she wrote an email to Mr. Verbeek and several others alleging the action was discriminatory and that she had been subjected to harassment. In response, Mr. Verbeek spoke to both of the trainers and then wrote an email to Miss Siddoo the following day explaining the trainer\u2019s reasons. He concurred with their decision to put Miss Siddoo into a different training group with others more at her level. His email went on to explain:\nThis brings me to the accusations in your letter. Penny, one of the trainers is East-Indian. Two of the other trainees and your replacement are women. Yet you still claim in your letter that \u201csomeone told them (the trainers) to let you go\u201d. You ask whether you are being targeted because you are a woman.\n[17] Mr. Verbeek went on to indicate that he felt the accusations were ludicrous, and that in fact, he felt as though he was being harassed by Miss Siddoo. The following day, Miss Siddoo sent Mr. Verbeek an email in which she referred to him as a \u201cliar\u201d and demanded retraining at a different location. Notwithstanding the acrimony displayed by Miss Siddoo towards Mr. Verbeek, he did arrange for her to be admitted into the next Checker training group starting on September 13, 2010.\n[18] A week before she began her new Checker training, Miss Siddoo sent off an email to 10 different ILWU officials, including their top executives and Mr. Verbeek. The original purpose of the email seemed to be an inquiry for the recovery of transportation costs for disabled employees. However, the email was quite lengthy and went on to criticize the union about the termination of her training in July 2010 and made general accusations of abuse of power, poor judgment and discrimination by the union.\n[19] Nevertheless, Miss Siddoo recommenced her Checker training on September 13, 2010 and it was supposed to continue on for a period of about eight weeks. Around the beginning of November 2010, Miss Siddoo was suspended from her training. According to the ILWU, Miss Siddoo had missed work on October 22, 2010 without explanation, and left her station early on another occassion. There also appeared to be some allegations that the employer, TSI, had concerns with Miss Siddoo\u2019s conduct.\n[20] As a result, Miss Siddoo\u2019s training was suspended and she was requested to attend the union\u2019s Grievance and Credentials Meeting on November 9, 2010 for an examination of the allegations. Miss Siddoo did not show up to the union meeting. Her testimony was that she never received notice. The ILWU\u2019s evidence was that notice was delivered to Miss Siddoo\u2019s \u201cplate\u201d at the Hall, which was their normal practice for the delivery of communications to employees.\n[21] After missing the meeting on November 9, 2010, Miss Siddoo was telephoned for an explanation. She responded with an email to the President of the ILWU advising that she had filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and that she was contemplating a complaint to the police. She asked the union President if they were going to \u201cput another hit out on me?\u201d In her oral testimony, Miss Siddoo mentioned several times that she believed someone at the ILWU had arranged a contract to kill her.\n[22] Mr. Verbeek responded to the email later that day and outlined the allegations of absenteeism and that TSI had some issues with Miss Siddoo\u2019s conduct. He said it was appropriate for them to continue the suspension of her training until the next Grievance and Credentials Meeting on January 4, 2011, at which time she could present her side of the story. In the meantime, she was welcome to come down to the Hall and apply for casual labour jobs if she wanted.\n[23] Miss Siddoo presented into evidence an email from Mr. Chris Fletcher, a training field supervisor of BCMEA, dated November 10, 2010. The email is addressed to four of Mr. Fletcher\u2019s BCMEA colleagues and details a conversation Mr. Fletcher had just had with Mr. Verbeek concerning Miss Siddoo. Mr. Fletcher states that he told Mr. Verbeek that neither the employer (TSI) nor the trainers had ever made him aware of any behavioural or discipline issues concerning Miss Siddoo. Mr. Fletcher states that he told Mr. Verbeek that Miss Siddoo will start the Checker training again as early as November 15, 2010. The email concludes with a report that Mr. Verbeek was not in full agreement and was going to speak with someone else about Miss Siddoo restarting her training.\n[24] Mr. Fletcher was not called as a witness so not much weight can be attributed to his email submitted in evidence. In any event, it was not explored at the hearing why the ILWU did not accept Mr. Fletcher\u2019s apparent request that Miss Siddoo be called back in to complete her training.\n[25] Miss Siddoo attended the January 4, 2011 Grievance and Credentials Meeting. She provided an explanation for her missed work, including a letter from her physiotherapist explaining the October 22, 2010 absence, which the union accepted. Miss Siddoo also presented a note from her doctor stating: \u201cAs of January 4, 2011, Penny is physically capable to return to checker training.\u201d The note was accepted by the ILWU, but before returning her to training, the union requested that her doctor complete a more comprehensive form called a Physical Demands Analysis Summary Table. The form, provided by the BCMEA, was specific to the Job Title \u201cHead Checker\u201d and listed the various job demands of that position.\n[26] Miss Siddoo\u2019s doctor completed the form on February 1, 2011. However, his response indicated that Miss Siddoo was unable to perform the standing and walking job demands. He also recommended that she start back to work gradually, at 4 hours per day.\n[27] According to her email to the union President on February 1, 2011, Miss Siddoo had dropped off the BCMEA doctor\u2019s form at the Hall in person that day. Before a response was received, Miss Siddoo wrote another email to the union the following day advising them that she was filing this complaint. Miss Siddoo did not pursue completion of the Checker training and did not apply for any more work through the Hall. She stated she was fed up and instead decided to pursue her human rights complaint. The ILWU did not make any further attempts to engage Miss Siddoo.\nIV. Analysis\nA. Requirement to establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n[28] In human rights cases, a complainant has the burden of proof to establish a prima facie case. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28). To demonstrate prima facie discrimination in the context of the CHRA, complainants are required to show: (1) that they have a characteristic or characteristics protected from discrimination under the CHRA; (2) that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to a situation covered by sections 5 to 14.1 of the CHRA; and, (3) that the protected characteristic or characteristics were a factor in the adverse impact (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, at para. 33). The three elements of discrimination must be proven on a balance of probabilities (see Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39, at paras. 55-69).\n[29] The Tribunal has recognized the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) [Basi]: \u201cdiscrimination is not a practise which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised.\u201d Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination.\u201d\nB. The prohibited grounds of discrimination alleged to be at issue\n[30] The first question for the Tribunal to decide is what prohibited grounds are alleged to be at issue in Miss Siddoo\u2019s allegations. Her initial complaint raised the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex, marital status and disability. Under cross-examination, and given the focus of her complaint was on the two training sessions in 2010, she stated she believed she was taken out of the first Checker training session because she is a woman, East Indian and disabled. With regard to her suspension from the second Checker training session, Miss Siddoo testified that it was based on her disability.\n[31] The grounds of religion and marital status arise in the context of Miss Siddoo\u2019s allegations of harassment. She claims comments based on these grounds were made towards her or in her presence.\nC. Alleged adverse impact based on prohibited grounds of discrimination\n[32] The next questions are: did Miss Siddoo experience an adverse impact with respect to a situation covered by sections 5 to 14.1 of the CHRA; and, were the prohibited grounds at issue a factor in that adverse impact? Miss Siddoo\u2019s submissions before the Tribunal focussed on sections 7, 10 and 14 of the CHRA. Her initial complaint also referenced section 9. I will deal with Miss Siddoo\u2019s allegations under sections 7, 9 and 10 together, while providing a separate anaylsis for her allegations under section 14.\n(i) Section 7, 9 and 10 allegations\n[33] Generally, sections 7, 9 and 10 of the CHRA deal with discrimination in the context of employment. Section 9(c) specifically prohibits employee organizations from acting in any way that would limit or deprive an individual of employment opportunities. Miss Siddoo was deprived employment opportunities by being removed from Checker training twice, in July 2010 and November 2010. She did not return to Checker training or to the Hall after November 2010, despite fulfilling the ILWU\u2019s request to submit a medical form from her doctor. Therefore, I am satisfied she suffered an adverse impact pursuant to section 9(c) of the CHRA.\n[34] That said, at no time was Miss Siddoo able to establish that her race, national or ethnic origin, sex, and\/or disability played a factor in her being removed from Checker training in either incidence in 2010. She submitted various emails between her and representatives of the ILWU into evidence, along with copies of Facebook email conversations with colleagues. While Respondent counsel justifiably expressed concern about the Facebook email conversations, given the individuals involved in the conversations were not called as witnesses and were not cross-examined on their statements, this evidence is admissible under section 50(3)(c) of the CHRA and I thought it might assist Miss Siddoo in the outline and presentation of her case. However, most of it pre-dated the 2010 incidents and there was nothing in the Facebook material relating to discrimination at the workplace. Even if this material was probative, I would not afford it much weight under the circumstances.\n[35] While the emails and Facebook conversations suggest there may have been some animosity towards Miss Siddoo from Mr. Verbeek and other colleagues, there is no indication therein that any animosity that may have existed is based upon a prohibited ground.\n[36] With regard to the first instance of removing Miss Siddoo from training, Mr. Verbeek provided the following detailed response by email on July 8, 2010:\nI have spoken to [D.K.] and [D.G.]. Both trainers agreed that the other three candidates, [G.C.], [R.H.], and [A.O.] had far more experience than you. They both agreed that it would be unfair to both you and the other three trainees to train to your level of experience. [G] has Dock Gantry, RTG, Reachstacker and 17 years on the waterfront. Both [R] and [A] are fully rated checkers at Fraser Surrey Dock. They already know all the procedures just not the computer system. [D] has told me that you have not failed, you will be put in the next group of trainees.\n[37] Miss Siddoo argued that her knowledge of that port facility made her equally or more expereinced than the other trainees, but I was not convinced that was so. In the end, Miss Siddoo did not provide sufficient evidence to refute Mr. Verbeek\u2019s explanation or indicate how a prohibited ground was a factor in her treatment.\n[38] With regard to the suspension in November 2010, there is some indication in the emails presented by Miss Siddoo that her suspension from training in November 2010 may have been procedurally unfair because BCMEA was not consulted. However, even if the suspension was an act of acrimony on the part of Mr. Verbeek, there is nothing to indicate that a prohibited ground played a factor in the action.\n[39] It is not sufficient that Miss Siddoo is a woman, East Indian, or someone who has a disability, for this Tribunal to automatically make a finding of discrimination. Nor is it enough that Miss Siddoo was treated adversely or in a differential manner. As outlined above, it is incumbent upon complainants to show that a prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in any adverse treatment they suffered. Despite the numerous and forceful allegations of discrimination, Miss Siddoo was unable to do so. She did not discharge her burden and even in my probing for more details, I did not catch a whiff of the subtle scent of discrimination. Therefore, Miss Siddoo has not established a prima facie case of discrimination under sections 7, 9 or 10 of the CHRA.\n[40] In any event, I accept that the reasons advanced by the ILWU for why Miss Siddoo was removed from both training sessions were not discriminatory. The evidence suggests the ILWU was working with Miss Siddoo to find her work suitable to her needs. In the first part of 2010, Miss Siddoo requested special upgrade training to see if she was able to drive a Multi-Tractor again. That special training was arranged within 5 days of the request. When it became apparent that Miss Siddoo was unable to operate the Multi-Tractor for long periods due to her injuries, Mr. Verbeek arranged for Miss Siddoo to be enrolled in the Checker training as an alternative. Miss Siddoo was removed from the training session in July 2010 because of her experience level. She was removed from training in November 2010 because of concerns over absenteeism and conduct. The merits of this last action are not for the Tribunal to decide. There was simply insufficient evidence to establish that discrimination played a factor in the actions.\n[41] Finally, Miss Siddoo claims the ILWU failed in its duty to accommodate her disaiblity because she has not been reinstated into Checker training after submitting the additional medical information requested by the ILWU. At the hearing, Respondent counsel made submissions suggesting it was not the duty of the ILWU, but rather the duty of BCMEA and TSI to provide accommodation. In this case, there is no need to determine if that is correct. While it is unclear what, if any, steps the ILWU took to accommodate Miss Siddoo following the submission of her additional medical information, the onus remains on the Complainant to establish that the union\u2019s actions or inaction in this regard were somehow influenced by a prohibited ground. Again, Miss Siddoo has been unable to establish this to be the case.\n[42] I also note that after her email of February 2, 2010 declaring her intention to file this complaint, Miss Siddoo did not attempt to work with the ILWU to find a reasonable accommodation. There is a duty incumbent on persons requesting accommodation to take steps to facilitate the search for an accommodation (see Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 SCR 970, at p. 944 [Renaud]). In the present case, Miss Siddoo provided the additional medical report form as requested by the ILWU. However, the next day, and before the union could respond, she then walked away from the accommodation process to pursue this complaint.\n[43] As a result, the Tribunal dimisses the complaints of discrimination under sections 7, 9 and 10 of the CHRA.\n(ii) Section 14 allegations\n[44] Section 14 of the CHRA prohibits harassment in matters related to employment. Miss Siddoo made several accusations of harrassment against members of the ILWU and used the term frequently throughout the hearing. However, harrassment is not easy to define.\n[45] Every act by which a person causes some form of anxiety to another could be labelled as harassment. What offends one person may not offend the next person at all. Furthermore, none amongst us are perfect, and we are all capable of being, on occasion, somewhat thoughtless, insensitive and perhaps even outright stupid. Does this mean that there can never be any safe interactions between people? The question is not so much whether one is offended or feeling humiliated, but by what objective measure can we define harassment, so that people everywhere know exactly how to conduct themselves to avoid it.\n[46] I do not think that every act of foolishness or insensitivity in the workplace was intended to be captured under section 14 of the CHRA. Harassment is a serious word, to be used seriously and applied vigorously when the occasion warrants its use. To do otherwise would be to trivialize it. It should not be cheapened or devalued in its meaning by using it to loosely label petty acts or foolish words where the harm, by any objective standard, is fleeting.\n[47] The Tribunal has attempted to define harassment as any words or conduct that is unwelcome or ought to be known to be unwelcome, based on a prohibited ground of discrimination, and evaluated on a case-by-case basis from the standard of the reasonable person in the circumstances. It usually denotes repetitious or persistent acts, although a single serious event can be sufficient to constitute harassment (see Janzen v. Platy enterprises ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 1252; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1999] 3 FC 653). In the employment context, the key is to examine whether the conduct has violated the dignity of the employee such that it has created a hostile or poisoned work environment (see Day v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 43, at para. 184; and, Croteau v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2014 CHRT 16, at para. 43).\n[48] With regard to being removed from the training sessions in 2010, Miss Siddoo claims the ILWU and, specifically Mr. Verbeek, were trying to humiliate her by knowingly putting her in a training session in July 2010 with people who had superior longshore work experience. She also alleges the union harassed her by requiring her to complete the medical form before returning to training. However, Miss Siddoo failed to establish that Mr. Verbeek was trying to humilate her and, more importantly, how a prohibited ground was a factor in either alleged incident.\n[49] Miss Siddoo also mentions that she was once called a \u201cspinster\u201d by another member of the union. Further, she claims a trainer made a comment regarding people who wear turbans. Even if these allegations were proven to be true, I would not find that they were repetitive or sufficently severe to constitute the type of harrassment proscribed by the CHRA.\n[50] Miss Siddoo also spoke about an argument in 2005 when Mr. Verbeek told her, \u201cFuck off, Penny Siddoo.\u201d Mr. Verbeek readily admitted to the statement under cross-examination and explained the context in which the remark was made. The comment by Mr. Verbeek was made only one time and therefore was not persistent or pervasive, nor do I find that it was singularly sufficient to have poisoned the work environment and therefore merit a finding of harassment under section 14 of the CHRA. Furthermore, with specific regard to Mr. Verbeek\u2019s comment, there is no evidence to support that the alleged harassment was based on a prohibited ground of discrimination under the CHRA.\n[51] Finally, Miss Siddoo claims to have been continuously harassed by members of the ILWU, including allegations of mobbing, gang stalking, psychological terrorism and death threats. There was insufficient evidence submitted to support these allegations, let alone that a prohibited ground factored into any of these alleged incidents.\n[52] Therefore, the Tribunal also dismisses Miss Siddoo\u2019s allegations of harassment as she has not been able to establish a prima facie case pursuant to section 14 of the CHRA.\nV. Additional Comments\n[53] Miss Siddoo appears prone to making improbable conclusions about events taking place around her. She also seems convinced that parties are sometimes colluding against her. Miss Siddoo was convinced that people in her workplace had colluded to make her perform poorly during training, and that answers to a written examination had been altered to ensure her failure.\n[54] The Complainant, while perhaps honestly believing representatives and members of the ILWU were \u201cout to get her\u201d, and perhaps experiencing distress and anxiety as a result, overreacted to events on several occasions. This lead to her souring her relationship with some representatives and members of the ILWU, which may indeed have resulted in some acrimony in the workplace. However, I do not believe discrimination played a factor.\n[55] It is unfortunate that the Commission failed to participate in this hearing. If it saw evidence of discrimination in its investigation, it would have been helpful for the Commission to present it before the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nDavid Thomas\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 15, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1952\/3213\nStyle of Cause:\nMunglegeet Kaur Siddoo v.

Ulyatt\n[1] The Respondent has brought a motion to:\na) Summarily dismiss the Complaint because it has disclosed no genuine issue requiring a trial or hearing pursuant to the general authority granted under Rule 3(2)(d);\nb) Alternatively, the Respondent submits:\nFirst, that the Tribunal admits into evidence in this proceeding all of the evidence adduced before the Tribunal in Cruden, including the transcripts of the evidence from the Cruden hearing, to avoid having to call the same witnesses to provide the same evidence a second time.\nSecond, that the Tribunal order Mr. Wheatcroft to identify the specific argument he intends to advance that was not decided in Cruden and the Evidence that he intends to rely on.\nThird, that the Tribunal narrow the scope of Mr. Wheatcroft\u2019s hearing to address the novel issue(s) raised by Mr. Wheatcroft and not matters already decided in Cruden.\n[2] The Respondent brings this Motion without the support of any evidence. The Respondent has chosen to rely on the complaint and the particulars from the Tribunal inquiry in the case of Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency and Health Canada T1466\/1210 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCruden\u201d), Tribunal decisions in the Cruden case bearing neutral citations 2010 CHRT 32 (motion to consolidate Cruden with Wheatcroft) and 2011 CHRT 13 (decision on liability), the Federal Court\u2019s judgment setting aside the decision on liability, Canada (A.G.) v. Cruden 2013 FC 520, and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, dismissing the appeal, 2014 FCA 131.\n[3] It is submitted by the Respondent that the Cruden case and the one at hand have similarities, as they both dealt with the same alleged discriminatory practice by CIDA, whereby both individuals had applied for a posting to Afghanistan as part of CIDA\u2019s 2008 Field Posting Exam. Initially the Respondent sought to consolidate the present complaint with the Cruden complaint. Member Marchildon declined to consolidate the complaints (see 2010 CHRT 32). Thus, the Cruden matter proceeded before the Tribunal, the Federal Court, and ultimately the Federal Court of Appeal.\n[4] The Tribunal in the Cruden matter, upon hearing substantial evidence, concluded that it would constitute undue hardship to require CIDA to post Ms. Cruden to Afghanistan on account of her medical condition, being a Type 1 Diabetic, and went on at great length to outline Ms. Cruden\u2019s health conditions, proposed working conditions, and the limitations on medication delivery services to individuals in Afghanistan.\n[5] The Respondent argues that the Tribunal, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have dealt with the fact that no Type 1 Diabetic ought to be posted to a war zone, and further argues that there is \u201c\u2026no genuine issue to be determined by this Tribunal regardless of whether the Complainant can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, there was a bona fide occupation requirement to not post individuals with Type 1 Diabetes to Afghanistan because of risks inherent of the condition\u201d.\n[6] The Respondent, in support of their position for summary judgment, relies on Hryniak v. Mauldin 2014 SCC 7, in which the Court stated, at para. 5:\n\u201c\u2026summary judgment rules must be interpreted broadly, favouring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely and just adjudication of claims.\u201d\n[7] The Complainant takes issue with the position of the Respondent.\n[8] The Complainant in his Brief, reviewed extensively his involvement with CIDA at different locations throughout the world, in different positions and the differences vis-\u00e0-vis himself and Ms. Cruden on health issues. The Complainant submits that the Respondent has misread the Cruden case and has ignored principles fundamental to human rights law and procedural fairness.\n[9] The Complainant went at length to distinguish the circumstances of the present complaint from those of the Cruden matter. The Complainant essentially submitted that in order to make out a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) that would justify a prima facie discriminatory workplace standard, the Respondent must establish:\na) that it adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\nb) that it did so in an honest and good faith belief and that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose;\nc) that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose such that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship on the employer.\nThese are the elements of the BFOR test that the Supreme Court of Canada formulated in British Colombia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d), at para. 54.\n[10] In para. 62 of the Meirion decision, the Court elaborated upon the third element by holding that:\n\u201cthe standard\u2026must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship.\u201d [emphasis added]\n[11] At paragraph 27 of his written submissions, the Complainant argued that the Supreme Court found that a blanket ban could only be justified in one of two ways:\n\u201c1. \u2018No person with [the] condition could ever [be accommodated in the task] without creating an unacceptable level of risk\u2019; and\n2. Alternatively, the Respondent, it was argued, must prove that \u2018testing for exceptional individuals who can [be accommodated in the task] safely despite their disability is impossible short of undue hardship\u2019\u201d.\n[12] The foregoing submissions, all stress the point that one must examine the requirements of an individual, rather than applicants in general.\n[13] The Commission, in objecting to the Motion for Summary Judgment, argues that:\na. Mr. Wheatcroft\u2019s condition is not the same as Ms. Cruden\u2019s, and the decision in Ms. Cruden\u2019s case was based upon a unique set of circumstances.\nb. The decision in Cruden was based on factual findings which would be unfair to extrapolate to Mr. Wheatcroft.\nc. The Respondent\u2019s Motion would be inconsistent with Tribunal Case Law.\nd. The present motion for summary judgment is unique and the Respondent has not followed what would be a normal procedure which would include evidence that there is no genuine issue for trial.\nI. Analysis\n[14] The Canadian Human Rights Act at s. 50(1) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) states that \u201cthe member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations\u201d, and the CHRT Rules were enacted to ensure that \u201call parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard.\u201d (Rule 1(1)(a))\n[15] The Respondent argues that the case at hand can be dealt with summarily and expeditiously.\n[16] This is an unusual motion in that there is no evidence before the Tribunal. The Respondent, the moving party, has not filed any evidence and basically relies upon the decisions rendered in the Cruden matter, at the various levels. The Respondent submits that the findings in Cruden and the particulars in the matter at hand are so similar, that even if the Complainant established a prima facie case, there would be no genuine issue for trial.\n[17] The essence of the Respondent\u2019s argument appears to be that\u2014even if a prima facie case can be made out\u2014there is no genuine issue to be determined, as the prohibition on posting individuals with type 1 diabetes to Afghanistan has been found to be a BFOR. The Tribunal has reviewed all of the aforementioned Cruden decisions and judgments and would point out the following:\n[18] The Federal Court judgment contains the following observations and conclusions at paragraphs 80-82:\n\u201c[80] This is not to say that there may not be a situation in the future where the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines would result in an employee being prevented from a posting in Afghanistan even though that employee\u2019s disability could be accommodated without undue hardship, but this is not that case. Moreover, the Tribunal did not even identify any potential situation where an employee may be disentitled to a posting to Afghanistan by the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines but could still be accommodated in such a posting short of undue hardship to his or her employer. Unless one concrete example or at least general possibility is identified, it is baseless to assert, in the broadest sense, that the guidelines \u201cdifferentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\u201d which is the requirement in paragraph 7(b) of the CHRA, or \u201c[deprive] or [tend] to deprive an individual or class of individuals,\u201d which is the requirement in paragraph 10(a)\u201d [underlined emphasis mine]\n\u201c[81] HC acknowledged at the hearing before the Tribunal that the \u201cabsolute medical requirements\u201d heading of the Afghanistan Guidelines was unfortunate as it did not capture the intention that it was a \u201cguideline\u201d and the Court was given to understand at the hearing of this application that it was under revision to reflect that fact. Any issue of compliance of the revised guideline with the CHRA will be addressed in the context of a specific fact situation that may arise in the future, i.e. where an employee claims they could be accommodated in an Afghanistan posting but is denied that opportunity through the application of the revised guideline.\u201d\n\u201c[82] In summary, absent a finding of a discriminatory practice, Ms. Cruden\u2019s complaint had to be dismissed. It may be, as the Tribunal found, that the wording of the Afghanistan Guidelines requires revision; however, absent a finding of a discriminatory practice in the result achieved when the guidelines are applied to Ms. Cruden or some other reasonably identifiable future individual or class of individuals, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to order the remedies it did. The application of the Afghanistan Guidelines did not discriminate against Ms. Cruden as she could not be accommodated in a posting to Afghanistan without undue hardship, there was no discriminatory practice as a result, and the complaint ought to have been dismissed.\u201d\n[19] Earlier, at paragraph 65 the Court stated:\n\u201c\u2026The Tribunal found that if it was not for its refusal to post Ms. Cruden to Afghanistan, CIDA would have experienced undue hardship because there were myriad pitfalls in posting a Type 1 diabetic with her profile and medical needs into a war zone.\u201d\n[20] Upon review of the Federal Court\u2019s decision, the Federal Court of Appeal at paragraph 29 stated:\n\u201c[29] The Federal Court Judge noted in paragraph 81 of his decision, there may be another situation where the application of the Afghanistan Guidelines could result in a particular employee being denied a posting in Afghanistan even though the needs of such person could be accommodated without imposing an undue hardship on the employer. However, this is not the case in this matter and the Tribunal did not identify any such particular situation. The Federal Court Judge also noted that Health Canada was planning to revise the Afghanistan Guidelines.\u201d\n[21] In reviewing the foregoing, both the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal clearly indicate the possibility of other complaints based on the Afghanistan Guidelines. The Courts do not appear to take issue with the Tribunal finding in Cruden that Ms. Cruden had established a prima facie case; rather, the only matter the Courts took issue with was the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a separate procedural duty to accommodate could subsist where an employer had established that it satisfied all three parts of the Meiorin BFOR test.\n[22] The Cruden case recognizes that each claim has to be assessed on an individual basis, and the result in Cruden does not automatically prevent another Complainant with Type 1 Diabetes from coming forth with a Complaint about matters that may be similar to the Cruden matter\n[23] In order for Summary Judgment to succeed, it would require the Tribunal to dismiss the Complaint for not disclosing a discriminatory practice or if this was in a civil matter, for not disclosing a cause of action, which would be akin to a civil procedure. However, the present matter is not a civil matter but one that is governed by the Act.\n[24] The Federal Court in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General) 2012 FC 445 (sub. nom. FNCFCS v. Canada) discussed in detail (at paragraphs 125 \u2013 157) the authority of the Tribunal to consider motions to dismiss in advance of a full hearing on the merits. The Court found that the power to dismiss should be exercised cautiously and would only be in the clearest of cases (see paragraph 140).\n[25] The Court in FNCFCS v. Canada found that the Tribunal has flexibility and may choose to deal with matters in advance, and stated as follows:\n[148] The examples referred to above are not intended to provide an exhaustive list of all of the circumstances where the Tribunal might choose to deal with issues in advance of a full hearing on the merits of a complaint. In every case, the Tribunal will have to consider the facts and issues raised by the complaint before it, and will have to identify the appropriate procedure to be followed so as to secure as informal and expeditious a hearing process as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[149] However, the process adopted by the Tribunal will have to be fair, and will always have to afford each of the parties \u201ca full and ample opportunity to appear[,]\u2026present evidence and make representations\u201d in relation to the matter in dispute.\n[emphasis added]\nThe Respondent has not established that the Complainant\u2019s allegations, even if taken as proven, would fail to make out a discriminatory practice. Mr. Wheatcroft should be given the opportunity to present his case in an attempt to establish that there is a prima facie case of discrimination. It would be at that juncture that the Respondent could argue that the Complainant has not established a prima facie case and could move for a non-suit and dismissal of the complaint. The jurisdiction and the law governing non-suits is canvassed in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785. However, after hearing evidence, if Mr. Wheatcroft has established a prima facie case, it is then incumbent upon the Respondent to establish a BFOR. At present, the Respondent\u2019s Motion is lacking any evidence, which is the Respondent\u2019s choice, but this choice cannot deprive the Complainant of the benefit of s. 50(1) of the Act.\n[26] It would only be in the clearest of cases that a complaint would be dismissed in advance of a full hearing on the merits. Expediency, invoked by the Respondent, cannot prevail over procedural fairness, natural justice, and s. 50(1). At present, there is no evidence before the Tribunal and the arguments based on the Cruden decisions have not satisfied me that this matter should not proceed.\n[27] The Respondent asks in the alternative that at the hearing, he be granted permission to rely on the Transcripts of Evidence provided by his witnesses in the Cruden matter. The Respondent seeks to file the Transcripts of the oral evidence of the following individuals:\n- Bob Johnston, former Director General of the Afghanistan Taskforce at CIDA;\n- Michael Collins, former Director of Corporate Services, Afghanistan Taskforce, CIDA;\n- Marion Parry, former Manager, Corporate Mobility at CIDA;\n- Colonel Jacques Ricard, former Chief of Land Staff, Medical Advisor, Department of National Defence;\n- Major Robin Thurlow, formerly of the Directorate of Health Services Operations, Department of National Defence;\n- Dr. Eva Callary, former Medical Officer-in-Charge, Occupational Health Clinic, Health Canada;\n- Dr. Peggy Baxter, Doctor, Occupational Health Clinic, Health Canada;\n- Dr. John Dupr\u00e9, Endocrinologist, Respondent\u2019s Expert;\nThis request is made without prejudice to the Respondent\u2019s right to call witnesses to address the specifics of this case. Also, in the Overview portion of the Respondent\u2019s motion materials, the Respondent asks for the Complainant to identify the specific arguments the Complainant intends to rely on which were not decided in Cruden. Finally, the Respondent asks that the Tribunal narrrow the scope of Mr. Wheatcroft\u2019s hearing such that it will only address novel issues raised by Mr. Wheatcroft, and will not address matters already decided in Cruden.\n[28] The Respondent relies on a decision of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario in CAW \u2013 Canada v Presteve Foods Ltd. 2013 HRTO 20 (hereinafter \u201cCAW\u201d) where the adjudicator ordered that a transcript from criminal proceedings be accepted as sworn testimony and be available for all parties to rely upon at the hearing. The Tribunal recognized the need to hear oral evidence on the specific allegations upon which it was being asked to make findings of credibility. The Tribunal then observed, at para. 104, that:\n\u201c\u2026there were other matters addressed in the transcript from the preliminary inquiry, both in examination-in-chief and on cross-examination, where it seemed that there may be little utility in going over orally at the hearing before this Tribunal what is already set out in full in the transcript from the preliminary inquiry in the criminal proceeding.\u201d\n[29] The Complainant, in principle, does not object to the introduction of transcripts of the evidence of the witnesses in the Cruden matter as it relates to the evidence in chief. The Complainant asks that the witnesses be called for cross-examination without limitation, and to elicit any other relevant evidence.\n[30] The Commission does not disagree with the use of transcripts as evidence, subject to the Complainant and the Commission being permitted to cross-examine the Respondent\u2019s witnesses. Furthermore, the Commission also submits that it may wish to use part of its cross-examinations from the Cruden hearing, but in addition, it may also wish to further cross-Examine the witnesses in respect of questions that arise in the matter at hand.\n[31] The Complainant also referred the Tribunal to the CAW case with respect to the use of transcripts from prior proceedings. The CAW decision states, at para. 105:\n\u201c [105] In this regard, and without restricting the ability of any party to question any witness or elicit any relevant evidence, I proposed that all parties be allowed to rely upon the evidence as set out in the transcript from the preliminary inquiry without needing to have that evidence repeated before me in oral testimony.\u201d [Emphasis mine]\n[32] However, the Tribunal in the CAW case went on to state, at paras. 106-107:\n\u201c[106] I invited submissions from the parties in response to my proposal. While not generally averse to what I proposed, all parties expressed concern that they not be restricted by the transcript in relation to matters upon which they may want to examine or cross-examine witnesses. CAW-Canada submitted that the issues in a human rights proceeding are very different than in a criminal proceeding, and that further evidence may need to be elicited from the witnesses than is set out in the transcript. I agree. My intention was not to restrict the eliciting of relevant evidence from witnesses, but rather to make the sworn testimony in the transcript from the criminal proceeding admissible as testimonial evidence before me and available to be relied upon by all parties.\n[107] The respondents expressed concern that credibility will be a major issue in this proceeding, and they did not want to be restricted from cross-examining witnesses simply because a particular line of cross-examination had been pursued in the criminal proceeding and was recorded in the transcript. As I have stated, I appreciate that there will be significant issues of credibility to be determined before me and I wish to afford all parties an adequate opportunity to test the credibility of opposing witnesses. At the same time, I am empowered under the Rules to provide not only for the fair and just but also for the expeditious resolution of this matter, and I have specific power to limit the evidence on any issue. I will exercise this power judiciously at the hearing and in a manner that will not deprive any party of a fair, just and expeditious resolution of this matter. But if a line of questioning already has been pursued with a witness in the criminal proceeding and if it is my determination that the hearing process is not benefiting from repeating this line of questioning before me, I will exercise the powers available to me under the Rules.\u201d [Emphasis mine]\n[33] The present circumstances are significantly different from the CAW case, in that the transcripts in question are from proceedings where Mr. Wheatcroft was not a participant. There is, however, utility in admitting the evidence from the Cruden matter which is not specific to Ms. Cruden, provided the witnesses are made available for cross-examination, subject to certain restrictions.\n[34] The adjudicator in the CAW case was cognizant of the need to ensure that the opposing parties (in the case before me, being Mr. Wheatcroft and the CHRC), be afforded a full opportunity to cross-examine or elicit evidence, and that they should not be restricted in this regard. I am in agreement with those principles.\n[35] Finally, while the CHRT\u2019s statutory framework and rules differ from those governing the CAW matter, like the adjudicator in the CAW matter, I am still empowered to set\ncertain limits on the cross-examination. (See Re: Sound v. Fitness Industry Council of Canada, 2014 FCA 48, para. 37; C.E.P.U. v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 26, para. 20; Kirchmeir v. Edmonton (City) Police Service 2000 ABCA 324, para. 21) I will therefore adopt the spirit of the underlined portions of paragraph 106 of the CAW decision cited above, as the approach that I will follow in the current case.\n[36] The Respondent has argued, in the alternative, that the Complainant should identify new arguments that were not identified or considered in the Cruden matter. The problem with the position of the Respondent is that the Complainant was not a party to the Cruden proceedings and was not privy to the exchange of documents and reports, nor has the Complainant had an opportunity to review the transcripts of the Cruden proceedings. It would be unfair to the Complainant to require him to identify new arguments or limit the scope of his complaint at this juncture.\nII. Order\n[37] The Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is dismissed.\n[38] The Respondent shall forthwith, and in any event no later than December 4, 2015, make available to the Complainant copies of the testimony transcripts from the Cruden hearing held before Member Marchildon.\n[39] The aforementioned transcripts shall be accepted as sworn testimony before the Tribunal, and will be available for all parties to rely upon at the hearing.\n[40] The Parties shall be able to call further evidence to address the specifics in the present case.\n[41] The Complainant Mr. Wheatcroft shall be able to lead his own evidence subject to relevance, as provided for by s. 50(1) of the Act. If Mr. Wheatcroft is advancing arguments not before the Tribunal in the Cruden proceedings, he shall particularize same, after reviewing the transcripts and exhibits in Cruden, and prior to hearing dates being set in the current matter.\n[42] The Complainant, at this time, is not required to advise what specific arguments he intends to advance that were not decided in Cruden, nor will the scope of his complaint be limited. This matter and the evidence he intends to advance may be addressed later, after the transcripts have been provided and disclosure is complete.\n[43] The Respondent shall, by summons if necessary, make available for cross-examination by the Complainant and the Commission, all witnesses whose transcript evidence in Cruden is being relied upon by the Respondent in the current case, subject to my earlier comments as set forth in paragraph 31.\n[44] Where a party relies on the cross-examination of a witness from the Cruden transcript, the party is not restricted from cross-examining that same witness in the current hearing.\nIII. Closing Comments\n[45] I trust the foregoing has covered all matters outstanding. Should there be any questions or difficulty in meeting the disclosure deadline, a further Case Conference should be immediately requested. I would ask that the Complainant, Mr. Wheatcroft, and the Commission advise the Tribunal when they have had an opportunity to review the transcripts and are in a position to move forward with setting hearing dates.\n[46] As a final comment, I would like to thank all counsel for their briefs and their thorough oral submissions.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Ulyatt\nTable of Contents\nI.Introduction 1\nII.Analysis 3\nIII.Decision 4\nI. Introduction\n[1] The Complainant has brought a motion to amend her Complaint to add the Complaint of Retaliation by the Respondent, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 500 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cInternational\u201d). The Complainant alleges continued bullying and harassment by International and outlines the particulars of same.\n[2] This Tribunal per Member Wallace on September 9, 2011, issued a strict confidentiality order in relations to Ms. Palm\u2019s settlement with her employer and the British Colombia Maritime Employers Association (\u201cBCMEA\u201d). The ruling stated the following:\n[20] I order disclosure of the settlement to the Remaining Respondents. Such disclosure to be made in the following manner:\n(a) Within fourteen days after the release of this ruling, Harris & Company, lawyers for the Employer Respondents, shall provide a copy of the settlement to Caroline & Gislason, lawyers for the Remaining Respondents;\n(b) Neither Caroline & Gislason nor the Remaining Respondents shall use the copy of the settlement for any purpose other than the hearing or settlement of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents;\n(c) Caroline & Gislason shall be permitted to communicate the terms of the Settlement orally to the Remaining Respondents. Caroline & Gislason shall not make copies of the copy of the Settlement, and neither Caroline & Gislason nor the Remaining Respondents shall communicate the terms of the Settlement to anyone, other than in the course of the hearing or settlement of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents; and\n(d) Caroline & Gislason shall return the copy of the Settlement to Harris & Company within seven days of the determination of Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints against the Remaining Respondents.\n[3] Ms. Palm, in her Motion, submitted that the information pertaining to her Complaints, presently before this Tribunal, was provided to a third party and the disclosure of that information led the Waterfront Employee Association Health and Benefit Plan Trustees (\u201cthe Trustee\u201d) to commence a civil action against her for benefits received in 2008, prior to her human rights Complaints in 2009 and her settlement with the BCMEA in 2011. The thrust of Ms. Palm\u2019s argument is that the disclosure made reference to her settlement and health information when counsel for the Trustee wrote on October 15, 2015, a letter which included the following:\nthe plan recently became aware that in addition to receiving benefits from the plan you also received a settlement from your employer and its representative and received full compensation from them. (Ms. Palm\u2019s Motion)\n[4] International, by their counsel, argued that \u201cMs. Palm\u2019s Motion does not disclose a tenable claim of retaliation\u201d and asks that the motion be dismissed. In summary of this position, International relies on Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at paragraph 7, as follows:\n[7] It is now undisputed that this Tribunal has the authority to amend a complaint to add an allegation of retaliation. As a rule, an amendment should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed. In any case, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of an amendment. That should be done only in the fullness of the evidence after a full hearing. Thus the test to be applied is whether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation. (Emphasis added)\n[5] The Respondent submits that Ms. Palm\u2019s claim must meet the allegations of satisfying section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d), which provides:\n[14.1] It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[6] Therefore, the Respondent argues there are two criteria to be met:\n(a) The act must be punitive, with the effect of harming the complainant.\n(b) The act must be done by a respondent or a person acting on a respondent\u2019s behalf.\n[7] The Respondent argues that Ms. Palm\u2019s motion does not meet these criteria and furthermore, it is submitted that the Trustee\u2019s lawsuit is not one that is controlled by the Union.\n[8] The Commission has submitted a brief supporting the position of the Complainant.\n[9] The Commission submits that the Tribunal has ample discretion regarding conduct proceedings and the discretion and authority to amend the Complaint to deal with additional allegations and that this approach has been upheld by the Federal Court. The Commission has relied upon Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 FCR 3. Also the Commission referred to a decision of the Tribunal in Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHRT) at para 19.\nII. Analysis\n[10] It appears all of the parties are in agreement based on their submissions that acknowledge that the Tribunal has the authority to amend the Complaint to add the allegations of retaliation (Virk, supra, and Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2013 CHRT 9 (CanLII)).\n[11] The Respondent is of the opinion that the Complainant has not met the onus of establishing a tenable case.\n[12] The ability to amend a complaint under the Act is clear and the issues and the cases do not set a high standard to be met in order to amend. The Complainant has established a tenable case and in light of the retaliation. The Complainant is able to amend. Whether the amended Complaint will succeed is still to be proven.\n[13] The Respondent has at its option the ability to bring a motion to seek Summary Judgment or at the end of the Complainant\u2019s case, to move for non-suit or lead evidence to dispute the Complaint.\n[14] The Tribunal adopts the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Canderel, which states:\n[\u2026] the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice. (Emphasis added)\nCanderel Ltd. v Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 FCR 3 (CanLII) at 2.\n[15] The Complainant, at present, ought to put forth her Complaints and they will be dealt with as previously stated.\n[16] The Tribunal is aware that there are three Complaints dating back to 2009 and that, at present, this Tribunal Member is at least the third Member to hear this matter.\n[17] It is time to bring matters to a head and for closure for the benefit of all of the parties.\nIII. Decision\n[18] Oder:\na) Ms. Palm will be able to file an Amended Statement of Particulars by the 14th day of January, 2016;\nb) Ms. Palm will disclose all documents relevant to her amended claim;\nc) The practical issues will be discussed at the Case Management Case Conference on January 8, 2016.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Background \u2013 The Complaint\n[1] On August 12, 2013, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) requested that the Acting Chair of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint (Complaint) of Mr. Ken Kelsh (Complainant) against the Canadian Pacific Railway (Respondent).\n[2] The Complaint, as amended, alleges:\ndiscrimination in employment on account of disability, adverse differential treatment and failure to accommodate, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act);\nretaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act; and\nsystemic discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s testing, bidding practices and procedures, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[3] The Complainant belongs to a division of the Teamsters Union (Union). His employment is governed by a collective agreement between the\nUnion and the Respondent (Collective Agreement).\n[4] The Commission is not participating in the hearing. It takes no position on this motion.\nII. Complainant\u2019s motion\n[5] The Complainant\u2019s motion, as amended, is for a Ruling regarding the payment of witnesses and for disclosure of documents and information.\nIII. Subject of this Ruling\n[6] The hearing of this Complaint is scheduled to start on January 11, 2016 and go to January 22, 2016. In this Ruling, I will deal with the motion\u2019s disclosure requests in motion paragraphs 2 through 6. I will issue a subsequent Ruling with respect to the payment of witnesses. I think the disclosure process is more time-consuming for the parties, and it is in the interests of both of them that they know their disclosure obligations with respect to this motion. The Ruling separately addresses each disclosure request.\nGeneral\n[7] Although this Ruling first cites the specific disclosure requests in the Notice of Motion, I have also set out the changes to the parameters of the requested disclosure since the Notice of Motion was filed. These changes occurred during oral submissions made at Case Management Conference Calls (CMCC) on December 8, 2015 and December 18, 2015, and in the contents of correspondence which the parties copied to the other parties and to the Tribunal.\nIV. Statute law, Tribunal Rules and case law\n[8] Subsection 50(1) of the Act states, in part, that the member or panel inquiring into a complaint \u201c\u2026shall give all parties \u2026 a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence, and make representations.\u201d Proper disclosure of documents is one way that the parties have a full and ample opportunity to present evidence.\n[9] Rule 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (Tribunal Rules) deals with the Statement of Particulars (SOP), disclosure and production of documents and information.\n[10] Rule 6(1)(d) is particularly relevant to this motion. It states:\nWithin the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n[11] Rule 6(5) makes the obligation to disclose ongoing in the circumstances described.\n[12] The case law is well-settled that the standard for the disclosure of documents pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and (5) is that of \u201carguable relevance.\u201d It is also settled law that the phrase \u201carguable relevance\u201d means that a document requested to be disclosed must have a nexus or rational connection to a fact, issue or form of relief sought or identified by a party (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18 (Seeley), at para. 6). A request for disclosure cannot be \u201c\u2026speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d (Johanne Guay v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34 (Guay), at para. 43).\nV. Motion paragraph 2\n[13] This paragraph requests \u201call significant management policy documents regarding TOP [Track Occupancy Permits] and sub-Foreman requirements or capabilities of Group 1 machine operators.\u201d\n[14] The Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion (Response) named the materials it had disclosed related to Track Occupancy Permits, Sub-Foreman Protection, and Group 1 Machine Operators.\n[15] The Respondent requested that the Complainant identify any specific document or documents which he believes the Respondent had not yet disclosed and, if the Complainant did so, the Respondent would search for and disclose them. The Respondent also stated that between the Response date and the hearing, it would disclose any additional documents of which it was not aware, in accordance with Rule 6(5).\n[16] The Complainant\u2019s December 7, 2015 Reply to Response (Reply) clarified that this disclosure request included \u201cany relevant email messages or memoranda from\u201d the Respondent\u2019s management \u201cdiscussing or commenting on\u201d the above-named policies, \u201cparticularly in the period January 1, 2005 to the August 24, 2011 date\u201d of the Complaint\u2019s filing, \u201cand thereafter any such documents that do not relate specifically to\u201d the Complaint and \u201c\u2026would therefore not be privileged.\u201d\n[17] I find that the Complainant has sufficiently particularized this disclosure request in his Reply, both by specifying the type of documents requested, and also the time periods for which they are requested. The Complainant also clarifies that for the period after the Complaint was filed, to date, the request excludes privileged documents.\n[18] I conclude that these documents are arguably relevant, in that they are rationally connected to Track Occupancy Permits, Sub-Foreman Protection, and Group 1 Machine Operators, all of which are related to a fact or issue in the parties\u2019 Statements of Particulars.\n[19] Therefore, the Respondent shall disclose, if it has not already done so, any arguably relevant management policy documents regarding Track Occupancy Permits, Sub-Foreman requirements or capabilities of Group 1 machine operators, including any arguably relevant email messages or memoranda from the Respondent\u2019s management with respect to the aforementioned policies, particularly in the period January 1, 2005 to August 24, 2011, and thereafter, any such documents that are not privileged with respect to the within Complaint.\nVI. Motion paragraph 3\n[20] This paragraph requests disclosure of all bid sheets for the Southern Ontario division for the period 2004 to the end of 2010 indicating the requirements for various Group 1 machine operator positions, in chronological order.\n[21] The Respondent required clarification regarding the areas for which the \u201cbid sheets\u201d were required.\n[22] In his Reply to Response, the Complainant clarified and amended this request as follows:\na) before 2014, the present Eastern Region District 1 was called the Southern Ontario Division;\nb) the disclosure request changed as follows: the initial Job Bulletins and subsequent Awards issued in January and February respectively for each year for the period 2004 to 2015.\n[23] The Complainant submitted that these documents were relevant to the issues of discrimination and accommodation because they \u201cdemonstrate the Group 1 positions available, their requirements (D card or E card)\u2026\u201d, and to whom they were awarded \u201camong the complainant and his peers\u201d over the period.\n[24] During the December 8, 2015 Case Management Conference Call (CMCC), Respondent counsel stated that \u201cbid sheets\u201d and \u201cBulletins\u201d should not be confused with each other.\n[25] The Respondent issues Bulletins containing every job for which employees can bid. Each employee then submits his or her bids. Just as there is a Bulletin history, there\u2019s also a bid history for each employee. Each employee bids on a large number of jobs in the applicable Bulletin, ranking them in order of preference.\n[26] At the December 8, 2015 CMCC, Complainant counsel clarified that the Complainant sought only the main Bulletins and Awards of jobs, not all the bid sheets of all employees. He submitted that this did not involve the Respondent putting a work product together, but was simply a matter of providing the record of these documents which the Respondent produced every year.\n[27] During the December 8, 2015 CMCC, Complainant counsel changed the disclosure request in this category to the following:\nRespondent\u2019s Job Bulletins for January and November plus the resulting Awards, for the Eastern Region District 1 (called the Southern Ontario Division before 2014) and the Toronto Division, for each of the 5 years from 2011 to 2015.\n[28] In paragraph 34 of the Respondent\u2019s December 17, 2015 Notice of Motion requesting an adjournment (Adjournment Motion), Respondent counsel quoted from parts of a December 14, 2015 email from Complainant counsel. In it, Complainant counsel stated that the Complainant\u2019s disclosure motion and reply requested \u201cbulletins and awards back to 2004\u201d and that he was repeating that request.\n[29] In the December 18, 2015 CMCC, Complainant counsel stated that notwithstanding his December 14, 2015 email, he was confirming that the Bulletin and Award disclosure the Complainant sought were the January Bulletins and resulting Awards, and the November Bulletins and resulting Awards, for each year for the period 2011 to 2015.\n[30] On December 21, 2015, Complainant counsel confirmed by email, copied to the parties and the Tribunal, that Respondent counsel Ms. Ainslie had disclosed all the January and November Bulletins and their associated Awards for both the Eastern Region District 1 and the Toronto Division, for the period 2011 to 2015.\n[31] It is therefore not necessary to order their disclosure in this Ruling.\nVII. Motion paragraph 4\n[32] This paragraph seeks disclosure of all daily time sheet information including wages, chronologically ordered, for the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2015 for:\n(i) Ontario South Rail Crew No. 1 (as of January 1, 2015, Rail Crew No. 3) and\n(ii) the Toronto Division where the complainant has been employed on the section for 4 to 5 months every winter.\n[33] In its Response, the Respondent\u2019s position was that:\nit would provide the Complainant with his own time sheet and wage information for the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2015;\nthe Complainant needed to clarify the scope of this request, because if he required this information for all other employees employed on the named Rail Crews from 2003 to 2015, the documentation would be in the thousands of pages;\nthis information is not probative or relevant, because the Rates of Pay of all maintenance of way positions are in the Wage Agreement, already disclosed; and\nthe Respondent would contravene Section 4.3 of Schedule 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) if it disclosed this information.\n[34] In paragraph 8 of the Reply, the Complainant:\nacknowledged that the Respondent had disclosed the Complainant\u2019s own time sheet information, but that they showed hours only, not wages;\nrevised and reduced his disclosure request to be for the daily rail crew time sheets (DRCTS) for:\n(i) January 1, 2011 to December 1, 2015 for all Ontario South Rail Crews; and\n(ii) the winter period of November 1 to April 30, for each year from 2008 to 2015 for the Toronto Division;\nbecause the DRCTS list only the name and position of the crew member and the number of regular and overtime hours worked that day, confidentiality was not a significant concern; and\nwhen combined with the Bulletins and Awards, the DRCTS would permit the Complainant to calculate his lost overtime opportunity in those periods in which the Respondent did not permit him to drive the Stake Truck or Plough Trucks.\n[35] During the December 8, 2015 CMCC, Respondent counsel said she had disclosed the following with respect to the Complainant himself:\nhis bid and award history from 2005 to 2011 \u2013 showing every position he bid on and every position he was awarded in that time period;\nhis position history from January 2003 to November 2015; and\nhis time history showing wage claims and time recorded, so if he worked overtime or special additional time claims, it shows that, from January 2003 to November 2015.\n[36] The requested documents do not have a formal name. Complainant gave each daily sheet the name \u201cDaily Rail Crew Time Sheet\u201d for ease of reference. Each is typed into a chart and well-organized. Each shows 20 or 30 or 40 people on a crew, which position each occupied, and how much regular time and overtime each worked.\n[37] During the December 8, 2015 CMCC, Complainant counsel submitted that the request for disclosure of the DRCTS ties in with the position history Respondent provided. However, that history only indicates whether the Complainant was working as a Group I machine operator, but nothing more. The Complainant also needs to know when he was working in a particular position.\n[38] Complainant counsel further submitted that there was really no other way to show the Complainant\u2019s wage and overtime loss in the 5 years he wasn\u2019t permitted to drive the Stake Truck as he did before. The only way to prove this loss even in an estimated way was to look at the people who did get Stake Truck jobs in the period 2011 \u2013 2015, and see the amount of overtime they worked.\n[39] The Complainant required disclosure of only the Rail Crews\u2019 DRCTS.\n[40] The Complainant stated that the foreman fills out the DRCTS, and the Respondent is supposed to keep them in the trailer for a while. They are sent to the timekeepers. The Complainant further stated that \u201cthis year\u201d, they were on the computer, and that there was one for each Rail Crew for each day.\n[41] The Complainant stated that this year, the Eastern Region District 1 became \u201cAlgoma\u201d and that the names are always changing. He also provided the names of the relevant supervisors in the time period from 2011 to date, and stated that in the Toronto Division, these daily time sheets are retained.\n[42] During the December 8, 2015 CMCC, the Complainant amended his request for the DRCTS to the following:\nall the DRCTS for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015 (there are 365 each year) for the Eastern Region District 1 (or whatever name that region was called and is presently called) and for the Toronto Division, for each Rail Crew for each of those years if available, with regular and overtime shown for each person, and their position.\n[43] Respondent counsel stated she would:\ni) make inquiries asking the Respondent if it had the DRCTS for the Rail Crews during the designated time periods in the designated areas, which would include the names of each Rail Crew member, showing the regular time and overtime worked, and the position, or if the Respondent had any portion of them; and\nii) if the Respondent has them, or any portion of them, she would disclose what the Respondent had; and\niii) if the Respondent only had a portion of them, she would so advise the other parties in writing.\n[44] Ms. Ainslie asked that the names on these documents be anonymized. However, this would make it impossible to assess the seniority of the employees in the DRCTS.\n[45] Therefore, the Tribunal decided to make a confidentiality order governing all the DRCTS which the Respondent discloses. This means that no counsel, party or witness shall in any manner discuss, refer to, or transmit in any form, any information whatsoever (including, without limitation, names or other personal information, wages, overtime, dates of birth) about any of the individuals in any of the DRCTS, except for the purposes of the hearing of this Complaint.\n[46] Further, in any Ruling and decision arising from the hearing, these individuals will be anonymized.\n[47] The issue of the DRCTS came up again in the December 18, 2015 CMCC. The Complainant reiterated that he required disclosure of them from 2011 to and including 2015, but if they were not available any longer for all those years, he required the DRCTS for 2015 because he thought they should be available for that year.\n[48] Ms. Ainslie sent an email to Complainant counsel dated December 21, 2015 at 10:55 a.m., copied to the Tribunal, in which, among other things, she stated that her understanding was that the Complainant\u2019s request for the DRCTS had been withdrawn. I find that this was a misapprehension of what had transpired on this issue at the December 18, 2015 CMCC. I do understand how the error could have been made, as Ms. Ainslie was not at that CMCC, and its main topic was a motion for an adjournment of the hearing.\n[49] On December 21, 2015, at 12:34 p.m., Complainant counsel emailed Ms. Ainslie in response, copied to the Tribunal, stating that the Complainant\u2019s request for disclosure of the DRCTS was at minimum for the disclosure of those for 2015.\n[50] Then, on December 22, 2015, at 3:07 a.m., by email copied to the Tribunal, Complainant counsel suggested that the Complainant\u2019s overtime opportunities in 3 and \u00bd of the past 5 years could be calculated if the Respondent provided the same type of \u201cTime History\u201d indicating overtime hours for several key employees, identical to that which it had provided quite quickly for the Complainant on December 4, 2015. The Complainant named as an example a certain foreman, with whom the Complainant would have been working driving the Stake Truck. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent could access this history and print if off simply by inputting the employee\u2019s name into its computer. The Complainant further submitted that the employee\u2019s or employees\u2019 name(s) would be redacted so that he could be identified by his position and the fact he occupied the Stake Truck, and suggested this would not be a hardship or a prejudice to the Respondent and would not result in any potential breach of privacy for the employee(s).\n[51] The Complainant had been unaware that the Respondent could produce this type of history until he received his own from the Respondent.\n[52] The Respondent did not respond directly to this proposed suggestion from the Complainant, and left it up to the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\nAnalysis\n[53] As the Respondent did not respond directly to the suggestion for alternative disclosure in the Complainant\u2019s December 22, 2015, 3:07 a.m. email, I find that I do not have enough information to confirm whether the Complainant\u2019s suggestion is feasible. Therefore, at present, I cannot order it.\n[54] In Schedule C of his SOP, the Complainant seeks, among other things, compensation for overtime hours he alleges he lost. His SOP alleges that for 2011, that amount was \u201capparently very large.\u201d He further alleges that [the fact that the amount was large] \u201c\u2026would be reflected by records regarding people who did drive the stake truck or other group one operators.\u201d\n[55] My understanding is that the DRCTS provide the following information for each Rail Crew member: name (which will be kept confidential), seniority, position worked, regular time worked, and overtime worked. Therefore, the DRCTS are arguably relevant to a form of relief sought by the Complainant, and if they are available in whole or in part, the Respondent shall disclose them.\n[56] Therefore, the Respondent shall disclose all Daily Rail Crew Time Sheets (DRCTS) for the 5 years in the period 2011 to 2015, for the Eastern Region District 1 (or whatever that region is now called, or was previously called) and for the Toronto Division. If the Respondent does not have all of these DRCTS in its records, then it shall disclose those that it does have.\n[57] Pursuant to subsection 52(1)(c) of the Act, I am satisfied that because of the personal nature of the information that is contained in the DRCTS, as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved, such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public, the information in the DRCTS, including the names of the employees therein, shall remain confidential, as further particularized below.\nVIII. Motion paragraph 5\n[58] The Complainant sought photographs of all Group 1 and Special Group machines (perhaps 15 to 20 machines) labelled with proper names, for the assistance of the Tribunal at the hearing.\n[59] The Respondent\u2019s submitted that it did not have such photographs. Its position was that to require the Respondent to provide the photographs would be requiring the Respondent to provide a work product. Further, the Complainant can determine which machines are relevant to his Complaint, and should provide the photographs.\n[60] At the December 8, 2015 CMCC, the Respondent also advised that its intranet website, RailCity, does not contain such pictures. Although the Respondent agreed that the requested photographs would be useful to both the parties and the Tribunal, the Complainant was more suited for the task of photographing the machines because he knew which were relevant to his Complaint.\n[61] The Complainant then offered to take the photos at the Respondent\u2019s Toronto yard, provided he first obtain permission from his supervisor to enter Respondent lands. This was out of concern for potential liability for trespass.\n[62] The parties agreed that the Complainant should take as many photos as he could of the relevant machines at the appropriate locations and produce them.\n[63] The parties have agreed that the Complainant take the pictures. Further, in neither the December 18, 2015 CMCC nor any correspondence copied to the Tribunal since then have the parties raised any remaining issue regarding the photographs. Therefore, this Ruling will not make an order with respect to the photographs.\nIX. Motion paragraph 6\n[64] The Complainant sought the home address of Vasile (\u201cRomeo\u201d) Cazecu and assistance to serve the Tribunal summons (sic) on its witnesses while working and their reasonable contact information, including home addresses.\n[65] The Respondent submitted in its Response that releasing its employees\u2019 home addresses would contravene Section 4.3, Schedule 1 of PlPEDA, but that it would be able to provide its employees\u2019 business addresses.\n[66] During the December 8, 2015 CMCC, the parties submitted the following:\nthe Commission had served subpoenas on Mr. Cazecu and all of the Complainant\u2019s other witnesses except a Mr. Ian Wilson;\nComplainant counsel stated that Mr. Cazecu had an \u201copen\u201d ticket to depart Canada on December 27, 2015 and was not scheduled to return until a date in January 2016 after the hearing and Mr. Wilson did not know if he was willing to return early;\nMr. Cazecu is a very significant, essential witness for the Complainant, and someone whose name will arise in other witnesses\u2019 testimony; and\nRespondent counsel stated that the Respondent would accommodate Mr. Cazecu at any time during the hearing.\n[67] I then suggested that subject to counsel availability, I could attend in Peterborough on December 21, 22 or 23, 2015 for Mr. Cazecu\u2019s examination and cross-examination. The parties advised that this was not an option because of scheduling conflicts.\n[68] I also suggested that Complainant counsel could draft an Affidavit for Mr. Cazecu to sign before his departure, which would give the Respondent the opportunity, if it wished, to ask its own witnesses questions in light of the Affidavit\u2019s contents. This might perhaps eliminate the need to call Mr. Cazecu at all, subject to the Respondent\u2019s right to cross-examine him on his Affidavit.\n[69] I granted Respondent counsel Ms. Ainslie\u2019s request for time to consult with outside counsel on the issue and review Mr. Cazecu\u2019s will-say before responding by end of business on December 9, 2015.\n[70] In her December 9, 2015 email to the parties and the Tribunal, Respondent counsel submitted:\nthe Respondent prefers viva voce evidence for all witnesses;\nif Mr. Cazecu returned in time to testify during the first or second weeks of the hearing, the Respondent agreed to bifurcate its case, subject to the understanding that the Tribunal permit the Respondent to recall witnesses for the specific purpose of replying to Mr. Cazecu\u2019s evidence;\nif Mr. Cazecu could not testify during the hearing, the Respondent agrees with the Tribunal further bifurcating and extending the hearing to additional dates, subject to the Tribunal permitting the Respondent to recall witnesses for the specific purpose of replying to Mr. Cazecu\u2019s evidence; and\nif the hearing requires additional dates, then the parties\u2019 closing arguments be made only after the hearing of all the viva voce evidence.\n[71] On December 10, 2015, Complainant counsel responded that the Complainant agreed with the Respondent\u2019s December 9, 2015 proposal. Mr. Wilson undertook to keep the Tribunal and the Respondent advised about Mr. Cazecu\u2019s return date and ability to give evidence. Complainant counsel also submitted that each of the Complainant\u2019s witnesses and many of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses will address Mr. Cazecu\u2019s qualifications and the positions the Respondent has permitted him to perform. In combination with this evidence and the related documentary evidence, the parties may have a written agreement as to certain facts. In that way, Complainant counsel thought that this might eliminate the need for Mr. Cazecu to testify or to require more hearing dates. Complainant counsel also stated he would canvass Mr. Cazecu about being at the second week of the hearing.\nAnalysis\n[72] The form of assistance requested in this category is now moot.\n[73] The Tribunal takes notice of the parties\u2019 submissions set out above with respect to their agreement that Mr. Cazecu can testify at any time during the January hearing, and the conditions to that agreement. If he does not testify at that time, the parties can make their submissions above, as well as any others they wish to make to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal will take them into consideration in deciding how to proceed.\nX. Ruling\n[74] If it has not already done so, the Respondent shall disclose all arguably relevant management policy documents regarding Track Occupancy Permits, Sub-Foreman requirements or positions, capabilities of Group 1 machine operators, such documents to include any arguably relevant email messages or memoranda from the Respondent\u2019s management with respect to the aforementioned policies, particularly for the period January 1, 2005 to August 24, 2011, and with respect to the period from August 25, 2011 to date, any such documents which are not privileged with respect to the within Complaint.\n[75] If the Respondent has them, the Respondent shall disclose all the documents referred to in this Ruling as the Daily Rail Crew Time Sheets (DRCTS) for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015 for the Eastern Region District 1 (which Region may also now be known as \u201cAlgoma\u201d, and may have been previously known by a different name) and for the Toronto Division, for each Rail Crew, each setting out the name of each Rail Crew member, the regular and overtime hours for each person, and their position.\n[76] If the Respondent does not have all the DRCTS for the period January 1, 2011 to December 31 2015, for the areas named above, the Respondent shall disclose the DRCTS that is has for the period and areas, and shall provide written confirmation to the other parties that it does not have the balance of the requested DRCTS.\n[77] The disclosed DRCTS shall be confidential. No party, counsel or witness shall discuss, refer to, or transmit in any form any information whatsoever about any individuals named in any of the DRCTS, including, without limitation, any personal information of any nature or kind, such as names, wages, overtime, dates of birth, home addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, except for the purposes of the hearing of this Complaint.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 31, 2015\n",

Introduction [1] Ms. Siddoo is a Complainant before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) alleging workplace discrimination. She has recently submitted two motions to the Tribunal, each to add a separate party to the present complaint against the International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502 (\u201cILWU\u201d). Specifically, Ms. Siddoo seeks to add as Respondents the British Columbia Maritime Employers\u2019 Association (\u201cBCMEA\u201d) and TSI Terminal Systems Inc. (which is now referred to as Global Container Terminals, hereinafter GCT). As the two motions are virtually identical, save for the named additional Respondents, this Ruling will apply to both motions.\n[2] At the time of bringing her complaint against the ILWU, Ms. Siddoo also filed complaints against BCMEA and GCT with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). The Commission did not find the complaints against BCMEA and GCT warranted an inquiry at the Tribunal. Ms. Siddoo judicially reviewed that decision to the Federal Court, who dismissed her application. She later attempted an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal who also dismissed her application.\n[3] The question before the Tribunal is whether it is proper to now add BCMEA and GCT as Respondents to the present complaint. I am not satisfied, for the reasons below, that it would be appropriate to add BCMEA and GCT to this complaint. Therefore, the two motions are dismissed.\nII. Facts [4] The following facts are the ones most relevant to the Complainant\u2019s motions currently being considered.\n[5] Ms. Siddoo filed the following complaints with the Commission:\n(a) On August 30, 2011 against GCT alleging adverse differential treatment and failure to provide a harassment-free environment in violation of sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d);\n(b) On November 7, 2011 against BCMEA alleging adverse differential treatment and failure to provide a harassment-free environment in violation of sections 7 and 14 of the Act; and\n(c) On November 7, 2011 against the ILWU raising the allegations of adverse differential treatment and failure to provide a harassment-free environment, in violation of sections 9 and 14 of the Act.\n[6] All three complaints were the subject of investigations by the Commission in order to determine if inquiry by the Tribunal was warranted pursuant to s. 44 of the Act.\n[7] On July 2, 2013 the Commission referred the complaint against ILWU to the Tribunal for inquiry. On the same day, the Commission dismissed the complaints against BCMEA and GCT following investigations into both. The Commission concluded there was insufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry by the Tribunal in respect of the two proposed Respondents.\n[8] On August 7, 2013, Ms. Siddoo filed an application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decisions to dismiss the complaints against BCMEA and GCT, which were later consolidated into a single Court file.\n[9] On June 4, 2014, the Federal Court dismissed Ms. Siddoo\u2019s applications, thus upholding the decisions of the Commission (Order dated June 4, 2014, Docket no. T-1341-13).\n[10] Ms. Siddoo attempted to appeal the Federal Court\u2019s decision, but failed to meet the deadline to serve and file a notice of appeal. Her application for an extension of the deadline was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal and denied (Order dated September 30, 2014, Docket No. 14-A-58).\n[11] On October 24, 2014, during a Tribunal case management conference call in the matter against ILWU, Ms. Siddoo raised the possibility that she may seek to add additional parties to the matter.\n[12] On December 10, 2014, Ms. Siddoo advised the Tribunal and the Commission that she would be seeking to add BCMEA and GCT as Respondents.\n[13] On December 18, 2014, Ms. Siddoo was advised by the Tribunal Chairperson by way of correspondence that if she intended to file a motion to add a respondent, she would have to file such motion by December 31, 2014 in order to ensure that the hearing on the merits against ILWU, scheduled for February 23-27, 2015, could proceed without delay.\n[14] On December 30, 2014, Ms. Siddoo filed a motion seeking to add BCMEA as a party and another motion seeking to add GCT as a party to the proceedings against ILWU currently before the Tribunal.\nIII. Analysis [15] The issue before the Tribunal is whether it is proper to add BCMEA and\/or GCT as Respondents to the complaint against IWLU currently before the Tribunal.\n[16] The Commission argues that there is no merit to the Complainant\u2019s request to add the proposed Respondents as parties to the matter. The Commission also argues that the motions should not be granted on the basis of procedural fairness.\n[17] The proposed Respondents, BCMEA and GCT, in a joint response to the motions, argue the following: that he Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to add the proposed Respondents; that the requirements of issue estoppel have been met; that adding the proposed Respondents would amount to an abuse of process; and, that the Complainant has not met the proper legal test for adding respondents. There were no submissions from the ILWU.\n[18] In reaching my decision, I have considered every submission of the Commission and of BCMEA and GCT. However, it is not necessary for me to address each one in this ruling.\n[19] As the question of jurisdiction has been raised, I must address this argument first.\nA. Jurisdiction [20] The position of the proposed Respondents is that the Tribunal may only consider a complaint against a respondent that has been referred to it by the Commission. The proposed Respondents cite section 49(1) of the Act to support their view that the Tribunal may only institute an inquiry upon a referral by the Commission. Reference is made to paragraph 10 of Zhou v. National Research Council, 2009 CHRT 7, to suggest that the Tribunal cannot be requested to institute an inquiry without such a referral.\n[21] I don\u2019t agree that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to add respondents to a complaint that has been referred for inquiry. The present inquiry was instituted by a referral from the Commission. The facts in the Zhou decision are significantly different than the present matter before the Tribunal. In Zhou, a respondent attempted to institute an inquiry into separate allegations against a co-respondent. Under those circumstances, the Tribunal properly dismissed the attempt to institute a new inquiry in that manner.\n[22] Most importantly, on the question of jurisdiction is the wording of the Tribunal\u2019s enabling statute. Under section 48.9(2) of the Act, the Chairperson has the authority to make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal. Section 48.9(2)(b) of the Act specifically provides for rules governing \u201cthe addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings\u201d. Rule 8(3) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure instructs parties on the method for seeking the addition of a new party.\n[23] In my view, section 48.9(2)(b) of the Act makes it clear that Parliament has conferred this jurisdiction on the Tribunal.\nB. Issue Estoppel [24] The proposed Respondents have argued that the doctrine of issue estoppel should apply to the present motions. The decision of the Commission to not add BCMEA and GCT to the complaint has been judicially reviewed by the Federal Court and the application was dismissed.\n[25] Notwithstanding the arguments put forward, the issue before the Tribunal is materially different. Whereas the Federal Court\u2019s review was based on the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s decision not to refer the complaints against the proposed Respondents for inquiry, the question before the Tribunal is different. The question in this case is whether or not it is now appropriate for the Tribunal to add these proposed Respondents to the present complaint.\n[26] For this reason, I do not regard the Complainant as issue estopped from bringing the present motions.\nC. Proper Legal Test for Adding Respondents \/ Merit of the Requests [27] The test for adding respondents to a complaint was set out by the Tribunal in Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du SCFP v. TELUS Communications (Qu\u00e9bec) Inc., 2003 CHRT 31, as follows:\n[30] The Panel is of the opinion that the forced addition of a new respondent once the Tribunal has been charged with inquiring into a complaint is appropriate, in the absence of formal rules to this effect, if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint of which the Tribunal is seized and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\n[28] This test has been applied by the Federal Court. (Canada (Attorney General) v. Brown, 2008 FC 734, at para. 39).\n[29] Although the Tribunal will not conduct a substantive review of the allegations at the time of the motion being made, there nevertheless must be a certain level of particulars provided in the motion in order for the Tribunal to be able to conclude there is any possibility of a tenable connection to the pre-existing complaint such that the proposed respondent might rightly be added thereto.\n[30] As a minimum, this would include facts alleged in relation to a specific discriminatory practice linked to a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Act. There would need to be sufficient detail in order to properly understand the allegation, the period of time during which the allegation took place, and the nexus between such actions and the proposed respondent. Unfortunately, the motions submitted by Ms. Siddoo do not include such a minimum level of particulars.\n[31] In her motions, Ms. Siddoo alleges generally that ILWU, BCMEA and GCT colluded to remove her from two different training sessions, refused to accommodate her, and did not effectively deal with Work Safe British Columbia (WSBC) on her behalf. Of these common allegations raised in her motions, Ms. Siddoo provides some particulars with regard to the training sessions, but there is no clear nexus to the proposed Respondents and a prohibited ground under the Act. She also made allegations of harassment by the president of TSI Systems Inc. (now GCT), but again did not establish a nexus with a prohibited ground under the Act.\n[32] The TELUS case cited above is an example of similar circumstances where the Tribunal denied a motion to add a respondent because, inter alia, there was insufficient documentation of discrimination provided to warrant inclusion of the proposed party.\nIV. Conclusion [33] In light of the foregoing, I dismiss the present motions. The Complainant has not sufficiently explained in her motions why the addition of BCMEA and GCT is necessary for the disposition of the present complaint. Despite a thorough reading of the material presented in support of the Complainant\u2019s motions, I find that no discriminatory practice has been clearly alleged against either of these two proposed Respondents, nor has a linkage with a prohibited ground been identified.\nSigned by\nDavid Thomas\nTribunal Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 4, 2015\n",

Preliminary [1] The Complainant brought a Motion, to seek an order from the Tribunal directing the Respondent to provide further and better particulars and disclosure on specific topics set out in its Motion Record, on the basis that the Respondent\u2019s disclosure does not substantiate the Respondent\u2019s two defences of undue hardship and a bona fide occupational requirement. Prior to the Motion, the parties reached agreement on a number of the Complainant\u2019s requests.\n[2] The Respondent brought a Motion, requesting that the proposed expert testimony of David Jacobs not be received in evidence by the Tribunal because the subject of his testimony is one within the Tribunal\u2019s own knowledge and experience.\n[3] The Parties also sought to deal with the Respondent\u2019s request of the Tribunal issuing a subpoena for Mr. Andrew Ross of Calian Ltd.\n[4] The Respondent also sought the Tribunal\u2019s consent to have its witness Dr. Boddam give his evidence at the outset of the hearing on April 13, 2015 for reasons of his unavailability during other days of the scheduled hearing.\nII. Complainant\u2019s Motion for Further Disclosure & Particulars [5] The Complainant is a psychiatrist who received his training in the United States of America. In 2007, he received his specialist recognition by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO), which pursuant to reciprocity agreements is recognized in other Provinces of Canada.\n[6] In 2008, the Complainant responding to recruitment, by Calian Ltd., on behalf of the Respondent, applied for a position as a psychiatrist with the Canadian Forces (CF). Notwithstanding his recognition by the CPSO as specialist, one of the requirements\u2019 of the position with CF was specialist certification in psychiatry from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC). He was unsuccessful with the examinations of the RCPSC and denied certification and as a result employment by CF.\n[7] The Complainant alleges that this hiring policy precludes members of fully qualified specialists of non-Canadian origin from being considered for employment and subjects the Complainant to discriminatory exclusion from employment opportunities and therefore discrimination having an adverse effect.\n[8] The Respondent\u2019s position is that by adopting the RCPSC standard, the Canadian Forces (CF) ensures that its psychiatrists meet the nationwide, recognized standard for proficiency in psychiatry, and is therefore a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) and denies that this requirement is discriminatory.\n[9] Prior to the hearing of the Motion, the respective parties reached agreement on a number of the Complainant\u2019s requests for disclosure and particulars as set out in the Complainant\u2019s Motion Record, but other matters were not satisfied.\n[10] In reaching any determination, I subscribe that it be fundamental that all parties have a full and ample opportunity to be heard and that all alleged facts, legal issues, relevant documents, and an overview of anticipated testimony be disclosed before the hearing. While the rules of the Tribunal are more flexible than the strict rules of the Courts of Justice, they still aim to ensure parties before the Tribunal benefit from fairness and natural justice.\n[11] Subscribing to Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 8, it is necessary that the respective parties provide particulars so as to properly define the issues, prevent surprises at the hearing of the matter, to enable the parties to prepare for the hearing and to facilitate the hearing. In complying with Rule 6(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, it is my opinion that the parties should err on providing more, than not enough. It is an obligation of the parties to comply with Rule 6(1) for the aforementioned purposes, as well as to assist the Tribunal in its finding of fact.\n[12] The Tribunal is not governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, and does not have the benefit of examinations of discovery. Section 48.9(2) of the CHRA empowers the Chairperson to make rules governing discovery proceedings, but no such rules have been made thus far. All the more reason for the respective parties to know the case which they must meet. This requires the most liberal disclosure of particulars. For the Respondent to argue that the particulars sought are not material, or that reasons for the document or documents being sought are flawed, is for the Tribunal to determine.\n[13] I do not believe that a liberal interpretation of the Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 8 decision is in conflict with Tiwari v. Air Canada et al., 2011 CHRT 16, especially since the issues in Tiwari were significantly different. I do not believe that these two decisions are incompatible with each other, or that they justify an attenuated disclosure obligation for the Respondent in the circumstance of this case.\n[14] While I agree with the Respondent, that disclosure of particulars does not entitle the opposing party to \u201cdisclosure of all of the evidence and arguments upon which the respondent intends to rely\u201d, however, the particulars must enable the parties to know the case that they must meet and as a result, the evidence which they must call or rely upon at the hearing.\n[15] The Respondent cites Bailie et al. v Air Canada Pilots Association, 2011 CHRT 17, in support of its position that it has provided sufficient particulars to meet the requirements of Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and satisfy the purposes of Rule 6, namely, \u201c\u2026to allow each of the parties to effectively run their respective cases\u2026.\u201d I agree with the argument stated at paragraph 12 of Bailie that a claim for further particulars should not be in effect a challenge to the credibility of the facts themselves. But with respect, I do not believe the Respondent has satisfied Rule 6, which in my opinion must be interpreted in a generous and broad sense in compliance with Rule 1(1) and (2) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[16] The Complainant is seeking, under heading C and E of his submissions, \u201c\u2026job descriptions or other information\/documents on the occupational requirements of both a civilian and a non-civilian Canadian Forces psychiatrist, including working directly or indirectly for the CF in August 2008, including any Calian psychiatrists, PS psychiatrists and Blue Cross psychiatrists.\u201d I believe that the Complainant is entitled to better and further particulars on these two issues concerning the use of civilian and non-civilian specialists providing services to the CF, and I so ORDER.\n[17] The Complainant further seeks particulars of CF\u2019s history of refusals of applications on the basis of CPS recognition without meeting RCPSC prerequisite by date and specialty as well as any accommodation or exceptions made for civilian CF specialists without RCPSC certification, before and after Dr. Keith was denied the positions for which he had applied. Any information which relates to (i) the Respondent\u2019s decision not to accept CPS credentials for CF specialist positions, or (ii) the Respondent\u2019s above-noted accommodation\/exemption of civilian CF specialists, is relevant. Accordingly, insofar as they relate to the period running from the Complainant\u2019s first application for the position until the date of his CHRA complaint, disclosure of any documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession containing this information is appropriate; and I so ORDER.\n[18] The Complainant seeks documents related to the RCPSC\u2019s and the CPSO\u2019s specialist certification procedure at the time of Dr. Keith\u2019s application. I believe that, to the extent such documents are in the Respondent\u2019s possession, such production is necessary for the reason claimed by the Respondent that the RCPSC policy was a bona fide occupational requirement and a fundamental issue in the Complainant\u2019s claim of adverse effect discrimination; and I so ORDER.\n[19] The Complainant\u2019s Motion also seeks more detailed witness statements, other than statements that consisted of a short paragraph of topics to be covered by each witness and on further request, five short bullet points summarizing categories of testimony. The Respondent\u2019s position is that it has provided a general description of the main points that each witness will testify about, sufficient to enable the Complainant to prepare his case and they need not be comprehensively detailed. It is sufficient to enable the Complainant to prepare its cross-examination and argument in chief.\n[20] Rule 6(1)(f) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure requires the witness statement to be \u201ca summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness.\u201d I do not believe that bullet points satisfy this rule. I believe that the quality of a witness statement is properly stated in C.D. v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp., 2010 HRTO 426, at paragraph 7: \u201c[w]itness statements should \u2026be detailed and set out the particular evidence that the witness will give, rather than just general topics.\u201d I do not believe that this requires a full and complete verbatim statement of the proposed testimony, but the summary prescribed by Rule 6(1)(f) should be sufficient for the opposing party to anticipate the evidence to be presented, and to allow proper preparation of its cross-examination and general case (See Bailie, at para. 15). It is ORDERED that the Respondent provide more detailed witness statements not later than 10 days prior to the commencement of the hearing.\nIII. Respondent\u2019s Motion for an Order that David Jacobs\u2019 Expert Opinion and Testimony be Excluded from the Hearing [21] This motion is brought by the Respondent to exclude David Jacobs as an expert witness as part of the Complainant\u2019s case. The Respondent alleges that expert evidence should only be admitted if the matter in issue requires specialized expertise to assist the Tribunal to understand the factual matter to reach a proper conclusion.\n[22] The Complainant\u2019s position is that Mr. Jacob\u2019s report (the Report) is necessary to assist the Tribunal in evaluating the Respondent\u2019s claim that Royal College certification is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) for the position sought by the Complainant; and further, that the report is of a technical subject matter not within the expertise or knowledge of the Tribunal.\n[23] The Complainant\u2019s Motion materials state that the Report provides detailed information about the regulation of doctors by the CPSO, its role, its powers and its duty to the public. It addresses the issue of CPSO recognition of specialists and how this relates to certification from the RCPSC.\n[24] The Respondent claims, at page 2 of its Motion Record, that the opinion evidence \u201cconsists primarily of a recitation of the statutory and regulatory framework for medical regulation\u201d and that the report is \u201cakin to calling expert evidence on domestic legal issues\u201d which is \u201cnot outside the experience and knowledge of this CHRT.\u201d\n[25] The Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.H-6, section (50)(3)(c) provides the Tribunal a more generous latitude in the admission of evidence as would otherwise be in a court of law. Nevertheless, both parties have referred to the leading case of R. v. Mohan [1994] 2 SCR 9, which at paragraph 17 states that the admission of expert opinion evidence depends on the application of the following criteria: (a) relevance; (b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (c) the absence of any exclusionary rule; and (d) a properly qualified expert. The Mohan decision makes reference to the earlier decision of R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 SCR 24, as being illustrative of the necessity requirement.\n[26] I believe that the Tribunal should follow the interpretation of Dickson J., in R. v. Abbey that the [opinion expert] evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature. For the expert evidence to be admissible it must be such that \u201cordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment about it if unassisted by persons with special knowledge\u201d (see Beven on Negligence (4th ed. 1928), cited in Mohan and Rosin v. Canadian Armed Forces 1989 CanLII 149 (CHRT), aff\u2019d [1991] 1 F.C. 391 (C.A.)). \u201cMere helpfulness\u201d is too low a standard to warrant accepting the dangers inherent in the admission of expert evidence\u201d (see R. v. D.D. 2000 SCC 43, at para. 47, referring to Mohan and Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 CHRT 46, at para. 8.)\n[27] The Complainant has suggested that the Tribunal\u2019s area of experience and knowledge is limited by being specific to interpreting whether discrimination has occurred and providing the appropriate remedy. He cites Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2006 CHRT 40, as authority for this assertion. As a result, in the complainant\u2019s view, Dr. Jacobs\u2019 report is outside the experience and technical knowledge of the Tribunal.\n[28] Section 50(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, provides that \u201c[i]n the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\u201d I believe the Tribunal\u2019s determination as to the appropriateness of receiving expert opinion evidence on the law was best stated in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Minister of Personnel), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 26., at paragraphs 16 and 17. The Tribunal is charged with deciding issues of fact and law and should not delegate this responsibility to expert witnesses: \u201c[t]he law is the province of counsel and the Tribunal,...it should be raised in argument rather than as expert or opinion evidence.\u201d\n[29] I agree with the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Report as consisting primarily of a recitation of the statutory and regulatory frameworks. I believe that the test established in Mohan has not been met. Dr. Jacob\u2019s Report is not outside the knowledge and experience of the Tribunal, and the issues of law discussed therein should not be delegated to an expert witness, as was stated in Northwest Territories above.\n[30] For the above reasons, I Order Dr. Jacob\u2019s Report not be admitted as evidence.\nIV. Issuance of a Subpoena Duces Tecum for Andrew Ross of Calian Ltd. [31] Prior to the Motions being heard, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to issue a summons pursuant to section 50(3) of the Canadian Human Right Act to Andrew Ross of Calian Ltd. to produce documents that are relevant to this proceeding, specifically information relating to the compensation for the position at issue which, the Respondent states, is in the sole possession of Calian Ltd.\n[32] The Complainant was in favour of the issuance of the subpoena to Andrew Ross, but desired broader terms.\n[33] On consent of the Respondent and the Complainant, the Tribunal is to issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of Mr. Andrew Ross of Calian Ltd., who is to be directed to produce all relevant documents in Calian Ltd.\u2019s possession, including but not limited to the salary structure for the positions in Petawawa and Cold Lake for which Dr. Keith applied, from the date of his first application for the position until the date of this decision, including terms of all benefits provided; and all documents concerning the actual tasks performed by Calian psychiatrists at Cold Lake and Petawawa over that period of time, to counsel for the Respondent, within 1 week\u2019s time from the date of Mr. Ross\u2019 personal service with the summons, or face compelled attendance at a hearing to be scheduled by the Tribunal and further to attend and give evidence at the hearing at such time and place as counsel for the Respondent may advise.\n[34] As requested by the parties, Tribunal agrees, on being advised by the Respondent that Mr. Ross has not made full production of all relevant documents being the subject matter of the above subpoena, within the time set out, at a date and time determined by the Tribunal, to schedule a hearing by teleconference for the sole purpose of requiring the attendance of Mr. Ross at the offices of the Respondent, at which time he will be ordered to produce all relevant documents to counsel for the Respondent.\n[35] On consent of the Parties, it is ordered that the Respondent will make production forthwith to counsel for the Complainant of all documents produced to the Respondent by Mr. Ross, upon receipt of same, and will further make production of all unproduced relevant documents from the CPSO and RCPSC, in its possession at the earliest possible date.\nV. Respondent\u2019s Witness, Dr. Boddam Testimony on April 13 or Week Following [36] On consent of the Parties, it is agreed that Dr. Boddam will not give testimony prior to the completion of the Complainant\u2019s case.\n[37] Dr. Boddam shall present his testimony, at a date following the scheduled week of the hearing, at such time as shall be determined by the Tribunal after consultation with counsel for the Respondent and the Complainant.\nSigned by\nRonald Sydney Williams\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 27, 2015\n",

Complaint\n[1] This is a decision regarding a Complaint dated July 25, 2013 by Michael Moffat, as Complainant, against Davey Cartage Co. (1973) Ltd. (\u201cDavey Cartage\u201d), as Respondent, alleging it discriminated against him on the basis of his disability by terminating his employment. Mr. Moffat alleges that the impugned conduct occurred as a result of him becoming temporarily disabled and unable to perform his work as a \u201cDispatcher \/ Inside Sales Agent\u201d for the Respondent following a motor vehicle accident outside of work. The accident occurred on or about February 16, 2013, in which Mr. Moffat suffered a concussion and was forced to remain off work for almost two months. When the Complainant returned to work on April 8, 2013, his employment was terminated by the Respondent that same day.\n[2] On April 29, 2014, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Complaint.\n[3] Mr. Moffat appeared and gave evidence at the hearing. He was assisted occasionally by his friend, Ms. Lynne Dunstan. Mr. Moffat provided a helpful, written chronology of events and gave evidence that was clear and cogent. The Respondent\u2019s President, Mr. Michael (Mick) Thomas, and its Operations Manager, Mr. Keith Freeman, appeared on behalf of Davey Cartage and also gave helpful, detailed evidence at the hearing. The Respondent was represented by a lawyer, Mr. Joe Coutts, of Coutts Pulver LLP. The Commission did not appear at the hearing.\nII. Decision\n[4] For the reasons set out below, I have determined that the Complaint has not been substantiated and it is therefore dismissed.\nIII. Facts\n[5] Davey Cartage is a trucking company based in Surrey, B.C. Its business has evolved over the years, but currently it owns and operates 11 truck tractors and approximately 100 trailers. It specializes in heavy hauling using flat-bed trucking solutions. Mr. Thomas gave evidence that 90% of the company\u2019s work is construction-related and that it specializes in moving large items such as bridge beams, structural steel and cranes. While 85-90% of its business is in British Columbia, it also does business in Alberta, Washington and Oregon. Its trucking employees are unionized. At the time of the hearing, the Respondent employed 15 people, including Mr. Thomas and Mr. Freeman. In the previous year, there had been as many as 25 employees.\n[6] At the time that Mr. Moffat was hired, Davey Cartage did not do any business hauling containers to and from the various ports in Greater Vancouver. Mr. Moffat\u2019s previous employment as a dispatcher had been with a trucking company that did exclusively container hauling. Mr. Thomas gave evidence that Davey Cartage had been interested in hiring Mr. Moffat because it wanted to expand its business into container hauling and Mr. Thomas believed the Complainant could help the company do that. Mr. Moffat acknowledged that he discussed his ability to bring that type of new business to the company, but that he made no promises that he could.\n[7] Nevertheless, the employment contract between Mr. Moffat and Davey Cartage indicated his job position to be \u201cDispatcher \/ Inside Sales Agent\u201d and the latter part of the title implied there was some expectation that the Complainant would bring in new business. Mr. Moffat admitted that he had no experience in dispatching heavy haul trucks, the core business of the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s witnesses also acknowledged this point, stating they believed that Mr. Moffat would learn the required specialized knowledge on the job.\n[8] The employment contract contained a clause stating the terms upon which Davey Cartage could terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment. Depending on the length of service, the company would be obliged to either give a certain period of notice of termination or pay in lieu thereof. The Respondent\u2019s evidence was that these amounts equalled or surpassed the minimum requirements under the British Columbia Employment Standards Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 113. The Respondent also submitted redacted copies of employment contracts with its other employees to demonstrate that this was a standard clause it used in all its employment contracts.\n[9] Mr. Moffat commenced work with the Respondent on May 1, 2012. On or about July 26, 2012, the Respondent gave the Complainant an employment reference letter that was requested by Mr. Moffat in connection with the financing of his house. In addition to giving the particulars about his employment and wages, the letter stated, inter alia, that Mr. Moffat was \u201ca reliable and competent employee.\u201d\n[10] On August 1, 2012, after satisfactorily completing a three month probation period, Mr. Moffat was given a $400 per month raise. Mr. Thomas stated that if he was going to keep an employee beyond the initial three month probationary period, it was his practice to always give a pay increase to the employee at that time.\n[11] On February 16, 2013, Mr. Moffat was involved in a very serious automobile accident. This occurred in his private motor vehicle and was not related to his employment. Several people were seriously injured in the accident, including Mr. Moffat. His injuries included a concussion, and he was unable to work for almost two months.\n[12] The Respondent\u2019s employees were covered for short-term disability benefits by The Great West Life Assurance Company (\u201cGreat West Life\u201d). The Complainant filed a Notice of Claim for such benefits on February 21, 2013 and did receive disability benefits while he was recovering from the accident and unable to work. The benefits were granted retroactively to the date of the accident.\n[13] Mr. Freeman testified that before becoming the Operations Manager, he had considerable experience working as a dispatcher. When Mr. Moffat was unable to work, Mr. Freeman assumed the dispatcher responsibilities in February of 2013 and continued in this role for several months. It was during this time that Mr. Freeman had an opportunity to observe operational problems that he believed were attributable to Mr. Moffat.\n[14] In particular, after he had assumed the dispatcher responsibilities, Mr. Freeman discovered that there were five company trailers that were essentially missing because there was no paperwork to account for them. According to Mr. Freeman, the trailers were not properly tracked by Mr. Moffat and the issue may never have come to light if Mr. Freeman had not taken over the dispatcher duties. Mr. Freeman had to drive around to various job sites of their customers to try to locate the 5 trailers. When he found them, he realized they had been unaccounted for, for 3 months, and as such, Davey Cartage was required to give its customer a substantial demurrage invoice for the three month period all at once. Although the demurrage charges were eventually recovered from the customer, the incident had a negative impact on the relationship between Davey Cartage and its customer.\n[15] Further evidence was given about the loss of a major customer of Davey Cartage and the performance of Mr. Moffat that may have contributed to that loss. The customer had expressed some dissatisfaction with service before Mr. Moffat arrived at Davey Cartage. However, rather than alleviate concerns, Mr. Thomas testified that in his opinion, Mr. Moffat exacerbated the problems with the customer. This eventually led to the customer deciding to terminate its relationship with Davey Cartage shortly before Mr. Moffat had his accident. Mr. Moffat was asked to meet with his counterpart at the customer to see if he could salvage the relationship, but his accident occurred just a few days before the date of the meeting, and the meeting never happened. There was evidence that the loss of this customer led to a significant loss of monthly revenue for Davey Cartage.\n[16] Both parties also gave detailed evidence about the failure of Davey Cartage to expand its business into port container hauling after Mr. Moffat was hired. There was evidence that some efforts had been made after the hiring of Mr. Moffat, such as the licensing of vehicles and personnel for port container hauling, but that a critical reservation system had not been set up. The Respondent claimed that it was the responsibility of Mr. Moffat to set up the reservation system, but that appeared to be in dispute. Mr. Moffat suggested other reasons for the failure. Whatever the cause, it was clear that Davey Cartage was not able to engage in the port container hauling business until after Mr. Moffat\u2019s departure. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to find fault on this issue. It is sufficient for the Tribunal to observe that this was a legitimate business concern of the Respondent.\n[17] Mr. Thomas gave evidence that internal monthly financial statements were prepared about 7-10 days after each month end. He testified that when he and Mr. Freeman reviewed the financial statements for February 2013, which would have been during the first or second week of March 2013, they made the decision to terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment. The Respondent\u2019s revenues were decreasing, Mr. Moffat was a highly paid employee, and the company was having serious concerns about his performance. Mr. Thomas testified that the issue that really cemented his decision to let Mr. Moffat go was the discovery of the missing trailers. However, Davey Cartage\u2019s management decided not to communicate their decision to Mr. Moffat until he was able to return to work.\n[18] The Complainant\u2019s medical condition was monitored by Dr. R. Demian who gave periodic reports to the insurance company, Great West Life. The doctor also kept Mr. Moffat apprised of his prognosis and advised him as to when he might be able to return to work.\n[19] On March 7, 2013, Mr. Moffat sent an email to Mr. Freeman, stating: \u201cHi Keith, was at the doctor today and she said should be able to work on the Monday mar 18, if progress continue\u2019s. Will keep you posted....Mike.\u201d (As written)\n[20] Mr. Freeman gave evidence that he spoke to Mr. Moffat on the telephone after receiving the March 7, 2013 email. Mr. Freeman stated he spoke to Mr. Moffat about his health in general and advised him to call again when he was ready to return to work.\n[21] On March 14, 2013, Mr. Moffat sent another email to Mr. Freeman, which read: \u201cHi Keith, sorry but the doctor say\u2019s 2 to 3 more week\u2019s. I\u2019ll keep you posted,\u2026.Mike.\u201d (As written)\n[22] Mr. Freeman testified that after the March 14, 2013 email, he spoke to Mr. Moffat and told him to take as much time to recover as he needed, as by then Great West Life had accepted Mr. Moffat\u2019s claim and was paying him the short-term disability benefits. He also testified that he told Mr. Moffat not to return until he was fully recovered and able to resume his full responsibilities.\n[23] Dr. Demian completed an updated report to Great West Life dated April 4, 2013. The salient content of the report is the doctor\u2019s reply to Question 5, which reads: \u201cIf your patient is able to return to work in the near future, does she have any restrictions and limitations that will need to be accommodated?\u201d Dr. Demian\u2019s handwritten response appears to read: \u201cApril 8 \/ 13 \u2013 graduated RTW over 1 mo period.\u201d\n[24] Dr. Demian was not called as a witness at the hearing. However, I understand the doctor meant that Mr. Moffat was ready to return to work as of April 8, 2013, but that there should be a graduated return to work (RTW) over a one month period. In their submissions at the hearing, the parties did not offer a different interpretation of the doctor\u2019s handwritten response to Question 5 of the report.\n[25] On April 4, 2013, Mr. Moffat sent an email to Mr. Freeman, stating: \u201cHi Keith, I will be back on Monday the 8th ready to work, I will call you tomorrow (Friday) for detail\u2019s. hope everything is going well..Mike.\u201d (As written)\n[26] Mr. Freeman testified that he spoke on the telephone with Mr. Moffat after the third email, on Friday, April 5, 2013. He recalled that Mr. Moffat was excited to come back to work and when he asked the Complainant if he was ready, Mr. Moffat replied that he was. Mr. Freeman testified that Mr. Moffat gave no indication during that phone call that he was not ready to fully resume his responsibilities. Mr. Moffat also testified that he did not raise the recommendation for a graduated return to work with Mr. Freeman during this telephone conversation.\n[27] When Mr. Moffat returned to work on Monday, April 8, 2013, he was immediately handed a letter of termination and a cheque. The letter indicated that his employment was being terminated pursuant to the termination clause in his contract. The cheque represented the following amounts:\na) the 2 weeks\u2019 pay in lieu of notice as required under the employment contract;\nb) 2 days\u2019 wages for February 18, 2013 and April 8, 2013;\nc) 3 days\u2019 wages for 3 unused vacation days; and\nd) a gratuitous payment equal to 5 days\u2019 wages described in the termination letter as \u201cpayment to assist you in your transition to new employment\u2026\u201d\n[28] Mr. Thomas testified that the 5 days\u2019 wages were not paid out of any obligation, but because they wanted to help Mr. Moffat with a new transition and to avoid any \u201chard feelings\u201d between the parties.\n[29] There is some dispute about whether or not the Complainant, on April 8, 2013, was aware of Dr. Demian\u2019s report with the recommendation of a graduated return to work over a one month period. The report was from Dr. Demian to Great West Life. Mr. Moffat testified that he had the report in his possession when he returned to work on April 8, 2013. However, under cross-examination, he was unable to recall how he came to receive the report which had been signed just four days earlier. Mr. Moffat also acknowledged that he did not mention the report nor give a copy to the Respondent when he showed up for work on April 8, 2013. He also acknowledged that at no time did he mention he was under any restrictions for his return to work.\n[30] Mr. Thomas testified that the first time the Respondent became aware of Dr. Demian\u2019s report dated April 4, 2013 was not until August of 2014, when it accompanied the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars in this proceeding.\n[31] Respondent counsel suggested in his argument that Mr. Moffat may not have recalled the facts accurately and that perhaps he did not have in his possession a copy of the doctor\u2019s report just four days after it was written. I have some doubt about whether Mr. Moffat had Dr. Demian\u2019s report when he showed up for work on April 8, 2013. He was unable to explain how he had come to possess the report so shortly after it was written, and unable to explain why he never raised the contents of the report with his employer. Nevertheless, I am not convinced much turns on this point. I find on the evidence before me that on the date of termination, the employer was unaware there were any restrictions on Mr. Moffat\u2019s ability to return to work and, indeed, Mr. Moffat led the Respondent to believe there were none.\nIV. Law\n[32] The Complaint cites section 7 of the CHRA as the discriminatory practice that the Respondent engaged in, on the basis of Mr. Moffat\u2019s disability. This section reads as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[33] According to section 3 of the CHRA, disability is a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nV. Jurisprudence\n[34] A prima facie case is \u201cone which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558). Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he is entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the employer (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S .C.R. 202, at p. 208; Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18).\n[35] In order to make out a prima facie case under s. 7(a) of the CHRA, a complainant must establish that:\n(i) the respondent refused to employ or continue to employ an individual; and\n(ii) there is a connection between\u2014on the one hand\u2014the refusal to employ or continue to employ that individual\u2014and on the other\u2014a prohibited ground of discrimination enumerated in s. 3 of the CHRA (See Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39, at para. 52).\n[36] In this last regard, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be a factor in the employer\u2019s actions or decisions (Ibid; Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.)).\n[37] Although the original Complaint to the Commission indicated discrimination under section 7 of the CHRA, Mr. Moffat did not lead evidence suggesting, nor did he present arguments alleging, discrimination under section 7(b) (adverse differentiation in the course of employment). Therefore, this decision is only examining allegations under section 7(a) of the CHRA.\n[38] A respondent can either present evidence to refute the allegation of prima facie discrimination, put forward a defence justifying the discrimination, or do both (Bombardier, supra, para. 64). Where the respondent refutes the allegation, its explanation must be reasonable. It cannot be a pretext to conceal discrimination (Khiamal v. Canada, 2009 FC 495, at para. 58).\n[39] The jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, \u201c[d]iscrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised.\u201d Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d (Khiamal, supra, at para. 59). That said, \u201c[e]vidence of discrimination, even if it is circumstantial, must nonetheless be tangibly related to the impugned decision or conduct\u201d (Bombardier, supra, at para. 88).\nVI. Issues\n[40] There are two issues to be determined:\nTo what extent does the Complainant\u2019sevidence support a prima facie case of discrimination, within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the CHRA?\nHas the Respondent refuted the allegation of prima facie discrimination by providing a reasonable explanation for its conduct that is not a pretext for discrimination?\nVII. Analysis\nA. Issue #1 - To what extent does the Complainant\u2019s evidence support a prima facie case of discrimination?\n[41] I have found that Mr. Moffat\u2019s evidence goes some distance towards a prima facie case. Without taking into account the Respondent\u2019s answer, the evidence appears to support the allegations in the Complaint: Mr. Moffat was indeed sidelined from his work by a disability at the time his employer decided to terminate his employment. At the time Mr. Moffat\u2019s termination letter was delivered to him, Dr. Demian had given the advice that he return to work gradually over a one month period. However, I must also consider whether the Respondent has refuted the prima facie allegation of discrimination.\nB. Issue #2 - Has the Respondent refuted the allegation of prima facie discrimination?\n[42] The question here is whether the Respondent has provided a reasonable, non-pretextual explanation for its conduct. Was the conduct of the Respondent, in its decision to terminate Mr. Moffat, influenced by his disability? In my view, it was not. The Respondent not only provided credible reasons for the termination that did not present characteristics of a pretext for discrimination, but moreover, the evidence as a whole established that its decision to terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment was in no way influenced by his disability.\n[43] The Respondent\u2019s witnesses were very frank in their admission that they had decided to terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment some weeks prior to his return to work. They gave several specific reasons for their decision that were not related to Mr. Moffat\u2019s disability.\n[44] Throughout the hearing, Mr. Moffat defended his job performance and took exception to the blame that was attributed to him. In cross-examination, Mr. Moffat put into question the financial and management decisions of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Freeman. In essence, he was attempting to demonstrate the shortcomings of the business decisions of the Respondent.\n[45] Unless there is evidence that a discriminatory ground was a factor, directly or indirectly, it is not the role of the Tribunal to second-guess the business decisions of company management which, with the benefit of hindsight, may be easy to criticize. The role of the Tribunal is to examine all of the considerations leading up to the impugned decision. In so doing, the Tribunal will ask itself whether the explanation proffered in support of the decision was reasonable in that context, but only so far as is necessary to determine whether the explanation given in support of the decision was not simply a pretext for discriminatory considerations (See Morin v. Canada, 2005 CHRT 41, at para. 219; Durrer v. CIB, 2007 CHRT 6, at para. 63, aff\u2019d on other grounds in 2008 FCA 384).\n[46] In its defense of its business decision to terminate Mr. Moffat, the Respondent also presented evidence to show that its gross revenues were greatly diminished in the early months of 2013. These statements were presented to demonstrate the impact of the loss of a major customer, for which Davey Cartage apportioned some blame to Mr. Moffat, and to show that continuing to employ him was becoming more unaffordable. In this regard, the Respondent also presented evidence to show that Mr. Moffat was the highest paid dispatcher the company had ever employed.\n[47] The Tribunal\u2019s role in examining the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, a termination of employment is to determine if there exists, as described in the Basi case, a \u201csubtle scent of discrimination.\u201d In the present case, I did not find any such scent. Whether in hindsight its business decisions were good ones or not, I am satisfied the Respondent made the decision to terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment without having any regard to the disability that had sidelined him for the previous two months. The Respondent\u2019s decision was premised on the belief that he was fully recovered and able to resume his full work responsibilities. The performance problems that were considered and discovered during his absence were not in any way connected to his disability. I therefore find that the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate Mr. Moffat\u2019s employment was not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[48] Certainly one can empathize with Mr. Moffat for the shock he must have experienced after finally returning to work after his accident, only to find out he had lost his job. However, in all the circumstances of this case, the manner of his dismissal cannot support a finding of discrimination.\n[49] In closing arguments, Mr. Moffat suggested there was a positive onus on his employer to make inquiries as to his medical fitness at the time he returned to work. He suggested that his employer should have asked for a medical report from his doctor or Great West Life. I am satisfied on the evidence that Davey Cartage did make such inquiry to Mr. Moffat directly, and that Mr. Moffat gave no indication that he was under any restrictions due to disability. In the circumstances of this case, and in light of Mr. Moffat\u2019s assurances that he was fully recovered and able to resume his full responsibilities, I do not find there was thereafter a positive duty on the Respondent to make inquiries to third parties.\n[50] This Tribunal has previously determined there is no further duty for an employer to inform itself when the employer does not in good faith have any knowledge of the disability:\n\u201c[42] However, in the present case, the Complainant, by his own admission, deliberately and successfully misled his supervising directors into sincerely believing that he was not an alcoholic. Although an employer has a duty to inform itself about an employee\u2019s disability and how the person can be accommodated, it seems only logical and fair that this duty should not be extended to situations where the employer does not in good faith have any knowledge whatsoever of the employee\u2019s disability.\u201d\n(Benoit v. Bell Canada (Quebec, 2004 CHRT 32, aff\u2019d 2005 FC 926)\n[51] Admittedly, the respondent-employer in the present case cannot claim to have had no knowledge whatsoever of Mr. Moffat\u2019s disability. Davey Cartage knew he had been injured; however, it believed Mr. Moffat\u2019s disability was temporary and no longer impacted his employment. Either Mr. Moffat himself was not aware of his own doctor\u2019s return to work recommendation at the time of the termination, or he simply chose not to disclose it to his employer. In any event, I am satisfied on the evidence that Mr. Moffat confirmed to his employer he was ready to return to work without restriction, and that Davey Cartage was not aware of the graduated return to work recommendation until more than a year later, when Dr. Demian\u2019s report was released to the Respondent as part of the disclosure process for this hearing.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[52] As noted above, one must consider all the circumstances to determine if there is a \u201csubtle scent of discrimination.\u201d Based on the evidence, it is clear the Respondent decided to terminate the Complainant\u2019s employment for reasons entirely unrelated to his disability. Although some of the evidence suggested a prima facie case of discrimination insofar as the termination fell closely after Mr. Moffat\u2019s automobile accident, the Respondent has successfully refuted this suggestion by demonstrating that his disability was not a factor in its decision.\n[53] I am satisfied on the evidence that the Respondent intended to wait until the Complainant had fully recovered from his injuries before terminating his employment. Davey Cartage\u2019s reasons for this termination were adequately explained and did not relate to his disability. In my view, these reasons provide a reasonable explanation for the termination and are not a pretext for discriminatory behaviour. I have found no evidence of any ulterior discriminatory considerations.\n[54] It is settled law that the burden of proof in the human rights context is the same as in the civil context: he or she who alleges bears the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities (Canada (Social Development) v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2011 FCA 202, at para. 16; Bombardier, supra, at para. 65). Where the respondent does not seek to rely on a statutory defence, the burden of proof remains with the complainant to demonstrate that the respondent\u2019s evidence is false or merely a pretext for discrimination (Wilson v. CBSA, 2015 CHRT 11, at para 22). The Complainant in the present case has not satisfied that onus.\n[55] As I have found that it is not substantiated, the Tribunal dismisses the Complaint.\nSigned by\nDavid L.

Complaint & Motion [1] Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook First Nation has refused to consider her as a captain for its fishery because she is a woman. According to her this decision is part of a larger practice on the part of the First Nation to exclude women from participating in its fishery. Ms. Tabor also claims her exclusion from captaining a boat is based on her marital status, because Millbrook First Nation previously had issues with her husband when he was a captain. Ms. Tabor alleges Millbrook\u2019s actions are discriminatory practices pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act [the CHRA].\n[2] Following the filing of her complaint, Ms. Tabor also contends Millbrook First Nation retaliated against her pursuant to section 14.1 of the CHRA. Among various allegations, she claims it delayed issuing a possession certificate, and subsequently took improper action against her and her family, with regard to her late father\u2019s residence on Millbrook First Nation.\n[3] Prior to the hearing of Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaints, Millbrook First Nation filed a motion challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to deal with those complaints.\n[4] Millbrook claims section 67 of the CHRA is applicable in the circumstances of this case:\n67. Nothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\nIt submits sections 61(1), 73(1)(a) and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act shield its decision vis-a-vis the fishery from scrutiny under the CHRA. It also claims section 20(1) of the Indian Act applies to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegation of retaliation regarding the possession certificate for her late father\u2019s residence.\n[5] In addition, Millbrook\u2019s motion argues that section 18(1) of the Indian Act confirms Aboriginal treaty rights, such as commercial fishing; and, section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 confirms an inherent Aboriginal right to self-governance with respect to those rights. As such, Millbrook claims decisions regarding the management of its fishing resources, including personnel choices, are also excluded from the application of the CHRA.\n[6] Ms. Tabor opposes Millbrook\u2019s motion. In her view, section 67 is a narrow exception to the application of the CHRA and, as such, there must be explicit authority under the Indian Act for its application. Ms. Tabor submits there is no such authorization under the Indian Act for the actions giving rise to her complaints.\n[7] Although the Commission did not participate in arguing the merits of Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaints, it provided submissions on Millbrook\u2019s motion in order to represent the public interest in the apppropriate interpretation and application of section 67 of the CHRA. It agrees with Ms. Tabor that section 67 is a narrow exception to the application of the CHRA and that there is no authorization under the Indian Act for the actions giving rise to her complaints. Furthermore, with regard to section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, the Commission submits Millbrook has not established that the actions or decision in issue constitute an Aboriginal and\/or treaty right, let alone that those rights have been infringed in any way.\n[8] In advance of the hearing, I ruled there was insufficient information to make a determination on the motion. In order to properly rule on the motion, I thought it important to hear evidence on the issues raised in the motion and the merits of the complaint as a whole. I informed the parties that I would render a ruling on the motion following the hearing of this matter (see Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2014 CHRT 21).\n[9] Having now heard evidence and argument on Millbrook\u2019s motion, I dismiss it for the following reasons.\nII. Analysis A. Section 67 of the CHRA (i) Interpretation [10] As an exception to the CHRA, section 67 has been interpreted narrowly (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band Council, 2000 CanLII 17153 (FCA) at para. 22 [Laslo]; and, Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 SCR 321 (QL), at para. 18). It does not shield all decisions made by a First Nation that might have some connection to the Indian Act (Shubenacadie Indian Band v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1998] 2 F.C. 198 (QL) at para. 31). Rather, it immunizes decisions that are an exercise of authority expressly granted by a provision of the Indian Act from scrutiny under the CHRA (see Laslo at para. 26).\n(ii) Nature of the complaints [11] Before getting into the provisions of the Indian Act relied upon by Millbrook, I note the nature of the allegations raised in this complaint are much broader than the decision to choose another candidate over Ms. Tabor for a captain\u2019s role. While Millbrook attempted to limit the scope of the complaint at the hearing to a 2008 decision to choose another candidate over Ms. Tabor for a captain\u2019s job, I find no basis for doing so.\n[12] The entire complaint, including the 2008 captain\u2019s decision, was referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. Millbrook did not judicially review the Commission\u2019s decision. Pursuant to section 10 of the CHRA, Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint also alleges a systemic practice of denying employment opportunities to women in the Millbrook First Nation fishery (see the Complaint Form at paras. 9-12, 14-17 and 19-20). No provisions of the Indian Act were raised to address this larger context of the complaint, only the 2008 captain\u2019s decision.\n[13] Also, Millbrook argues the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide Ms. Tabor\u2019s retaliation complaint is ousted by a finding that it does not have jurisdiction over the principal complaint. In the Commission\u2019s view, whether or not Ms. Tabor\u2019s employment complaint is shielded from scrutiny by section 67 of the CHRA, the retaliation allegations have an independent status.\n[14] Retaliation under section 14.1 of the CHRA is an independent discriminatory practice, separate and apart from the complaint that gives rise to the alleged retaliation (see Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), 2001 CanLII 6296 (CHRT) at para. 233; Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 2001 CanLII 8492 (CHRT) at para. 292; and, Gainer v. Export Development Canada, 2006 FC 814 at para. 36).\n[15] The wording of section 14.1 explicitly states that retaliation is a discriminatory practice (\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice\u2026\u201d); and, section 4 of the CHRA specifies that a discriminatory practice, \u201c\u2026as described in sections 5 to 14.1\u2026\u201d, can be the subject of a complaint (see also s. 40(1) of the CHRA) and an order (see also s. 53(2) of the CHRA). Furthermore, a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d is defined at section 39 of the CHRA as \u201c\u2026any practice that is a discriminatory practice within the meaning of sections 5 to 14.1\u201d.\n[16] Nothing in the CHRA binds a retaliation complaint to the jurisdiction or substantiation of the complaint giving rise to the allegations of retaliation. Therefore, even if the provisions of the Indian Act submitted by Millbrook were to affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the main complaint, this does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the retaliation complaints.\n(iii) Timing of the complaints [17] Section 67 was repealed on June 18, 2008, by section 1 of An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 2008, c. 30. Millbrook claims that during the grace period set out in section 3 of An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act it benefited from an exception equal to, if not broader than, the exception created under section 67:\n3. Despite section 1, an act or omission by any First Nation government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs or services under the Indian Act, that was made in the exercise of powers or the performance of duties and functions conferred or imposed by or under that Act shall not constitute the basis for a complaint under Part III of the Canadian Human Rights Act if it occurs within 36 months after the day on which this Act receives royal assent.\n[18] In Millbrook's view, section 3 of An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act potentiality exempted all acts or decisions made by a First Nation operating any program or service pursuant to the Indian Act from liability under the CHRA.\n[19] Ms. Tabor filed her complaint on May 21, 2008 and alleges discriminatory practices under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA that occurred prior to this date. Seeing as these events occurred before the repeal of section 67 on June 18, 2008, section 3 of An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act was not in force and is not applicable to the allegations under sections 7 and 10 in this case. As specified in section 3, it applies to the 36 months after the day on which An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act received royal assent.\n[20] That said, the allegations of retaliation regarding the possession certificate for Ms. Tabor\u2019s late father\u2019s residence fall within the 36 month grace period. However, I do not interpret section 3 of An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act as creating an exception broader than the exception under section 67. While more detailed than section 67, section 3 still requires that the act or omission of the First Nation government be made in \u201c...the exercise of powers or the performance of duties and functions conferred or imposed by or under [the Indian Act]\u201d. This remains consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s previous jurisprudence that interpreted and applied section 67. That is, there must still be an exercise of authority expressly granted by a provision of the Indian Act to avoid scrutiny under the CHRA.\n(iv) Section 61(1) of the Indian Act [21] I now turn to the provisions of the Indian Act relied upon by Millbrook. As stated above, Millbrook claims it exercised authority granted under sections 61(1), 73(1)(a), and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act in its decision to hire a fishing boat captain in this case. However, in my view, Millbrook\u2019s hiring decision was not an exercise of authority under these provisions.\n[22] Beginning first with section 61(1) of the Indian Act, it provides:\n61. (1) Indian moneys shall be expended only for the benefit of the Indians or bands for whose use and benefit in common the moneys are received or held, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which Indian moneys are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.\n[23] I fail to see how section 61(1) is relevant to hiring a fishing boat captain. Section 61(1) deals with the expenditure of money. It does not authorize, expressly or by implication, the hiring of a fishing boat captain or hiring within the Millbrook fishery generally. While every staffing decision involves the control, management or expenditure of money, this alone does not bring it beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The consequence would be that any First Nation staffing decision would be beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which goes well beyond a narrow interpretation of section 67 (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2003 CHRT 41 at para. 30 [Bressette]).\n[24] Millbrook\u2019s argument under section 61(1) of the Indian Act also points out that the section is subject to treaty rights (\u201c\u2026and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender\u2026\u201d). As mentioned above, it also claims section 18(1) of the Indian Act confirms Aboriginal treaty rights, such as commercial fishing; and, section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 confirms an inherent Aboriginal right to self-governance with respect to those rights. Therefore, it argues the reference to treaty rights in section 61(1) of the Indian Act also immunizes decisions related to spending for hiring in its fishery.\n[25] To the extent Millbrook\u2019s argument tries to assert a treaty right in relation to section 61(1) of the Indian Act and, consequently, that its decision regarding Ms. Tabor was an exercise of authority expressly granted by the Indian Act for the purposes of section 67 of the CHRA, I dismiss this argument for the same reasons as stated below at paragraph 66 of this ruling. In sum, a treaty right to manage fishing resources, including personnel choices, was not established before me.\n(v) Sections 73(1)(a) and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act [26] Sections 73(1)(a) and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act state:\n73. (1) The Governor in Council may make regulations\n(a) for the protection and preservation of fur-bearing animals, fish and other game on reserves;\n[\u2026]\n81. (1) The council of a band may make by-laws not inconsistent with this Act or with any regulation made by the Governor in Council or the Minister, for any or all of the following purposes, namely,\n(o) the preservation, protection and management of fur-bearing animals, fish and other game on the reserve;\n[27] Millbrook concedes the CHRA would apply to the hiring decision of a boat captain as it pertains to the control and navigation of a boat, as there is no authority under the Indian Act providing for waterway navigation. However, the captain does not simply steer the boat; he or she manages the catch and is the conservation officer on the water, exercising the express authority and corresponding discretion as provided by sections 73(1) and 81(1) of the Indian Act. Therefore, Millbrook argues the Tribunal should consider the function of the captain\u2019s position in question and determine if that function derives, in whole or in part, from authority under the Indian Act.\n[28] At the hearing of this matter, Mr. Allan Tobey, a fisheries training consultant and technical advisor on training and marine safety to the Canadian fishing industry, was qualified as an expert to give evidence on a list of specific items agreed upon by the parties regarding a lobster captain\u2019s role in stock management and conservation, amongst other things. In sum, he testified about the use of appropriately sized lobster traps to avoid \u201cghost fishing\u201d. That is, traps equipped with a minimum amount and size of escape mechanisms that allow for small lobsters to escape and for other lobsters to break free should the trap be lost at sea. He also spoke about the need, at the beginning of the lobster season, to avoid fishing female lobsters, especially those bearing eggs. If caught, those lobsters are to be returned, carefully, back to the sea to avoid stress and\/or death. Mr. Tobey also testified about a captain\u2019s need to know the quota of fish and\/or lobster they can fish per license, along with the sizes and types of species of marine life that cannot be fished, called bycatch, and which must be released upon capture. According to Mr. Tobey, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulates these conservation requirements.\n[29] While I accept Mr. Tobey\u2019s evidence regarding a fishing boat captain\u2019s role in conservation, I do not accept that conservation, or sections 73(1)(a) and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act, were the predominant purpose behind Millbrook\u2019s decision to hire a fishing boat captain, whether it be Ms. Tabor or otherwise. Along with conservation, the testimony of Mr. and Ms. Tabor, Mr. Alex Cope and Mr. Adrian Gloade all indicated that fishing boat captains have various other responsibilities aside from conservation, including navigating the boat, maintaining the boat and its fishing gear in good repair, and managing the crew. In choosing one candidate over another for the captain\u2019s role, the evidence did not leave me with the impression that any of these requirements took precedence over another; or, that Millbrook\u2019s decision was predominantly based on the preservation, protection and management of fish.\n[30] In Bressette, the Tribunal had to make a similar finding regarding the \u201cpredominant purpose\u201d behind a First Nation\u2019s decision to staff a Family Caseworker position:\n[27] In my view, the decision of the respondent involves both a staffing aspect and a financial aspect. But, in my opinion, the predominant purpose behind the decision of the Band Council was to staff the Family Caseworker position. The fact that a small financial benefit resulted does not detract from this conclusion.\n[31] Likewise, in this case, the decision to hire a fishing boat captain involves a conservation aspect, along with a navigation, maintenance and management aspect. The predominant purpose behind Millbrook\u2019s hiring decision was to staff a fishing boat captain with all these qualifications. While conservation may have been one consideration for Millbrook\u2019s hiring decision, it was not the only consideration, nor did the evidence indicate it was the predominant consideration. Therefore, upon my review of the evidence, I fail to see how sections 73(1)(a) and 81(1)(o) of the Indian Act authorized Millbrook\u2019s decision to hire a fishing boat captain in this case.\n[32] As a result, there is no provision of the Indian Act that expressly or by implication authorizes Millbrook\u2019s hiring decisions in this case. This conclusion is similar to those of the Tribunal in other hiring\/staffing cases where section 67 was raised (see for example Bressette; Deschambeault v. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 CHRT 48; Bernard v. Waycobah Board of Education, 1999 CanLII 1914 (CHRT); and, Desjarlais v. Piapot Band No. 75, [1989] 3 FC 605 (C.A.) (QL)).\n(vi) Section 20(1) of the Indian Act [33] Millbrook also claims section 20(1) of the Indian Act applies to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegation of retaliation regarding the possession certificate for her late father\u2019s residence.\n[34] Section 20(1) provides:\n20. (1) No Indian is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve unless, with the approval of the Minister, possession of the land has been allotted to him by the council of the band.\n[35] Ms. Tabor\u2019s claim is that, when her father died, he asked Millbrook that his home be held in trust by Ms. Tabor for his eldest grandson, Ms. Tabor\u2019s son, until he came of age. Millbrook agreed to the request and made an arrangement with Ms. Tabor whereby it would give her a certificate of possession under which she would hold the property in trust for her son. Until her son came of age, Ms. Tabor was to rent out the house and place the money in a trust fund for him. Implicit in this agreement was that Ms. Tabor would only rent out the home to rent-paying members of Millbrook First Nation; otherwise, she would not receive any rent to put in trust.\n[36] Millbrook did not issue a certificate of possession for the property for approximately two years. However, Ms. Tabor allowed some members of Millbrook, who were on social assistance, to live in the house in the meantime. These occupants did not have a set rent and only paid what they could. Given that social assistance recipients receive a housing allowance, Millbrook required Ms. Tabor to pay back portions of those tenants\u2019 social assistance benefits. Also, prior to the certificate of possession being issued, Millbrook required Ms. Tabor to maintain the yard of the property.\n[37] Ms. Tabor claims she was not responsible for rentals or maintenance at the property until the certificate of possession was issued. By requiring her to pay back social assistance benefits, maintain the yard and, in the meantime, delaying issuance of the certificate of possession, Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook retaliated against her.\n[38] Section 20(1) of the Indian Act grants a First Nation authority over housing allocation decisions (Laslo at para. 27). However, the allegations of retaliation made by Ms. Tabor in relation to her late father\u2019s home do not challenge Millbrook\u2019s authority to grant or refuse housing. There seems to be no dispute that Ms. Tabor was, or was to be given, possession of the home. In any event, it is clear that she made use of the home despite there being no official certificate of possession. Millbrook did not take issue with Ms. Tabor\u2019s use of the home, except where doing so, in their view, violated their agreement with her.\n[39] While the delay in issuing the certificate of possession could arguably fall under section 20(1), in my view, this is not the crux of Ms. Tabor\u2019s retaliation allegation here. Rather, it is the rent and maintenance issues that arose before the issuance of the certificate that cause concern for Ms. Tabor. These actions do not involve the grant or refusal of housing under section 20(1) of the Indian Act. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with these allegations.\nB. Sections 18(1) of the Indian Act and 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 [40] As mentioned above, Millbrook\u2019s motion also claims that a decision about managing its fishing resources, including personnel choices, is a constitutionally protected Aboriginal or treaty right under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. It claims section 18(1) of the Indian Act confirms Aboriginal treaty rights, such as commercial fishing; and, section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 confirms an inherent Aboriginal right to self-governance with respect to those rights. Therefore, according to Millbrook, decisions regarding those rights are excluded from the application of the CHRA.\n[41] Section 18(1) of the Indian Act states (emphasis added):\n18. (1) Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.\n[42] Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides:\n35. (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.\n[43] In support of its argument that managing its fishing resources, including personnel choices, emanates from a constitutionally protected Aboriginal or treaty right, Millbrook relies on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in R. v. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 665 (SCC) [Marshall 1]. Ironically, that decision deals with Ms. Tabor\u2019s uncle. In that case, Mr. Marshall was charged with three offences under federal fishery regulations: the selling of eels without a licence; fishing without a licence; and, fishing during the closed season with illegal nets. Mr. Marshall argued he possessed treaty rights to catch and sell fish that exempted him from compliance with the regulations.\n[44] The treaties in issue in that case were negotiated between the British and Mi\u2019kmaq following much militray and political turmoil between the parties. In 1760-1761, when the treaties were negotiated, there was motivation for reconciliation between the parties and a mutual interest in establishing stable peace (see Marshall 1 at paras. 3 and 17). Treaties were entrered into whereby the Mi\u2019kmaq could bring the products of their hunting, fishing and gathering to a truckhouse to trade.\n[45] The Supreme Court confirmed that these Mi\u2019kmaq treaty rights were protected by section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 (see Marshall 1 at paras. 7 and 48). In interpreting the trade arrangement in modern times, in a manner which gave meaning and substance to the promises made by the Crown, the Supreme Court found the treaty rights provided for the ability to obtain a moderate livelihood through hunting and fishing by trading the products of those traditional activities (see Marshall 1 at paras. 52, 56, and 59). According to the Supreme Court, a moderate livelihood includes such basics as food, clothing, housing and a few amentities, but not the accumulation of wealth which would exceed a sustenance lifestyle (Marshall 1 at paras. 59-60).\n[46] The Supreme Court determined Mr. Marshall was entitled to an acquittal, because \u201cnothing less would uphold the honour and integrity of the Crown in its dealings with the Mi\u2019kmaq people\u2026\u201d (Marshall 1 at para. 4). It found the imposition of a discretionary licensing system interfered with Mr. Marshall\u2019s treaty right to fish for trading purposes; and, the ban on sales infringed on his right to trade for sustenance. As these rights were exercisable only at the absolute discretion of the Crown, there was a prima facie infringement of the treaty rights and the regulations were inoperative against Mr. Marshall unless justified. With regard to the charge for fishing during the closed season, the Supreme Court found another prima facie infringement of the treaty rights because there could be no limitation on the method, timing and extent of a treaty right to fish apart from a treaty limitation to that effect (see Marshall 1 at paras. 64-66).\n[47] Millbrook also relies on the decision in R. v. Simon, 1985 CanLII 11 (SCC) [Simon]. In that case, Mr. Simon, a Mi\u2019kmaq person, was convicted under section 150(1) of Nova Scotia's Lands and Forests Act for possession of a rifle and shotgun cartridges. Pursuant to the terms of a 1752 treaty, Mr. Simon argued he had a right to hunt, and in combination with section 88 of the Indian Act, this provided him with immunity from prosecution under the provincial act. Article 4 of the 1752 treaty stated that \u201cthe Tribe of Mick Mack Indians Inhabiting the Eastern Coast of the said Province\u201d have \"free liberty of Hunting & Fishing as usual\"; and, section 88 of the Indian Act states that provincial laws of general application apply to Indians, subject to the terms of any treaty (see Simon at paras. 2-6).\n[48] The Supreme Court determined the 1752 treaty continued to be in force and effect and to constitute a positive source of protection against infringements on hunting rights (see Simon at paras. 26 and 36). Mr. Simon was covered by the treaty because he was a Mi\u2019kmaq person living in the same area as the original Mi\u2019kmaq community which was a party to the treaty (see Simon at paras. 42-45). The Supreme Court found Mr. Simon\u2019s possession of a rifle and ammunition was referable to his treaty right to hunt. Therefore, section 88 of the Indian Act operated to exempt him from provincial legislation restricting or contravening the terms of the 1752 treaty and his convinction was quashed (see Simon at para. 62). Given section 88 of the Indian Act covered Mr. Simon\u2019s situation, the Supreme Court did not find it necessary to consider section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 (see Simon at para. 66).\n[49] I recognize the importance of protecting Aboriginal and treaty rights in our society and their significance to Aboriginal peoples. The significance and protection for these rights is affirmed in section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Aboriginal and treaty rights are important collective rights that deserve to be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. Any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the Aboriginal group claiming the right. However, in most cases, argument and evidence, pursuant to established case law, is required to establish an Aboriginal or treaty right. To claim, based on Marshall 1 or Simon, that a decision about managing fishing resources, including personnel choices, is a constitutionally protected Aboriginal or treaty right under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 is not sufficient.\n[50] First, it was incumbent upon Millbrook to actually establish the Aboriginal or treaty rights it claims are applicable in this case. A treaty right to manage fishing resources was not established before me. There was insufficient evidence and argument made to establish that the right to manage fishing resources, including personnel choices, was contemplated by the treaties examined in Marshall 1 or Simon; or, that it is a logical evolution of any of those treaty rights. In fact, no specific treaty terms were put in evidence before me. As the Supreme Court stated in R. v. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 666 (SCC) [Marshall 2] at paragraph 20 (emphasis added):\nThe September 17, 1999 majority judgment did not rule that the appellant had established a treaty right \u201cto gather\u201d anything and everything physically capable of being gathered. The issues were much narrower and the ruling was much narrower. No evidence was drawn to our attention, nor was any argument made in the course of this appeal, that trade in logging or minerals, or the exploitation of off-shore natural gas deposits, was in the contemplation of either or both parties to the 1760 treaty; nor was the argument made that exploitation of such resources could be considered a logical evolution of treaty rights to fish and wildlife or to the type of things traditionally \u201cgathered\u201d by the Mi\u2019kmaq in a 1760 aboriginal lifestyle. It is of course open to native communities to assert broader treaty rights in that regard, but if so, the basis for such a claim will have to be established in proceedings where the issue is squarely raised on proper historical evidence, as was done in this case in relation to fish and wildlife.\n[51] Millbrook also states it has an inherent right of self-governance. I recognize that self-governance is of paramount importance for Aboriginal peoples. In fact, self-determination is recognized in the Annex and Article 4 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, GA Res. 61\/295, UN GAOR, 61st Sess, Supp No 49 Vol III, UN Doc A\/61\/49 (2007) [UN Declaration] (which Canada endorsed on November 12, 2010). That said, the UN Declaration was not argued before me .\n[52] Furthermore, I note the practices, customs and traditions which constitute Aboriginal rights are those which have continuity with the practices, customs and traditions that existed prior to contact with European society (see R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 SCR 507). To establish the Aboriginal right, there must be some evidence of the existence of a pre-contact practice, tradition or custom, and that this was integral to the distinctive pre-contact Aboriginal society (see Lax Kw'alaams Indian Band v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 56 at para. 46). With specific regard to an asserted right to self-government, the Supreme Court stated in R. v. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 SCR 821 at paragraph 27:\nAboriginal rights, including any asserted right to self-government, must be looked at in light of the specific circumstances of each case and, in particular, in light of the specific history and culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right.\n[53] This exemplifies that a principle as significant as a right to self-governance should not be analyzed summarily, based solely on a statement of its existence. A more in depth analysis needs to take place, with evidence and argument to support it. This type of evidence and argument was also lacking on Millbrook\u2019s part.\n[54] Second, even if Millbrook has an Aboriginal or treaty right to manage its fishing resources, including personnel choices, that does not necessarily shield all actions related to Millbrook\u2019s fishery from regulation under the law, including under the CHRA. An infringement of the right must first be established. The test for infringement under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 was set out in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 SCR 1075 at page 1112 [Sparrow]:\nTo determine whether the fishing rights have been interfered with such as to constitute a prima facie infringement of s. 35(1), certain questions must be asked. First, is the limitation unreasonable? Second, does the regulation impose undue hardship? Third, does the regulation deny to the holders of the right their preferred means of exercising that right? The onus of proving a prima facie infringement lies on the individual or group challenging the legislation.\n[55] The same test applies to determine whether an aboriginal or a treaty right has been infringed. The wording of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 supports a common approach to infringements of Aboriginal and treaty rights (see R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 SCR 771 at para. 79 [Badger]).\n[56] In raising the application of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 to the circumstances of this case, Millbrook had the onus of establishing an infringement to any of its Aboriginal or treaty rights pursuant to the Sparrow test. Insufficient evidence was brought forward to demonstrate interference with an Aboriginal or treaty right. In this regard, I also note section 35(4) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides \u201caboriginal and treaty rights [\u2026] are guaranteed equally to male and female persons\u201d (emphasis added).\n[57] Third, if a prima facie infringement is found, the analysis moves to the issue of justification. The test for justification asks whether there is a valid legislative objective for the infringement; examines the special trust relationship and the responsibility of the government vis-\u00e0-vis Aboriginal peoples; and, asks such further questions as may arise in the particular circumstances of the case. Given recognition and affirmation requires sensitivity to and respect for the rights of Aboriginal peoples, these further questions may include whether there has been as little infringement as possible; fair compensation provided; and\/or, whether Aboriginal people were consulted (see Sparrow at pp. 1113-1119; and, Badger at para. 97).\n[58] In Marshall 2, the Supreme Court affirmed the government\u2019s general regulatory power over the exercise of treaty rights, subject to justification for valid objectives. In the context of the 1760-1761 treaties, the Supreme Court stated that valid regulatory objectives could include conservation, economic and regional fairness, and recognition of the historical reliance upon, and participation in, the fishery by non-aboriginal groups.\n[59] Even if Millbrook had succeeded in establishing an Aboriginal or treaty right and an infringement of that right, the Crown was not put on notice that section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 was at issue in this case or that it could potentially have to provide a justification for the application of the CHRA to the circumstances of this case. A notice of constitutional question, pursuant to Rule 9(7) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), was not served.\n[60] The government\u2019s justification to an alleged infringement in this case would have been important given the characterization of the Aboriginal and treaty rights by Millbrook seem to be different than the rights confirmed in Marshall 1. As the Supreme Court stated in Marshall 2 at paragraph 22: \u201cThe factual context, as this case shows, is of great importance, and the merits of the government\u2019s justification may vary from resource to resource, species to species, community to community and time to time\u201d. The government\u2019s potential justification in this case was not contemplated by Millbrook.\n[61] Therefore, in my view, Millbrook did not seriously consider the application of Aboriginal and\/or treaty rights, nor section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, to the circumstances of this case. If it had, it would have brought sufficient evidence to establish the alleged Aboriginal or treaty rights it claims are applicable in this case; that those rights have been infringed; and, would have served a notice of constitutional question to allow the Crown to provide submissions on the issue. As that was not the case here, I dismiss Millbrook\u2019s argument under section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[62] To the extent Millbrook\u2019s argument also tries to assert a treaty right in relation to section 18(1) of the Indian Act and, consequently, that its decision regarding Ms. Tabor was an exercise of authority expressly granted by the Indian Act for the purposes of section 67 of the CHRA, I dismiss this argument as well.\n[63] Section 18(1) is in a part of the Indian Act entitled \u201cRESERVES\u201d. It has been held to constitute a statutory acknowledgement of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary obligation to First Nation groups with respect to the uses to which reserve land may be put (see Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 SCR 335 at pp. 348-350 per Ritchie, McIntyre and Wilson; and, at pp. 383-384 per Dickson, Beetz, Chouinard and Lamer). The marginal note for section 18(1) is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of this section: \u201cReserves to be held for use and benefit of Indians\u201d.\n[64] I wish to add that the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty is a component of the principle of the honour of the Crown. In Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14 at paragraph 66, the Supreme Court described the principle of the honour of the Crown as follows:\nThe ultimate purpose of the honour of the Crown is the reconciliation of pre-existing Aboriginal societies with the assertion of Crown sovereignty. As stated in Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 550, at para. 24:\nThe duty of honour derives from the Crown\u2019s assertion of sovereignty in the face of prior Aboriginal occupation. It has been enshrined in s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal rights and titles. Section 35(1) has, as one of its purposes, negotiation of just settlement of Aboriginal claims. In all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, the Crown must act honourably, in accordance with its historical and future relationship with the Aboriginal peoples in question.\n[65] Given the interpretation of section 18(1) of the Indian Act and the principles ennuciated above, I fail to see how a hiring decision is an exercise of authority in relation to the use of reserve lands. Millbrook\u2019s argument and evidence was insufficient to establish any connection between section 18(1) of the Indian Act and the circumstances of this case.\n[66] Furthermore, Millbrook relies on a small portion of the wording of section 18(1) of the Indian Act (\u201c\u2026and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender\u2026\u201d) for its proposition that the section confirms Aboriginal treaty rights, such as commercial fishing. A plain reading of the section suggests the use of the term \u201ctreaty\u201d is in relation to treaty terms that may affect the use and benefit of reserve lands for First Nation groups; and, not necessarily the confirmation of treaty rights in general. In any event, given Millbrook\u2019s argument under section 18(1) relies on the establishement of a treaty right; and, given the treaty right to manage fishing resources, including personnel choices, was not established; Millbrook\u2019s argument under section 18(1) is also dismissed.\nIII. Ruling [67] I find the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaints. Section 67 of the CHRA is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. Nor is there evidence to indicate an infringement of an Aboriginal or treaty right pursuant to section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[68] For these reasons, Millbrook First Nation\u2019s motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 27, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1658\/01311 & T1659\/1411\nStyle of Cause: Stacy Lee Tabor v Millbrook First Nation\nRuling of the Tribunal Dated: March 27, 2015\nDate and Place of Hearing: July 28 to 30, 2014\nAugust 1, 2014\nAugust 5 to 7, 2014\nSeptember 16, 2014\nTruro, Nova Scotia\nAppearances:\nGary A.

Ruling. 24\nI. The Complaint [1] Mr. Richard Carpenter (\u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint against the Navy League of Canada (\u201cRespondent\u201d) on January 25, 2011 (\u201cFirst Complaint\u201d), alleging that pursuant to sections 7 and 14(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d), the Respondent discriminated against him on account of his sexual orientation, treated him in an adverse, differential manner, and failed to provide a harassment free workplace. On the same day, the Complainant filed an amendment to the First Complaint, alleging national or ethnic origin as another ground of discrimination. The Commission accepted the amendment.\nII. The Motions [2] The Complainant has made two motions:\n(1) that the Respondent\u2019s February 5, 2014 Statement of Particulars (\u201cFirst SOP\u201d) be substituted for its amended SOP filed April 7, 2014 (\u201cAmended SOP\u201d); or alternatively, that both SOPs form part of the record in this inquiry (\u201cSOP Motion\u201d);\nand\n(2) that the Tribunal permit the Complainant to amend the Complaint to add retaliation, within the meaning of section 14.1 of the Act (\u201cMotion to Amend\u201d).\nA. The SOP Motion (i) Background [3] On January 17, 2013, the Commission requested that the Tribunal Chairperson institute an inquiry into the First Complaint. The record indicates that at the time of referral, the Respondent was represented by counsel, and on January 13, 2014, counsel removed himself as the Respondent\u2019s lawyer.\n[4] On January 28, 2014, the Respondent\u2019s National Executive Director sent notice that the Respondent was no longer represented by counsel and that Gordon King, President of the Respondent\u2019s Ontario Division, would represent the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s letter also stated that Mr. King was then in the process of reviewing the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\n(ii) The Respondent\u2019s First SOP [5] On February 5, 2014, the Respondent served and filed the First SOP, consisting of 2 pages, under a cover letter signed by Mr. King. Although there are other statements and representations in the First SOP, those which are relevant to the SOP Motion are:\n\u2022 \u201cOne member had confessed to making \u201cGay Slurs and Comments\u201d and left the organization as soon as confronted with this information\u201d (\u201cGay Slur Admission\u201d or \u201cGay Slur\u201d);\n\u2022 The Respondent does not intend to call any witnesses or file any documents.\n[6] On February 11, 2014, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it had retained a new representative, a paralegal.\n[7] On February 24, 2014, the representative requested an extension of time to file an \u201camendment and re-submission of the Statement of Particulars\u201d, because he had just received the file and needed to review it.\n[8] I asked for the Complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s submissions on the request. The Complainant objected because, in his view, the Respondent had been \u201cfully represented by counsel\u201d since September, 2010, has already filed its SOP, and should be strictly held to the Tribunal\u2019s timeframes.\u201d The Complainant alleged that the Respondent was using \u201c\u2026yet again, another stall tactic\u201d.\n[9] The Commission consented to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n[10] After considering the above submissions, I granted the Respondent\u2019s request. The Respondent subsequently filed the Amended SOP on April 7, 2014.\nB. The Amended SOP [11] The Amended SOP consists of:\n\u2022 recitations of sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Act;\n\u2022 the following statements:\n\u201cIt is [the Respondent\u2019s position that the Act was complied with at all times to its fullest. Guidelines are in place and were followed at all times to prevent and investigate all matters. We feel that this claim is unfounded and should be dismissed\u201d;\n\u2022 the names of 9 proposed witnesses;\n\u2022 a 1-page list of 20 documents for disclosure.\n[12] The Respondent provided will-say statements for its witnesses on April 23, 2014.\n[13] The Amended SOP did not include any of the statements and representations in the First SOP.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s Reply and Position regarding the Amended SOP [14] The Complainant submits he had intended to rely on the Gay Slur Admission.\n[15] In the Complainant\u2019s Reply to the Amended SOP, he noted that the Amended SOP did not include any of the statements in the First SOP, including the Gay Slur Admission. He noted that in contrast to the First SOP, the Amended SOP proffered 9 witnesses, as well as documentary disclosure.\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Position [16] In a subsequent Case Management Conference Call, the Respondent confirmed its position that the Amended SOP be substituted for the First SOP and requested that the Amended SOP be the only one on record.\n[17] The Complainant objected, and made this SOP Motion.\n(iii) Complainant\u2019s Submissions [18] The Complainant\u2019s submissions are set out below.\n\u2022 An amendment is a clarification only, not a \u201clicense \u2026to introduce new issues, submit new particulars, or overcome inept representation\u201d.\n\u2022 Does the Tribunal have the authority to delete the First SOP from the record?\n\u2022 The Respondent\u2019s request to amend the Statement of Particulars was a way for the Respondent to \u201c\u2026circumvent the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) in a veiled attempt to overcome its previously stated positions on various issues that are the focal point of the Complainant\u2019s case.\n\u2022 The First SOP was signed by the Respondent\u2019s duly authorized representative, and dated; the Amended SOP was neither signed nor dated.\n\u2022 The Amended SOP withdraws material admissions, including one which goes to the focal point of the Complaint.\n\u2022 To the extent that the Respondent is introducing new witnesses and documentary evidence, it should seek authorization from the Tribunal under Rule 9(3), not through a new or amended SOP.\n(iv) Commission\u2019s Submissions [19] The Commission filed its Response to assist the Tribunal and the parties by providing what it submits is the appropriate test and the factors to take into account in making its decision. The Commission takes no position on the Complainant\u2019s requested remedy.\n[20] The Commission\u2019s submissions are set out below.\n\u2022 There is nothing specific in the Rules regarding the amendment of Complaints and SOPs, nor about the withdrawal of admissions.\n\u2022 The within situation is unusual because \u201cmost cases deal with \u2026withdrawal of an admission in the context of a motion to amend a pleading (as opposed to after an amended pleading has been filed with a court or tribunal)\u201d, as is the sequence here.\n\u2022 It is well established that the Tribunal has the authority to grant amendments, including to a party\u2019s \u201cpleadings\u201d, such as an SOP.\n\u2022 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cadmission\u201d as:\n\u201c[C]onfessions, concessions or voluntary acknowledgements made by a party of the existence of certain facts. More accurately regarded, they are statements by a party, or someone identified with him in legal interest, of the existence of a fact which is relevant to the cause of his adversary.\u201d\n\u2022 The Tribunal should consider the following in making its decision on this Motion:\n(a) whether an admission constitutes a \u201csubstantial\u201d one, which, if withdrawn, would result in a \u201cradical change in the nature of the questions in controversy\u201d, as in Merck & Co. Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2003 FCA 488 (\u201cMerck\u201d), at para 32; and\n(b) whether withdrawing the admission would prejudice the Complainant, by placing the onus on the Complainant to establish the truth of the admission and whether that onus would lengthen the hearing and financially impact the Complainant; and\n(c) what best serves the interests of justice.\n(v) Respondent\u2019s Submissions [21] The Respondent\u2019s submissions are set out below.\n\u2022 The Respondent properly requested the amendment to the First SOP, and the Tribunal granted the Respondent the right to file an amended SOP.\n\u2022 The Respondent understood the Tribunal\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d for the amendment as meaning that \u201cthe new SOP was to strike and replace the former submission\u201d and would be the only submission referred to and responded to.\n\u2022 It is prejudicial to the Respondent for the First SOP to remain on the record because the Respondent did not have a legal representative when it was written, nor was legal review of it sought.\n\u2022 An amendment can also make additions and deletions to what it is amending, not just clarifications.\n\u2022 Once the Respondent had a legal representative who reviewed the file, an \u201camendment was required\u201d.\nC. Issues [22] Can the First SOP be struck from the record?\n[23] Can the Respondent revoke the First SOP in its entirety and substitute the Amended SOP?\nD. Analysis (i) Can the First SOP be struck from the record? [24] It is necessary to preserve a complete record of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the complaint. A complete record includes all documents filed, including those which have been amended.\n[25] A complete record is also required if either party wishes to make an application for judicial review of the Ruling or any subsequent rulings or decisions in this inquiry. The Federal Courts Rules, 1998, SOR\/98-106 (\u201cFC Rules\u201d), in particular, Federal Courts Rules 317 and 318, require the administrative body which made the ruling or decision to submit a certified copy of the material requested by the party making an application for judicial review, subject to any objection by the administrative body or a party. The failure to preserve a complete record could be viewed as interfering with the Court\u2019s exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.\n[26] Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s record of the First Complaint shall include both the Respondent\u2019s First SOP and the Respondent\u2019s Amended SOP.\n(ii) Can the Respondent revoke the First SOP in its entirety and substitute the Amended SOP? [27] It is necessary to briefly review the legislative framework of the Tribunal and its resulting legal nature in order to give context to and decide this issue.\nE. Statute law [28] The relevant sections of the Act are:\n[29] Subsection 48.1(1):\n\u201cThere is hereby established a tribunal to be known as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2026\u201d\n[30] Subsection 48.9(1):\n\u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d\n[31] Section 50(1):\n\u201cAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made, and, at the discretion of the member or panel conducting the inquiry, any other interested party, the member or panel shall inquire into the complaint and shall give all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d\n[32] Section 50(3)(c):\n\u201cIn relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not the evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law\u201d.[1]\n[33] Section 48.1(1) of the Act (supra) creates the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal is what is called a \u201ccreature of statute\u201d. It has only the powers which the Act confers on it, either expressly, or by necessary implication as recognized in the case law. The Tribunal is not a judicial authority. Rather, it is a quasi-judicial body, that is to say, an administrative body that functions in much the same way as a court.\n[34] There are other significant differences between a court and the Tribunal flowing from the fact that the Tribunal is a statutory creation, conducting a statutory inquiry. Of relevance are the following:\n\u2022 The Act does not create or make a complaint into a common law cause of action (Chopra v. Canada, 2007 FCA 268, at para. 36).\n\u2022 An inquiry under the Act is not an action governed by the Federal Courts Rules, specifically FC Rule 169, nor is it a \u201cproceeding\u201d under FC Rule 1.1. Put briefly, a complaint is not the same as a lawsuit in a court.\n\u2022 Subsection 50(3)(c) provides that in a Tribunal hearing, the member or panel can \u201creceive and accept\u201d \u201cany evidence and other information that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not\u201d\u2026it \u201c\u2026would be admissible in a court of law\u201d, [my emphasis] subject only to privilege and information from a conciliator.\n[35] Therefore, the rules of evidence which apply to a Tribunal hearing provide much greater leeway for admissibility than do the rules of evidence applicable in a court.\n[36] Parliament\u2019s intention in making the Tribunal a quasi-judicial administrative body constituted by the Act was to provide the public with less formal, more flexible procedures for hearing human rights complaints than those of the courts (see section 48.9(1) of the Act, supra.)\n[37] Therefore, one must both exercise caution and make appropriate adjustments when comparing and trying to import terminology and procedures from civil courts to administrative human rights tribunals.\nF. Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) [38] The fact that the Tribunal is not a court impacts on the inherent nature of the documents the parties use to present their positions and respond to the opposite parties.\n[39] Statements of Particulars are filed pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal Rules (\u201cTribunal Rules\u201d), which reads, in part:\n\u201c6(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(a) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case;\n(b) its position on the legal issues raised by the case;\n(c) the relief it seeks;\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(e) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed\u2026\n(f) a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses\u2026\u201d\n[40] Although an SOP may be roughly analogous to a \u201cpleading\u201d in a civil court action, it is not the same thing. This fact also holds for complaints, replies and other documents which parties file in a human rights case. None are the same as pleadings in a civil court. Not only are they not the same because the venue in which they are filed is not a court, but they are not the same because they are not subject to the special rules which govern pleadings.\n[41] Significant to this motion is that rules of a court which may govern representations and admissions in pleadings simply do not apply to SOPs \u2013 or any other documents \u2013 filed in Tribunal inquiries. In particular, in the Federal Court, FC Rule 183 requires a party to admit every allegation of material fact which is not disputed when that party files a defence or subsequent pleading.\n[42] Tribunal Rule 6 sets out the required content of SOPs. Among other things, a party\u2019s SOP is required to set out \u201cthe material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case\u201d.\n[43] There is nothing in the Act or the Tribunal Rules about admissions or the withdrawal of an admission, whether made in a complaint, an SOP or any other document.\n[44] With respect to documents, Tribunal Rule 9(4), in referring to the hearing, states:\n\u201cExcept with the consent of the parties, a document in a book of documents does not become evidence until it is introduced at the hearing and accepted by the Panel.\u201d\n[45] The fact that in its SOP, a party makes a statement, lists a document for disclosure or names a proposed witness and summarizes the witness\u2019 proposed hearing testimony does not in and of itself establish either the admissibility of the document or the proposed testimony at the hearing. Nor does it establish the truth thereof. Credible admissible evidence about a representation, statement or admission in an SOP, proffered or elicited at the hearing, is what the decision maker must ultimately rely upon in deciding whether a disputed fact has been established.\n[46] Statements of Particulars and Tribunal Rules 6(1) and 9(3) support and further the aims of Tribunal Rule 1(1) which states:\n1(1) These Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n[47] This language partially mirrors subsection 48.9(1) and section 50 of the Act. However, as subsection 48.9(1) makes clear, informality and expeditiousness are always subject to the requirements of natural justice.\n(i) Function of an SOP [48] The function of a party\u2019s SOP is to put the opposite party on notice about the position the party will take, the kind of evidence it proposes to adduce at the hearing, and the case the opposite party will have to meet. This pre-hearing disclosure plays a critical role in affording the parties a \u201c\u2026full and ample opportunity to be heard\u2026[and] present evidence\u2026\u201d, as required by section 50(1) of the Act.\n[49] While one could assert that as of February 5, 2014, some of the facts in issue in the First Complaint were not being disputed, by April 7, 2014, this was no longer the case.\n(ii) Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction regarding amendments to SOPs [50] It is settled law that the Tribunal has the discretion to permit amendments to complaints: Attorney General v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (\u201cParent\u201d).\n[51] I find that the Tribunal\u2019s authority to permit amendments to complaints also necessarily authorizes it to permit the amendment of SOPs. If this were not so, then a party who had already filed its SOP and was then faced with an amended Complaint could not respond to the amendment by filing an amended SOP. This would deny a party the full and ample opportunity to present its case, and would be contrary to natural justice. It is also not the Tribunal\u2019s practice \u2013 see Itty v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 33, para. 61.\n(iii) Unsigned SOP [52] The Complainant has objected to the fact that the Amended SOP is unsigned and undated. The Rules do not require that an SOP be signed or dated.\n(iv) Is Rule 9(3) the correct vehicle to amend an SOP in these circumstances? [53] Rule 9(3) states:\n\u201cExcept with leave of the Panel, which leave shall be granted on such terms and conditions as accord with the purposes set out in 1(1), and subject to a party\u2019s right to lead evidence in reply,\n(1) a party who does not raise an issue under Rule 6 shall not raise that issue at the hearing;\n(2) a party who does not, under Rule 6, identify a witness or provide a summary of his or her anticipated testimony shall not call that witness at the hearing;\n(3) a party who does not disclose and produce a document under Rule 6 shall not introduce that document into evidence at the hearing;\n(4) a party who does not, under Rule 6, identify the relief which it seeks shall not make representations in respect of that relief at the hearing; and\n(5) a party who has not complied with 6(3) shall not introduce an expert report into evidence nor call an expert witness at the hearing.\u201d\n[54] In essence, then, Rule 9(3) mandates that except with leave of the Member or Panel, the failure of a party to comply with Rule 6 by not disclosing a new issue, witness, testimony, document, request for relief or expert\u2019s report before the hearing means the party cannot introduce that new issue, witness, testimony, document, request for relief or expert\u2019s report at the hearing.\n[55] A party making a request under Rule 9(3) potentially faces a denial of such leave by the Member or panel.\n[56] If the Member does grant leave, it is on terms and conditions as the Member decides. For example, the Member can order an adjournment to allow the other party to prepare its response. Leave is also subject to the other party\u2019s right to call reply evidence.\n[57] To suggest that the hearing is the correct place to raise an amendment or other new matter when the need for the amendment or the fact of the new matter is known to the requesting party well before the hearing, as is the case here, does not take into account the purpose of Rule 9(3). That purpose is to avoid what is called \u201ctrial by ambush\u201d and the resulting waste of time, resources and added expense to all those participating in the hearing - the parties, counsel, witnesses - and the Tribunal.\n[58] I conclude that Rule 9(3) is not the correct procedure to use in the circumstances.\n(v) Nature of an amendment [59] An amendment can make additions and deletions to the original version of a document, as well as clarifications.\n[60] In the normal course, it would be understood that the amended document would likely take the place of the original document going forward, for the purposes of case management, ongoing disclosure and hearing preparation.\n[61] However, the circumstances here are not in the normal course. The Respondent\u2019s amendments to the First SOP include the removal of the Gay Slur Admission. This is a significant matter in the context of the First Complaint. The Gay Slur Admission has the potential to directly relate to one of the grounds of discrimination alleged in the Complaint: sexual orientation.\n[62] In the British Columbia Human Rights complaint of McLean v. B.C. (Min. of Public Safety and Sol. Gen.) No.2, 2006 BCHRT 83 (\u201cMcLean\u201d), the respondent had admitted that the complainant had a disability as defined in the British Columbia Human Rights Code. Two years later, the respondent sought to withdraw the admission. The tribunal stated that \u201cThe overriding question is whether the interests of justice justify the withdrawal of the admission\u201d (McLean, at para. 23)\n[63] I adopt the B.C. Tribunal\u2019s statement in Mclean which also points out that:\n\u201c\u2026in the human rights context, it must be kept in mind that the complaint and response are not the equivalent of pleadings in the civil litigation context, and, so far as fairness and the nature of the issues raised allow, the Tribunal\u2019s procedures should be kept simple and flexible.\u201d (ibid).\n[64] The removal of the Gay Slur Admission therefore requires a consideration of whether the interests of justice justify its removal, as well as adjustments to the human rights administrative context in which this inquiry takes place.\nG. Relevant factors to determine interests of justice [65] I find the following are relevant in arriving at a determination of the interests of justice in the SOP Motion: whether the Respondent delayed in seeking leave to amend and withdraw the Gay Slur Admission; whether there is loss of a hearing date, and general procedural efficiency; prejudice; whether the admission was made inadvertently, or by mistake; other factors arising from the human rights context (ibid).\n(i) Did the Respondent delay in requesting the amendment and seeking leave to withdraw the Admission? [66] The Respondent gave notice that it had retained new representation on February 11, 2014 and made its request to amend its SOP on February 24. I find that the Respondent did not delay in its request to amend its SOP.\n[67] However, the Respondent did not notify the parties or the Tribunal that the Amended SOP would withdraw the Gay Slur Admission. The substance of the notice the Respondent gave was that because it had obtained legal representation after filing the First SOP, it sought an extension of time to file an amended SOP.\n[68] So although there was no delay, there was also no notice of the withdrawal of the admission.\n(ii) Loss of Hearing Date and general procedural efficiency [69] There is no hearing date set. The withdrawal of the admission at this stage of the First Complaint does not hinder procedural efficiency.\n(iii) Was the Admission made inadvertently or by mistake? [70] The Respondent submits that it did not have legal representation or advice when it drafted and filed the First SOP. Its subsequently-retained legal representative confirmed this.\n[71] I do not know if the Gay Slur Admission \u201c\u2026was made inadvertently or hastily or without full knowledge of the facts\u2026\u201d (McLean, at para. 23) as there is no evidence in this regard.\n[72] The only finding I make as to how the admission came about is that the Respondent did not have a legal representative when it drafted and filed the First SOP. As a consequence of that, through its subsequent legal representative, the Respondent sought to amend the First SOP, which, among other things, proffered no witnesses or documentary evidence.\n[73] The legal advice which the Respondent obtained was presumably responsible for the changes in its Amended SOP.\n[74] Subject to my comments and decision regarding the removal of the Gay Slur Admission without notice, I do not find anything incorrect in the Respondent\u2019s amending its SOP based on legal advice.\n(iv) Other factors arising out of the human rights context [75] There is no evidence as to whether the Respondent is an \u201cunsophisticated litigant\u201d (McLean, at para.31). Therefore, I do not make a finding on this issue.\n(v) Prejudice [76] The Respondent has added a list of witnesses and documents in its Amended SOP. The Amended SOP reflects the Respondent\u2019s most current position. It also allows the Complainant to know the case he must meet.\n[77] Not permitting the Respondent to rely on its Amended SOP would prejudice the Respondent by among other things, removing its proposed witnesses and documents from the inquiry. That would deny the Respondent the \u201c\u2026full and ample opportunity to \u2026 appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations\u201d, mandated by section 50(1) of the Act. The Respondent shall therefore be permitted to use the Amended SOP for the purposes of case management, disclosure, and hearing preparation.\n[78] On its face, the Gay Slur Admission goes to one of the Complaint\u2019s key allegations: discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation.\n[79] The Complainant wishes to rely on this Admission as conclusive proof of the truth of its contents. That view is based in large part on the way in which civil courts have treated admissions made in pleadings in various cases. The Commission uses the same framework to suggest the criteria the Tribunal should use to arrive at its decision.\n[80] As set out in other parts of this Ruling, above, the Complainant cannot rely on the Gay Slur Admission as conclusive proof of the truth of its contents, because of the way the Act and the Tribunal Rules are meant to work.\n[81] Further, the Amended SOP no longer mentions the Gay Slur, and the Respondent will not seek to establish this incident at the hearing.\n[82] However, the First SOP remains on the record. Its reference to the Gay Slur has put the other parties on notice that an incident involving negative comments about sexual orientation may have been made by a member of the Respondent and that there may have been consequences that arose from the incident.\n[83] I find that it would prejudice the Complainant to the degree that the interests of justice would not be served if the Gay Slur was totally removed from this inquiry.\n[84] Therefore, the Complainant will be granted leave to amend its Statement of Particulars, if he chooses to do so, by adding the Gay Slur contents. It would then become an allegation.\n[85] If the Complainant chooses to amend its SOP to include the Gay Slur, the Respondent will not be prejudiced. The amendment will give the Respondent notice that the Complainant will lead evidence on the incident at the hearing and the Respondent can prepare its defence accordingly. Further, the Tribunal will give the Respondent the opportunity to file an amended SOP to deal with the Complainant\u2019s amendment.\n[86] Giving the Complainant the option to proceed in this manner does not prejudice him. It simply removes the idea that he could have relied on the Gay Slur Admission as conclusive proof that the events therein occurred. He could not have done this in any event, for the reasons previously set out. However, giving him this option permits him to seek to establish that the Gay Slur incident occurred.\n[87] If the Complainant amends his SOP to include the Gay Slur, he can then request documentary disclosure relating to it from the Respondent, cross-examine the Respondent\u2019s witnesses at the hearing regarding the allegation, and, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s consent, can subpoena witnesses to the hearing whose testimony he thinks will shed light on the alleged incident by adducing evidence on it.\n[88] Having decided the foregoing, I again wish to stress that simply because a representation or allegation is in a party\u2019s SOP, the truth of that representation or allegation is not established unless the parties agree that it is true, or unless and until the Tribunal decides that its truth has been established, based on admissible, credible evidence at the hearing\nH. The Motion to Amend the Complaint by adding retaliation under section 14.1 (i) Background - The Second Complaint [89] On January 28, 2013, the Complainant filed another complaint with the Commission, alleging that the Respondent retaliated against him for filing the First Complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act (\u201cSecond Complaint\u201d). As at the date of this Ruling, the Commission has not referred the Second Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry.\n(ii) Statute law and jurisprudence [90] Section 14.1 of the Act states:\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\u201d\n[91] As set out in the previous section of this Ruling dealing with the SOP Motion, the Tribunal has the authority to grant amendments to complaints (Parent, supra).\n[92] An amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint (Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 45929 (CHRT), at para 11) (\u201cCook\u201d), and the amendment cannot result in prejudice to the opposite party (Parent, supra, at para 40).\n[93] Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 (\u201cVirk\u201d) held that the specific test to permit section 14.1 retaliation as an amendment to a complaint was \u201cwhether the allegations of retaliation are by their very nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint, and disclose a tenable claim for retaliation\u201d (Virk, supra, at paras 7-8.)\n(iii) Complainant\u2019s Submissions [94] The Complainant submits that the Respondent retaliated against him within the meaning of section 14.1 of the Act, for having filed the First Complaint, by:\n\u2022 refusing to permit the Complainant to attend two of the Respondent\u2019s three ceremonial events in May, 2012 and one such event in January, 2013; and\n\u2022 instructing him not to pick up and drop off cadets at, or be on the Respondent\u2019s parking lot.\n[95] The Complainant alleges that these events occurred after the Respondent suspended him.\n[96] He alleges that in response to his request to attend the 2012 events, the Respondent\u2018s National Director, after consulting with the Respondent\u2019s Brantford branch, refused to permit him to attend two of them, and \u201c\u2026indicated that I should be able to appreciate that they are presently working through my Human Rights\u2026complaint\u2026individual members named in my complaint were concerned that my presence at Navy League activities could\u2026further complicate the issue.\u201d\n[97] The Complainant submits that the Respondent\u2019s response to his request to attend the 2013 event \u201c\u2026indicated that my presence at these event[s] [sic] would most assuredly lead to the creation of a negative atmosphere among the onsite volunteer staff\u201d. The Respondent \u201chope[s] that I can appreciate the level of anxiety\u201d.\n[98] The Complainant further submits that the Second Complaint has not been withdrawn, nor has the Commission dismissed it, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s submission below.\n(iv) Respondent\u2019s Position and Submissions [99] The Respondent opposes the amendment. It submits that it would be prejudiced if the Tribunal permitted the amendment because:\n(a) the subject matter of the proposed amendment occurred after the First Complaint was filed;\n(b) the Complainant filed a \u201cnewer application\u201d at the Commission containing the same allegations as the Motion to Amend and that application was either dismissed or withdrawn at the Commission\u2019s investigation stage;\n(c) the Respondent has not had the opportunity to address the proposed amendment\u2019s allegations in its statement of particulars, nor in conference calls when the allegations could have been raised in relation to the First Complaint.\n[100] The Respondent also submits:\n\u2022 the Motion to Amend is res judicata because its subject matter was already \u201cpresented to the Commission\u201d; and\n\u2022 the proposed amendment constitutes a substantially new complaint and would not aid in determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, as required by Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, [1994] 1 F.C. 3 1993 Can LII 2990 (FCA), at page 10.\n(v) Commission\u2019s Position and Submissions [101] The Commission\u2019s supports the Motion to Amend. The Commission submits that the requested amendment passes the test in Virk, supra, because the issue of retaliation is \u201cclearly\u201d linked to the original complaint, is linked to it by the Complainant, and discloses a tenable claim for retaliation.\nI. Analysis (i) Timing of alleged retaliation [102] The Complainant links the Respondent\u2019s refusals to let him attend certain events and be on Respondent\u2019s property to the fact that he filed the First Complaint. One of the grounds on which the Respondent objects to the amendment is that the alleged retaliation occurred after the First Complaint was filed.\n[103] Retaliation is a reaction to an action. It is therefore in the nature of retaliation that it occurs after an action.\n[104] The wording of section 14.1 acknowledges this nature by stating that a\n\u201c\u2026person against whom a complaint has been filed\u201d [my emphasis] discriminates by retaliating or threatening retaliation against the individual \u201cwho filed the complaint\u2026\u201d [my emphasis].\n[105] I find that section 14.1 requires that a complaint has to have been filed before a subsequent act against the filer or the victim can be alleged to be retaliation.\n[106] Therefore, the fact that the retaliation alleged by the Complainant occurred after the First Complaint was filed does not preclude the Tribunal from granting the amendment.\n(ii) Is the allegation of retaliation untenable? [107] Given the language the Complainant alleges the Respondent used in denying the Complainant\u2019s requests to attend the Respondent\u2019s ceremonial functions, especially the language used regarding the 2012 events, I find that the Complainant\u2019s allegations of retaliation are not untenable.\n(iii) Res Judicata [108] There are conflicting submissions from the Complainant and the Respondent about whether the Second Complaint has been withdrawn or dismissed.\n[109] Commission counsel does not state that the Complainant has withdrawn it, or that the Commission has dismissed it. I assume that Commission counsel knows the status of the Second Complaint at the Commission. As well, presumably, the Respondent and the Complainant would have received official correspondence had the Commission dismissed the Complaint. No party has filed or referred to such correspondence.\n[110] I find that there has not been a final decision on the merits of the alleged retaliation. Therefore, res judicata does not apply here.\n(iv) Does the proposed amendment constitute a substantially new complaint? [111] The Complainant links the alleged retaliation to the filing of the First Complaint. The Tribunal has found that in cases like this, when the Virk test has been met, granting an amendment to add section 14.1 retaliation does not make the amendment a new complaint.\n(v) The issue of prejudice [112] The Respondent has known that the Complainant viewed retaliation as an issue since January 28, 2013, when the Complainant filed the Second Complaint.\n[113] Further, there are no hearing dates set.\n[114] The Tribunal will give both parties the opportunity to file Amended Statements of Particulars in relation to the retaliation allegation. The Respondent will therefore be given sufficient time to prepare an answer to the retaliation amendment.\n[115] For all of the above reasons, I find that the Respondent will not be prejudiced by the amendment.\n[116] Further, as set out in Cook, supra, at para. 19, I find that it would be unfair to the Complainant to require him to pursue his retaliation allegation by way of a separate complaint.\n[117] I also take into account that the Commission supports the amendment, notwithstanding that it has not formally referred the Second Complaint to the Tribunal.\n[118] I point out that the fact the Tribunal has granted this amendment does not mean that the Complainant has substantiated the allegation of retaliation. As with the other allegations in the First Complaint, the Tribunal can only decide whether the allegation of retaliation has been substantiated after evaluating all the evidence admitted at the hearing.\nIII. Ruling [119] The Respondent\u2019s First SOP dated February 5, 2014 and the Respondent\u2019s Amended SOP dated April 7, 2014 shall remain part of the Tribunal\u2019s record in this Complaint.\n[120] For the purposes of case management and the parties\u2019 disclosure obligations and hearing preparations, and subject to the rulings below, the Respondent\u2019s Amended SOP takes the place of the Respondent\u2019s First SOP.\n[121] The Tribunal hereby grants the Complainant leave to amend his SOP, if he so chooses, to include the Gay Slur Admission. Should he do so:\n(a) the Gay Slur Admission will become and be called the \u201cGay Slur Allegation\u201d;\n(b) the Complainant may request disclosure from the Respondent in respect of the Gay Slur Allegation; and\n(c) the Tribunal will grant a request from the Respondent for a corresponding amendment to the Respondent\u2019s Amended SOP.\n[122] At the hearing, subject to the Complainant having amended his SOP to include the Gay Slur Allegation, and provided the parties have complied with the Tribunal Rules, particularly those dealing with ongoing disclosure, both parties may lead evidence, including, without limitation, documentary and oral evidence, related to the Gay Slur Allegation, subject to the admissibility of such evidence.\n[123] The Motion to Amend is granted. The First Complaint is hereby amended by adding to it the allegation that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant by retaliating against him within the meaning of section 14.1 of the Act.\n[124] The Complainant and the Commission may serve and file amended Statements of Particulars, in accordance with Rule 6, with respect to the section 14.1 allegation.\n[125] The Respondent may serve and file an amended Statement of Particulars, dealing with the section 14.1 allegation, in response to the Complainant\u2019s and Commissions amended Statements of Particulars, in accordance with Rule 6.\n[126] The Complainant may serve and file a Reply, if any, to the Respondent\u2019s amended Statement of Particulars.\n[127] The dates by which the parties serve and file the foregoing documents shall be decided at a Case Management Conference Call to be held as soon as possible.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 20, 2015\n[1] Subsection (4) prohibits the admission of evidence that would be privileged under the law of evidence. Subsection (5) prohibits a conciliator appointed to settle the complaint from being a witness.\n",

Complaint substantiated 36\nIII. Order 37\nI. Complaint & Background\n[1] To begin with, I would like to honour and acknowledge the Mi\u2019kmaq (Mi\u2019kmaw) First Nations people and the Millbrook First Nation community. The hearing of this matter was held on traditional Mi\u2019kmaw territory and close to the Millbrook community, in Truro, Nova Scotia. I was impressed and find it worth mentioning that the parties and witnesses who participated in the hearing, the majority of whom live together in the Millbrook community, were respectful and cordial amongst each other, even in the midst of conflict and litigation. I find their behaviour exemplary and commend them for it. In this decision, when referring to Millbrook First Nation, I am referring to the First Nation as an employer and not to the community as a whole or individual community members.\n[2] The Complainant, Ms. Stacey Lee Marshall Tabor, is a Mi\u2019kmaw First Nation woman and a member of the Millbrook First Nation. She comes from a family of fishers and began fishing at 16 years of age. She also comes from a family that fought for their aboriginal and treaty rights. Donald Marshall, her uncle, fought for his treaty right to fish. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized Mr. Marshall had a Mi\u2019kmaq treaty right to fish for sustenance and trade in R. v. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 665 (SCC).\n[3] Like her uncle, Ms. Tabor stands up for what she believes in. Ms. Tabor has also exercised her treaty right to fish by doing some unlicensed fishing. It is also clear from Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony that her passion is fishing. She wants to practice this passion and wishes to someday realize her dream of being a fishing boat captain. In fact, to her knowledge, she was the first First Nations woman to qualify to be a fishing boat captain in Nova Scotia. However, like many other people who have attempted to be the first to do something, it can often be a challenge to be a pioneer. Despite her aspirations and qualifications, Ms. Tabor has only been able to work, on a few occasions, as a Deckhand and First Mate for the Millbrook First Nation fishery.\n[4] Ms. Tabor claims Millbrook First Nation has denied her employment in its fishery over several years because she is a woman. Specifically, she asserts Millbrook refused to consider her for a captaincy in its fishery in 2008. She contends her situation is reflective of a larger practice on the part of the First Nation to exclude women from participating in its fishery. Ms. Tabor also claims her exclusion from captaining a vessel in 2008 was based on her marital status, because Millbrook First Nation had issues with her husband following his captaincy in 2007 and held those issues against her as well. Ms. Tabor alleges Millbrook\u2019s actions are discriminatory practices pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act [the CHRA].\n[5] For its part, Millbrook First Nation denies the allegations made against it. It claims Ms. Tabor was not selected for a captain\u2019s job in 2008 because there was a more qualified candidate. It also denies having a practice of excluding women from participating in its fishery.\n[6] Following the filing of her complaint, Ms. Tabor contends Millbrook First Nation retaliated against her pursuant to section 14.1 of the CHRA. The retaliation allegations will be analyzed in a separate decision.\n[7] After hearing from the parties and reviewing all the evidence, submissions and affidavits before me, I find Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA to be substantiated for the reasons that follow.\nII. Analysis of the complaint\nA. Legal Framework\n[8] In human rights cases, the complainant has the burden of proof of establishing a prima facie case. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC) at para. 28 [O\u2019Malley]).\n[9] Millbrook\u2019s submissions focus mainly on its decision to choose another candidate over Ms. Tabor when she applied for a captain\u2019s license in 2008. As such, Millbrook argues the test from Shakes v. Rex Pak Ltd., (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 [Shakes] should be applied to determine if Ms. Tabor has established a prima facie case. That test is: (1) she was qualified for the job; (2) not hired; and, (3) that someone no better qualified, but lacking the distinguishing feature, in this case, of being a woman, subsequently obtained the position (see Shakes at para. 8918).\n[10] However, in Premakumar v. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 (CHRT) the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) stated:\n[77] While both the Shakes and the Israeli tests serve as useful guides, neither test should be automatically applied in a rigid or arbitrary fashion in every hiring case: rather the circumstances of each case should be considered to determine if the application of either of the tests, in whole or in part, is appropriate. Ultimately, the question will be whether Mr. Premakumar has satisfied the O'Malley test, that is: if believed, is the evidence before me complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in Mr. Premakumar's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent?\n(see also Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 at paras. 17-18; and, Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), 2005 FCA 154 at paras. 24\u201130)\n[11] I agree with this statement and find it would be inappropriate to apply the Shakes test in the circumstances of this case. The nature of the allegations raised in this complaint are broader than the individual 2008 decision to choose another candidate over Ms. Tabor for a captain\u2019s role. Prior to 2008 and on an ongoing basis, Ms. Tabor alleges a systemic practice of denying employment opportunities to women in the Millbrook First Nation fishery, including herself. Moreover, it is Millbrook who characterizes the 2008 captain\u2019s decision as being based on a comparison of the qualifications between Ms. Tabor and the chosen candidate. In her complaint and evidence, Ms. Tabor states she was not provided with such an explanation for Millbrook\u2019s 2008 captain\u2019s decision.\n[12] Therefore, applying the O'Malley test to the context of this case, to demonstrate prima facie discrimination Ms. Tabor had to establish: that she had a characteristic or characteristics protected from discrimination under the CHRA (section 3 of the CHRA); that she was refused or deprived employment or treated adversely in employment (section 7 and\/or 10(a) of the CHRA); and, that the protected characteristic or characteristics were a factor in the refusal to employ her (section 7(a) of the CHRA) or the practice that deprived her of employment opportunities (section 10(a) of the CHRA) (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33 [Moore]).\n[13] If a prima facie case is established, a respondent can avoid an adverse finding by calling evidence to show its actions were not discriminatory; or, by establishing a statutory defence that justifies the discrimination. In this case, Millbrook led evidence in an effort to show that its actions were not discriminatory. Therefore, it had an evidential burden to rebut the prima facie case to avoid an adverse finding (Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 at para. 68 [Pieters]). However, the ultimate burden of proof remained on Ms. Tabor to establish Millbrook\u2019s evidence was false or a pretext (see Pieters at para. 74).\n[14] Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that discrimination is not usually practiced overtly and, consequently, proving it by way of direct evidence is often difficult. Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to consider all the circumstances and evidence to determine if there exists the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT)). As the standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard on a balance of probabilities, \u201c[a]n inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses\u201d (B\u00e9atrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at p. 142).\n[15] Finally, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that a discriminatory consideration be one of the factors in the actions in issue (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.) at paragraph 7).\nB. Ms. Tabor\u2019s case\n[16] The events giving rise to Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint span over a decade, mainly from 1996 to 2008. The evidence offered in support of her complaint can be divided into the following categories: (i) derogatory comments regarding women; (ii) difficulty getting funding for captain\u2019s training; (iii) work experience with Millbrook and its fishery from 2000-2006; (iv) the 2007 lobster season; (v) the 2008 captain\u2019s license; and, (vi) the experience of other women in Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery. On a prima facie basis, the following are my findings of fact related to each of these categories of evidence, unless specified otherwise.\n[17] Based on this evidence, I find Ms. Tabor has established a prima facie case of discrimination pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA, on the compound grounds of sex and marital status.\n(i) Derogatory comments regarding women\n[18] Ms. Tabor began her experience working for Millbrook in 1996 when she was a summer student working as a fisheries guardian. Of the four fisheries guardians working for Millbrook that summer, Ms. Tabor was the only female. She described the working environment as sexist and chauvinistic.\n[19] It was during her 1996 summer experience that Mr. Alex Cope, at the time and currently the Band Administrator for Millbrook First Nation and an elected Band Councillor, first made comments regarding the role of women in the fisheries. Mr. Cope made comments to the effect that the only place for women\u2019s breasts on a boat was on the bow as a figurehead. Mr. Cope repeated the comments at a dinner in Ms. Tabor\u2019s home, in front of their guests, in 2005. This time the comments were specifically directed towards Ms. Tabor.\n[20] Craig Tabor, the Complainant\u2019s husband, confirmed Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony when he also testified that he was present for and heard Mr. Cope make the same comments during the get together at the Tabors\u2019 home in 2005.\n(ii) Difficulty getting funding for captain\u2019s training\n[21] By 1998, Ms. Tabor wanted to get training to become a captain. She decided to pursue a Master Limited course, a form of captain\u2019s training and certification, at the Nova Scotia Community College School of Fisheries in Pictou, Nova Scotia. She found out other men from Millbrook were taking the course and the First Nation was funding their training. However, when she approached Millbrook for funding for the training, she was denied the funding and told there were no more spots available at the school.\n[22] Despite this denial, Ms. Tabor phoned the school and was told a spot was still available. She registered for the Master Limited course on a Friday and began attending the school the following Monday.\n[23] Ms. Tabor testfied that Mr. Cope was angry at her for going to the school and told her, in a phone conversation, she should not be there as she was taking the spot from someone else. She tried many times to find out who the person was that she was allegedly taking a spot from, but was unable to do so. She also does not recall many Millbrook community members being present at the school for the course. In her recollection, there were only two other Millbrook community members attending the course.\n[24] Near the end of the course, Ms. Tabor contacted Ms. Clara Gloade, a former Band Councillor for Millbrook First Nation and member of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Nova Scotia (the Association), to enquire whether there were any other options to receive funding for her fisheries training. Ms. Gloade supported Ms. Tabor\u2019s pursuit of fisheries training and offered her a job at the Association to help with the tuition fees.\n[25] Ms. Gloade testified before the Tribunal. She tried to obtain funding for Ms. Tabor\u2019s course by bringing the issue before Millbrook\u2019s Chief and Council, but was unsuccessful. It is Ms. Gloade\u2019s opinion that Millbrook was reluctant to fund Ms. Tabor\u2019s course because she is a woman. As a result, and given she wanted to help Ms. Tabor obtain training to realize her ambition of becoming a captain, Ms. Gloade helped Ms. Tabor obtain employment at the Association in an effort to assist with her tuition fees.\n[26] On the last day of her training, Ms. Tabor learned Millbrook would fund her course after all. Ms. Tabor successfully completed the Master Limited course, including meeting a minimum requirement for time at sea fishing.\n(iii) Work experience with Millbrook and its fishery from 2000-2006\n[27] Millbrook\u2019s fishery fishes various species of marine creatures. A large part of their catches are lobster, rock crab and snow crab. The lobster fishing season usually runs from the beginning of May to the end of July, followed by the snow crab season that usually runs from the end of June to September.\n[28] Following her training at the School of Fisheries, Ms. Tabor worked various seafaring jobs outside of Millbrook First Nation. She started working for Millbrook in 2000. Her first position was \u201cdoing ropes\u201d, which is a form of fishing gear preparation and is done on land.\n[29] In 2001 and 2002, Ms. Tabor worked as a Deckhand fishing lobster out of Pictou Landing. Her duties included regular deck jobs, such as fishing and seperating lobster, baiting traps and painting buoys.\n[30] Following the 2002 lobster season, Ms. Tabor made her interest known to Adrian Gloade, the Millbrook First Nation Fisheries Manager, that she was interested in fishing the snow crab season as well. Fishing snow crab is more demanding than fishing lobster, as the boat goes further out at sea and for longer periods of time, usually 2-3 days, but it is also more lucrative. Ms. Tabor was told she did not have enough experience to go snow crabbing. However, around the end of June 2002, Mr. Tabor received a call from Adrian Gloade offering him a position as a Deckhand on a snow crab boat. At that time, Mr. Tabor did not have any fishing experience in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. His only experience with Millbrook\u2019s fishery at that point, from earlier in 2002, was preparing gear and painting buoys.\n[31] Later in September 2002, while Ms. and Mr. Tabor were driving together in front of the Band office, Mr. Cope flagged the couple down and explained he needed their help to go out snow crab fishing. According to the Tabors, at that time, there was a shortage of fishers because a number of them were on strike and refusing to fish. The Tabors agreed to fish the rest of the 2002 snow crab season and Ms. Tabor was assigned to a vessel as a First Mate fishing out of Port Bickerton. A First Mate has added responsibilities on top of those of the Deckhands, including overseeing the crew and navigating the boat when the captain is not available. The position requires more training and sea experience than that of a Deckhand.\n[32] Three weeks into her assignment as First Mate, Ms. Tabor informed Adrian Gloade that she was five weeks pregnant. She continued to fish the 2002 snow crab season until a particularly rough time at sea caused her some stomach pain. She decided to stop fishing for the season for the safety of her pregnancy.\n[33] On March 14, 2003, Ms. Tabor gave birth to a son.\n[34] Around July or August 2003, Ms. Tabor called Adrian Gloade about securing another position with the fishery. As a snow crab vessel was short a crew member, Ms. Tabor was given an opportunity to go out on a \u201chitch\u201d. A \u201chitch\u201d is the period of time from when the vessel leaves the wharf to go out to sea until it returns to land. As mentioned above, in the case of snow crab fishing, a hitch could last a few days. Unfortunately, during the hitch in 2003, Ms. Tabor was injured and, thereafter, was no longer available to fish for the rest of the 2003 season.\n[35] In Ms. Tabor\u2019s experience, to apply for a fishing position with Millbrook\u2019s fishery, one needs to call or show up at the Band office, or speak with Adrian Gloade. The Fisheries Department then decides whether a job is made available to an individual. There is no formal application process or forms to fill out. This was Mr. Tabor\u2019s experience as well. As he explained, it is the informal, however, usual process to be followed when someone is interested in obtaining a job in the fishery.\n[36] From 2004 to 2006, Ms. Tabor made several attempts to gain employment fishing for Millbrook by calling or appearing in person at the Band office. Despite her Master Limited certificate and fishing experience, she was unsuccessful in doing so. When she would request work, she was treated dismissively.\n[37] During this time, and given she could not secure employment with Millbrook\u2019s fishery, she eventually gave up trying to work in the fishery. She dedicated herself to taking care of her child, along with working other non-fishing jobs, including making lobster traps for Millbrook in 2004.\n[38] Ms. Loretta Bernard, a former Band Councillor and former receptionist for Millbrook, also testified before the Tribunal and corroborated Ms. Tabor\u2019s accounts of trying to gain employment in the fishery. She witnessed Ms. Tabor calling and coming into the Band office to request work on the fishing boats. Ms. Tabor was not taken seriously by Millbrook officials. Ms. Bernard described their behavior as rolling their eyes, making jokes about Ms. Tabor, and making comments about the place of women in the community, namely that they should stay home with their kids.\n(iv) 2007 lobster season\n[39] Mr. Tabor also worked for Millbrook\u2019s fishery. His first position, in April 2002, was painting buoys and preparing gear prior to the fishing season. In fact, he first met and worked with Ms. Tabor in April 2002 and she taught him how to make lobster traps and prepare the gear for the lobster fishery. As mentioned above, Mr. Tabor was subsequently offered a position as a Deckhand for the 2002 snow crab season, his only prior experience in the fishery being painting buoys and preparing gear earlier that year. Mr. Tabor continued to work as a Deckhand during the 2003 lobster and snow crab seasons. In 2004, Adrian Gloade approached him to take his captain\u2019s training even though he did not have the sea time required to complete this training. While he did his captain\u2019s training in 2004, he lacked a first aid certificate, along with the minimum requirement of sea time, to complete his Master IV Class certificate. Despite this, he mentored as a First Mate over the course of the 2004 and 2005 seasons and fished both lobster and snow crab. For the 2006 and 2007 lobster seasons, Mr. Tabor was awarded a captain\u2019s license, on a boat named the Chief Rachael Marshall, fishing out of Lismore. He was given the captain\u2019s position without asking for it. He eventually completed his first aid certificate and received his Master IV Class certificate in 2009.\n[40] As mentioned above, Mr. Tabor corroborated Ms. Tabor\u2019s assertion that all that needed to be done to get a job with the fishery was to make your interest known by calling or speaking in person to Adrian Gloade or to appear at a council meeting and manifest your interest. He also testified about the drug tests administered by Millbrook for those who wanted to fish. They are usually offered around March or April and all fishers have to take the test before the fishing season commences. There is a second opportunity for a person to take the drug test again if the first one is failed. According to Mr. Tabor, he failed more drug tests than he passed, but was still allowed to go fishing. In her testimony, Ms. Tabor corroborated Mr. Tabor\u2019s evidence on this issue.\n[41] A captain normally chooses his own crew and Mr. Tabor wanted to hire Ms. Tabor as a Deckhand for the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007. However, he encountered resistance from Millbrook to let him hire her. After much insistence, Mr. Tabor was able to get Ms. Tabor on his crew. This was the first time Ms. Tabor was employed in Millbrook\u2019s fishery, on a fishing boat, since 2003. She ended up steering the boat for most of the 2007 lobster season.\n[42] At the end of the 2007 lobster season, Mr. Tabor was asked to go out fishing snow crab for Millbrook on a different boat. He left the fishing gear from the Chief Rachel Marshall on the wharf to dry out, as is the usual practice, so it would not become moldy when later stored. The gear remained on the wharf for a few weeks. It took longer than usual for the gear to dry out since it rained the first week. Mr. Tabor also conceded that the gear remained out on the wharf longer than usual because he was out snow crab fishing. While at sea snow crab fishing, Millbrook hired people to remove the fishing gear from the wharf and deducted the costs for doing so from Mr. Tabor\u2019s 2007 earnings from Millbrook\u2019s fishery.\n[43] In the past, Mr. Tabor was asked by Millbrook to help remove gear from the wharf for other fishers, and was never paid to do so. According to Mr. Tabor, it is common practice in Millbrook for fishers to help each other out and he does not understand why Millbrook had to pay people to remove his gear in 2007.\n[44] There was also a disagreement between Millbrook and Mr. Tabor regarding the lobster sales arising from the Chief Rachael Marshall. Millbrook identified a shortfall between Mr. Tabor\u2019s pay and the lobster sales from his boat. Mr. Tabor claims there are discrepancies in Millbrook\u2019s accounting and that some lobster sales were not properly attributed to his boat.\n[45] In 2007, Mr. Tabor was also involved in a small claims action initiated by Frank Gloade, a former Deckhand of his from the 2006 season. In 2006, Frank Gloade was asked by Millbrook to leave Mr. Tabor\u2019s crew before the end of the season in order to fish snow crab for Millbrook on another vessel. As a result, Mr. Tabor had refused to pay Frank Gloade for the part of the fishing season where he was assigned to the other boat. Frank Gloade pursued Mr. Tabor in small claims court for breach of contract. Millbrook supported Frank Gloade in the action.\n[46] Following the small claims court proceedings, around August 2007, Mr. Cope told Mr. Tabor he would not fish or work in any capacity for Millbrook ever again. Mr. Tabor has not worked for Millbrook since that time. Despite the dispute with Millbrook over gear storage and sales in 2007, Mr. Tabor believes it is the small claims court action that was the catalyst for Mr. Cope telling him he would never work for Millbrook again.\n(v) 2008 captain\u2019s license\n[47] Following her experience as Deckhand in 2007, and seeing as Mr. Tabor was not returning to work in the fishery, Ms. Tabor was interested in taking over the license for the Chief Rachael Marshall for the 2008 lobster season. In or about early January 2008, she and Mr. Tabor approached Mr. Cope regarding the lobster sales issue from the 2007 season. During this conversation, Ms. Tabor indicated to Mr. Cope her interest for the captain\u2019s license for the Chief Rachael Marshall for the upcoming lobster season.\n[48] On January 8, 2008, Ms. Tabor went to a Band Council meeting, attended by Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade, where she reiterated her interest for the captain\u2019s license for the Chief Rachael Marshall.\n[49] In January or February 2008, in a phone conversation, Ms. Tabor spoke with Adrian Gloade over speakerphone in Mr. Tabor\u2019s presence. Mr. Gloade informed her that, despite her interest, Millbrook allocated the Chief Rachael Marshall captain\u2019s license to Frank Gloade. During this conversation, when pressed by Ms. Tabor as to the reasons why she was not chosen for the captain\u2019s license, Ms. Tabor described Adrian Gloade as becoming evasive and indicated that the Fisheries Committee had considered her for a license, but that she did not \u201cstand out\u201d. When Ms. Tabor asked why she was not notified that the decision was upcoming, Adrian Gloade told her the Fisheries Committee was in a rush to allocate the licenses due to an upcoming meeting involving the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Mr. Tabor corroborated Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence regarding the phone conversation with Adrian Gloade and that she was told at that time that she did not get the licence as it was given to Frank Gloade.\n[50] As a result, Ms. Tabor did not receive a captain\u2019s license for the 2008 lobster season.\n(vi) Experience of other women in Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery\n[51] Ms. Tabor also testified that, to the best of her knowledge, there has never been a female captain in the Millbrook fishery. Furthermore, very few women work in the fishery, and those that do, work in low-level positions, usually on land, or perform administrative duties. Ms. Tabor feels angry, hurt, frustrated, humiliated, degraded, embarassed and, at times, depressed that her own First Nation would exclude her from its fishery. She testified that the whole experience leading to her complaint has \u201ctaken the wind out of her sails\u201d and that she is exhausted by having to continually try to prove herself to people who do not want to take notice of her.\n[52] Ms. Gloade also testified as to her experience as a Band Councillor for Millbrook First Nation for almost 20 years. She raised local women\u2019s issues before Band Council on many occasions. She stated she was always outvoted on issues regarding women at Band Council. Based on her observations and experiences on Band Council, she believes women, including Ms. Tabor, are treated differently than men in Millbrook.\n[53] Ms. Bernard, also in her experience as a Band Councillor for over 14 years and receptionist for Millbrook for approximately 9 years, corroborated Ms. Gloade\u2019s assertions regarding women in Millbrook First Nation. Ms. Bernard testified that women are treated differently than men and that many leaders and councillors of the community believe women should not work and should stay at home with their children. In her view, this kind of thinking is commonplace in Millbrook. Ms. Bernard added that, to her knowledge, there are very few women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery, and the ones that do, mostly work low-level positions in the office or baiting traps on the wharf.\nC. Prima facie case established\n[54] Ms. and Mr. Tabor testified for many hours, but answered questions succinctly and without hesitation. More importantly, their testimony was consistent with the allegations in the complaint and their affidavits, even when challenged under cross-examination. Mr. Tabor testified with a considerable amount of detail that corroborated Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony. Although married to Ms. Tabor, I had no reason to believe Mr. Tabor was testifying in a self-serving manner in support of his wife. Overall, I found Ms. and Mr. Tabor\u2019s evidence to be credible and reliable.\n[55] Ms. Gloade and Ms. Bernard also corroborated the larger context of Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence regarding the way women in Millbrook and, more specifically, in the fisheries are treated.\n[56] When considered as a whole, the evidence brought forward in support of Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint shows, on a prima facie basis, a pattern whereby she has been denied employment opportunities in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. It begins with the comments by Mr. Cope, a prominent authority and decision-maker in the community. Mr. Cope\u2019s comments may indicate Millbrook\u2019s attitude towards employing women in the fishery. Coupled with her difficulty in getting funding for her captain\u2019s training, the subtle scent of discrimination begins to permeate.\n[57] Despite her training and experience, including obtaining a Master Limited certificate with all its corresponding requirements of sea time experience and other certifications, Ms. Tabor only rises to the position of First Mate with the Millbrook fishery. Her one season as a First Mate coming in 2002 when there is a shortage of fishers. Otherwise, from 2000 to 2003 Ms. Tabor works mostly as a Deckhand on a few occasions.\n[58] From 2004 to 2006, despite contacting the Band office and Adrian Gloade multiple times by phone and in person for a job opportunity to go out fishing, Ms. Tabor cannot secure employment with Millbrook\u2019s fishery. Ms. Bernard testified that Ms. Tabor\u2019s requests for employment in the fishery are not taken seriously by officials in Millbrook because she is a woman. This further corroborates Millbrook\u2019s prima facie attitude towards employing women to fish in its fishery.\n[59] In contrast to Ms. Tabor, Mr. Tabor begins fishing for Millbrook at the request of Adrian Gloade and receives employment in the fishery without issue, including regular work in both the lobster and snow crab fishery every year. Adrian Gloade even approaches him about getting his captain\u2019s training. Once Mr. Tabor completes his captain\u2019s training, and despite not meeting all the requirements to get his captain\u2019s certification, he quickly rises in rank, becoming a captain in 2006 without asking for it. This notwithstanding failing some drug tests.\n[60] In 2007, Mr. Tabor\u2019s second year as a captain, he attempts to hire Ms. Tabor on his crew. It takes much convincing on his part for Millbrook to agree thereto. At the end of the 2007 lobster season, disagreements arise between Mr. Tabor and Millbrook over gear storage and sales, along with a small claims court action. The result of the small claims court action is that Mr. Tabor is told he will never work for Millbrook again. He in fact has not returned to work for Millbrook since that time.\n[61] All these facts culminate with Millbrook\u2019s decision not to award Ms. Tabor a captain\u2019s license in 2008. By her account, despite making her intentions known, Millbrook did not even consider her for the role of captain. This is consistent with Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence regarding the way Millbrook treated her other applications for work in the fishery from 2004-2006. It is also consistent with Ms. Tabor\u2019s other evidence regarding Millbrook\u2019s views of women working in the fishery.\n[62] Based on the prima facie facts leading up to the 2008 decision, I am satisfied on a prima facie basis that sex was at least a factor in Ms. Tabor being denied the captain\u2019s license. Therefore, a prima facie case under section 7 of the CHRA, based on sex, has been established.\n[63] On a prima facie basis, I am also satisfied that the fact that Ms. Tabor is married to Mr. Tabor was a factor in Millbrook\u2019s decision not to award her a captain\u2019s license in 2008. The ground of marital status encompasses discrimination based on the particular identify of a spouse or family member (see B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66). In my view, there is a prima facie link between the alleged performance issues Millbrook had with Mr. Tabor\u2019s captaincy in 2007; the 2007 small claims action; Mr. Tabor\u2019s assertion that he was told he would not work for Millbrook again; and, Ms. Tabor not being considered for a captaincy in 2008. Given the sequence and proximity of the events between 2006 and 2008, and Millbrook\u2019s hesitance to allow Mr. Tabor to hire Ms. Tabor in 2007, I believe sufficient evidence was presented to warrant an explanation from Millbrook as to the marital status allegation. Therefore, I am satisfied that a prima facie case under section 7, based on marital status, has also been established.\n[64] Finally, the combined evidence of Ms. Tabor, Ms. Gloade and Ms. Bernard on their experience in Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery leads me to believe, on a prima facie basis, that Ms. Tabor\u2019s experience may be reflective of a larger practice whereby women are deprived of employment opportunities in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence regarding the comments about women in the fishery and her difficulty in gaining employment with Millbrook\u2019s fishery; combined with Ms. Gloade and Ms. Bernard\u2019s evidence regarding Ms. Tabor\u2019s treatment; how women\u2019s issues are not taken seriously by Millbrook; that very few woman work in the fishery; and, that those who do work in the fishery, are given low-level positions, satisfies me that a prima facie case, pursuant to section 10(a) of the CHRA, has been established on the ground of sex.\nD. Millbrook First Nation\u2019s response to the complaint\n[65] As mentioned above, Millbrook led evidence to attempt to demonstrate that its actions were not discriminatory. It addressed each aspect of Ms. Tabor\u2019s case: (i) the derogatory comments regarding women; (ii) Ms. Tabor\u2019s difficulty in getting funding for her captain\u2019s training; (iii) Ms. Tabor\u2019s experience with Millbrook and its fishery from 2003-2006; (iii) the 2007 lobster season; (iv) the 2008 captain\u2019s license; and, (v) the experience of other women in Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery.\n[66] From Millbrook\u2019s initial response to this complaint to the Commission in 2008; to the filling of its affidavits before the Tribunal; and, finally, to its presentation of testimonial evidence at the hearing of this matter, Millbrook\u2019s explanations to the actions giving rise to this complaint were constantly changing and evolving. Various inconsistencies in Millbrook\u2019s position and evidence will be highlighted in the following pages. Overall, I find Millbrook\u2019s evidence to be unconvincing, unreliable and pretextual. Having considered all of Millbrook\u2019s evidence and weighing it against the evidence offered by Ms. Tabor, on a balance of probabilities, I find Millbrook discriminated against Ms. Tabor.\n(i) Derogatory comments regarding women\n[67] In responding to the allegation that he made comments to the effect that the only place for women\/breasts on a boat was on the bow as a figurehead, Mr. Cope\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his sworn affidavit.\n[68] In his affidavit he swore he never made the comment in 1996. With regard to the allegation that the comment was repeated in 2005, Mr. Cope swore in his affidavit that it was actually Mr. Tabor who made the comment then. He added that he found it saddening that Mr. Tabor was now attributing the comment to him in order to advance Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint.\n[69] In his testimony in chief, Mr. Cope confirmed the statements in his affidavit. However, on cross-examination, he was presented with Millbrook\u2019s initial response to the complaint before the Commission, filed by its counsel and dated September 2, 2008. A portion of that response states:\nAlex Cope does agree that he made the comment regarding the front of the boat however, he made the comment in jest to Ms. Tabor\u2019s husband, Craig Tabor, who is Alex Cope\u2019s nephew.\n[70] Mr. Cope then explained that he may have said the comments jokingly, along with others who were saying it as well. According to him, it was an ongoing joke and not specifically directed at Ms. Tabor.\n[71] Mr. Cope\u2019s testimony on this issue was unconvincing and unreliable. It is clear the comments were made. Based on Mr. Cope\u2019s comment that it was an \u201congoing joke\u201d, and Ms. and Mr. Tabor\u2019s prima facie evidence, I find the comments were also made on more than one occasion. The fact that the September 2008 statement mentions the comments were made to Mr. Tabor also leads me to accept Ms. and Mr. Tabor\u2019s evidence that the comments were directed towards Ms. Tabor in 2005.\n(ii) Difficulty getting funding for captain\u2019s training\n[72] In his affidavit, Mr. Cope stated Millbrook was reluctant to pay for Ms. Tabor\u2019s captain\u2019s training course because she had previously enrolled in the course in 1997, but did not finish it. However, when testifying, he explained that Millbrook initially offered the course to ten people. Ms. Tabor only found out about the training once the spots were full; and, Millbrook was not initially willing to fund her spot as she circumvented the Band by going directly to the school to get another spot opened up. This resulted in one more spot than Millbrook was willing to fund. Adrian Gloade also testified that Ms. Tabor only expressed interest in the training once the spots were full and that she contacted the school directly and had a spot opened up for her.\n[73] On this issue, Millbrook also challenged the reliability of Ms. Clara Gloade\u2019s evidence regarding Ms. Tabor\u2019s difficulty in getting funding for captain\u2019s training. According to Millbrook, Ms. Gloade\u2019s recollection of people and events, in general, was not accurate. Millbrook also noted that Ms. Gloade has spent her lifetime championing First Nations women\u2019s issues in Nova Scotia; therefore, it is not surprising to hear how she describes the situation of First Nations women in Millbrook. According to Millbrook, it would be counter-intuitive for someone, whose very essence and entire career has centered around the plight of Aboriginal woman in Nova Scotia, to suggest anything less than she did about the Millbrook Fishery.\n[74] While I agree Ms. Gloade\u2019s memory has faded, and that she could not recall some events and some individuals, this does not, in my view, affect the reliability of her whole testimony. On the specific point that she attempted to champion Ms. Tabor\u2019s cause before Millbrook\u2019s Council to obtain funding for her course at the School of Fisheries, and her understanding from Ms. Tabor that this was because Millbrook was reluctant to fund her course, I find her evidence reliable. I also accept her evidence that women are treated differently than men in Millbrook as will be discussed later in these reasons.\n[75] While Ms. Gloade\u2019s testimony is not determinative of why Ms. Tabor was initially denied funding for her captain\u2019s training, it does corroborate Ms. Tabor\u2019s assertion that she had challenges receiving funding.\n[76] I do find it concerning however that Millbrook would argue that, given Ms. Gloade defended First Nations women\u2019s rights all her life, this necessarily affects her credibility. I find this to be an unwarranted attack on her integrity as nothing in her evidence leads me to question her motives for testifying or the credibility of what she said.\n[77] Overall, I find Millbrook\u2019s explanation for Ms. Tabor\u2019s difficulty in getting funding for her captain\u2019s training to be unreliable and unconvincing.\n[78] Ms. Tabor explained the reason why she did not complete the course in 1997: it was to take care of her father who was ill. This is a legitimate reason for dropping out of the course and was not challenged by Millbrook.\n[79] In this regard, I note Mr. Cope\u2019s response about Millbrook\u2019s willingness to only fund a certain amount of spots was not previously raised in his affidavit. Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit simply stated:\n37. Millbrook was originally hesitant to pay for Stacy\u2019s enrollment in this program as Millbrook had previously provided funding for Stacy for a course in 1997 and Stacy walked away from the program without finishing. It is not Millbrook\u2019s practice to fund additional education programs when a band member has failed to complete an earlier program (this point is also relevant to a later complaint).\n[80] Incidentally, I also note Mr. Cope testified after, and was present for, Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony explaining why she left the course in 1997 and describing Mr. Cope\u2019s statements to her in 1998. In my view, the inconsistency between Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit and testimony puts the credibility of Mr. Cope\u2019s response to this issue in question. I believe Mr. Cope adjusted his response to this allegation in light of Ms. Tabor\u2019s testimony.\n[81] Mr. Cope\u2019s explanation for Millbrook\u2019s initial denial of funding is also unconvincing when weighed against Ms. Tabor\u2019s prima facie evidence. That is, Mr. Cope stated there were ten spots being funded by Millbrook at the school. However, Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence was that she only recognized two community members at the training. If only 2 out of 10 spots showed up to the training this may explain why Millbrook eventually agreed to pay for Ms. Tabor\u2019s training, but that explanation was not advanced by Millbrook. Rather, during his testimony, Mr. Cope explained: \u201cWe contested it but ended up paying for the spot because we have a reputation of paying our bills\u201d.\n[82] Aside from Mr. Cope\u2019s testimony, Millbrook did not substantiate the funding of ten spots at the school or that Ms. Tabor\u2019s attendance at the school resulted in an extra spot that Millbrook had to fund. Considering the evidence on this issue as a whole, and in view of my findings that Millbrook\u2019s explanation here is not credible or convincing, I find it more probable than not that Millbrook simply did not want Ms. Tabor to attend captain\u2019s training.\n(iii) Experience with Millbrook and its fishery from 2003-2006\n[83] Millbrook\u2019s explanation for Ms. Tabor\u2019s alleged difficulties in gaining employment with the fishery from 2003-2006 is that she chose to stay at home with her son. It was Adrian Gloade\u2019s understanding that the Tabors had decided that Ms. Tabor would stay home and care for their son while Mr. Tabor went out to fish.\n[84] While Ms. Tabor did stay at home for some time in 2003 following the birth of her son, her prima facie evidence was that, from 2004 to 2006, she made several attempts to gain employment in Millbrook\u2019s fishery without success. Aside from working some non-fishing jobs, she stayed at home with her children during this time, not voluntarily, but rather because she was ignored, laughed at and, ultimately, not able to get a job in the fishery.\n[85] Ms. Bernard corroborated Ms. Tabor\u2019s assertion regarding her attempts to gain employment in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. Millbrook challenged the credibility of Ms. Bernard\u2019s testimony on this issue as well. As a Band Councillor, and having allegedly witnessed discrimination, Millbrook questions why she did not raise the issue at Band Council or before the Fisheries Committee. Millbrook also questioned the motives behind her testimony, because she left Band Council on bad terms.\n[86] Ms. Bernard gave me no reason to doubt her testimony that she witnessed Ms. Tabor coming to seek work in the fisheries on numerous occasions and that her application was not taken seriously. Aside from Millbrook questioning the motives behind Ms. Bernard\u2019s testimony, it did not demonstrate in its evidence anything to refute Ms. Bernard\u2019s testimony or Ms. Tabor\u2019s interest in gaining employment in its fishery from 2004 to 2006.\n[87] While Millbrook questioned Ms. Tabor\u2019s interest in fishing given she was not pursuing further training and certifications, her unchallenged response was that she gave up on these options because the First Nation did not support her through funding or related employment opportunities. Ms. Tabor\u2019s repeated and consistent response is credible and reasonable given she fished in 2007 when given the opportunity and kept pursuing that opportunity in 2008. Therefore, in my view, Adrian Gloade\u2019s testimony regarding Ms. Tabor\u2019s child care responsibilities does not provide a reasonable explanation as to why she was not able to secure employment in Millbrook\u2019s fishery from 2004-2006.\n(iv) 2007 lobster season\n[88] Millbrook\u2019s evidence on this issue focused on alleged performance issues it had with Ms. and Mr. Tabor\u2019s tenure on the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007.\n[89] On the gear storage issue, Millbrook claims the Tabors left their fishing gear on the wharf for weeks and that it received complaints about this from workers on the wharf. It claims it eventually had to pay to hire a third party to remove and store the gear. Mr. Tabor did not deny the fishing gear from the Chief Rachael Marshall was left on the wharf longer than usual, but questioned the need to hire a third party to remove it.\n[90] Millbrook also claims the Tabors did not bring the boat back in proper condition. It provided pictures to show the boat before and after the 2007 lobster season to illustrate the damage the Tabors allegedly did to the boat.\n[91] The pictures of the boat presented by Millbrook were undated. Adrian Gloade, who brought forward the pictures, testified that he did not take them and was unsure as to when they were taken. It is also difficult to see any difference between the before and after pictures, aside from a difference in cleanliness. Four of the nine pictures are of rope wrapped around the propeller. No damage to the boat is apparent from the pictures.\n[92] In response to Millbrook, Mr. Tabor explained that there is normal wear and tear to any fishing boat at the end of the season. While he encountered problems with the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007, he had previously identified those issues to Millbrook following the 2006 season, however, they were not fixed prior to the 2007 season. Otherwise, the only deficiency with the boat he encountered at the end of the 2007 season was a rope that had wrapped around the propeller, which happened on the last day of the season. Mr. Tabor was not aware of any maintenance issues with the boat until Millbrook\u2019s counsel filed its response to this complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) in 2008.. Mr. Tabor added that, while a captain is responsible for maintaining the condition of the boat, for example by changing the engine oil, a captain is not a boat mechanic. Mechanical issues with the boat or its engine are dealt with by a trained mechanic, which Millbrook has on staff. Mr. Tabor explained how he changed the engine oil during the 2007 season and mounted a protector over the propeller in an attempt to keep the boat\u2019s fins from cutting the lobster trap lines.\n[93] I find the boat maintenance issues raised by Millbrook in relation to the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007 to be unreasonable and pretextual. Aside from the statements of Adrian Gloade and Mr. Cope, and the problematic before and after pictures, Millbrook did not substantiate that there was any damage caused to the Chief Rachael Marshall by Mr. Tabor in 2007 or any repairs needed to the boat as a result. It is telling that Mr. Tabor was only made aware of these alleged maintenance issues when Millbrook, through its counsel, filed its response to the complaint before the Commission in 2008. In contrast, with the gear and sales issues, Millbrook confronted Mr. Tabor shortly after they arose, requested compensation from him and provided details to support the allegations, including a bill in the case of the gear storage issue. With the maintenance issues, no compensation was requested from Mr. Tabor and no details were provided as to what damage Mr. Tabor allegedly caused to the boat in 2007. In this regard, clause 1(15) of the Employment Agreement between Millbrook and Mr. Tabor in 2007 provided (emphasis added):\nOn the termination or end of the term of this Agreement, the Captain shall return the Vessel to the First Nation on or before the date of termination or the last day of the term, and the Captain shall return the Vessel to the First Nation in substantially the same condition as it was in when the Captain took possession of her, fair wear and tear expected, and the Captain may return the Vessel by properly securing it to the wharf as designated by the First Nation, and immediately notifying the First Nation of the Vessel's whereabouts. The Captain and a representative of the First Nation shall do a survey of the Vessel to determine the condition of the Vessel and to ensure the Vessel is in substantially the same condition as it was when the captain took possession of her.\nNo survey of the Chief Rachael Marshall from the 2007 lobster season was filed in evidence. In my view, all the above reasons demonstrate Millbrook\u2019s alleged maintenance issues with the Chief Racahel Marshall in 2007 are pretextual.\n[94] Adrian Gloade and Ms. Dawn Ellis, Senior Finance Clerk for the Millbrook First Nation fishery, also provided extensive evidence on how captains are paid and how the First Nation makes money through the fisheries. This was related to the disagreement between Millbrook and Mr. Tabor regarding lobster sales from the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007.\n[95] In sum, a captain and crew\u2019s pay is determined at the start of the season, with approval from Millbrook. The First Nation provides the boat and supplies and recovers those expenses from the sale of the lobsters caught. It also takes a percentage of the sales as its profit, with the remainder going back to the captain. When a boat comes to shore, the lobster catch is weighed and a landing slip is provided to the captain accounting for the amount of lobsters caught. The captain then sells the lobsters to a buyer approved by Millbrook. The buyer pays Millbrook directly and the amount is credited to the captain\u2019s boat.\n[96] On this issue, Millbrook\u2019s September 2008 response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint claimed: \u201cMr. and Ms. Tabor took lobster to another buyer outside of the Band after being specifically told not to do so\u201d. Adrian Gloade testified that the First Nation did not receive payment for the final weeks of Mr. Tabor\u2019s 2007 lobster season. He called Millbrook\u2019s approved buyer, who stated they had not dealt with Mr. Tabor. According to Adrian Gloade, once he determined who Mr. Tabor had sold his lobster catch to, he asked them if they knew they were to send payment for the lobsters to the First Nation and not to Mr. Tabor. The buyer was not aware of this and were going to pay Mr. Tabor. Therefore, payment to Mr. Tabor was stopped and sent to Millbrook instead.\n[97] In response, Mr. Tabor explained that he only ever sold his lobster catches to J & K Fisheries or North Nova in 2007, Millbrook\u2019s two approved buyers.\n[98] On cross-examination, Adrian Gloade testified that he probably gave Mr. Tabor permission to sell to another buyer, he was just not informed of the change and the buyer was not instructed to pay the First Nation. This is contradictory to Millbrook\u2019s previously stated 2008 response. Then Adrian Gloade was presented with accounting documentation indicating payments from the approved buyer to Millbrook, including a copy of a dated cheque, which coincide with Mr. Tabor\u2019s final weeks of the 2007 lobster season. His response was that the cheques arrived late and the approved buyer had told him that they did not deal with Mr. Tabor. Ultimately, Adrian Gloade testified that he was not aware of any intentional discrepancies with Mr. Tabor\u2019s sales during the 2007 season. As a result, I find Adrian Gloade\u2019s evidence on this issue to be unreliable.\n[99] With regard to the sales shortfall between Mr. Tabor\u2019s pay and the landings from his boat, Ms. Ellis stated that the shortfall occurred because Mr. Tabor\u2019s expenses and weekly pay draws exceeded the weekly catches. In Ms. Ellis\u2019 opinion, the cause of the shortfall was because Mr. Tabor\u2019s pay seemed high. Ms. Ellis added that since 2008, Millbrook has set a standard pay for captains and crew members in response to these types of shortfalls.\n[100] I found Ms. Ellis\u2019 evidence to be reliable. What I draw from her evidence on the lobster sales shortfall issue is that Millbrook and Mr. Tabor were in conflict with each other over this issue. As explained above, Mr. Tabor believes there are discrepencies in Millbrook\u2019s accounting for the sales of the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007 and that some sales were not properly attributed to this boat.\n[101] It is also clear that Millbrook and Mr. Tabor were in conflict over the gear storage issue. Mr. Tabor also provided prima facie evidence on his conflict with Millbrook over Frank Gloade\u2019s small claims court action. Despite these conflicts, Millbrook denies saying to Mr. Tabor that he would never work for them again or that it prevented him from fishing for them since that time. According to Millbrook, Mr. Tabor was no longer interested in fishing after 2007, which it claims is evidenced by the fact that he pursued studies in other fields.\n[102] While it is true that Mr. Tabor went on to study other fields, I also accept his explanation that he did this as an alternative to Millbrook\u2019s refusal to hire him. This is corroborated by Millbrook\u2019s September 2008 response to the complaint:\nNeither Mr. nor Ms. Tabor were issued permanent contracts through the Band for the 2008 fishing season due to the issues that the Band had with respect to the boat operated by Mr. and Ms. Tabor during the 2007 fishing season.\nFurther, Mr. Tabor was not considered for an employment contract because he had informed the Band he had taken the RCMP entrance exam and was waiting to hear back from the RCMP with respect to entering their training program and that he also intended to take the Band\u2019s heavy equipment course so that he could go to western Canada to work.\n[103] I find the conflict between Millbrook and Mr. Tabor over gear storage, sales and the small claims court action were factors in Millbrook\u2019s refusal to hire Mr. Tabor in 2008. I also find Millbrook\u2019s refusal to hire Mr. Tabor then factors into Millbrook\u2019s decision not to hire Ms. Tabor in 2008.\n[104] That is, aside from Millbrook claiming there was a more qualified candidate for the captain\u2019s license in 2008, Millbrook argues Ms. Tabor\u2019s performance in 2007 provided added justification for its licensing decision. In its view, given it was mostly a two person crew in 2007, it was reasonable that it would discuss performance issues regarding the Tabors when deciding on the most qualified person to captain the vessel the following year. Furthermore, according to Millbrook, their Employment Agreement with Mr. and Ms. Tabor in 2007 held both the captain and crew responsible for many duties. Millbrook contends Ms. Tabor\u2019s performance issues in 2007 included, based on its Employment Agreement, holding her responsible with Mr. Tabor for any deficiencies in maintenance, gear storage and sales. Millbrook specifically referred to clauses 1, 1(1), 1(3), 1(10) and 2 of the Employment Agreement as holding the captain and crew responsible for issues related to the boat.\n[105] There is nothing in the Employment Agreement that convinces me that Ms. Tabor could be held responsible for issues related to sales, maintenance and gear storage. Most of the duties and responsibilities enunciated in the Employment Agreement begin with the recital \u201cThe Captain shall\u2026\u201d, including maintaining the vessel and equipment in good condition (clauses 1(1) and 1(5)) and sales (clauses 1(6) and 1(7)). The Employment Agreement also holds the captain strictly liable for any damage to the boat:\nThe Captain acknowledges that he is responsible for the cost of any damage, loss of and\/or repairs pertaining to the fishing vessel, its equipment, (mechanical, electronic etc.) and fishing gear that is attributable, directly or indirectly, to the negligence of the Captain and or the Crew Members under his command.\n[106] The other clauses referred to by Millbrook state:\nClause 1: The Captain and the Crew Members (the first mate and the deck hand) shall be available to work at reasonable times and for reasonable periods of times to perform such duties as are required by the First Nation.\nClause 1(3): The Captain and the Crew Members shall fish the First Nation's Vessel during the 2007 lobster season in LFA-26-A, until the conclusion of the 2007 lobster season, [\u2026] and is to carry out such fishing duties in a diligent, effective and efficient manner.\nClause 1(10): The Captain is responsible for any training and command of the Crew Members on the Vessel during the 2007, LFA- 26- A, lobster season and the periods required before and after the season to maintain the Vessel and equipment.\nClause 2: The term of this Agreement is for the term, commencing the 1st day of May 2007 and ending two (2) weeks after the end of the Lobster season (15th July 2007). A breach of any term or condition of this agreement by the Captain or a crew member shall be deemed \"just Cause\" for dismissal of that person and the First Nation may terminate the services of that person or persons for a the breach of any term or condition of this Agreement [\u2026].\nIt is not clear to me how these clauses relate to sales, maintenance and\/or gear storage, let alone that they support Millbrook\u2019s argument of holding the crew responsible for these issues.\n[107] Aside from Ms. Tabor being a crew member on the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007, Millbrook did not convince me that the gear storage and alleged sales issues, along with the pretextual maintenance issues, somehow demonstrated poor performance by Ms. Tabor. There was insufficient evidence that Millbrook did a performance evaluation for the captain and crew of the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007, let alone that an individualized assessment of Ms. Tabor\u2019s performance was done.\n[108] Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade did comment on the state of the Chief Rachael Marshall\u2019s engine following the 2007 lobster season, and that this reflected Ms. Tabor\u2019s inability to change the oil of a boat. However, aside from making this comment, Millbrook did not substantiate this claim. Furthermore, Ms. Tabor explained that she knows how to change the oil of a boat, however she did not change the oil of the Chief Rachael Marshall in 2007. In my view, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade\u2019s unsubstantiated claim about Ms. Tabor\u2019s ability to change the oil of a boat adds to my finding that the maintenance issues alleged by Millbrook from the 2007 lobster season are contrived.\n[109] I also believe associating the gear storage and alleged sale issues to Ms. Tabor is pretextual as well. As I found above, Millbrook was in conflict with Mr. Tabor over the gear storage and sales issues, along with the small claims court action. This resulted in Mr. Tabor being excluded from future work with Millbrook. Given Millbrook\u2019s insufficient explanation and evidence in support of associating the gear storage and alleged sales issues to Ms. Tabor, I believe it is more probable than not that Millbrook grouped Ms. Tabor into the conflict it had with Mr. Tabor because she is his wife. In fact, Ms. Tabor assisted Mr. Tabor in challenging the alleged sales issues by advocating on his behalf before Band Council regarding those issues.\n[110] If Mr. Tabor was excluded from future work because of his conflict with Millbrook, and Ms. Tabor is associated with this conflict as well, it is probable that Millbrook excluded her from future work on this basis as well. For this reason, I believe Ms. Tabor\u2019s marital status was a factor in her not being considered for a captain\u2019s license in 2008.\n[111] As will be explained in the following pages, I also believe Ms. Tabor\u2019s sex was a factor in her not being considered for a captain\u2019s license in 2008.\n(v) 2008 captain\u2019s license\n[112] Millbrook contends Ms. Tabor did not formally apply for the captain\u2019s license in 2008. Despite this, Millbrook argues that it appropriately considered her for the license and compared her qualifications to the other two candidates who applied for the license before making their choice. In comparing Ms. Tabor\u2019s qualifications to those of Frank Gloade, the candidate chosen for the license, Millbrook says his qualifications were superior.\n[113] In my view, Millbrook\u2019s position, that Ms. Tabor did not apply but was still considered for the 2008 captain\u2019s license, is contradictory and pretextual. I find Millbrook did not consider Ms. Tabor for a captain\u2019s license in 2008 because she is a woman and because of the conflict it had in 2007 with Mr. Tabor.\n[114] On the first point about not formally applying, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade testified that, while Ms. Tabor had attended a Band Council meeting in January 2008 and stated her intention to apply for the captain\u2019s license, she did not formally apply and they did not hear from her again after this. Two other candidates contacted the Band office and applied for a license.\n[115] When Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade were asked how a person formally applies for a license, they agreed that there is no formal application process. Rather, a candidate is required to contact Adrian Gloade and, subsequently, take and pass a drug test. This is consistent with Mr. and Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence that there is no formal process to apply for a position with the Millbrook fishery. That is, you only need to make your intention known and a job is usually made available. However, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade\u2019s reversal in positions \u2013 formal application process vs. no formal application process \u2013 highlights another reason for me to question the reliability of their evidence.\n[116] Despite the lack of a formal application, according to Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade, in early 2008 the Fisheries Committee held a meeting where it discussed the candidates for the captain\u2019s license, including Ms. Tabor. During that meeting, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade state the Fisheries Committee determined Frank Gloade had better qualifications and more experience than Ms. Tabor. As a result, Frank Gloade was promised the captain\u2019s license, subject to drug testing.\n[117] On this issue, Adrian Gloade initially testified that he did not recall having a conversation with Ms. Tabor following the decision to promise Frank Gloade the captain\u2019s license. However, on cross-examination, he stated that, while he may have spoken to Ms. Tabor, she only asked him about the bidding process for the fishing license. He claims he did not inform her at that time that she would not receive the license.\n[118] I find Adrian\u2019s Gloade\u2019s statement is not credible as it does not fit with the preponderance of evidence in this case. It is logical that Adrian Gloade and Ms. Tabor would discuss the process for allocating fishing licenses (open bid system or employment contract), given Ms. Tabor had attended a Council meeting and stated her intention to apply for a captain\u2019s license. However, it does not seem probable that they would have only spoken about the process for allocating fishing licenses given the Chief Rachael Marshall license Ms. Tabor was interested in had already been promised to Frank Gloade.\n[119] The timing of this conversation coinsides with when Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade say the Fisheries Committee met and determined Frank Gloade would be awarded the license. It further coinsides with Ms. and Mr. Tabor\u2019s prima facie evidence regarding when they spoke to Adrian Gloade. In response to Millbrook, Ms. Tabor added that, as the decision to award the captain\u2019s license to Frank Gloade was made before drug testing occurred on April 9, 2008, she saw no reason to take the drug test. In my view, Ms. Tabor\u2019s explanation and evidence on this issue is logical and credible. I find Adrian Gloade informed her in January or February 2008 that she would not receive the captain\u2019s license. His statement to the contrary is unreliable.\n[120] To reinforce its decision to hire Frank Gloade over Ms. Tabor, Millbrook called Mr. Allan Tobey to testify. He was qualified as an expert on the Fisheries Act and its regulations, and their application to Frank Gloade and Ms. Tabor in comparing them for a captaincy. He also provided a report, which opines as to who was more qualified to captain a fishing boat in 2008 as between the two candidates.\n[121] Mr. Tobey\u2019s report concludes Frank Gloade was more qualified in 2008, based on having superior training (a Fishing Master IV Class certificate) and experience (fished for lobster in Lismore in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006). To form his opinion, Mr. Tobey was provided with Frank Gloade\u2019s \u201caffidavit\u201d, an unsigned statement, prepared by Millbrook\u2019s counsel, attesting to Mr. Gloade\u2019s qualifications and filed on consent of the parties for the truth of its contents. Mr. Tobey\u2019s evaluation of Ms. Tabor\u2019s qualifications was based on \u201ca copy of someone\u2019s affidavit\u201d and he was told that she had been a student Deckhand for a few years but no area was specified. Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit provides information on Ms. Tabor\u2019s qualifications as described by Mr. Tobey:\na) 2001 \u2013 student deckhand with Millbrook fisheries;\nb) 2002 \u2013 student deckhand with Millbrook fisheries;\nc) 2002-2003 \u2013 student deckhand with Millbrook fisheries;\nd) 2007 \u2013 First Mate on Chief Rachel Marshall.\nMr. Cope\u2019s affidavit also specifies that Ms. Tabor received her Master Limited certificate in 1998.\n[122] On cross-examination, it came out that Mr. Tobey was not provided with a complete overview of Ms. Tabor\u2019s seafaring experience prior to working for Millbrook, along with other training certificates she received for simulated electronic navigation, marine emergency duties, and proficiency in radio. In response, Mr. Tobey became defensive and was dismissive of Complaintant Counsel\u2019s suggestion that some of the additional training certificates were superior to the certifications held by Frank Gloade. In Mr. Tobey\u2019s opinion, Ms. Tabor\u2019s additional experience and certifications were related to the shipping industry. As his opinion was sought and delivered based on a comparison of the \u201cfishing experience\u201d and \u201cactual experience in Lismore\u201d, this additional information did not change his opinion that Frank Gloade was more qualified. Ms. Tabor had an inferior captain\u2019s certificate (Master Limited) and had only one fishing season in Lismore (2007). Her two other fishing seasons being in Pictou Landing (2001-2002); and, she did not complete the fishing season in 2003.\n[123] I did not find Mr. Tobey\u2019s evidence to be reliable or useful in this case. Mr. Tobey was provided with incomplete information to make a comparison of the qualifications of Ms. Tabor and Frank Gloade; and, the information he was provided with came solely from Millbrook. In this regard, I note Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit prefaces Ms. Tabor\u2019s fishing experience from 2001-2003 as being \u201cstudent\u201d. Mr. Cope explained that this was because Ms. Tabor was part of a mentoring program during this time. While less experienced fishers may mentor with more experienced fishers, and I note some of Mr. Tabor and Frank Gloade\u2019s experience was described as \u201cmentoring\u201d; that said, neither Mr. Tabor nor Frank Gloade were described as \u201cstudents\u201d while they mentored. In my view, Mr. Cope\u2019s characterization of Ms. Tabor as a \u201cstudent\u201d from 2001-2003 is an obvious attempt to discredit her fishing experience.\n[124] Along with the one-sided information relied upon to produce his expert report, the fact that Mr. Tobey was so fixed in his opinion and not open to challenges thereon, makes me question the neutrality of his opinion. In any event, even if I accept Frank Gloade was more qualified than Ms. Tabor in 2008, Mr. Tobey\u2019s opinion does not assist in determining whether a comparison of the qualifications of candidates was actually done by Millbrook or that Ms. Tabor was actually considered for the 2008 captain\u2019s license.\n[125] In this regard, Millbrook also pointed out that Ms. Tabor\u2019s Master Limited certificate was expired in 2008. Millbrook adds that it is improbable that she would have been able to reacquire her certifications prior to the 2008 lobster season. I fail to see why the fact that her Master Limited certificate was expired in 2008 is relevant to Millbrook\u2019s position in response to this complaint. While it may reinforce its argument that Frank Gloade was more qualified than Ms. Tabor, it does not shed light on Millbrook\u2019s position that a comparison of the qualifications of candidates was actually done. As mentioned above, I do not believe Ms. Tabor was considered for a license, let alone that her qualifications were considered alongside those of Frank Gloade.\n[126] On this issue, both Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade stated in their affidavits and testifed before the Tribunal that Millbrook is required to submit each captain\u2019s certificate to their insurance company. According to them, insurance rates will depend on the qualifications of the captain. They must select the highest qualified captain who applies, because insurance is very costly for new or inexperienced captains and, if there is an accident, Millbrook would have to explain why a more experienced captain was not chosen.\n[127] However, on cross-examination, neither Mr. Cope nor Adrian Gloade were able to say whether there was actually a cost difference between different captains based on experience and qualifications. Nor were they able to produce any insurance documentation in this regard. Given Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade were unable to substantiate their claim, whether through their testimony or through documentation, that there is different insurance premiums based on the qualifications and experience of captains, I find Millbrook\u2019s insurance argument to be pretextual.\n[128] Furthermore, according to Millbrook, experience fishing in Lismore was a heavily weighed consideration in awarding the captain\u2019s license. Frank Gloade had fished for lobster in Lismore from 2003 to 2006, while Ms. Tabor only had the one season in Lismore in 2007. Interestingly, Frank Gloade\u2019s experience fishing in Lismore corresponds to the same time period where Ms. Tabor could not gain employment in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. If Frank Gloade was more qualified than Ms. Tabor in 2008, it is in part because he was given training and fishing opportunities Ms. Tabor was not. As discussed previously, Frank Gloade and Mr. Tabor rapidly gained training and experience fishing for Millbrook. In some cases, Mr. Tabor did not even have to request employment or training before being offered it by Millbrook, including a captaincy. However, as Ms. Tabor established in her prima facie case, from 2004 to 2006, despite contacting the First Nation multiple times for a job, she could not secure employment with Millbrook\u2019s fishery. This lack of experience is then held against her in the 2008 competition.\n[129] In my view, the situation in 2008 was the same as it was from 2004 to 2007. Ms. Tabor testified, and was corroborated by Ms. Bernard, that her requests for employment in the fishery from 2004 to 2006 were not taken seriously by officials in Millbrook because she is a woman. Mr. Tabor also experienced resistance from Millbrook to hire Ms. Tabor as part of his crew in 2007. There is no reason to believe that Millbrook\u2019s attitude towards Ms. Tabor changed in 2008.\n[130] I find Millbrook\u2019s explanation for not awarding Ms. Tabor the captain\u2019s license in 2008, based on qualifications, to be unreliable, unconvincing and unreasonable. The impression I am left with after analyzing Millbrook`s response to this complaint is that it crafted an explanation to Ms. Tabor\u2019s allegations, after the fact, and tailored its argument and evidence in an attempt to narrow the issues in this complaint to a simple comparison of the qualifications of Ms. Tabor and Frank Gloade for the 2008 captain\u2019s license. The emphasis on qualifications, including having an expert testify on the issue in an attempt to validate a stated \u201cformal\u201d comparison of candidates; and, raising an insurance issue related to qualifications, which was not supported by any documentation or otherwise, are all indications of this. It is also contradictory in my mind, and indicative of a pretext, that Millbrook would, on one hand, argue Ms. Tabor did not apply for the captain\u2019s license in 2008 and, on the other hand, say she was fully considered based on comparing her qualifications against the other candidates who applied. As stated above, the issues in this complaint are much broader than the 2008 captain\u2019s decision and Ms. Tabor\u2019s treatment in the years leading up to that decision is indicative that she was not considered at all for that license and that Millbrook\u2019s response to this complaint is pretextual.\n[131] Furthermore, I found Millbrook\u2019s main witnesses, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade, testified in an unreliable manner. They relied heavily on their affidavits when testifying and would often times read their affidavits before answering questions. When confronted with ommissions in his affidavit, Mr. Cope responded with words to the effect of \u201cI wasn\u2019t asked the question\u201d, which puts in question the reliability of his affidavit. Most importantly, and as stated above, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade made statements during their oral evidence, which have been highlighted throughout this decision, that contradict their affidavits and Millbrook\u2019s previously stated position to the complaint, and which did not accord with the preponderance of evidence in this case. I believe Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade\u2019s evidence was changing and evolving in light of evidence in support of Ms. Tabor\u2019s case and in an attempt to justify Millbrook\u2019s actions. In this regard, I note Millbrook is their employer and many of the allegations in this complaint involve actions or decisions taken by them in their roles with Millbrook First Nation.\n[132] Overall, the evidence indicates Ms. Tabor was not considered for a captain\u2019s license in 2008 and that her sex was a factor. This finding is consistent with the way in which Ms. Tabor was treated by Millbrook when applying for jobs in the fishery from 2004 to 2006. Ms. Bernard corroborated this allegation and Millbrook did not provide a reasonable explanation to it. The fact that her lack of experience is then used against her in 2008 perpetuates the discrimination based on sex.\n[133] As a result, and pursuant to section 7 of the CHRA, I find Millbrook did not consider Ms. Tabor for a captain\u2019s license in 2008 because she is a woman.\n(vi) Experience of other women in Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery\n[134] A majority of Millbrook\u2019s witnesses, those who live in the community, asserted that as First Nations people they have been discriminated against for being First Nations and, therefore, they would not discriminate against others. Aside from these answers appearing to be rehearsed, because each witness was asked the same question and answered essentially the same way, I do not accept this logic. Having suffered discrimination does not guarantee that a person will not discriminate against another person. This is especially not convincing when the witnesses are claiming they were discriminated against on the basis of being First Nations, which is completely different from the main grounds alleged in this case: sex and marital status. With regard to discrimination based on sex, I would add that the prejudices and stereotypes surrounding differences between men and women transcend race, culture and ethnicity.\n[135] In response to the evidence that there are few women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery, let alone actually fishing, Mr. Cope and Adrian Gloade stated in their affidavits that there were 7 women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery in 2007 and 5 in 2008. Adrian Gloade believes these numbers are significant considering how small Millbrook\u2019s fishery is. According to Adrian Gloade, Millbrook hires on average 40-65 crew members annually to work on its fishing boats. He also mentioned that Millbrook encourages women to be involved in the fishery and pays for their training if they want it, which it did for Ms. Tabor as well.\n[136] According to Millbrook, the 5 women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery in 2008 were Michelle Gloade, Margaret Gloade, Jean Abram, Carla Asprey and Karen Asprey. Michelle Gloade and Karen Asprey provided affidavits and testified before the Tribunal. Margaret Gloade and Carla Asprey only provided affidavits.\n[137] Michelle Gloade works as an administrative assistant for the Millbrook fisheries office. In 2005\/2006, Carla Asprey was Manager of the Millbrook fisheries wharf and, according to Karla Asprey, now performs \u201cdock-side monitoring\u201d with the fishery. Insufficient evidence was provided to determine Jean Abram\u2019s position with the Millbrook fishery. Overall, of the 5 women identified by Millbrook, only 2 have actually fished for Millbrook: Margaret Gloade and Karen Asprey.\n[138] Margaret Gloade\u2019s affidavit indicates she works as a Deckhand fishing snow crab. She states she has been employed in the Millbrook fishery on and off for approximately 20 years. Over this period of time, she indicates she has been involved in trap construction, maintenance, cleaning boats and has worked as a Deckhand.\n[139] Ms. Asprey fishes for hagfish\/slime eels with her husband. While she holds the fishing license for their boat, her husband is the captain. She testified that she does not spend much time on the boat. Mainly, she builds traps, baits and gets supplies for the boat. She explained that, while she is not a captain, she could be if she wanted to. She is also convinced Millbrook would pay for her captain\u2019s training and certifications as it has done with others. According to Ms. Asprey, Millbrook encourages women to work in its fishery. She also testified she has never experienced discrimination on the basis of her sex from Millbrook\u2019s Fisheries Department, Mr. Cope or Adrian Gloade.\n[140] I find Ms. Asprey\u2019s testimony is not particularly convincing or useful in this case. Her statements regarding her ability to be a captain and having the First Nation pay for her training are anecdotal; and, there was no elaboration on how Millbrook encourages women to work in the fishery. Furthermore, her role in the fishery fits with those of other women in Millbrook. That is, she works mainly on land. Therefore, I do not find Ms. Asprey\u2019s testimony to be supportive of Millbrook\u2019s position of encouraging women to fish or supporting them in their pursuit of higher fisheries training.\n[141] The fact remains, as presented by Millbrook, that out of the 45-60 people working as crew members in Millbrook\u2019s fishery in 2008, 2 were women. Furthermore, it appears that women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery, especially at the time the complaint was made, predominantly occupy non-fishing positions. I find it misleading that Millbrook would say 5 women work in the fishery, and that this is significant, given only 2 actually fish and the others work non-fishing jobs. This is another example that leads me to believe Millbrook\u2019s response to this complaint is pretextual.\n[142] Currently, there are still few women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. Mr. Cope admitted there has been a steady decline in women working in the fishery. He also indicated that in 2014 there were only 4 women working in Millbrook\u2019s fishery. Based on their testimony and affidavits, these four women include Michelle Gloade, Margaret Gloade, and Karen Asprey. The fourth woman was not identified, although Mr. Cope\u2019s affidavit indicates she may work in the snow crab fishery. Otherwise, as mentioned above, only Margaret Gloade and Karen Asprey actually fish for Millbrook, with Ms. Asprey only doing a limited amount of fishing based on her testimony.\n[143] On its own, the statistical evidence of women being a minority in Millbrook\u2019s fishery does not substantiate that Ms. Tabor, or women generally, are denied employment opportunities in Millbrook\u2019s fishery (Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490 at paras. 109-110). However, it is circumstantial evidence from which inferences of discriminatory conduct may be drawn (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLII 7740 (FC) at para. 22).\n[144] In my view, the statistical evidence reinforces Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence regarding the comments about women in the fishery and her difficulty in gaining employment and funding for training within Millbrook\u2019s fishery. When combined with Mr. Tabor\u2019s evidence on his career path with Millbrook\u2019s fishery, a stark contrast between the treatment of men and women in Millbrook\u2019s fishery emerges. Finally, there was Ms. Gloade and Ms. Bernard\u2019s evidence regarding Ms. Tabor\u2019s treatment and their own experience with Millbrook\u2019s administration and fishery, evidence I found to be credible despite Millbrook\u2019s challenges thereto as addressed above. With specific regard to Ms. Gloade, I would note that while she could not remember some conversations and events, her consistent and repeated impression of her two decades on Band Coucil, through her testimony and affidavit, was that men and women are treated differently in Millbrook. This long-term impression is reliable and is distinguishable from remembering specific events or conversations. For all these reasons, I am convinced that Ms. Tabor\u2019s experience, and the statistical representation of women in Millbrook\u2019s fishery, is reflective of a practice of depriving women of employment opportunities fishing for Millbrook\u2019s fishery.\n[145] As a result, I find Millbrook has engaged in a discriminatory practice pursuant to section 10(a) of the CHRA.\nE. Complaint substantiated\n[146] In weighing all the evidence on a balance of probabilities, and pursuant to the analysis above, I find Ms. Tabor\u2019s complaint under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA to be substantiated. Ms. Tabor has presented sufficient evidence to establish that she has been denied employment opportunities to fish for Millbrook\u2019s fishery because she is a woman. This culminated in the 2008 decision not to consider her for a captaincy, where her marital status was also a factor in her being denied that employment opportunity. I also find Ms. Tabor\u2019s situation is reflective of a larger practice within Millbrook\u2019s fishery of depriving women employment opportunities to fish. I find Millbrook`s response to Ms. Tabor\u2019s evidence not to be credible and to be pretextual.\n[147] The circumstances that led to this complaint are unfortunate given the events not only happened in a small community, but amongst family members. Moving forward, I trust the parties will be able to move past this situation and achieve reconciliation. I am also hopeful that Ms. Tabor will one day be able to realize her dream of becoming a captain of a fishing boat.\nIII. Order\n[148] As the complaint has been substantiated, I may make an order against Millbrook First Nation pursuant to section 53(2) of the CHRA. However, the parties have agreed that they will first try to resolve the issue of remedy amongst themselves. I therefore invite the parties to begin settlement discussions in response to the findings in this decision. I will seek an update from the parties thereon following the release of the reasons for my decision on Ms. Tabor\u2019s retaliation complaint.\n[149] Until such time as the issue of remedy is finally resolved, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction in this matter.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 29, 2015\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1658\/01311 & T1659\/1411\nStyle of Cause:\nStacey Lee Tabor v Millbrook First Nation\nRuling of the Tribunal Dated:\nApril 29, 2015\nDate and Place of Hearing: July 28 to 30, 2014\nAugust 1, 2014\nAugust 5 to 7, 2014\nSeptember 16, 2014\nTruro, Nova Scotia\nAppearances:\nGary A.

Le contexte [1] Les plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN), ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC (1985), c H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] Le 10 juillet 2012, une formation constitu\u00e9e des membres instructeurs Marchildon, Lustig et B\u00e9langer a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente affaire (2012 TCDP 16).\n[3] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013, la Commission a rappel\u00e9 Mme Cindy Blackstock \u00e0 la barre. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un document soumis \u00e0 Mme Blackstock, et apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties sur la question, le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement l\u2019instance pour examiner l\u2019objection. Il a inform\u00e9 les parties que, comme la Commission avait l\u2019intention de soumettre de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on \u00e0 Mme Blackstock un certain nombre d\u2019autres documents nouvellement communiqu\u00e9s, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable selon lui de trancher la question de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019attendre la fin de l\u2019audience, comme les parties l\u2019avaient convenu au d\u00e9part.\n[4] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle allait dans ce cas d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, le lendemain ou peu apr\u00e8s, une requ\u00eate concernant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents. Elle a fourni au Tribunal et aux parties un avis de requ\u00eate intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance admettant des documents en preuve pour la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leur contenu \u00bb.\n[5] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance (CGI) tenue dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013, les parties ont convenu de plaider la requ\u00eate le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Elles ont \u00e9galement convenu de plaider la question des param\u00e8tres du rappel de t\u00e9moins, question que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait soulev\u00e9e.\n[6] Les plaignantes ayant pr\u00e9vu de faire t\u00e9moigner Mme Blackstock au d\u00e9but de janvier 2014, et par souci d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les choses afin de donner plus de certitude aux parties, le 6 janvier 2014 le tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, avec motifs \u00e0 suivre.\n[7] Le 14 janvier 2014, la Commission a rappel\u00e9 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la barre. Les parties ont demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements sur la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Tribunal, dat\u00e9e du 6 janvier 2014. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 sur la question, et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un bref ajournement, il a rendu de vive voix la d\u00e9cision de clarification suivante :\n[traduction]\n1. Une partie signifie \u00ab un extrait \u00bb. L\u2019utilisation du terme partie dans la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e renvoie \u00e0 la partie au sujet de laquelle quelqu\u2019un t\u00e9moigne ou \u00e0 la partie \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019avocat a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal. Par exemple, Mme Blackstock a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de plusieurs parties de l\u2019entente de service de la C.\u2011B. qui se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 275;\n2. Le Tribunal souhaite s\u2019assurer que la partie adverse est inform\u00e9e de la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une partie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments;\n3. En dispensant les parties de l\u2019exigence de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre en vue d\u2019authentifier les documents, le Tribunal ne souhaite pas autoriser une partie \u00e0 produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur lesquels elle se fondera pendant son argumentation finale, \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui n\u2019auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie au point c. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, sans par ailleurs donner \u00e0 la partie adverse l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate, si n\u00e9cessaire; [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n4. Si une partie \u00e0 l\u2019intention de fonder son argumentation sur des parties de documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie au point c., elle court le risque que le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n5. Le Tribunal prend note de la suggestion de Me Champ selon laquelle il donnera des renseignements clairs sur les parties des documents en cause qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, parties sur lesquelles il entend fonder son argumentation, et ce, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne commence \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n6. Cela pourrait aider l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer sa propre preuve pendant l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audition de la preuve et \u00e9viter au Tribunal d\u2019avoir \u00e0 fournir les mesures curatives pr\u00e9vues au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[8] Les motifs de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus le 16 janvier 2014 (2014 TCDP 2).\n[9] Le 24 octobre 2014, l\u2019audience sur le fond a pris fin et la formation a avis\u00e9 les parties que, la semaine suivante, elle leur ferait part d\u2019un processus permettant de mieux traiter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments faisant partie du dossier de preuve du Tribunal.\n[10] Le 3 novembre 2014, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 que les parties fassent circuler entre elles et s\u2019\u00e9changent une liste indiquant \u00e0 quels documents les parties \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019avaient pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, en fonction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Tribunal, ainsi que du tableau de la Commission et des plaignantes qui pr\u00e9sentait en d\u00e9tail les documents sur lesquels les plaignantes s\u2019\u00e9taient fond\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs arguments.\n[11] Dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er d\u00e9cembre 2014, la Commission a fourni au Tribunal une liste (jointe \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A) \u00e9num\u00e9rant les documents qui, selon ce dont les parties avaient convenu, pouvaient \u00eatre retir\u00e9s des cahiers de preuve documentaire. Les documents sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par leurs num\u00e9ros de pi\u00e8ce et d\u2019onglet.\n[12] Dans la m\u00eame lettre, la Commission a \u00e9galement \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 les documents sur lesquels les parties ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas entendues. La liste figure \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B de la lettre de la Commission (voir l\u2019annexe B \u00e0 titre indicatif).\n[13] La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon elle, les documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B se rangent dans les deux cat\u00e9gories suivantes :\n[traduction]\na) les documents inclus dans les pi\u00e8ces HR-01 \u00e0 HR-15 et qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le tableau de la Commission et des plaignantes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab invoqu\u00e9s par les avocats \u00bb, mais auxquels il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019audition ou dans les observations \u00e9crites finales;\nb) les documents inclus dans les pi\u00e8ces HR-01 \u00e0 HR-15 et qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le tableau de la Commission et des plaignantes, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab invoqu\u00e9s par les avocats \u00bb et auxquels il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que dans les observations \u00e9crites finales. Un document figurant dans la pi\u00e8ce R-13 se range lui aussi dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[14] La Commission a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les discussions qu\u2019elle avait eues avec les parties, elle croyait comprendre que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral s\u2019opposait \u00e0 ce que les cat\u00e9gories de documents susmentionn\u00e9es fassent partie du dossier soumis au Tribunal, car ces documents n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme au paragraphe 75 de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal du 16 janvier 2014 (2014 TCDP 2); le texte de ce paragraphe est le suivant :\nLes personnes qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, en ce sens qu\u2019elles ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de parties de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve ainsi que de la pertinence de ces parties de documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019ont fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce point de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Tribunal. Les documents qui seront retir\u00e9s du dossier \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience sont tous les documents qui n\u2019ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun renvoi, que ce soit par un t\u00e9moin au cours de sa d\u00e9position ou par un avocat au cours de sa plaidoirie. Pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision finale, le Tribunal se fondera sur les parties des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve auxquels il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[15] La position de la Commission est reproduite en partie ci-dessous :\n[traduction]\nPlus t\u00f4t cette ann\u00e9e, la Commission et les plaignantes ont \u00e9tabli un tableau indiquant les parties de chaque document figurant dans les pi\u00e8ces HR\u201101 \u00e0 HR\u201115, la pi\u00e8ce C-2 et la pi\u00e8ce AFN-1 sur lequel elles entendaient se fonder. L\u2019objet de ce tableau, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni au d\u00e9part au Tribunal et aux parties le 5 mars 2014, avant le d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sentation des arguments du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00e9tait de veiller \u00e0 ce que ces documents soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au point c. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Tribunal du 6 janvier 2014, dont le texte est le suivant :\nc.

Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral soul\u00e8ve maintenant des doutes au sujet de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents [traduction] \u00ab invoqu\u00e9s par les avocats \u00bb pour la Commission, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et l\u2019APN et auxquels les avocats n\u2019ont pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de vive voix au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[18] De l\u2019avis de la Commission, les documents figurant dans le tableau de cette derni\u00e8re et des plaignantes comme \u00e9tant ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab invoqu\u00e9s par les avocats \u00bb devraient faire partie du dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal, peu importe qu\u2019on y ait fait explicitement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou non \u00e0 l\u2019audition, et ce, pour les motifs suivants. Premi\u00e8rement, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 largement \u00e0 l\u2019avance de l\u2019intention qu\u2019avaient la Commission et les plaignantes de se fonder sur ces documents, et il n\u2019a donc subi aucun pr\u00e9judice.\n[19] Deuxi\u00e8mement, de l\u2019avis de la Commission, l\u2019inclusion de ces documents est conforme \u00e0 la lettre et \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal (2014 TCDP 2). Elle soutient que, pour tous ces motifs, la totalit\u00e9 des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B devrait faire partie du dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal.\n[20] Le m\u00eame jour, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et l\u2019APN ont \u00e9crit aux parties et au Tribunal pour faire part de leur appui envers la position de la Commission selon laquelle la totalit\u00e9 des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B devrait faire partie du dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal.\n[21] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a fait remarquer que le Tribunal, dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de janvier 2014 (2014 TCDP 2), autorisait une partie \u00e0 faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un document pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans ses observations finales, ce qui aurait donn\u00e9 aux autres parties aussi peu qu\u2019un jour pour pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse en vue d\u2019utiliser le document. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle utilisation d\u2019un document a \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de janvier 2014, il ne devrait y avoir aucune objection \u00e0 ce que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ait fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des documents dans sa r\u00e9ponse, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7ue deux semaines avant de conclure sa plaidoirie, ou dans ses observations \u00e9crites, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7ues deux mois avant de conclure sa plaidoirie.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement r\u00e9pondu le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 la lettre des parties et a demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements sur la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de janvier 2014 du Tribunal, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en ce qui concerne le paragraphe 75 (reproduit plus t\u00f4t), car il y avait chez les parties une certaine incertitude et un manque de consensus \u00e0 propos de son sens. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une d\u00e9cision afin qu\u2019il d\u00e9cide si les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les avocats lors de la \u00ab plaidoirie \u00bb, comme il est mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 75, n\u2019incluent que ceux sur lesquels les parties se fondent dans leurs observations \u00e9crites.\n[23] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 fournir ces \u00e9claircissements.\nII. L\u2019analyse [24] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de la formation doit \u00eatre lue dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, et il est donc important d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019isoler des paragraphes distincts du reste de la d\u00e9cision si l\u2019on veut bien saisir le contexte et les motifs rendus.\n[25] Par souci de commodit\u00e9, les paragraphes dans lesquels figurent les motifs de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du 16 janvier 2014 du Tribunal sont reproduits ci-dessous :\n[67] Dans ces dispositions, le Parlement a explicitement pr\u00e9vu des limites \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal d\u2019admettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de contraindre des t\u00e9moins. Sous r\u00e9serve de ces limites, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00ab recevoir [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements \u00bb, comp\u00e9tence qui n\u2019est limit\u00e9e que par l\u2019obligation fondamentale qu\u2019a le Tribunal de garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale telle que la pr\u00e9voient les paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi ainsi que par la pertinence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve : voir Dhanjal c. Air Canada, [1996] D.C.D.P. no 4, aux paragraphes 21 et 22; Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, au paragraphe 124 (Warman).\n[68] En tant que produit de la loi, le Tribunal tire ses pouvoirs exclusivement de sa loi habilitante. Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la jurisprudence a reconnu que le grand pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) permettait au Tribunal de recevoir et d\u2019accepter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mills (C.A.F.), [1984] A.C.F. no 917. Les observations que les parties ont formul\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 l\u2019approche fond\u00e9e sur les principes de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ainsi que les exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire qui existe en common law ne sont que peu de secours \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[69] Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et de la Commission selon laquelle il serait on\u00e9reux et inutile d\u2019exiger que les auteurs des documents en cause soient cit\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 la seule fin d\u2019authentifier ces documents. Les parties conviennent qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la CTGI du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2013, avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 la pratique consistant \u00e0 admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse ou non de ou\u00ef\u2011dire, au cas par cas, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les parties les pr\u00e9sentaient en preuve, et d\u2019examiner toute question relative \u00e0 leur fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019\u00e9valuation. Cela permet au Tribunal de d\u00e9finir clairement le dossier qui constituera le fondement de sa d\u00e9cision finale. Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019approche qu\u2019il entendait suivre dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il rendrait oralement le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Cette approche se fonde \u00e9galement sur la jurisprudence : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, 2006 CF 1244, aux paragraphes 36 \u00e0 38; Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 124. Contrairement aux observations des plaignantes et de la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019avis que les d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues dans Ault, PIPS et \u00c9thier militent en faveur de l\u2019admission de documents d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le Tribunal ne voit aucune raison de d\u00e9roger maintenant \u00e0 sa pratique et d\u2019admettre en une seule fois [traduction] \u00ab tout document contenu dans les classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ou tout document communiqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, comme la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien l\u2019a demand\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate.\n[70] La requ\u00eate en question va m\u00eame plus loin, et, ainsi, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a insist\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance pour le Tribunal de saisir la pr\u00e9sente occasion pour \u00e9claircir davantage ses r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve. Dans sa requ\u00eate, en plus de demander que les documents soient re\u00e7us en preuve dans leur ensemble, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que tout document soit [traduction] \u00ab recevable en preuve pour faire preuve de son contenu, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si [\u2026] le document en cause est soumis \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin. \u00bb \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande qu\u2019il soit fait exception au paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure. Au titre du paragraphe 9(4), la pratique habituelle du Tribunal consiste, au terme de l\u2019audience, \u00e0 retirer du cahier de preuve documentaire tout document auquel les parties n\u2019ont pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au cours de la proc\u00e9dure. La Commission a confirm\u00e9 sa compr\u00e9hension de cette r\u00e8gle et de ses conditions d\u2019application \u00e0 la CTGI du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2013, et le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 toutes les parties de la teneur de cette proc\u00e9dure dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette CTGI.\n[71] Si le Tribunal accueillait la requ\u00eate, cela voudrait dire que les documents auxquels aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a jamais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au cours de l\u2019audience seraient re\u00e7us en preuve et feraient partie du dossier. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ne dit pas que, \u00e0 la place, elle fera r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces documents dans son argumentation finale, et ce, bien que son avocat ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie orale que c\u2019est ce que sa cliente avait l\u2019intention de faire autant que possible. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il est concevable que des documents dont il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement question \u00e0 quelque moment de l\u2019audience que ce soit puissent faire partie de la preuve sur laquelle le Tribunal est cens\u00e9 se fonder pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision finale. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[72] Cette demande soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre de questions. Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve plusieurs centaines de documents et elles ont r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elles souhaitaient se r\u00e9server le droit de pr\u00e9senter un nombre inconnu de documents additionnels au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019elles finiront de prendre connaissance des documents ayant fait l\u2019objet de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le fait d\u2019accueillir cette demande forcerait le Tribunal \u00e0 examiner et m\u00eame \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des documents potentiellement longs et m\u00eame techniques sans pour cela disposer de t\u00e9moignages oraux ou de plaidoiries. Bien que le Tribunal reconnaisse que le nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les plaignantes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s est significativement moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que les centaines de milliers de documents, au bas mot, qui faisaient l\u2019objet de la communication et que les parties devaient examiner, cela ne d\u00e9charge pas les plaignantes du fardeau consistant \u00e0 faire valoir leurs pr\u00e9tentions. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[73] En outre, le fait de proc\u00e9der de cette mani\u00e8re soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement une grave question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Tant dans la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e que dans la d\u00e9cision de clarification, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que les parties soient au fait des arguments qu\u2019elles doivent r\u00e9futer. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] En admettant des documents sans demander aux plaignantes de pr\u00e9ciser en quoi ils \u00e9taient pertinents dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et en quoi ils \u00e9tayaient leur position, le Tribunal pourrait placer l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une position o\u00f9 il serait incapable de r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate ou de r\u00e9futer ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[74] Compte tenu de cela, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019exception au paragraphe 9(4), et, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, il retirera du dossier tous les documents qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en bonne et due forme et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9s, ce qui aurait ainsi permis que ces documents soient re\u00e7us en preuve. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur les \u00e9tapes qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de respecter pour assurer la pr\u00e9sentation de documents au point c. de sa d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. Ainsi, le Tribunal a assoupli l\u2019application du paragraphe 9(4). Ce point est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nc. Au sens du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, un document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant qu\u2019un avocat ou un t\u00e9moin de la partie qui le pr\u00e9sente n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\ni. sur quelles parties du document on se fonde;\nii. quel est le lien entre ces parties du document et une des questions en litige.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[75] Les personnes qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, en ce sens qu\u2019elles ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de parties de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve ainsi que de la pertinence de ces parties de documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019ont fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce point de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Tribunal. Les documents qui seront retir\u00e9s du dossier \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience sont tous les documents qui n\u2019ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun renvoi, que ce soit par un t\u00e9moin au cours de sa d\u00e9position ou par un avocat au cours de sa plaidoirie. Pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision finale, le Tribunal se fondera sur les parties des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve auxquels il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[76] Les avocats de la Commission et de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ont fait savoir qu\u2019ils avaient l\u2019intention, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leurs observations finales, d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur certaines parties des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qui sont selon eux pertinents dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils proc\u00e8dent ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de parties de documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une prise de distance par rapport \u00e0 la pratique normale et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure habituelle du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Bien que, compte tenu de la souplesse de ses R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal a accueilli cette demande, cette prise de distance par rapport \u00e0 la pratique normale exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il garantisse le respect des principes de justice naturelle. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[77] Les parties sont libres de d\u00e9finir la strat\u00e9gie qui sous-tend l\u2019expos\u00e9 de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, toutefois, les r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que les parties doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre au courant des arguments qu\u2019elles doivent r\u00e9futer et qu\u2019elles puissent se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e. Dans le cas o\u00f9 les plaignantes ou tout autre partie souhaiteraient, au cours de leur argumentation finale, produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la production de la preuve, le Tribunal a institu\u00e9 une disposition curative qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019invoquer afin de r\u00e9parer toute injustice subie par la partie adverse. Cette mesure est pr\u00e9vue au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, qui est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nd. Si une partie souhaite se fonder sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9crite ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019argumentation finale (que ce soit avant que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ou apr\u00e8s), le Tribunal pourra prendre les mesures curatives qui s\u2019imposent, et, notamment, il lui sera possible d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate une r\u00e9ponse, notamment en citant d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et en produisant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire additionnels, conform\u00e9ment au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c0 la suite de cela, il se pourrait que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[78] Les plaignantes et la Commission n\u2019ont pas encore clos leur preuve et pourraient encore d\u00e9cider de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre des t\u00e9moins additionnels. Les plaignantes, s\u2019exprimant au nom de la Commission, ont \u00e9galement fait part de leur intention de fournir au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un tableau dans lequel elles pr\u00e9ciseront quelles sont les parties des documents en cause sur lesquelles elles comptent fonder leur argumentation finale. Elles ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elles produiraient ce tableau avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 commence \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause afin de permettre \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e. Pour autant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 re\u00e7oive ce tableau avant de commencer \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause, il pourrait lui \u00eatre utile aux fins de la pr\u00e9sentation de ses arguments et \u00e9viter qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel aux mesures curatives pr\u00e9vues au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. Cela d\u00e9pendra bien \u00e9videmment des renseignements effectivement contenus dans le tableau en question en ce qui concerne la description des parties des documents sur lesquelles les plaignantes comptent s\u2019appuyer ainsi que du temps dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 disposera pour examiner les documents en cause avant de devoir pr\u00e9senter ses arguments. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[26] Comme il est soulign\u00e9 dans les paragraphes qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate avait pour but de veiller \u00e0 ce que la partie adverse connaisse les arguments qu\u2019elle devait r\u00e9futer et \u00e9viter de laisser \u00e0 la formation le soin d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des informations techniques sans pouvoir entendre une explication concernant la pertinence d\u2019un document particulier par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un t\u00e9moin ou d\u2019un avocat. Les plaignantes et la Commission ont fourni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un tableau pr\u00e9sentant en d\u00e9tail les parties des documents sur lesquelles elles se fonderaient, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente ses arguments. Vu la nature continue de la communication, elles ont \u00e9galement modifi\u00e9 leur tableau \u00e0 mesure que de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s.\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la situation un mois avant l\u2019audience de pr\u00e9sentation des observations finales. Cependant, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette derni\u00e8re \u2013 le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2014 \u2013 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on pr\u00e9sente en preuve des documents auxquels les avocats n\u2019avaient fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que dans leurs observations \u00e9crites finales. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019attendre plut\u00f4t que de faire part de son objection \u00e0 l\u2019audience de pr\u00e9sentation des observations orales finales.\n[28] La seule exception est l\u2019onglet 66. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a inclus ce document dans les cahiers de preuve \u00e9tayant son argumentation, mais elle n\u2019a pas fait express\u00e9ment mention \u00e0 des parties de ce document lors des observations orales. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a toutefois fait \u00e9tat du document dans ses observations finales, contestant sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et son importance. En agissant de la sorte, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a permis \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien de r\u00e9futer les affirmations qu\u2019il avait faites dans sa r\u00e9ponse et, ainsi, de se fonder sur le document qu\u2019elle avait reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 66. La r\u00e9ponse de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 deux semaines avant l\u2019audition des observations orales finales, ce qui a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 assez de temps pour r\u00e9pondre. Pour ces raisons, la formation est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y a lieu de consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019onglet 66 fait partie du dossier de preuve soumis au Tribunal. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019onglet 477, auquel il est \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la r\u00e9ponse de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, la formation signale que ce document a lui aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans les observations \u00e9crites de la Commission. Elle ne consid\u00e8re donc pas que ce document est vis\u00e9 par l\u2019exception susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[29] Nous devons aussi garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales et les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de communication qui, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre ces mesures pr\u00e9cises. \u00c0 la date de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, soit le 16 janvier 2014, la formation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait au courant que la communication de documents se poursuivrait apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, jusqu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2014, date \u00e0 laquelle les plaignantes et la Commission devaient avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs observations \u00e9crites finales.\nIII. L\u2019ordonnance [30] Pour respecter l\u2019esprit de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate tout enti\u00e8re, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties et eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances sp\u00e9ciales qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es lorsque les parties ont re\u00e7u des documents apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de leur argumentation, la formation ordonne ce qui suit :\nLes documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B de la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 1er d\u00e9cembre 2014 (y compris ceux auxquels il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que dans les observations \u00e9crites finales \u2013 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es oralement \u2013 et qui figurent \u00e0 la page 9) seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie du dossier de preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9 aura la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux documents des plaignantes qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B ainsi qu\u2019aux observations \u00e0 l\u2019appui, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019onglet 66. S\u2019il d\u00e9cide de profiter de cette possibilit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra aviser les parties et le Tribunal de son intention et de la forme que rev\u00eatira sa r\u00e9ponse avant le 21 janvier 2015 au plus tard, \u00e0 la suite de quoi l\u2019intim\u00e9 aura jusqu\u2019au 4 f\u00e9vrier 2015 pour pr\u00e9senter sa r\u00e9ponse.\nLa formation continue de se r\u00e9server le droit de demander des \u00e9claircissements aux parties sur toute question ou tout document pendant qu\u2019elle examine la preuve.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nEdward P.

Introduction\n[1] Le 7 mars 2014, j\u2019ai rendu une d\u00e9cision (2014 TCDP 10) portant qu\u2019en 2003, l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) avait commis des actes discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP), et qu\u2019en raison de son \u00e2ge, de sa race, de sa couleur et d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue d\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, l\u2019ASFC avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment priv\u00e9 le plaignant d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi au concours Vancouver 1002 et au concours Victoria 7003.\n[2] Dans la partie VI de ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014, j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de conclusions, dont les suivantes :\n[257] En me fondant sur les motifs expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019ensemble de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances connexes, je suis arriv\u00e9 aux conclusions de fait suivantes : M. Tarnawski et M. Baird n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins dignes de foi; leurs caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9taient semblables : ils \u00e9taient souvent r\u00e9ticents et se sont exprim\u00e9s \u00e0 maintes reprises avec une certaine prolixit\u00e9 afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 donner des r\u00e9ponses directes et impartiales. Tous deux ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire. Chaque fois que leur t\u00e9moignage diff\u00e9rait de celui de M. Turner, j\u2019ai souscrit au t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier.\n[258] Ni M. Tarnawski ni M. Baird n\u2019ont expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas eu lieu ou que la conduite \u00e9tait en quelque sorte non discriminatoire.\n[259] Je conclus que les entrevues que M. Tarnawski (concours Vancouver 1002) et M. Baird (concours Victoria 7003) ont fait passer \u00e0 M. Turner \u00e9taient vici\u00e9es et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9es, qu\u2019elles se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a priv\u00e9 M. Turner de la possibilit\u00e9 de poser sa candidature en vue d\u2019un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de l\u2019ASFC et que, dans chaque cas, la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 arbitraire et a servi de pr\u00e9texte, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle constituait un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[3] Dans la partie VII de ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014, j\u2019ai cit\u00e9 l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP :\n[263] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP dispose qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ le plaignant qui a souffert d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice moral en tant que victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. Apr\u00e8s une audience ult\u00e9rieure sur la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder, j\u2019ordonnerai \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant la juste somme qui l\u2019indemnisera du pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre vu priver d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi.\n[264] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP dispose que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s\u2019il est conclu que l\u2019acte discriminatoire en question \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je conclus que les gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Ron Tarnawski et Trevor Baird ont agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e en privant le plaignant d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi. En temps utile, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder, je rendrai une ordonnance qui indemnisera le plaignant du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de leur geste.\n[265] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une victime peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte commis. Je conclus que le plaignant a effectivement perdu le salaire qu\u2019il aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent des services frontaliers. Le montant de la perte sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder. La perte sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en calculant le total des gains que le plaignant aurait acquis \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent des services frontaliers et en d\u00e9duisant de cette somme le salaire que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de tirer d\u2019un autre emploi att\u00e9nuant. Le revenu que le plaignant a gagn\u00e9 dans le cadre de ses efforts pour att\u00e9nuer sa perte de salaire en tant qu\u2019agent des services frontaliers doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9 par des d\u00e9tails et des d\u00e9clarations de revenus personnelles.\n[266] Aux termes du paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, des int\u00e9r\u00eats peuvent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s sur toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats seront calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte pour ce qui est de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux.\n[267] Lors de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 ordonner, j\u2019examinerai si le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019offrir un emploi au plaignant.\nII. Le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de la conduite\n[4] Dans ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014, j\u2019ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages des surintendants d\u00e9fendeurs, MM. Ron Tarnawski et Trevor Baird. J\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019aucun d\u2019eux n\u2019\u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin digne de foi. Je conclus maintenant que dans chacun des concours, la conduite respective de Ron Tarnawski et Trevor Baird \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait intentionnelle, fond\u00e9e sur des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et impr\u00e9gn\u00e9e d\u2019une intention cach\u00e9e de priver le plaignant de la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019ASFC.\nIII. Le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u2013 Les r\u00e9percussions sur le plaignant\n[5] L\u2019extrait suivant est tir\u00e9 du long t\u00e9moignage que le plaignant a livr\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 sa plainte tenue par le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair :\n[traduction]\nQ. (M. Yazbeck) M. Turner, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, quelles r\u00e9percussions le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement aux concours de Victoria et de Vancouver a-t-il eu sur vous?\nR. Cela m\u2019a beaucoup affect\u00e9. Je veux dire, la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019on m\u2019a dit que je ne revenais pas, parce que j\u2019avais essay\u00e9 --- fort d\u2019obtenir un emploi \u00e0 temps plein avec eux, cela m\u2019a stress\u00e9. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me demander, genre, qu\u2019est-ce qui ne va pas chez moi? Ai-je fait quelque chose de mal tout ce temps?\nJ\u2019essayais de penser, bien, \u00e0 ce que je pouvais faire pour am\u00e9liorer mon sort. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, j\u2019ai suivi les cours sur l\u2019AE, vous savez, d\u2019abord, pour \u00e9largir mes connaissances sur l\u2019AE, mais aussi, vous savez, parce que je pensais qu\u2019ils m\u2019aideraient peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer mes comp\u00e9tences ou quelque chose comme \u00e7a.\nDonc, j\u2019essayais juste de faire de mon mieux, mais cela m\u2019a extr\u00eamement bless\u00e9. Je veux dire, je pensais que j\u2019\u00e9tais bon. Je formais du personnel, comme mes examens de rendement l\u2019indiquaient. J\u2019aidais du mieux que je pouvais. Et cela m\u2019a tellement affect\u00e9 que je n\u2019en dors pas la nuit parfois, et tout ce processus tra\u00eene depuis trois ans.\nCela a compl\u00e8tement perturb\u00e9, accapar\u00e9 la majeure partie de ma vie. Je ne peux plus aller nulle part. Je ne peux pas voyager \u00e0 cause des honoraires d\u2019avocat, et de tout le reste. Cela m\u2019a compl\u00e8tement perturb\u00e9.\nEt puis \u2013 il s\u2019agit d\u2019un organisme gouvernemental et j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 abasourdi de voir qu\u2019ils ne voulaient m\u00eame pas \u2013 quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ma plainte, qu\u2019ils ne voulaient pas faire enqu\u00eate. Ils l\u2019ont simplement \u00e9cart\u00e9e du revers de la main comme si de rien n\u2019\u00e9tait.\nEt de la part d\u2019un organisme gouvernemental, je suis abasourdi et je suis en col\u00e8re. Service Canada, quand je suis arriv\u00e9 chez eux, m\u2019ont bien accueilli. Ils m\u2019ont trait\u00e9 \u00e9quitablement. Comme vous pouvez le voir, j\u2019ai gravi les \u00e9chelons depuis mon classement initial de CR3, je suis maintenant PMO2. De toute \u00e9vidence, je ne faisais rien de mal.\nQ. M. Turner, votre plainte date de f\u00e9vrier 2005 et, comme vous le savez, l\u2019agence en aurait eu connaissance peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Vous avez mentionn\u00e9 il y a quelques instants qu\u2019ils ne voulaient pas faire enqu\u00eate. Donc, est-ce que quelqu\u2019un de l\u2019agence a communiqu\u00e9 avec vous pour discuter de vos all\u00e9gations et tenter de d\u00e9terminer directement quelles \u00e9taient vos pr\u00e9occupations?\nR. Non. La premi\u00e8re fois que j\u2019ai eu un quelconque contact avec l\u2019agence, c\u2019est lors de notre premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation avec la Commission des droits de la personne. \u2026\nIV. La discussion entre l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le membre Sinclair au sujet de la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder\n[6] L\u2019extrait suivant est tir\u00e9 de la transcription des d\u00e9bats \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue par le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une partie de la conversation interlocutoire qui a eu lieu entre le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nM. Stark : Je ne crois pas qu\u2019une nomination r\u00e9troactive soit vraiment appropri\u00e9e dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et voici pourquoi. M. Turner est maintenant nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de PM02 \u00e0 Service Canada, il occupe un poste existant \u00e0 (inaudible). Je pense qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Victoria, dans le r\u00e9pertoire des candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s de Victoria.\nIl se trouve donc maintenant au m\u00eame niveau qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et le fait d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 ce poste ne comporterait donc aucun avantage pour lui.\nMaintenant, comme l\u2019a \u00e9tabli mon savant confr\u00e8re, il n\u2019existe plus de poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, c\u2019est maintenant le poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reclassifi\u00e9 au niveau PM03; il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un poste diff\u00e9rent. Il (inaudible), de sorte qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement plusieurs autres caract\u00e9ristiques. Apr\u00e8s ce concours, les fonctions exerc\u00e9es aux points d\u2019entr\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es de CIC \u00e0 l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, et tous les employ\u00e9s doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper un poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers, ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas tous r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire.\nVous aviez donc raison d\u2019affirmer dans votre d\u00e9claration initiale, M. Sinclair, que s\u2019il y a \u2013 il est impossible de replacer le plaignant dans la situation o\u00f9 il se serait trouv\u00e9. Le portrait a chang\u00e9, il aurait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de les comp\u00e9tences et les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre agent des services frontaliers plut\u00f4t qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes. Il ne peut tout simplement pas \u00eatre replac\u00e9 dans la situation o\u00f9 il se trouvait.\nLa seule fa\u00e7on de le faire est de lui accorder une indemnit\u00e9, s\u2019il pla\u00eet au Tribunal de le faire, mais comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, cette possibilit\u00e9 est assez limit\u00e9e (inaudible), il en est au stade \u2013 et il occupe maintenant le poste de PM02, qui se trouve au m\u00eame niveau de classification. Je ne crois donc pas que ce soit la chose \u00e0 faire pour cette raison.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019autre question dont nous avons parl\u00e9, et je tenterai d\u2019\u00eatre bref, M. Sinclair, nous avons parl\u00e9 (inaudible) a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 (inaudible), soit celle du crit\u00e8re applicable au renouvellement de la nomination. Maintenant, M. Turner, il convient de souligner que la plupart des candidats nomm\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du r\u00e9pertoire des candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s de Vancouver, de Victoria, je n\u2019arr\u00eate pas de les m\u00e9langer, \u00e9taient tous qualifi\u00e9s \u2013 les nominations \u00e0 partir de ce r\u00e9pertoire concernaient seulement des postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nDonc, (inaudible) M. Turner aurait pu s\u2019attendre du fait d\u2019avoir (inaudible) \u00e0 partir du r\u00e9pertoire des candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s de Vancouver, de Victoria, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un poste dot\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Cela ne lui aurait pas conf\u00e9r\u00e9 un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. C\u2019est un point tr\u00e8s important \u00e0 souligner; donc, \u00e0 partir du r\u00e9pertoire de Victoria, il n\u2019aurait pas obtenu un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Voil\u00e0 une raison de plus pour laquelle M. Turner ne devrait pas \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 r\u00e9troactivement.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, vous dites que s\u2019il avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du r\u00e9pertoire du concours 7003, cela n\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 que pour occuper un poste dot\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nM. Stark : Oui \u2026 (citant la pi\u00e8ce R-2, onglet 52) \u2026 il s\u2019agit d\u2019un rapport sur le concours, et vous remarquerez que chaque candidat nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de ce r\u00e9pertoire l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste dot\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : C\u2019est ce que disait l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi?\nM. Stark : Bien, l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi, je pense, \u00e9tait un peu (inaudible) que cela, l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi, en fait, visait des postes permanents, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et (inaudible), mais cela permet de penser qu\u2019aucun poste permanent n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de ce r\u00e9pertoire, il n\u2019y avait donc que des postes dot\u00e9s pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. \u2026\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous dites qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre suffisamment indemnis\u00e9 \u2026 par l\u2019octroi de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, que voulez-vous dire par l\u00e0? \u2026\nM. Stark : Je veux dire qu\u2019il pourrait recevoir un suppl\u00e9ment de salaire, pour la p\u00e9riode entre le moment o\u00f9 le r\u00e9pertoire des candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s de Victoria a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli et le moment o\u00f9 il a obtenu son poste \u00e0 Service Canada, il pourrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de la diff\u00e9rence entre les deux salaires (inaudible) jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a atteint la diff\u00e9rence entre les deux salaires (inaudible) o\u00f9 il a atteint le salaire \u00e9quivalent du poste de PM02. Il serait donc indemnis\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on. Mais il ne peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un poste pour lequel il n\u2019avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises, soit celui d\u2019agent des services frontaliers. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un poste diff\u00e9rent, qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une reclassification, et il devrait r\u00e9ussir un concours \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, comme tout le monde.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, vous dites que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats devrait aller du moment o\u00f9 il ne s\u2019est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour le concours de Victoria ou de Vancouver jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a obtenu le poste de PM02 \u00e0 Service Canada. \u2026\nM. Stark : C\u2019est exact.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, deux points sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on inexacte dans la discussion ci-dessus, et ces points sont pertinents quant au droit du plaignant \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\n[8] D\u2019abord, l\u2019affirmation voulant que la reclassification du poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes en poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers corresponde \u00e0 une modification importante des fonctions exerc\u00e9es aux points d\u2019entr\u00e9e du Canada. En examinant la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au membre Sinclair, je n\u2019ai pu trouver aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9cis \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des concours en question, la modification du nom des inspecteurs des douanes pour celui d\u2019agents des services frontaliers comportait une modification importante des fonctions exerc\u00e9es aux points d\u2019entr\u00e9e du Canada, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des fonctions suppl\u00e9mentaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019immigration.\n[9] Ensuite, les \u00e9valuations annuelles contenaient de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui \u00e9tablissaient la comp\u00e9tence de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes. Il est donc raisonnable de conclure que, si les agents des services frontaliers devaient effectivement accomplir des fonctions suppl\u00e9mentaires, les cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Turner \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes lui auraient permis de ma\u00eetriser et d\u2019exercer toute fonction suppl\u00e9mentaire qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e en tant qu\u2019agent des services frontaliers.\n[10] \u00c0 l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder tenue les 21 et 22 avril 2015, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne justifiaient par l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire du plaignant pour l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode allant de 2004 \u00e0 2014 : cette indemnit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 quatre ans. Limiter la perte de salaire du plaignant \u00e0 quatre ans constituerait une d\u00e9cision arbitraire, et un exercice tout \u00e0 fait inad\u00e9quat du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire judiciaire. En outre, limiter l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire \u00e0 quatre ans m\u2019obligerait \u00e0 faire abstraction du traumatisme \u00e9motionnel de la victimisation.\n[11] Je conclus que les faits et les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9cartent la possibilit\u00e9 de limiter la perte de salaire du plaignant \u00e0 quatre ans.\nV. La pi\u00e8ce C-4 : le calcul de la perte de salaire du plaignant\n[12] La pi\u00e8ce C-4 est un dossier factuel de quatre pages, qui est le produit d\u2019une collaboration entre l\u2019avocat du plaignant et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il fait \u00e9tat du revenu que M. Turner a gagn\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2004 \u00e0 2014. Il montre que M. Turner a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un emploi \u00e0 Service Canada, o\u00f9, en temps opportun, il est devenu un fonctionnaire f\u00e9d\u00e9ral occupant un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[13] Sous le titre \u00ab Diff\u00e9rence \u00bb, la pi\u00e8ce C-4 contient un calcul de la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire r\u00e9el que M. Turner a gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 Service Canada et le salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que l\u2019ASFC verse aux agents des services frontaliers. La pi\u00e8ce C-4 fournit \u00e9galement une estimation du salaire additionnel tir\u00e9 du travail en temps suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n2004 40 711,19 $\n2005 17 031,25 $\n2006 22 293,89 $\n2007 22 646,93 $\n2008 25 089,37 $\n2009 16 665,96 $\n2010 16 169,74 $\n2011 11 019,97 $\n2012 15 238,05 $\n2013 10 452,58 $\n2014 13 059,57 $\nTotal : 210 378,50 $ + *5 191,53 $ en int\u00e9r\u00eats = 215 570,03 $\n*La pi\u00e8ce C-4 contient un calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de 2004 \u00e0 2014, qui totalisent 5 191,53 $.\n[14] La pi\u00e8ce C-4 comportait les notes suivantes :\nSalaire : 2004 \u00e0 2014 (taux de l\u2019ASFC); Quarts de l\u2019ASFC\/Primes pour heures suppl\u00e9mentaires moyennes pour Victoria; Service Canada \u2013 Montants r\u00e9els figurant sur les feuillets T4.\nNotes en surbrillance : 2004 : comprend un salaire de 12 635 $, mais pas les prestations d\u2019AE de 10 325 $; 2009 : prime \u00e0 la signature d\u2019environ 5 000 $ non comprise (d\u00e9claration de revenus indique 59 534 $); 2011 : ne comprend pas l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part de Service Canada. Le document d\u2019ASFC indique 17 134,85 $ en indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part; 2015-2019 : la diff\u00e9rence de salaire de 2014 (13 059,57 $) x 5 ans au lieu de la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\nTous les montants fournis par l\u2019ASFC sont tir\u00e9s des renseignements sur les salaires du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor fournis par M.

L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 tenant lieu de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration\n[15] Au paragraphe 267 de ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014, j\u2019ai affirm\u00e9 ceci : \u00ab Lors de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 ordonner, j\u2019examinerai si le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019offrir un emploi au plaignant \u00bb.\n[16] \u00c0 l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder tenue les 21 et 22 avril 2015, le plaignant a retir\u00e9 sa demande de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent des services frontaliers. Le plaignant demande plut\u00f4t une indemnit\u00e9 de 65 297,85 $ pour la perte de salaire anticip\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2015-2019. Ce paiement forfaitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en utilisant la \u00ab diff\u00e9rence \u00bb de salaire de 2014, soit 13 059.57 $, et en l\u2019appliquant \u00e0 chacune des cinq ann\u00e9es suivantes (5 x 13 059,57 $ = 65 297,85 $), pour arriver \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation approximative de la perte de salaire pour cette p\u00e9riode.\nVII. L\u2019argument du plaignant concernant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire\n[17] L\u2019avocat de M. Turner a soutenu que le Tribunal devrait accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour la totalit\u00e9 de la perte de salaire subie au cours de la p\u00e9riode de onze ans allant de 2004 \u00e0 2014, telle que cette perte est consign\u00e9e et calcul\u00e9e dans la pi\u00e8ce C-4 de la partie intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Diff\u00e9rence \u00bb, plus le paiement forfaitaire tenant lieu de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\n[18] Je conclus que la pi\u00e8ce C-4 fournit un calcul exact selon lequel la perte de salaire du plaignant s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 210 378,50 $, et \u00e0 215 570.03 $ une fois les int\u00e9r\u00eats de 5 191,53 $ ajout\u00e9s. S\u2019ajoute \u00e0 cela l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 tenant lieu de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de 65 297,85 $, ce qui porte \u00e0 280 867,88 $ l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 totale demand\u00e9e par le plaignant.\nVIII. L\u2019att\u00e9nuation des dommages\n[19] Moins d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s son exclusion par l\u2019ASFC, le plaignant a obtenu un emploi \u00e0 Service Canada, et ce, alors qu\u2019il vivait des bouleversements \u00e9motifs attribuables au fait qu\u2019il avait vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination raciale, ce qui constituait une r\u00e9alisation exceptionnelle. En poursuivant son chemin et en r\u00e9ussissant \u00e0 joindre les deux bouts, le plaignant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer sa perte de revenu r\u00e9sultant des actes discriminatoires de l\u2019ASFC.\nIX. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[20] Il est tr\u00e8s important de souligner que les deux actes discriminatoires ont oblig\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 son r\u00eave de poursuivre une carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC. Le fait qu\u2019une telle attitude discriminatoire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 enracin\u00e9e dans les concours Vancouver 1002 et Victoria 7003 est d\u00e9plorable, et t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris pour l\u2019esprit et l\u2019objet de la LCDP. Il faut en tenir compte dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nX. La r\u00e9paration : les ordonnances d\u2019indemnisation et de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[21] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 toutes les conclusions que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9es dans ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014 portant que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires dans le cadre de deux concours de recrutement, et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations que les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder tenue les 21 et 22 avril 2015, je rends les ordonnances suivantes : une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et une indemnit\u00e9 li\u00e9e au fait que les actes discriminatoires \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n1. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) : j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 280 867,88 $ pour le salaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 par suite des actes discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Majoration relative aux obligations fiscales : j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire suffisante pour couvrir toute obligation fiscale suppl\u00e9mentaire pouvant r\u00e9sulter de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance d\u2019indemnisation.\n2. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) : j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 15 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que le plaignant a subi par suite des actes discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n3. En vertu du paragraphe 53(3) : compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment commis les actes discriminatoires, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra verser au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 15 000 $.\n4. Chaque indemnit\u00e9 portera des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision du 7 mars 2014.\nXI.

Introduction\n[1] Claudette Wilson, une femme de race noire, all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur la race et le sexe de la part de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC), lorsque celle\u2011ci l\u2019a transf\u00e9r\u00e9e de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle avait travaill\u00e9 pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es \u00e0 un autre endroit dans la m\u00eame ville.\nII. Les faits\n[2] Mme Wilson a travaill\u00e9 pendant 21 ans au m\u00eame centre de surveillance de l\u2019Immigration (le CSI) \u00e0 Toronto. Pendant la plus grande partie de cette p\u00e9riode, elle a travaill\u00e9 comme agente de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, mais pendant les deux ann\u00e9es ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010, elle a occup\u00e9 le poste de surveillante de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[3] Il est important de souligner que Mme Wilson n\u2019\u00e9tait pas directement employ\u00e9e par l\u2019ASFC; celle\u2011ci avait plut\u00f4t sous\u2011trait\u00e9 les services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en question, c\u2019est la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G4S Security Services (Canada) Ltd. (la G4S ) qui d\u00e9tenait le contrat de fourniture du personnel de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 la CSI et c\u2019\u00e9tait elle qui \u00e9tait l\u2019employeur de Mme Wilson. L\u2019ASFC fournissait le personnel de supervision, de gestion et des op\u00e9rations. Mme Wilson estimait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e exemplaire, qui \u00e9tait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ASFC et par son employeur, la G4S.\n[4] En juin 2010, l\u2019ASFC a embauch\u00e9 un nouveau gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations, \u00e0 savoir M. Sajjad Bhatti. En juillet 2010, Mme Wilson a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un incident survenu au travail, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son transfert de son lieu de travail actuel \u00e0 un autre CSI \u00e0 Toronto. M. Bhatti \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur de la lettre qui avisait Mme Wilson de son transfert \u00e0 un autre centre \u00e0 Toronto.\n[5] Mme Wilson s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e au transfert, et l\u2019affaire a d\u00fb \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un arbitrage de griefs devant le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles. Finalement, un proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9.\n[6] Mme Wilson a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e parce que M. Bhatti ne voulait pas d\u2019une femme de race noire au centre o\u00f9 il travaillait. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions, que M. Bhatti avait refus\u00e9 d\u2019interagir avec elle \u00e0 deux reprises au moins. Une fois, elle l\u2019avait salu\u00e9 en disant [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour monsieur \u00bb, mais il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu. Une deuxi\u00e8me fois, elle l\u2019avait salu\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il passait devant la cage d\u2019escalier, mais il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu et avait continu\u00e9 son chemin. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu de [traduction] \u00ab contact visuel \u00bb avec elle et qu\u2019il avait continu\u00e9 son chemin. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait [traduction ] \u00ab murmur\u00e9 \u00bb quelque chose, mais elle ne saurait dire ce que c\u2019\u00e9tait, si du moins il avait dit quoi que ce soit. Selon Mme Wilson, M. Bhatti avait une attitude discriminatoire. Elle \u00e9tait convaincue que le traitement auquel M. Bhatti la soumettait \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur la race et le sexe et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ceci : [traduction] \u00ab Pourrait\u2011il s\u2019agir d\u2019autre chose? Je suis une femme et je suis noire \u00bb.\n[7] Mme Wilson n\u2019a pas pu se rappeler le moment auquel les deux incidents ont eu lieu. Elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins. Elle a soumis au Tribunal des copies de deux lettres : l\u2019une, manuscrite et sign\u00e9e \u00ab Justice Seekers \u00bb (revendicateurs de justice), et l\u2019autre, dactylographi\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e aussi \u00ab Justice Seekers \u00bb avec quatre signatures illisibles. Les deux copies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la plainte de Mme Wilson. Je conclus que les lettres ont peu de valeur probante, en raison du fait que les signatures sont ind\u00e9chiffrables et que les auteurs n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9s. En outre, les lettres ne contiennent aucun renseignement qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte pour discrimination de Mme Wilson et, par cons\u00e9quent, elles ne sont pas utiles. Mme Wilson n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant aux dommages, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, qu\u2019elle a subis par suite de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[8] M. Bhatti \u00e9tait le seul t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9 au Canada et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de descendance pakistanaise. Il a dit que, quand il \u00e9tait enfant, il avait souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible de commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants et d\u2019injures en raison de la couleur de sa peau. Il a affirm\u00e9 ne pas se souvenir des incidents au sujet desquels Mme Wilson se plaint.\n[9] M. Bhatti a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans ses habitudes d\u2019\u00eatre impoli et que, si la plaignante l\u2019avait salu\u00e9 comme elle le pr\u00e9tend, il affirme qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9pondu d\u2019une mani\u00e8re respectueuse. Malgr\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage concernant ses habitudes, il ne pouvait pas se rappeler les deux incidents susmentionn\u00e9s et, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne pouvait pas nier qu\u2019ils avaient eu lieu. Ainsi, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Wilson quant aux deux incidents demeure essentiellement non contredit. M. Bhatti a bel et bien admis avoir remis \u00e0 Mme Wilson une lettre concernant son transfert \u00e0 un autre centre.\nIII. Les aspects juridiques\n[10] La plainte de Mme Wilson est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H\u20116 (la Loi). Selon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. L\u2019article 3 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que les motifs de distinction illicite comprennent le sexe, la race et la couleur.\n[11] Il est bien \u00e9tabli, je crois, qu\u2019il incombe \u00e0 Mme Wilson d\u2019\u00e9tablir prima facie qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. La preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558; Canada c. Johnstone, 2014 CAF 110, au paragraphe 82).\n[12] Lorsque Mme Wilson aura \u00e9tabli prima facie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, il reviendra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir une explication raisonnable quant \u00e0 la conduite jug\u00e9e r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible (Baptiste c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 2001 CanLII 5801 (TCDP), au paragraphe 6).\n[13] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019existe pas de preuve directe; Mme Wilson se fonde plut\u00f4t sur une preuve circonstancielle. Mais celle\u2011ci sera suffisante si la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une conclusion de discrimination rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible (Baptiste, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 60 et Khiamal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, au paragraphe 60).\n[14] Pour faire droit \u00e0 une plainte, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif de la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un facteur qui a motiv\u00e9 la conduite ou les d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019employeur (Holden v. Canadian national railway (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.); Baptiste, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 11; Khiamal, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 61).\n[15] Enfin, la norme de preuve qui s\u2019applique dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme civile habituelle (Baptiste, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 10; Khiamal, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 60). Le fardeau de prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s incombe \u00e0 celui ou celle qui r\u00e9clame l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation (Developement social Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2011 CAF 202, au paragraphe 16).\nIV. Les questions en litige\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 les deux questions fondamentales suivantes qu\u2019il faut examiner :\nL\u2019ASFC \u00e9tait\u2011elle l\u2019employeur de Mme Wilson, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, existait\u2011il une relation employeur\u2011employ\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi?\nLa plaignante a\u2011t\u2011elle apport\u00e9 la preuve d\u2019une diff\u00e9rentiation d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi?\n[17] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 une conclusion d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante en ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me question en litige, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire que je me penche sur la premi\u00e8re question (\u00e0 savoir si la relation d\u2019emploi exig\u00e9e existait).\nV. Analyse\n[18] Mme Wilson croit que sa r\u00e9affectation \u00e0 un \u00ab nouvel \u00bb endroit a eu lieu en raison du traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle a subi de la part de M. Bhatti, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une femme de race noire. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e9tablissaient\u2011ils prima facie l\u2019existence d\u2019une distinction d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite?\n[19] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Mme Wilson n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas prima facie l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle a subi et les motifs illicites de discrimination invoqu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En d\u2019autres termes, m\u00eame \u00e0 supposer que j\u2019ajoute foi aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Mme Wilson, je ne peux pas d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 partir de son t\u00e9moignage, comment le refus de M. Bhatti d\u2019interagir avec elle, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 de pair avec la d\u00e9cision de la transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 un autre CSI, \u00e9taient d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa race, \u00e0 son sexe, \u00e0 ces deux motifs, ou \u00e0 leur effet combin\u00e9 (voir l\u2019article 3.1 de la Loi). La conduite de M. Bhatti, telle que la plaignante l\u2019a d\u00e9crite dans son t\u00e9moignage, pouvait \u00eatre attribuable \u00e0 de nombreuses raisons. La croyance de Mme Wilson selon laquelle, parce qu\u2019elle est une femme de race noire, M. Bhatti voulait la transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 un autre CSI et n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses salutations \u00e0 deux reprises \u00e0 des dates non connues, n\u2019est pas suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qui doit \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e. Une simple croyance, sans \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, n\u2019est pas suffisante pour justifier une plainte de discrimination (Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 CF 785, aux paragraphes 30 et 31).\n[20] L\u2019exigence en mati\u00e8re de preuve visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir prima facie l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination comporte habituellement trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer :\nqu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la Loi contre la discrimination;\nqu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019emploi concern\u00e9;\nque la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. (Voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33; Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 76).\n[21] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Wilson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui du premier et du deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment (sa race et son sexe, ainsi que sa mauvaise exp\u00e9rience professionnelle). Toutefois, elle n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui du troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de sa croyance personnelle. Compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, elle n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, \u00e0 part sa croyance selon laquelle la distinction d\u00e9favorable dont elle a fait l\u2019objet \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite. La preuve que Mme Wilson a soumise n\u2019est pas assez compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en sa faveur, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[22] Cela \u00e9tant dit, m\u00eame si je devais conclure qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, je ne suis pas convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le sexe ou la race de Mme Wilson, ou leur effet combin\u00e9, ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ASFC de la transf\u00e9rer. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Bhatti, une explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire quant au transfert a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019incident survenu au travail en juillet 2010. Il incombe \u00e0 Mme Wilson de convaincre le Tribunal, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la preuve explicative pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Bhatti pour le compte de l\u2019ASFC est fausse ou n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte (Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, aux paragraphes 74 et 83). Mme Wilson n\u2019y est pas parvenue.\n[23] J\u2019ai tir\u00e9 la conclusion susmentionn\u00e9e en tenant d\u00fbment compte du principe selon lequel, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve directe, l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duite des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Toutefois, compte tenu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est plus probable de tirer une conclusion d\u2019absence de discrimination. Le transfert est enti\u00e8rement attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019incident survenu au travail. De m\u00eame, la preuve ne permet pas de conclure que la race et le sexe de Mme Wilson ont probablement jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le fait que M. Bhatti n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses salutations.\n[24] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la plainte n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e et, en application du paragraphe 53 (1) de la Loi, je la rejette.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRonald Sydney Williams\nMembre instructeur\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 13 mai 2015\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T1961\/4113\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Claudette Wilson c.

Requ\u00eate\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Jenn Trucking Ltd. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e), et dat\u00e9e du 5 novembre 2014 en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance rejetant la plainte au motif que le plaignant n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal depuis environ deux ans et demi et que ce d\u00e9faut de participation a entra\u00een\u00e9 un retard indu qui est pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nII. Contexte\n[2] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience en raison d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui seraient survenus de f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 mai 2009. Le plaignant a travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme aide-camionneur\/conducteur de camion-grue jusqu\u2019en mai 2009. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il s\u2019est bless\u00e9 dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions en tombant de la plate-forme du camion et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9ficience d\u00e9coulant de ces blessures.\n[3] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP) le 25 mai 2010. L\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction le 28 octobre 2011, et, le 29 novembre 2011, la CCDP a inform\u00e9 le plaignant et le Tribunal qu\u2019elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2011, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re lettre au plaignant et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les informer qu\u2019il allait instruire la plainte. Le 31 janvier 2012, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit une autre lettre aux parties pour leur expliquer le processus de divulgation et demander au plaignant de fournir son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, y compris sa liste de redressements demand\u00e9s et de documents, au plus tard le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2012. Dans la m\u00eame lettre, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la CCDP de divulguer ses documents au plus tard le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2012 et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de divulguer les siens au plus tard le 16 mars 2012.\n[5] La CCDP a divulgu\u00e9 ses documents le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2012, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a divulgu\u00e9 les siens le 16 mars 2012. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la directive donn\u00e9e le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2011 relativement \u00e0 la divulgation. Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI) a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e et a eu lieu le 31 mai 2012. \u00c0 cette occasion, la date limite consentie au plaignant pour fournir les renseignements demand\u00e9s et divulguer ses documents a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 21 juin 2012, et on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au 12 juillet 2012 pour d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9.\n[6] Le plaignant a fourni les renseignements demand\u00e9s et divulgu\u00e9 ses documents le 12 juin 2012, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 le 12 juillet 2012. Par la suite, le Tribunal a communiqu\u00e9 avec le plaignant le 27 mars 2013 et le 3 mai 2013 pour lui demander ses disponibilit\u00e9s en vue d\u2019une CTGI, dont le but est de s\u2019assurer que les parties continuent de faire avancer le dossier en vue de l\u2019audience. Comme le plaignant n\u2019a pas fourni ses disponibilit\u00e9s, la CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 21 janvier 2014. Le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 au plaignant un courriel et une lettre par messagerie pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de participer \u00e0 cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Le plaignant n\u2019y a pas particip\u00e9.\n[7] Le 10 juillet 2014 ou vers cette date, le Tribunal a parl\u00e9 au plaignant et a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire en \u00e9tait maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audience et qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre disponible pour une CTGI et pour l\u2019audience. Lors de cette discussion, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il informerait le Tribunal de ses intentions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019audience au plus tard le 5 ao\u00fbt 2014.\n[8] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal avant le 5 ao\u00fbt 2014, et une deuxi\u00e8me CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 29 ao\u00fbt 2014. Un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au plaignant pour l\u2019informer que sa participation \u00e9tait requise. Le 28 ao\u00fbt 2014, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal :\n[traduction] Je ne suis presque jamais chez moi le jour, car je travaille pour subvenir \u00e0 mes besoins et \u00e0 ceux de mes trois gar\u00e7ons... J\u2019imagine qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, pour ne pas que la proc\u00e9dure soit retard\u00e9e davantage en raison de d\u00e9lais qui ne me conviennent pas, que vous teniez la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique comme pr\u00e9vu, m\u00eame si je ne peux pas y participer\u2026 Je ne peux pas me permettre de poursuivre cette affaire, car cela prend beaucoup de temps, alors je vais devoir m\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans cette affaire.\n[9] Par suite du courriel du plaignant, la CTGI du 29 ao\u00fbt 2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e. La Commission a \u00e9crit au plaignant le 2 septembre 2014 et lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer [traduction] \u00ab clairement et sans \u00e9quivoque \u00bb si son courriel du 28 ao\u00fbt 2014 signifiait qu\u2019il souhaitait retirer sa plainte. Le 16 septembre 2014, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au plaignant pour lui demander d\u2019indiquer, au plus tard le 25 septembre 2014, s\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de participer \u00e0 la CTGI et \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Encore une fois, le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu, et une CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 23 octobre 2014. Un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au plaignant par courriel et par messagerie.\n[10] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la CTGI du 23 octobre 2014, malgr\u00e9 que le Tribunal ait tent\u00e9 \u00e0 trois reprises de le joindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pendant la CTGI. Un calendrier a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en vue du rejet de la plainte et pour permettre au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter des observations. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 5 novembre 2014, et le plaignant et la Commission avaient jusqu\u2019au 5 d\u00e9cembre 2014 pour y r\u00e9pondre. Un avis des directives relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 au plaignant par courriel et par messagerie.\n[11] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts en vue de communiquer avec le plaignant au sujet de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui par messagerie vocale, par courrier recommand\u00e9 et par courriel (une confirmation de r\u00e9ception et de lecture a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue pour certains courriels). Aucune r\u00e9ponse n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue, la date limite consentie au plaignant pour d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 5 janvier 2015, et le plaignant en a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 dans un courriel, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert et lu.\n[12] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019examen des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, toutes les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres observations sur l\u2019application de la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure dans cette affaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses observations additionnelles le 4 mai 2015.\n[13] La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position sur la requ\u00eate, et le plaignant n\u2019a pas fourni de r\u00e9ponse ou pris position \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nIII. Analyse\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que le d\u00e9faut du plaignant de prendre des mesures concr\u00e8tes dans cette affaire, en particulier son d\u00e9faut de participer \u00e0 cette affaire de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit depuis juillet 2012, lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que le d\u00e9faut du plaignant de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal constitue un abus de cette proc\u00e9dure. Le plaignant n\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 aucune position.\n[15] Comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre chez lui, il peut prendre des mesures pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019abus de sa proc\u00e9dure, notamment le rejet d\u2019une affaire. Dans Labelle c. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 TCDP 4 (CanLII), le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il peut rejeter une plainte lorsque l\u2019affaire n\u2019a pas avanc\u00e9 depuis une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9raisonnable en raison du fait que les plaideurs \u00ab ne tienn[ent] absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal. Dans ces circonstances, le retard peut constituer un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. (Voir \u00e9galement Mattice c. Westower Communications Ltd., 2014 TCDP 32.)\n[16] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on concr\u00e8te \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal depuis le mois de juin 2012. Malgr\u00e9 les efforts consid\u00e9rables d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par le Tribunal, le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas rendu disponible pour une CTGI depuis plus de deux ans et demi. En outre, le plaignant a exprim\u00e9 une certaine incertitude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la proc\u00e9dure, mais il a refus\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer de fa\u00e7on claire et non \u00e9quivoque au Tribunal ou \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de donner suite \u00e0 sa plainte ou non. Bien que le plaignant ait fait part, dans son courriel du 28 ao\u00fbt 2014, de ses pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, compte tenu de ses obligations professionnelles et parentales, il n\u2019a demand\u00e9 aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement au Tribunal et n\u2019a plus communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Enfin, le plaignant n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune r\u00e9ponse dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en vue de faire rejeter la plainte.\n[17] \u00c0 ce point-ci, soit plus de trois ans et demi depuis que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, tr\u00e8s peu de choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en vue de faire instruire l\u2019affaire dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9. Ce retard est survenu en d\u00e9pit des directives expresses du Tribunal au sujet de l\u2019obligation de participation du plaignant.\n[18] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en faveur du rejet de la plainte sur le fondement du pr\u00e9judice subi, car la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e sur le fondement d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nIV. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[19] Le Tribunal conclut que le d\u00e9faut du plaignant de donner activement suite \u00e0 sa plainte et son d\u00e9faut de respecter les directives du Tribunal constituent un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 par\nRicki T. Johnston\nMembre instructrice du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 28 mai 2015",

Contexte\n[1] Le 3 juin 2011, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans de l\u2019\u00e9poque (aujourd\u2019hui P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada) (\u00ab POC \u00bb). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que POC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb ou la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), en omettant ou en refusant de tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience et en le traitant de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable par l\u2019adoption d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire, le privant ainsi d\u2019une chance d\u2019emploi. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de telle sorte que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u00e9sormais \u00ab le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, repr\u00e9sentant POC et la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada \u00bb (\u00ab CFP \u00bb) (collectivement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb).\nII. La requ\u00eate du plaignant\n[2] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 divulgue d\u2019autres documents.

Parties de la plainte pertinentes au regard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate\n[3] Les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte et pertinentes au regard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s :\n(i) le plaignant a un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 son avis, constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi;\n(ii) en juin 2008, il a soumis, dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection 08-DFO-IA-NCR-929466 (le \u00ab concours de dotation ENG-05 \u00bb), sa candidature \u00e0 un poste ENG-05 non encore cr\u00e9\u00e9 au sein de POC (le \u00ab poste ENG\u201105 \u00bb), sans pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et sans solliciter de mesures d\u2019adaptation;\n(iii) en avril 2009, au terme du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation qui comprenait une entrevue, POC l\u2019a inclus dans le groupe de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour occuper le poste. Ce groupe devait \u00eatre en place du 20 avril 2009 au 20 octobre 2010;\n(iv) le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que son entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab passable \u00bb et que sa candidature ne serait pas retenue une fois que le poste serait cr\u00e9\u00e9;\n(v) le plaignant a estim\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9ficience lui avait fait obstacle durant l\u2019entrevue et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019identifier comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et n\u00e9cessitant des mesures d\u2019adaptation, ce qu\u2019il a fait en ao\u00fbt 2009. En septembre 2009, il a soumis \u00e0 POC un formulaire de \u00ab demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00bb;\n(vi) POC a propos\u00e9 de refaire la phase d\u2019\u00e9valuation du concours de dotation ENG-05 apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de la CFP des informations concernant les modes d\u2019adaptation sp\u00e9cifiquement indiqu\u00e9s. POC a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de se pr\u00e9senter au Centre de psychologie du personnel (CPP) de la CFP afin de d\u00e9terminer les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9es;\n(vii) le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord et ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au CPP. Il a fait valoir aupr\u00e8s de POC que la mesure d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9e \u00e9tait de le nommer au poste ENG-05, et ce, pour les motifs suivants :\nil avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le groupe des candidats qualifi\u00e9s sur la base de crit\u00e8res objectifs, et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certain de se qualifier de nouveau;\nla norme ou la pratique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb \u00e9tablie par la CFP, et dont POC se sert encore dans ses concours de dotation pour \u00e9valuer les candidats, est intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoire vis-\u00e0-vis du plaignant et de ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui;\nl\u2019obligation d\u2019adaptation de l\u2019employeur s\u2019applique tout au long du processus de s\u00e9lection, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la nomination (en incluant cette \u00e9tape);\nla modalit\u00e9 d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il propose ne constituerait pas une contrainte excessive pour POC et servirait \u00e0 combler l\u2019\u00e9cart de repr\u00e9sentativit\u00e9 caract\u00e9risant le plan d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi (\u00ab EE \u00bb) de l\u2019intim\u00e9;\n(viii) POC a rejet\u00e9 la proposition du plaignant.\nJ\u2019aborderai maintenant les diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de documents demand\u00e9s, eu \u00e9gard aux all\u00e9gations ci-dessus.\nIV. Le processus de divulgation\nA. Dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal\n[4] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\nLe membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[5] En vertu de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), les parties \u00e0 une plainte sont tenues de fournir un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions comprenant la preuve documentaire, le nom des t\u00e9moins, un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 (\u00ab r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 \u00bb) et les proc\u00e9dures relatives aux rapports d\u2019expert.\n[6] Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent. Il pr\u00e9voit :\nChaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n[7] Le paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit essentiellement que l\u2019obligation de divulgation est continue.\nB. Norme relative \u00e0 la divulgation des documents\n[8] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est la suivante :\nles documents doivent \u00eatre [traduction] \u00ab potentiellement pertinents \u00bb \u00e0 une question abord\u00e9e dans la plainte;\npour qu\u2019ils le soient, il doit exister un lien rationnel entre le document dont la divulgation est demand\u00e9e et un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 ou invoqu\u00e9 par d\u2019autres parties (Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (CanLII) [Seeley], au paragraphe 6;\nles demandes de divulgation \u00ab [\u2026] ne doi[vent] pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative[s] ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u201cpartie de p\u00eache\u201d \u00bb (Johanne Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34 (Can LII) (\u00ab Guay \u00bb), au paragraphe 43;\nla description des documents ne doit pas \u00eatre trop large ou g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, mais raisonnablement d\u00e9taill\u00e9e (ibid.)\n[9] La position du plaignant est la suivante :\nen dehors de la norme de la pertinence potentielle, le degr\u00e9 de divulgation doit \u00eatre plus important l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019exigence d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Le plaignant s\u2019appuie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 817 (CSC) [Baker] ainsi que sur l\u2019article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Disclosure Issues in Administrative Proceedings \u00bb [Questions de divulgation dans les instances administratives], publi\u00e9 par le cabinet d\u2019avocats Pinto Wray James, s.r.l. (l\u2019\u00ab article Pinto \u00bb);\n[traduction] \u00ab Les cinq facteurs non exhaustifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker \u00bb, tels qu'ils sont cit\u00e9s aux pages 4 et 5 de l\u2019article Pinto, sont les suivants :\n(i) [traduction] \u00ab plus l\u2019instance administrative ressemble \u00e0 un processus d\u00e9cisionnel judiciaire, plus il est probable [\u2026] \u00bb que les [traduction] \u00ab garanties proc\u00e9durales \u00bb requises se rapprochent de celles que r\u00e9clame un proc\u00e8s civil;\n(ii) la nature du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et les dispositions de la loi habilitante \u2013 s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou si la d\u00e9cision tranche d\u00e9finitivement la question;\n(iii) [traduction] \u00ab plus la d\u00e9cision a des r\u00e9percussions importantes, plus strictes seront les garanties proc\u00e9durales \u00bb;\n(iv) la [traduction] \u00ab doctrine des attentes l\u00e9gitimes fait partie de la doctrine de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale \u00bb; c.-\u00e0-d. que le tribunal doit suivre la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019anticipe l\u00e9gitimement l\u2019individu concern\u00e9;\n(v) les proc\u00e9dures dont se dote l\u2019organisme lui-m\u00eame, [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] surtout lorsque la loi \u00bb accorde au d\u00e9cideur le droit de [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] choisir ses propres proc\u00e9dures \u00bb.\n[10] Le plaignant fait valoir que les facteurs 5, 4, 3 et 1 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la plainte, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab type d\u2019affaire concernant une conduite discriminatoire \u00bb (tel qu\u2019\u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019article Pinto).\n[11] L\u2019article Pinto postule \u00e0 la page 5 que :\n[traduction] [E]n pratique, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019obligation de divulgation dans une instance administrative doit commencer par le cinqui\u00e8me facteur de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker. [\u2026] Cependant, cet arr\u00eat nous rappelle que les r\u00e8gles et proc\u00e9dures m\u00eames du tribunal ne sont pas l\u2019ultime moyen de d\u00e9terminer si les documents divulgu\u00e9s suffisent \u00e0 garantir un processus \u00e9quitable. Il est toujours loisible \u00e0 une partie de soutenir qu\u2019un degr\u00e9 de divulgation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 s\u2019impose compte tenu des autres facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker.\nC. Analyse\n[12] La d\u00e9cision administrative port\u00e9e en appel dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I\u20112 et du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019immigration, 1978, DORS\/78-172 (collectivement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s la \u00ab Loi sur l\u2019immigration \u00bb). Mavis Baker avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une mesure d\u2019expulsion du Canada. La demande qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour en \u00eatre exempt\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e dans une lettre, sans motifs.\n[13] Mme Baker contestait la d\u00e9cision au motif qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, notamment parce que la lettre par laquelle sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e ne comportait aucun motif.\n[14] L\u2019avocat de Mme Baker avait ensuite obtenu les notes de l\u2019agent d\u2019immigration ayant men\u00e9 enqu\u00eate, que l\u2019agent sup\u00e9rieur, suivant la conclusion de la Cour, avait utilis\u00e9es pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision.\n[15] L\u2019\u00ab attente l\u00e9gitime \u00bb de Mme Baker, compte tenu de la Convention internationale relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant, \u00e9tait que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de ses enfants n\u00e9s au Canada soient une consid\u00e9ration primordiale dans la d\u00e9cision d\u2019immigration (Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 8). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, la Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9venu que la doctrine des attentes l\u00e9gitimes ne donnait pas ouverture \u00e0 des droits fondamentaux en dehors du domaine proc\u00e9dural (Baker, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 26).\n[16] D\u2019apr\u00e8s mon interpr\u00e9tation, la Cour a appliqu\u00e9 le cinqui\u00e8me facteur de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker lorsqu\u2019elle a accord\u00e9 de l\u2019importance aux directives du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Immigration \u00e9tablissant les crit\u00e8res dont les agents d\u2019immigration doivent tenir compte lorsqu\u2019ils prennent une d\u00e9cision fond\u00e9e sur des motifs du type de ceux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker.\n[17] Le th\u00e8me principal de l\u2019article Pinto me para\u00eet \u00eatre le suivant : plus le degr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale requis dans les instances administratives est important, plus le degr\u00e9 de divulgation doit l\u2019\u00eatre aussi. \u00c0 mon sens, le th\u00e8me secondaire est le suivant : le fait qu\u2019une partie ou un tribunal a suivi les r\u00e8gles de divulgation de ce m\u00eame tribunal ne signifie pas que cette partie ou ce tribunal a offert la divulgation requise dans le contexte d\u2019une instance en particulier.\n[18] C\u2019est l\u2019article Pinto, et non l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, qui \u00e9tablit un lien entre le concept d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et la divulgation de documents avant l\u2019audience.\n[19] La divulgation discut\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker concernait les motifs de la d\u00e9cision du d\u00e9cideur, et non les documents divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audience au sens de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles. Le Tribunal motive la vaste majorit\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9cisions, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles ne soient rendues sur consentement, ce qui est d\u2019ailleurs g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9.\n[20] En ce qui a trait aux quatre premiers facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker, le Tribunal est un organisme quasi judiciaire cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le paragraphe 48.1(1) de la LCDP; ce n\u2019est pas une cour de juridiction civile. Les appels relatifs aux d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal sont pr\u00e9vus par la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C 1985, ch. F\u20117. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi reconna\u00eet l\u2019importance de la d\u00e9cision rendue, pour les parties \u00e0 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, en leur offrant la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de soumettre leur preuve et leurs observations durant l\u2019instruction de la plainte. Il s\u2019agit de la maxime de justice naturelle audi alterem partem \u2013 \u00ab entends l\u2019autre partie \u00bb \u2013 ench\u00e2ss\u00e9e dans la Loi. Les parties \u00e0 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne instruite devant le Tribunal peuvent l\u00e9gitimement s\u2019attendre, en ce qui concerne la divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience, \u00e0 ce que le paragraphe 50(1) soit respect\u00e9 et interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la divulgation soit conforme aux R\u00e8gles et \u00e0 la jurisprudence qui les interpr\u00e8te.\n[21] En plus du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles permet aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des requ\u00eates afin que d\u2019autres documents leur soient divulgu\u00e9s. L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles pr\u00e9voit la divulgation de documents avant l\u2019audience. Le fait que le paragraphe 6(5) rende cette obligation de divulgation continue est aussi une garantie d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[22] La Loi autorise \u00e9galement le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00e9laborer ses propres proc\u00e9dures \u2013 par exemple, le paragraphe 48.9(2) autorise le pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique. De m\u00eame, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)e) autorise le membre instructeur \u00e0 \u00ab trancher toute question de proc\u00e9dure ou de preuve \u00bb pendant l\u2019audience.\n[23] La doctrine de la pertinence potentielle comme norme de divulgation des documents est bien \u00e9tablie dans la jurisprudence. La \u00ab pertinence potentielle \u00bb signifie qu\u2019un document qui pourrait ou non s\u2019av\u00e9rer pertinent ou admissible en preuve, mais qui a un lien avec une question, un fait ou un redressement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans la plainte, doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 dans le processus de divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cette jurisprudence a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi ainsi que les exigences de justice naturelle pour \u00e9tablir cette norme de la pertinence potentielle.\n[24] Je conclus que la Loi sur les droits de la personne, les R\u00e8gles, la jurisprudence qui les interpr\u00e8te de m\u00eame que la norme de la \u00ab pertinence potentielle \u00bb \u00e9tablissent la port\u00e9e, large mais non illimit\u00e9e, de la divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 laquelle les parties \u00e0 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne sont r\u00e9put\u00e9es avoir droit, afin qu\u2019elles aient la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. C\u2019est donc le cinqui\u00e8me facteur de l\u2019arr\u00eat Baker \u2013 les proc\u00e9dures et normes du Tribunal \u2013 qui r\u00e9git la divulgation des documents.\n[25] Le plaignant invoque aussi l\u2019analyse faite dans l\u2019article Pinto d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle la Loi sur l\u2019exercice des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gales, L.R.O. 1990, ch. 22 (la \u00ab LECL \u00bb) exige un degr\u00e9 de divulgation plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans certaines situations, notamment en cas d\u2019audience disciplinaire.\n[26] La LECL est une loi ontarienne qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute instance administrative de cette province requ\u00e9rant une audience. Elle ne s\u2019applique pas aux instances administratives f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. La Loi sur les droits de la personne est une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a institu\u00e9 le Tribunal en tant qu\u2019organisme administratif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Par cons\u00e9quent, la LECL ne s\u2019applique pas dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nV. Courriels, notes d\u2019information, proc\u00e8s-verbaux et notes de service \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au tableau 1 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate\n[27] Le plaignant sollicite la divulgation de tous les courriels, notes d\u2019information, proc\u00e8s-verbaux et notes de service conserv\u00e9s durant les p\u00e9riodes sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es dans les dossiers officiels de POC, y compris dans son syst\u00e8me de gestion de l\u2019information et dans les dossiers \u00e9lectroniques de courriels du minist\u00e8re, et r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par ou adress\u00e9s \u00e0 neuf personnes nomm\u00e9es dont la plupart sont cit\u00e9es comme t\u00e9moins par les deux parties, en y incluant les documents dont celles-ci ont re\u00e7u une copie ou une copie confidentielle.\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate pour les motifs suivants :\n(a) il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 des documents qui \u00e9taient soit d\u00e9tenus, soit cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les personnes nomm\u00e9es au tableau 1;\n(b) la demande du plaignant est trop large, sp\u00e9culative et \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb;\n(c) le plaignant ne sp\u00e9cifie pas ad\u00e9quatement les documents qu\u2019il veut obtenir quand il demande \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de chercher plus profond\u00e9ment dans ses [traduction] \u00ab dossiers minist\u00e9riels \u00bb \u2013 cette [traduction] \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie extr\u00eamement g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de documents \u00bb est [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9pourvue de param\u00e8tres raisonnables \u00bb.\n[29] Le plaignant r\u00e9torque que la seule fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00eatre plus sp\u00e9cifique serait de disposer d\u00e9j\u00e0 des documents requis.\nAnalyse\n[30] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) limite la divulgation aux \u00ab documents [\u2026] qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle \u00bb.\n[31] Le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de [traduction] \u00ab documents minist\u00e9riels \u00bb ou de [traduction] \u00ab dossiers personnels \u00bb est sans importance au regard de l\u2019obligation de divulgation qui s\u2019y rapporte. Pour autant que les dossiers en question soient en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ils sont vis\u00e9s par la divulgation s\u2019ils sont potentiellement pertinents. Il est indiff\u00e9rent que ces dossiers se trouvent dans la messagerie \u00e9lectronique d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ou ailleurs dans ses dossiers, plut\u00f4t que dans un dossier ou un r\u00e9pertoire minist\u00e9riel.\n[32] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a apparemment d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 des renseignements d\u00e9tenus ou cr\u00e9\u00e9s par les personnes nomm\u00e9es au tableau 1, et la description des autres documents que le plaignant veut obtenir n\u2019est pas claire.\n[33] Il ne suffit pas qu\u2019une partie pr\u00e9cise les p\u00e9riodes, les auteurs ou les parties auxquels se rapportent les documents requis. La partie qui sollicite la divulgation doit lier sa demande \u00e0 des faits, des questions ou des formes de redressement invoqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019un des expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cision. Le plaignant ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[34] Si le plaignant est en mesure de formuler une demande plus pr\u00e9cise d\u00e9montrant clairement en quoi les documents re\u00e7us jusqu\u2019ici sont inad\u00e9quats, et en quoi toute autre demande de divulgation est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, le Tribunal \u00e9valuera et tranchera alors la demande apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des autres parties.\nVI. Harc\u00e8lement\n[35] Le plaignant veut obtenir de POC tous les documents [traduction] \u00ab relatifs \u00e0 toute enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement effectu\u00e9e par des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de POC concernant Michael Gardiner et\/ou [le plaignant] ou \u00e0 toute discussion s\u2019y rapportant \u00bb. Il soutient que la plainte et son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions font tous deux mention d\u2019all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et de ses demandes aupr\u00e8s des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs pour que le harc\u00e8lement cesse.\n[36] L\u2019intim\u00e9 objecte que le harc\u00e8lement, au sens de la Loi, \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de cette plainte \u2013 il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9 dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte que la Commission a transmis au Tribunal. Pour inclure des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 la plainte, le plaignant doit pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en vue de la modifier.\n[37] Par ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que parce que le pr\u00e9tendu harc\u00e8lement a cess\u00e9, les raisons pour lesquelles il a pris fin sont d\u00e9pourvues de pertinence.\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve les deux questions suivantes : 1. Le harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi s\u2019inscrit-il dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte? 2. M\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas (ce qu\u2019il nie), la raison pour laquelle le pr\u00e9tendu harc\u00e8lement a cess\u00e9 n\u2019est pas pertinente aux fins de la plainte.\nAnalyse\nLe harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi s\u2019inscrit-il dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte?\n[39] Le paragraphe 73 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant d\u00e9crit des actes qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, constituent du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il utilise l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab en contravention de la LCDP [la Loi] \u00bb, suivie de la note de bas de page 20, laquelle reproduit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) et l\u2019article 59 de la Loi.\n[40] Dans la note de bas de page 22 se rapportant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re phrase du paragraphe 74 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, ce dernier reproduit \u00e0 nouveau et int\u00e9gralement l\u2019article 59 de la Loi, \u00e0 propos de la pr\u00e9tendue absence de r\u00e9action ou complicit\u00e9 des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de POC vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019intimidation et du harc\u00e8lement qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir subi.\n[41] L\u2019article 59 de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\nEst interdite toute menace, intimidation ou discrimination contre l\u2019individu qui d\u00e9pose une plainte, t\u00e9moigne ou participe de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte, au proc\u00e8s ou aux autres proc\u00e9dures que pr\u00e9voit la pr\u00e9sente partie, ou qui se propose d\u2019agir de la sorte.\n[42] Aux termes du paragraphe 60(1) de la Loi, quiconque enfreint l\u2019article 59 \u00ab commet une infraction \u00bb. Le paragraphe 60(2) pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [q]uiconque commet une infraction pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe (1) encourt, sur d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 par proc\u00e9dure sommaire, une amende maximale de 50 000 $ \u00bb. Les autres dispositions de l\u2019article 60 prescrivent le d\u00e9lai requis pour intenter une poursuite, exigent que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada intente la poursuite ou y consente et \u00e9noncent le droit d\u2019une association patronale ou d\u2019une organisation syndicale d\u2019intenter une poursuite ou d\u2019\u00eatre poursuivie.\n[43] L\u2019article 60 donne effet \u00e0 l\u2019article 59. Si une personne est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir menac\u00e9 ou intimid\u00e9 une autre personne ou lui avoir fait subir de la discrimination dans les circonstances pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 59, elle doit \u00eatre poursuivie devant un tribunal de juridiction sommaire \u2013 une cour criminelle. Ce tribunal a \u00e9galement le pouvoir d\u2019appliquer la peine pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 60(2).\n[44] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019estime que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 60 signifie que l\u2019article 59 traite de l\u2019aspect criminel de la menace, de l\u2019intimidation ou de la discrimination dans les circonstances pr\u00e9vues par cette disposition. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une cour criminelle de juridiction sommaire et n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour faire respecter l\u2019article 59. Par cons\u00e9quent, une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, d\u2019intimidation ou de discrimination ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 59 dans le cadre d\u2019une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne soumise au Tribunal.\n[45] Le paragraphe 14(1) de la Loi est la disposition applicable en vertu de laquelle un plaignant peut all\u00e9guer le harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, \u00e0 la note de bas de page 20, cite l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9voit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\n[\u2026]\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n[46] Le plaignant invoque, pour all\u00e9guer le harc\u00e8lement, deux dispositions de la Loi, dont l\u2019article 59, que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019administrer ni de faire respecter. Il est n\u00e9anmoins dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties de savoir si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement s\u2019inscrit dans la port\u00e9e de cette plainte.\n[47] Le Tribunal doit se prononcer sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte avant de statuer sur la divulgation. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si la plainte comprend les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement au sens de la Loi.\n[48] J\u2019inviterai les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la question de savoir si la plainte comprend une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 14 et, si tel n\u2019est pas le cas, leurs positions concernant la modification de la plainte en vue de l\u2019y inclure. Le d\u00e9lai relatif \u00e0 ces observations sera fix\u00e9 lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\nVII. Courriel du 25 novembre 2009 adress\u00e9 par M. Gardiner au plaignant\n[49] Le plaignant d\u00e9clare avoir adress\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Gardiner un courriel [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] concernant les difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 obtenir de la direction une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00bb. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que M. Gardiner a retir\u00e9 un courriel du 25 novembre 2009 (le \u00ab courriel Gardiner du 25 novembre 2009 \u00bb) presque imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir envoy\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse au plaignant. La requ\u00eate sollicite la divulgation du courriel retir\u00e9.\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ignore si son syst\u00e8me informatique lui permet de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un courriel retir\u00e9.\nAnalyse\n[51] Le courriel Gardiner du 25 novembre 2009 pourrait faire partie de la trame de la plainte et concerner la demande d\u2019adaptation. \u00c0 ce titre, je conclus que ce courriel est potentiellement pertinent.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire de son mieux pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le courriel Gardiner du 25 novembre 2009. S\u2019il y parvient, il devra le divulguer. Sinon, il devra en informer les autres parties par \u00e9crit.\nVIII. Mesures d\u2019adaptation li\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres concours de dotation : dossiers relatifs aux mesures d\u2019adaptation de la CFP\n[53] Le plaignant demande la divulgation de tous les documents conserv\u00e9s le concernant et regardant les mesures d\u2019adaptation pr\u00e9vues pour chacun des concours de dotation suivants :\nService correctionnel Canada : processus de dotation no 08-PEN-EA-NCR-NHQ-2853;\nPOC : processus de dotation no 10-DFO-INA-NCR-939827;\nminist\u00e8re des Transports : processus de dotation no 09-MOT-IA-OTT-69796;\nle plaignant demande \u00e9galement la divulgation de tous les documents d\u00e9tenus par le Centre de psychologie du personnel (\u00ab CPP \u00bb) de la CFP concernant toutes les mesures d\u2019adaptation qui lui \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es, notamment [traduction] \u00ab tous les documents d\u2019analyse du CPP appuyant toute mesure d\u2019adaptation n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e ou offerte au plaignant \u00bb.\n[54] Le plaignant fait valoir que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle il a refus\u00e9 de participer au processus d\u2019adaptation. Les documents donneront \u00e9galement un [traduction] \u00ab aper\u00e7u \u00bb de la mani\u00e8re dont le CPP d\u00e9termine les mesures d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9es et permettront de pr\u00e9senter des arguments plus \u00e9clair\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le CPP peut effectivement \u00e9tablir ces mesures, en ce qui se rapporte aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employees Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (CSC) [Meorin]. Cette divulgation justifiera la d\u00e9cision du plaignant de ne pas demander l\u2019\u00e9valuation relative aux mesures d\u2019adaptation. Elle permettra \u00e9galement d\u2019aborder la norme ou la pratique de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb ainsi que les modalit\u00e9s par lesquelles des mesures d\u2019adaptation peuvent le plus raisonnablement \u00eatre consenties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[55] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande, car la question de savoir si le plaignant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de mesures d\u2019adaptation dans le cadre d\u2019autres demandes d\u2019emploi ne concerne pas celle qui se pose dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Il s\u2019agit ici de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a raisonnablement compos\u00e9 avec les besoins du plaignant dans le contexte du concours de dotation ENG-05.\n[56] J\u2019estime que les documents demand\u00e9s sont potentiellement pertinents quant aux questions de l\u2019adaptation et de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb, ainsi qu\u2019au regard des proc\u00e9dures de la CFP et du CPP et de leur participation aux mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[57] L\u2019intim\u00e9 devra divulguer les documents susmentionn\u00e9s, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il ne l\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\nIX. Formulaire d\u2019auto-identification sign\u00e9 par le plaignant\n[58] En septembre 2009, le plaignant s\u2019est identifi\u00e9 comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Il a communiqu\u00e9 une copie non sign\u00e9e du formulaire, et demande la divulgation de la copie sign\u00e9e pour l\u2019utiliser en preuve. Il consent \u00e0 cette divulgation.\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il ne peut pas divulguer le formulaire sign\u00e9, car la signature le rend confidentiel aux termes du paragraphe 9(3) de la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, L.C. 1995, ch. 44 (la \u00ab LEE \u00bb). En outre, il ne conteste pas [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] que le plaignant s\u2019est identifi\u00e9 comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u00bb; il soutient cependant que ce fait n\u2019est pas pertinent quant aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n[60] J\u2019estime que le fait que le plaignant se soit identifi\u00e9 comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience est potentiellement pertinent quant aux all\u00e9gations factuelles contenues dans la plainte. Comme il a consenti \u00e0 ce que le formulaire lui soit divulgu\u00e9, le plaignant a renonc\u00e9 dans cette mesure \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9. Pour que le dossier soit complet, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que le formulaire sign\u00e9 ou une copie certifi\u00e9e conforme lui soit divulgu\u00e9.\n[61] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit, dans la mesure du possible, divulguer le formulaire sign\u00e9 ou une copie certifi\u00e9e conforme au plaignant. Ce dernier devra coop\u00e9rer avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 en signant tout consentement que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente pourrait exiger en vue de la divulgation du formulaire.\nX. [traduction] \u00ab Plan strat\u00e9gique de mise en \u0153uvre du plan d\u2019action de la direction sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi (PADEE) pour 2008 \u2013 2011 \u00bb de POC\n[62] Le plaignant demande \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une copie du document susmentionn\u00e9 lui soit divulgu\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas connaissance de ce document et qu\u2019il a divulgu\u00e9 au plaignant une copie de celui qui porte le titre [traduction] \u00ab Plan d\u2019action de la direction sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u2013 Janvier 2008 au 31 mars 2011 \u00bb.\n[63] L\u2019intim\u00e9 devra rechercher le document que demande le plaignant; s\u2019il ne parvient pas \u00e0 le retrouver, il devra confirmer par \u00e9crit aux parties que celui-ci n\u2019est ni en sa possession ni sous son contr\u00f4le.\nXI. Candidatures et curriculum vitae de deux candidats au poste ENG-05\n[64] Le plaignant demande \u00e0 POC de lui communiquer les documents de candidature et curriculum vitae de Tracey Clarke et Darren Gould, deux personnes dont les candidatures n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenues dans le concours de dotation ENG-05, afin de corr\u00e9ler les r\u00e9sultats de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection.\n[65] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que ces informations ne sont pas pertinentes; la question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte est de savoir s\u2019il a omis de composer avec les besoins du plaignant en ne le nommant pas au poste ENG-05. Les renseignements demand\u00e9s n\u2019aideront pas le plaignant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Les seuls renseignements susceptibles de le faire int\u00e9ressent les [traduction] \u00ab qualifications du plaignant et celles du candidat retenu \u00bb (r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, paragraphes 37 et 38). Le crit\u00e8re pertinent pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] est de savoir si le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, et si une personne qui n\u2019est pas plus qualifi\u00e9e que lui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e au poste \u00bb (ibid.).\nAnalyse\n[66] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne cite pas sp\u00e9cifiquement la d\u00e9cision Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited (1981), 3 C.H.R.R.D\/1001 (Comm. enq. Ont.) [Shakes] \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position, mais le crit\u00e8re servant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie s\u2019y trouve \u00e9nonc\u00e9 selon le point de vue de l'intim\u00e9. La Commission a \u00e9galement voulu s\u2019appuyer sur le courant jurisprudentiel de la d\u00e9cision Shakes : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] particuli\u00e8rement au regard du crit\u00e8re comparatif \u00bb (expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission, au paragraphe 59).\n[67] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait une mise en garde contre l\u2019application \u00ab automatique [...] \u00bb du crit\u00e8re Shakes \u00ab [\u2026] d\u2019une mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire dans chaque affaire qui porte sur l\u2019embauchage : il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte des circonstances de chaque affaire pour \u00e9tablir si l\u2019application de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des crit\u00e8res, en tout ou en partie, est pertinente \u00bb (Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 18, citant Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 3 [Premakumar], au paragraphe 77). L\u2019expression \u00ab l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des crit\u00e8res \u00bb renvoie au crit\u00e8re de Shakes et \u00e0 celui de la d\u00e9cision Israeli v. Public Service Commission (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616., qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir autrement une preuve prima facie et s\u2019applique \u00e0 d\u2019autres circonstances.\n[68] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire preuve de flexibilit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (CanLII) et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en substance que le crit\u00e8re visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie dans une affaire d\u2019emploi devrait \u00eatre souple et non formul\u00e9. Pour la Cour, la d\u00e9cision Shakes n\u2019est qu\u2019une illustration des directives fournies par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC) [O\u2019Malley], lequel \u00e9nonce un crit\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et souple aux fins de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[69] En outre, la pr\u00e9sente plainte ne concerne pas seulement la question de savoir s\u2019il y a eu discrimination au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi ou des enjeux d\u2019adaptation. Il s\u2019agit aussi de d\u00e9terminer si, au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi, la ligne de conduite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb est discriminatoire sur le plan syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant et de ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui.\n[70] Le plaignant fait valoir que ces renseignements lui permettront [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] de corr\u00e9ler les r\u00e9sultats de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection des candidats avec les atouts et qualifications essentiels \u00bb, et de s\u2019en servir relativement \u00e0 son [traduction] \u00ab argument de la bonne personne \u00bb (r\u00e9plique du plaignant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate).\n[71] Le plaignant a \u00e9tabli un lien entre ces documents et la question de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb dans la plainte et ils devraient lui \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s sous r\u00e9serve de leur caract\u00e8re confidentiel, que j\u2019estime devoir prot\u00e9ger de la mani\u00e8re ci-dessous indiqu\u00e9e.\n[72] Exception faite de leurs noms, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de caviarder tout renseignement d\u2019identification personnel sur chacun des curriculum vit\u00e6 et documents de candidature, notamment les dates de naissance, adresses, num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, courriels, num\u00e9ros d\u2019assurance sociale, num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et adresses au travail. L\u2019intim\u00e9 divulguera ensuite les versions caviard\u00e9es des documents de candidature et curriculum vit\u00e6 de Tracey Clarke et de Darren Gould au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission.\nXII. Ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi\n[73] Le plaignant souhaite obtenir les ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs (les \u00ab ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs \u00bb ou \u00ab ententes \u00bb) et\/ou les documents int\u00e9ressant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] li\u00e9e de quelque fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, qui concernent Michael Gardiner et Derek Buxton pour les ann\u00e9es 2008-2009 et 2009-2010 \u00bb. Le plaignant [traduction] \u00ab aimerait savoir \u00bb si les personnes nomm\u00e9es [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] avaient des objectifs sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 atteindre en mati\u00e8re d\u2019EE et si elles ont re\u00e7u la moindre contrepartie (notamment financi\u00e8re) ou [traduction] \u00ab de bons points \u00bb pour avoir atteint ces objectifs, et si [traduction] \u00ab des primes de rendement [leur] avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 promises pour [la personne nomm\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019EE, une femme], mais pas pour le plaignant \u00bb (avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant et r\u00e9plique du plaignant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate).\n[74] L\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln, en particulier les paragraphes 26 et 27, est le fondement de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab les questions \u00bb soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la LEE et des obligations qu\u2019elle lui impose [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] sont d\u00e9pourvues de pertinence dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a clairement affirm\u00e9 que la LEE op\u00e9rait ind\u00e9pendamment de la Loi [sur les droits de la personne] \u00bb (r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, au paragraphe 33).\n[75] S\u2019agissant sp\u00e9cifiquement des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 leur divulgation au motif qu\u2019elles ne concernent pas les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, puisque le candidat retenu dans le concours de dotation ENG-05 n\u2019appartenait \u00e0 aucun groupe d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi (\u00ab EE \u00bb). Je note que la d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e semble contredire l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, que j\u2019aborderai plus loin. M\u00eame si des primes de rendement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 promises, elles n\u2019auraient eu aucun effet sur le processus de s\u00e9lection.\nAnalyse\n[76] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln, le plaignant invoquait la LEE \u00e0 une fin pr\u00e9cise :\n[\u2026] [Le plaignant] pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que tant le Tribunal que la juge Dawson ont commis une erreur puisqu'ils n'ont pas tenu compte des propos [du plaignant] qui avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la violation de l'article 5 de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi, L.C. 1995, ch. 44, \u00e9tait en soi une preuve prima facie suffisante de discrimination (Lincoln, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 11).\nLe paragraphe [26] de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln contient ceci :\nLa derni\u00e8re question vise la pertinence de la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi dans le contexte d'une plainte en vertu de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. [\u2026]\n[77] Je conclus que le paragraphe 27 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln d\u00e9fend la proposition selon laquelle le non-respect de la LEE par un intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en soi d\u00e9cisif au regard de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi sur les droits de la personne.\n[78] L\u2019application du paragraphe 27 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln \u00e0 des affaires de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans Khiamal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495 [Khiamal]. Dans cette affaire, le plaignant souhaitait introduire en preuve des donn\u00e9es statistiques que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait recueillies au titre de la LEE. Le Tribunal ne l\u2019y a pas autoris\u00e9.\n[79] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli une distinction entre la mani\u00e8re dont le plaignant voulait se servir \u00ab des donn\u00e9es statistiques que l\u2019on trouve dans le rapport sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans l\u2019emploi \u00bb et celle dont le plaignant dans Khiamal tentait d\u2019utiliser la LEE. La Cour a conclu que ce plaignant :\n[\u2026] ne parl[ait] pas de l\u2019application ou du respect de la [LEE]. [\u2026] C\u2019est l\u2019inf\u00e9rence qui peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui rev\u00eat de l\u2019importance. Et c\u2019est au Tribunal qu\u2019il revient de d\u00e9cider de la valeur qu\u2019il convient de leur attribuer. [\u2026] La question de savoir si les donn\u00e9es statistiques soumises par le [plaignant] sont utiles pour trancher la question en litige et si elles appuient l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination est une conclusion qu\u2019il appartient au Tribunal de tirer (Khiamal, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 96).\n[80] De m\u00eame, dans Kanags Premakumar c. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 (TCDP) [Premakumar], la membre MacTavish, alors pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, a admis en preuve des donn\u00e9es statistiques \u00ab [\u2026] sur la repr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de l\u2019effectif [de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019intim\u00e9] \u00bb (Premakumar, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62).\n[81] Les d\u00e9cisions Khiamal et Premakumar appuient la proposition voulant que le paragraphe 27 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Lincoln doive recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation conforme \u00e0 sa teneur et non lib\u00e9rale au point d\u2019exclure automatiquement toute preuve li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019EE au motif qu\u2019elle est sans pertinence au regard d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. Une telle preuve, si elle est admise, doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e quant \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 son poids par ce m\u00eame Tribunal.\nDans sa plainte et son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant mentionne l\u2019EE dans son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et ses all\u00e9gations factuelles. Par exemple, au paragraphe 30 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, il explique comment il a d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab la logique suivant laquelle sa demande d\u2019\u00eatre choisi dans le groupe de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour le poste constituerait une mesure d\u2019adaptation raisonnable et aiderait l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 atteindre ses objectifs d\u2019EE \u00bb.\n[82] Le nom de Heather McDonald (Skaarup) figure dans la liste de t\u00e9moins de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9; cette derni\u00e8re est notamment d\u00e9crite comme [traduction] \u00ab la candidate de l\u2019EE ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e au poste ENG-05 \u00bb. Kenneth Hill, un autre t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, est d\u00e9crit par ce dernier comme [traduction] \u00ab le candidat retenu dans le concours ENG-05 sans tenir compte de l\u2019EE \u00bb. Toujours dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste \u00e9galement l\u2019argument du plaignant li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019EE.\n[83] Il me semble que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi s\u2019inscrit dans la trame de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[84] Cela \u00e9tant dit, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations aux termes de la LEE ou du PADEE 2008-2011, ou de tout autre politique concernant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi (Lincoln, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 27). Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des redressements relativement \u00e0 des violations de la LEE (ibid).\n[85] Il ressort de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant que c\u2019est la d\u00e9claration issue du plan strat\u00e9gique des ressources humaines 2009-2012 de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la diversit\u00e9 \u00bb sera l\u2019un des [traduction] \u00ab engagement[s] des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs visant tous les directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [\u2026] et ces derniers devront faire la preuve concr\u00e8te de leurs efforts pour recruter des membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00bb, qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que ces cadres recevaient des [traduction] \u00ab gratifications, bons points ou primes de rendement \u00bb s\u2019ils remplissaient les objectifs d\u2019EE (avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant, note de bas de page 1).\n[86] Quant \u00e0 savoir si les ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs sont potentiellement pertinentes au regard de la plainte et si elles doivent donc \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es, la question se rapporte ici \u00e0 la nature des documents r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\n[87] Si je comprends bien, le plaignant cherche \u00e0 prouver, \u00e0 partir des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, qu\u2019en mettant en \u0153uvre la LEE, et en particulier en rem\u00e9diant \u00e0 la sous-repr\u00e9sentation per\u00e7ue des femmes, l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 ainsi que d\u2019autres personnes atteintes de la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui, et a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur endroit. Ce n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose que de chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer le non-respect de la LEE, du PADEE ou des politiques d\u2019EE pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie.\n[88] Dans ce contexte, je conclus que les parties des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs concernant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi sont potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 une question int\u00e9ressant la plainte.\n[89] Cependant, exiger la divulgation de l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 desdites ententes n\u2019est pas potentiellement pertinent quant \u00e0 cette question et constitue une atteinte injustifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers personnels des individus vis\u00e9s. Seules les parties se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi sont potentiellement pertinentes.\n[90] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de caviarder toutes les portions des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, y compris les montants d\u2019argent, pour ne laisser que le nom de chaque individu, l\u2019ann\u00e9e ou les ann\u00e9es durant lesquelles les ententes \u00e9taient en vigueur et tous les segments concernant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 divulguera alors les versions caviard\u00e9es des ententes de rendement des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission.\n[91] Je conclus que les documents concernant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de ces individus et l\u2019EE ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents. Ce qui l\u2019est, cependant, c\u2019est de savoir s\u2019il existait certaines primes de rendement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un groupe ou de groupes donn\u00e9s d\u2019EE, et non le montant des primes financi\u00e8res. De plus, la divulgation des informations financi\u00e8res des personnes vis\u00e9es serait une atteinte injustifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.\nXIII. La demande du plaignant concernant la d\u00e9termination de la pertinence potentielle\n[92] Dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, le plaignant demande \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9, de la Commission ou au personnel du Tribunal et de la Commission de d\u00e9cider ce qui est potentiellement pertinent. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner au personnel de la Commission de fournir des services. Le personnel du Tribunal n\u2019offre pas d\u2019avis juridiques, comme l\u2019implique une d\u00e9cision concernant la pertinence potentielle. La proc\u00e9dure usuelle en mati\u00e8re de divulgation consiste, pour la partie repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, \u00e0 regrouper tous les documents concernant une plainte, conform\u00e9ment aux instructions de l\u2019avocat, et \u00e0 ce que ce dernier d\u00e9termine ce qui est potentiellement pertinent. Les avocats sont des officiers de justice. \u00c0 ce titre, ils doivent se soumettre non seulement aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019organisme qui r\u00e9git leur propre profession, \u00e0 celles de la cour et du tribunal, mais aussi se conduire de mani\u00e8re \u00e9thique envers les autres parties, la cour ou le tribunal. Les avocats ont \u00e9galement la responsabilit\u00e9 professionnelle d\u2019expliquer les r\u00e8gles de la cour ou du tribunal \u00e0 leurs clients, et de les informer des cons\u00e9quences li\u00e9es au non-respect de ces r\u00e8gles. Dans les circonstances, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de rendre ce type d\u2019ordonnance.\nXIV. Divulgation et admissibilit\u00e9\n[93] S\u2019agissant des documents dont la divulgation est ordonn\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sente, j\u2019aimerais noter que cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019ils sont automatiquement admissibles en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La norme d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame que celle qui r\u00e9git la divulgation.\nXV. D\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9\n[94] La d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte reste en vigueur.\nXVI. D\u00e9cision\n[95] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fera de son mieux pour retrouver le courriel du 25 novembre 2009 que M. Michael Gardiner a envoy\u00e9 au plaignant et qu\u2019il a ensuite retir\u00e9.

Le contexte\n[1] Les plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN), ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (la plainte) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC), autrefois appel\u00e9 Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (AINC), all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations est assimilable \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c. H\u20116 (la LCDP ou la Loi). Le 14 octobre 2008, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) et, le 3 novembre 2008, elle lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[2] Le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Mme Cindy Blackstock, agissant pour le compte de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, a signifi\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire modifier la plainte en vue d\u2019y inclure des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, un acte contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi (la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte). Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 16 octobre 2012 (2012 TCDP 24), le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, concluant que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9coulaient de la m\u00eame matrice factuelle que celle de la plainte initiale et que la bonne administration de la justice appuyait l\u2019octroi de la modification plut\u00f4t que de s\u00e9parer artificiellement les all\u00e9gations en de multiples instances. Le Tribunal a tenu une audience sur les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2013, le 1er mars 2013, les 15, 16, 17, 19, 22 et 24 juillet 2013 ainsi que le 7 ao\u00fbt 2013, \u00e0 Ottawa. Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, c\u2019est le nom de Mme Blackstock que l\u2019on utilisera lorsque l\u2019on fera r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des faits mettant en cause cette derni\u00e8re, et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien sera appel\u00e9e la plaignante. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve entendus lors de cette audience, de pair avec les observations \u00e9crites que les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la suite, \u00e9clairent la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nII. Le droit en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles\nA. Un survol de la jurisprudence applicable\n[3] Comme l\u2019indique l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[4] Comme c\u2019est le cas pour d\u2019autres plaintes de discrimination, le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles p\u00e8se tout d\u2019abord sur les \u00e9paules du plaignant, qui doit en fournir une preuve prima facie. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le plaignant doit fournir une preuve qui, si l\u2019on y ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour qu\u2019il soit justifi\u00e9 de rendre un verdict de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contre le plaignant (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28 [O\u2019Malley]). Si une plainte repose sur un motif de distinction illicite, le plaignant est tenu de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination, qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33).\n[5] Cependant, les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur un motif de distinction illicite. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ant\u00e9rieure du plaignant que l\u2019on substitue au motif de distinction illicite. C\u2019est donc dire que pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles, le plaignant se doit de montrer qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en vertu de la LCDP, qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte et que cette derni\u00e8re a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de cet effet. Cela dit, il y a une certaine controverse dans la jurisprudence du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont un plaignant peut \u00e9tablir que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable subi.\n[6] Dans Virk c. Bell Canada (2005 TCDP 2 [Virk]), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab [l]\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d\u2019acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte \u00bb (Virk, au paragraphe 156). Selon ce point de vue, le plaignant doit montrer que le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 auteur des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019existence de la plainte, qu\u2019il a agi de mani\u00e8re inopportune et que son inconduite a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte (voir la d\u00e9cision Virk, au paragraphe 158). Dans certaines d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal, la d\u00e9cision Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme exigeant que le plaignant prouve l\u2019existence d\u2019une intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles (voir, par exemple, Malec, Malec, Kaltush, Ishpatao, Tettaut, Malec, Mest\u00e9pap\u00e9o, Kaltush c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 TCDP 2, ainsi que Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Raj Thambirajah, 2012 TCDP 29).\n[7] Une autre approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e dans Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (No 7), (1995), 23 C.H.R.R. D\/213, confirm\u00e9e par (1998) O.A.C. 188 (C. Div.), modifi\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs par (2000), 50 O.R. 3(d) 18 (C.A.) et adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (TCDP) [Wong]. Selon cette approche, pour prouver que des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es il suffit d\u2019y avoir un lien entre les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles et l\u2019exercice des droits du plaignant en vertu de la LCDP. Si l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9tablirait manifestement l\u2019existence de ce lien, cela pourrait \u00eatre aussi le cas de la \u00ab perception raisonnable \u00bb du plaignant que l\u2019acte commis est une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[8] Si l\u2019on applique l\u2019approche suivie dans la d\u00e9cision Wong, il faut d\u00e9terminer dans quelle mesure la perception du plaignant est raisonnable, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas tenir l\u2019intim\u00e9 responsable de l\u2019angoisse ou des r\u00e9actions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es du plaignant (voir Wong, au paragraphe 219). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, s\u2019il y a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de conflit entre le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9, il peut \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si la perception du plaignant est raisonnable ou pas. Pour aider \u00e0 faire cette analyse, dans Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et de Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 40, aux paragraphes 48 \u00e0 61 [Bressette], le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 une approche dans le cadre de laquelle il a tout d\u2019abord d\u00e9termin\u00e9 s\u2019il pouvait admettre, en se fondant sur une preuve prima facie, que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e9tait au moins l\u2019un des facteurs qui avaient influenc\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tendue diff\u00e9rence de traitement. S\u2019il est possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie, on demande alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer le traitement de mani\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[9] Comme dans Virk, certains tribunaux et commissions des droits de la personne des provinces ont besoin d\u2019une preuve d\u2019intention, au moyen d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs ou d\u2019inf\u00e9rences, pour corroborer une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Walsh c. Mobil Oil Canada, 2008 ABCA 268 et Noble c. York University, 2010 HRTO 878). D\u2019autres ont suivi l\u2019approche expos\u00e9e dans Entrop, Wong et Bressette en se fondant sur une perception raisonnable du plaignant de l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Bissonnette c. School District No. 62 and Frizzell, 2006 BCHRT 447), ou simplement sur un lien entre la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable ult\u00e9rieur (voir Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Ville de Nicolet, 2001 CanLII 88 (QC TDP)).\n[10] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont toutes deux fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait privil\u00e9gier l\u2019une de ces deux approches. La plaignante est d\u2019avis que l\u2019approche qui pr\u00e9vaut \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle est celle qui est expos\u00e9e dans Wong et qu\u2019il est inutile pour elle de prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait une intention pr\u00e9cise; elle doit plut\u00f4t montrer que Mme Blackstock a per\u00e7u raisonnablement que la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles cons\u00e9cutif \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. L\u2019intim\u00e9, en revanche, soutient que, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Tribunal dans Virk et Cassidy, il doit y avoir un aspect conscient aux repr\u00e9sailles et la plaignante doit montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte et y a r\u00e9agi n\u00e9gativement en usant de repr\u00e9sailles ou d\u2019une autre conduite punitive. Cependant, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutiennent tous deux qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019approche qu\u2019adoptera le Tribunal, les preuves li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00e9tayent leurs positions respectives.\n[11] \u00c0 notre avis, l\u2019approche suivie dans Wong et Bressette est celle qui convient pour analyser les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles. Exiger qu\u2019il y ait une intention en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles impose, pour confirmer cette pratique discriminatoire, un fardeau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que pour les autres qui sont d\u00e9crites dans la LCDP. Cela ne concorde pas avec une interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP ou de la l\u00e9gislation relative aux droits de la personne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[12] La r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative de base est la suivante : [traduction] \u00ab il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2e \u00e9d. (Toronto : Butterworths, 1983), \u00e0 la page 87; voir \u00e9galement Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 RCS 27, au paragraphe 21).\n[13] La nature de la l\u00e9gislation relative aux droits de la personne est \u00e9galement prise en compte lors de son interpr\u00e9tation :\nLa l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l\u2019essor des droits individuels d\u2019importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu\u2019en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu\u2019elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu\u2019offre la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n(CN c.

Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66, au paragraphe 44)\n[14] Le mot \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb signifie \u00ab [r]endre le mal pour le mal \u00bb (Le Petit Robert 2013, sous \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb). En anglais, le mot \u00ab retaliate \u00bb signifie \u00ab respond to an injury, insult, assault, etc. in like manner \u00bb (Canadian Oxford Dictionnary, 2e \u00e9d., sous \u00ab retaliate \u00bb). M\u00eame si le sens ordinaire et grammatical des mots \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb ou \u00ab retaliate \u00bb aide \u00e0 comprendre l\u2019agissement de base qui est en litige, ces d\u00e9finitions ne sont pas enti\u00e8rement transf\u00e9rables \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, \u00e0 l\u2019objet et \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la LCDP.\n[15] Tout d\u2019abord, le fait d\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re litt\u00e9rale les d\u00e9finitions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent dans le contexte de la LCDP \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 qualifier une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u2019acte fautif (pr\u00e9judice, insulte, agression, dommage). Cela ne concorde manifestement pas avec l\u2019objet de la LCDP :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet [\u2026] au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\nLorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9pose une plainte de pratique discriminatoire en vue de prot\u00e9ger cet objet, le public exerce les droits que lui conf\u00e8rent les lois \u00ab fondamentales \u00bb ou \u00ab quasi constitutionnelles \u00bb en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (voir Battlefords and District Co\u2011operative Ltd. c. Gibbs, [1996] 3 RCS 566, \u00e0 la page 577). Ces droits \u00ab [\u2026] et les valeurs [que ces lois tendent] \u00e0 promouvoir et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger, sont, hormis les dispositions constitutionnelles, plus importan[ts] que tou[s] les autres \u00bb (Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 RCS 145, \u00e0 la page 158). C\u2019est donc dire que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte en vue de prot\u00e9ger des droits de la personne ne devrait pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un acte fautif, mais comme un geste noble, s\u00fbr et juste.\n[16] Deuxi\u00e8mement, si les d\u00e9finitions des mots \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb et \u00ab retaliate \u00bb sous\u2011entendent une forme quelconque de gestes conscients et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s de la part de la personne qui les exerce, on peut en dire autant de la discrimination elle-m\u00eame. Le mot \u00ab discrimination \u00bb signifie \u00ab [t]raitement in\u00e9gal et d\u00e9favorable appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines personnes (notamment en raison de leur origine, leur sexe, leur \u00e2ge, leurs croyances religieuses [\u2026] (Le Petit Robert 2013, sous \u00ab discrimination \u00bb). En anglais, \u00ab to discriminate \u00bb signifie \u00ab make a distinction, esp. unjustly and on the basis of race, age, sex, etc. \u00bb (Canadian Oxford Dictionnary, 2e \u00e9d., sous \u00ab discriminate \u00bb). Malgr\u00e9 ces d\u00e9finitions de la discrimination, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que lorsqu\u2019on prend en compte la nature et l\u2019objet de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver l\u2019intention pour \u00e9tayer une all\u00e9gation de discrimination.\n[17] Dans Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), 1987 CanLII 73 (CSC), au paragraphe 9 [Robichaud], la Cour supr\u00eame a fait remarquer que la LCDP \u00ab [\u2026] vise \u00e0 \"donner effet\" au principe de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances pour tous en supprimant les distinctions injustes. \u00bb C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que cette loi vise principalement \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination, et non \u00e0 punir ceux qui la pratiquent. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour supr\u00eame a ajout\u00e9 :\nPuisque la Loi s\u2019attache essentiellement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination de toute discrimination plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la punition d\u2019une conduite antisociale, il s\u2019ensuit que les motifs ou les intentions des auteurs d\u2019actes discriminatoires ne constituent pas une des pr\u00e9occupations majeures du l\u00e9gislateur. Au contraire, la Loi vise \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des conditions socialement peu souhaitables, et ce, sans \u00e9gard aux raisons de leur existence.\n(Robichaud, au paragraphe 10)\n[18] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, dans O\u2019Malley, au paragraphe 14, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nAdopter un point de vue plus \u00e9troit pour conclure que l\u2019intention constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire de la discrimination en vertu du Code serait, me semble\u2011t\u2011il, \u00e9lever une barri\u00e8re pratiquement insurmontable pour le plaignant qui demande r\u00e9paration. Il serait extr\u00eamement difficile dans la plupart des cas de prouver le mobile et il serait facile de camoufler ce mobile en formulant des r\u00e8gles qui, tout en imposant des normes d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, cr\u00e9eraient, comme dans l\u2019affaire Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), des injustices et de la discrimination en traitant \u00e9galement ceux qui sont in\u00e9gaux (Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 (1950), \u00e0 la p. 184). De plus, comme j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de le d\u00e9montrer, nous avons ici affaire aux cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une conduite plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la punition d\u2019une mauvaise conduite. En d\u2019autres termes, nous sommes saisis essentiellement de voies de recours civiles. La preuve de l\u2019intention, une exigence n\u00e9cessaire dans notre fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder une loi criminelle et punitive, ne devrait pas \u00eatre un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne qui vise \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination. Je suis d\u2019avis que les tribunaux d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure ont eu tort de conclure que l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction constitue un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u00e9cessaire.\n[19] Conform\u00e9ment aux arr\u00eats Robichaud et O\u2019Malley, l\u2019intention n\u2019est pas une preuve qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous signalons que cette derni\u00e8re ne fait pas de distinction entre les pratiques discriminatoires, et cela inclut les repr\u00e9sailles dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 :\n4. Les actes discriminatoires pr\u00e9vus aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte en vertu de la partie III et toute personne reconnue coupable de ces actes peut faire l\u2019objet des ordonnances pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 53.\n39. Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente partie, \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1.\n[20] De plus, aucune exigence d\u2019intention n\u2019est express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 :\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[21] La notion d\u2019intention n\u2019appara\u00eet dans la LCDP que lorsqu\u2019une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e, et il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un aspect dont il faut tenir compte au moment de rendre une ordonnance en vertu de l\u2019article 53 :\n53. (3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\nL\u2019analyse qu\u2019ont adopt\u00e9e les membres instructeurs du Tribunal en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) ainsi que les indemnit\u00e9s correspondantes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es \u2013 ou non \u2013 peuvent \u00eatre une indication du seuil plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que comporte l\u2019exigence d\u2019intention.\nLa Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce paragraphe est une \u00ab [\u2026] disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires \u00bb (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, au paragraphe 155, d\u00e9cision confirm\u00e9e par 2014 CAF 110 [Johnstone CF]). Une conclusion d\u2019agissement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 exige que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne aient \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels \u00bb (Johnstone CF, au paragraphe 155). L\u2019acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est \u00ab [\u2026] celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante \u00bb (Johnstone CF, au paragraphe 155). Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas souvent accord\u00e9 d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 dans la fourchette sup\u00e9rieure que pr\u00e9voit ce paragraphe, ce qui peut \u00eatre une indication que l\u2019on applique l\u2019exigence d\u2019intention. Fait int\u00e9ressant, dans Bressette, le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, mais n\u2019a accord\u00e9 aucune indemnit\u00e9 en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\n[22] De plus, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab [i]l ne doit pas y avoir de hi\u00e9rarchie en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00bb (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2014 CAF 110, au paragraphe 81 [Johnstone CAF]). En d\u00e9terminant que le motif illicite de la situation de famille ne devrait pas comporter un seuil plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour une conclusion de discrimination prima facie que pour les autres motifs illicites indiqu\u00e9s dans la LCDP, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nJe conviens que le crit\u00e8re qui doit s\u2019appliquer pour pouvoir conclure \u00e0 une discrimination de prime abord fond\u00e9e sur le motif interdit de la situation de famille doit \u00eatre essentiellement le m\u00eame que celui qui s\u2019applique dans le cas des autres motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s de discrimination.\n(Johnstone CAF, au paragraphe 81)\n[23] Il est possible d\u2019appliquer le m\u00eame raisonnement \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Les repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019impliquent pas l\u2019application d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite, mais elles emploient \u00e0 leur place une plainte de discrimination. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 Johnstone CAF, le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 devrait \u00eatre essentiellement le m\u00eame que celui qui s\u2019applique aux autres pratiques discriminatoires. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, aucune de ces autres pratiques n\u2019exige que le plaignant \u00e9tablisse l\u2019existence d\u2019une intention.\n[24] Cette interpr\u00e9tation concorde \u00e9galement avec les consid\u00e9rations de principe importantes qui sous-tendent l\u2019article 14.1. L\u2019interdiction d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte sauvegarde l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus relatif aux plaintes de la LCDP en assurant une protection aux plaignants qui h\u00e9sitent peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 exercer les droits que leur conf\u00e8re la LCDP par crainte de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle garantit \u00e9galement que s\u2019ils sont victimes de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte, une mesure de redressement leur sera accord\u00e9e. Cet article peut \u00e9galement servir \u00e0 dissuader ceux qui pourraient user de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[25] Le fait d\u2019exiger une intention pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles peut aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des objets de l\u2019article 14.1, car, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises : \u00ab [l]a discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire \u00bb (Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP)). C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019une obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une intention ferait en sorte qu\u2019il serait fort difficile d\u2019\u00e9tayer une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[26] En fait, avant l\u2019inclusion de l\u2019article 14.1, les repr\u00e9sailles n\u2019\u00e9taient vis\u00e9es que par les articles 59 et 60 de la LCDP. Ces deux articles font qu\u2019une personne qui exerce toute menace, intimidation ou discrimination contre une personne parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la LCDP commet une infraction punissable sur d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9. Avant l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 14.1, en 1998, rares \u00e9taient les poursuites intent\u00e9es pour repr\u00e9sailles, et celles qui l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 avaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9chou\u00e9. Cela \u00e9tait d\u00fb au fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences criminelles qui \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 dans ces affaires : une preuve hors de tout doute raisonnable que des mesures \u00e9taient prises contre un plaignant dans l\u2019intention de l\u2019obliger \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Le Parlement a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le syst\u00e8me antidiscriminatoire cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la LCDP conviendrait mieux que les tribunaux criminels pour contrer les affaires de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Parlement du Canada, R\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatif 298E, \u00ab Projet de loi S\u20115 : Loi modifiant la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, le Code criminel et la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb, par Nancy Holmes (Division du droit et du gouvernement, 1998), \u00e0 la section C3, en ligne : Parlement du Canada, http:\/\/www.parl.gc.ca\/About\/Parliament\/ LegislativeSummaries\/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&ls=S5&Parl=36&Ses=1&Language=F).\n[27] Pour ces raisons, nous ne croyons pas qu\u2019il faudrait qu\u2019un plaignant soit tenu de faire la preuve d\u2019une intention pour \u00e9tayer une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. \u00c0 notre avis, l\u2019objet central de la LCDP consiste \u00e0 \u00ab \u00e9liminer des conditions antisociales sans \u00e9gards aux motifs ou intentions de ceux qui en sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 11). Obliger un plaignant \u00e0 prouver une intention en vue d\u2019\u00e9tayer une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles amoindrit la protection qu\u2019offre la LCDP contre de tels agissements et affaiblit l\u2019effet de l\u2019inclusion de l\u2019article 14.1 dans la LCDP.\n[28] Cela dit, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019un plaignant prouve l\u2019existence d\u2019une intention pour \u00e9tayer une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, il faut tout de m\u00eame que ce plaignant pr\u00e9sente des preuves suffisantes pour justifier que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans un pr\u00e9tendu traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la part d\u2019un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, et ce, que ce traitement repose sur une perception raisonnable ou pas. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, nous signalons qu\u2019une preuve prima facie n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019une partie produise un type d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment particulier. Au contraire, dans chaque affaire, le fait de savoir si la preuve produite est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154, au paragraphe 27) est une question mixte de fait et de droit. Si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment que l\u2019on pr\u00e9sente pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles est suffisant, il revient dans ce cas au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la preuve du plaignant, de pair avec n\u2019importe quel \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, en vue de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que l\u2019on a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[29] C\u2019est dans cette optique que nous passons maintenant \u00e0 un examen des faits propres \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIII. La plainte de repr\u00e9sailles\n[30] La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de 2007 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mme Blackstock et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien entretenaient des liens de collaboration \u00e9troits avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019Examen conjoint de la Politique nationale de 2000, dans le cadre duquel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e la formule appliqu\u00e9e par le gouvernement du Canada pour financer les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les r\u00e9serves (la \u00ab Directive 20\u20111 \u00bb), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a charg\u00e9 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien d\u2019engager une \u00e9quipe d\u2019experts en vue de d\u00e9terminer au moins trois formules de financement de rechange pour les organismes de service \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019au cours de ce travail de recherche et de la production des trois rapports qui en ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 (les rapports Wen:de), les parties ont travaill\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re concert\u00e9e. Cependant, une fois que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, il y a eu un changement notable dans l\u2019attitude de l\u2019intim\u00e9 envers la plaignante, un changement qui, selon cette derni\u00e8re, a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans aucun doute attribuable \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[31] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet qu\u2019AADNC retient les services d\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019organismes, comme la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, et d\u2019experts pour leur comp\u00e9tence dans le domaine du financement des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves indiennes au Canada. En fait, AADNC fait \u00e9galement affaire avec des gouvernements provinciaux et de nombreux organismes internationaux au sujet de questions connexes. L\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien entretenaient effectivement une relation de travail depuis un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es, mais cette relation a chang\u00e9 en 2006, apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du rapport Wen:de et sa pr\u00e9sentation. Ce changement date toutefois d\u2019avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que la perception de Mme Blackstock, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9 contre elle des repr\u00e9sailles parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, est infond\u00e9e et d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[32] La plainte de repr\u00e9sailles repose sur une s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents pr\u00e9cis dans lesquels, all\u00e8gue-t-on, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pris des mesures de la nature de repr\u00e9sailles. Mme Blackstock, agissant pour le compte de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien (la plaignante), all\u00e8gue que les incidents suivants ont eu lieu par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte : (A.) elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e occasionnelle au sein d\u2019un groupe de travail, malgr\u00e9 ses qualifications professionnelles (le Groupe de travail de la Colombie\u2011Britannique), (B.) elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec le ministre et les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario (la r\u00e9union des Chefs de l\u2019Ontario au cabinet du ministre), (C.) l\u2019intim\u00e9 a surveill\u00e9 ses interventions publiques (la surveillance des interventions publiques de la plaignante), (D.) l\u2019intim\u00e9 a surveill\u00e9 les pages Facebook concernant la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et la campagne \u00ab Je suis un t\u00e9moin \u00bb, de m\u00eame que sa page Facebook personnelle (la surveillance des pages Facebook), et (E.) l\u2019intim\u00e9 a consult\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inopportune son dossier figurant dans le Registre des Indiens, et ce, \u00e0 deux reprises (l\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier de la plaignante figurant dans le Registre des Indiens).\n[33] Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, nous examinerons chacun de ces pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[34] En 2008, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a form\u00e9 un Groupe de travail en Colombie\u2011Britannique avec des organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations en vue de mettre au point et d\u2019implanter pour la province une meilleure formule de financement des services de bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ce Groupe de travail \u00e9tait issu de la Partnership Table (la Table de partenariat), un groupe compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants d\u2019organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, de repr\u00e9sentants du minist\u00e8re des Enfants de la Colombie\u2011Britannique ainsi que de repr\u00e9sentants de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Brtitannique d\u2019AADNC, qui se r\u00e9unissaient environ quatre fois par ann\u00e9e.\n[35] \u00c0 l\u2019une des r\u00e9unions de la Table de partenariat, un haut fonctionnaire d\u2019AADNC, affect\u00e9 au Bureau des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de l\u2019Alberta, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le mod\u00e8le de financement albertain, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme une version am\u00e9lior\u00e9e de la Directive 20\u20111. \u00c0 la suite de ces discussions, le groupe a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser le mod\u00e8le de financement albertain comme base pour une formule [traduction] \u00ab faite en Colombie\u2011Britannique \u00bb, que l\u2019on adapterait en vue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la fois aux besoins des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et aux exigences de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale.\n[36] Cette initiative a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation du Groupe de travail, un processus tripartite qui \u00e9tait form\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants des organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, du gouvernement de la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique ainsi que de l\u2019Administration centrale d\u2019AADNC. En Colombie\u2011Britannique, le Bureau r\u00e9gional des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille d\u2019AADNC a accord\u00e9 des fonds en vue d\u2019embaucher un employ\u00e9 occasionnel qui g\u00e8rerait le processus et aiderait \u00e0 mettre au point le document que produirait le Groupe de travail. Cet employ\u00e9 devait assister aux r\u00e9unions, r\u00e9diger des \u00e9bauches, g\u00e9rer la contribution des membres du Groupe de travail, \u00e9crire des notes d\u2019information \u00e0 la haute direction d\u2019AADNC et mettre au point des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de communication \u00e0 l\u2019intention des organismes afin de permettre \u00e0 ceux-ci d\u2019expliquer le mod\u00e8le \u00e0 leurs divers chefs, conseils et collectivit\u00e9s.\n[37] Lors d\u2019une des r\u00e9unions pr\u00e9liminaires du Groupe de travail, Mary Teegee, des Carrier Sekani Family Services, \u00e0 Prince George (Colombie\u2011Britannique), a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au Groupe de travail de retenir pour ce poste les services de Mme Blackstock, compte tenu de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et de son expertise dans le domaine des services de bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en Colombie\u2011Britannique. Linda Stiller, qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, g\u00e9rait le programme des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille d\u2019AADNC dans la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e, cens\u00e9ment parce que Mme Blackstock avait critiqu\u00e9 vivement et ouvertement le nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement albertain que la Colombie\u2011Britannique pr\u00e9voyait adopter. Le Groupe de travail a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 plut\u00f4t d\u2019embaucher une personne du nom de Jeffrey Lyons, qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion du Manitoba d\u2019AADNC \u00e0 titre de travailleur social et qui, en tant que repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019Administration centrale d\u2019AADNC, avait pris part \u00e0 l\u2019examen national de la Directive 20\u20111.\n[38] Les membres du Groupe de travail ont continu\u00e9 de se r\u00e9unir pendant neuf \u00e0 douze mois en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir le mod\u00e8le de financement de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et ils ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Enhanced Prevention Services Model for B.C. Advisory and Steering Committee workshop \u00bb (Mod\u00e8le am\u00e9lior\u00e9 de services de pr\u00e9vention pour l\u2019atelier du Comit\u00e9 consultatif et de direction de la Colombie-Britannique). Selon Mme Stiller, le mod\u00e8le de financement de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a \u00e9t\u00e9 ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 par les membres de la Table de partenariat, ainsi que par le conseil d\u2019administration de tous les organismes de bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance de la province, mais le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne l\u2019a jamais adopt\u00e9.\nLe Groupe de travail de la Colombie-Britannique\n(i) Les positions des parties\n[39] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019opposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au fait que le Groupe de travail retienne les services de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 titre de consultante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Aux dires de Mme Blackstock, Mary Teegee l\u2019avait inform\u00e9e que, en plus de refuser de l\u2019embaucher comme consultante, les membres du Groupe de travail avaient exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de discussions si Mme Blackstock y participait.\n[40] De l\u2019avis de la plaignante, l\u2019explication qu\u2019a donn\u00e9e Linda Stiller, la t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, au sujet du refus d\u2019embaucher Mme Blackstock, \u00e0 savoir que celle-ci avait critiqu\u00e9 le nouveau mod\u00e8le de financement albertain, est un pr\u00e9texte. Mme Stiller a admis ne pas \u00eatre au courant des critiques pr\u00e9cises de Mme Blackstock et ne pas \u00eatre entr\u00e9e en contact avec elle pour discuter de son point de vue sur le mod\u00e8le de financement albertain; l\u2019avis de la plaignante est \u00e9galement \u00e9tay\u00e9 par le rapport de 2008 du v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Mme Stiller a aussi reconnu que, lors de ses r\u00e9unions avec des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019Administration centrale nationale d\u2019AADNC, ces derniers ont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement discut\u00e9 de la plainte. La plaignante soutient que si l\u2019on ajoute \u00e0 cela le fait que le consultant embauch\u00e9 par le groupe de travail venait de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la province et n\u2019avait ni les titres de comp\u00e9tence de Mme Blackstock ni une connaissance pr\u00e9cise de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher Mme Blackstock, dont l\u2019expertise dans le domaine des services de bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en Colombie\u2011Britannique est bien connue et respect\u00e9e, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que son t\u00e9moin, Mme Stiller, a clairement expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi Mme Blackstock n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un choix valable pour le poste d\u2019employ\u00e9 occasionnel au sein du Groupe de travail. L\u2019employ\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 devait [traduction] \u00ab tenir la plume \u00bb pour le Groupe de travail, s\u2019occuper de la r\u00e9daction du travail du groupe, assurer des services de soutien internes et r\u00e9diger des documents de communication expliquant le mod\u00e8le choisi aux chefs, aux conseils et aux collectivit\u00e9s. Le Groupe de travail de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait pr\u00e9vu de se servir du mod\u00e8le albertain comme base de son propre syst\u00e8me provincial et de l\u2019adapter en vue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la fois aux besoins des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et aux exigences de la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. Mme Stiller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison des critiques v\u00e9h\u00e9mentes et publiques de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du mod\u00e8le albertain et de son opinion selon laquelle la m\u00e9thode d\u00e9crite dans le rapport Wen:de aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, elle avait le sentiment que Mme Blackstock se serait trouv\u00e9e en situation de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, car celle-ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en faveur du mod\u00e8le qui allait constituer le fondement du syst\u00e8me du Groupe de travail. Mme Stiller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de Mme Blackstock, M. Lyons avait une connaissance pr\u00e9cise de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et il avait travaill\u00e9 dans le cadre de plusieurs contrats pour le minist\u00e8re provincial de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, ainsi que pour un certain nombre d\u2019organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations de la province.\n[42] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher M. Lyons plut\u00f4t que Mme Blackstock n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles et que la perception de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est d\u00e9raisonnable. Mme Stiller a reconnu qu\u2019elle connaissait Mme Blackstock et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne de la plaignante, mais elle a indiqu\u00e9 que cela n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur pertinent dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle avait prise.\n(ii) L\u2019analyse\n[43] Mme Blackstock a une expertise ind\u00e9niable dans le secteur d\u2019intervention du Groupe de travail. Si l\u2019on combine \u00e0 cela le fait que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont survenus peu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la plaignante a fourni suffisamment de preuves pour montrer que l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019embauche de Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. Cela \u00e9tant, la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e.\n[44] Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Son t\u00e9moin, Linda Stiller, a \u00e9t\u00e9 digne de foi et le tribunal souscrit \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle n\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 Mme Blackstock de participer de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux r\u00e9unions du Groupe de travail, mais s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e au fait de l\u2019embaucher pour aider \u00e0 mettre au point le document que le Groupe de travail allait produire.\n[45] Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette opposition, \u00e0 savoir que les opinions d\u00e9favorables que Mme Blackstock avait \u00e9mises publiquement au sujet du mod\u00e8le de financement des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance de l\u2019Alberta \u00e9taient en conflit direct avec l\u2019objectif que le Groupe de travail tentait d\u2019atteindre. Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait en faveur du rapport Wen:de, qui pr\u00e9conisait un investissement consid\u00e9rable de fonds dans tout le pays, tandis que, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Stiller, le mod\u00e8le albertain correspondait aux niveaux de d\u00e9penses des provinces \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 et visait \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la prestation des services des organismes pr\u00e9sents dans les r\u00e9serves \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelon de la province gr\u00e2ce aux fonds disponibles.\n[46] Dans une d\u00e9cision d\u2019embauche comme celle dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est raisonnable que l\u2019intim\u00e9 refuse d\u2019embaucher une personne qui a \u00e9mis plus t\u00f4t des opinions d\u00e9notant l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats avec le travail \u00e0 entreprendre. Nous n\u2019avons rien relev\u00e9 dans cette preuve qui indiquerait que l\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est un pr\u00e9texte. S\u2019il est vrai que Mme Stiller a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque elle \u00e9tait peut\u2011\u00eatre au courant de l\u2019existence de la plainte, elle a aussi fait remarquer que, \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire r\u00e9gionale, elle ne s\u2019occupait pas du tout de ce genre de question. Le Tribunal conclut que, vu la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable, le fait que Mme Stiller \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte ne suffit pas \u00e0 lui seul pour conclure qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un facteur dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[47] Pour ces raisons, le Tribunal conclut que cette s\u00e9rie particuli\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements ne montre pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a us\u00e9de repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante.\nB. La r\u00e9union des Chefs de l\u2019Ontario au cabinet du ministre\n[48] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario pour prendre part \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec David McArthur, un adjoint sp\u00e9cial de l\u2019honorable Chuck Strahl, ministre d\u2019AADNC (qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, portait le nom d\u2019AINC). La r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 bref avis, car un grand nombre des chefs \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 Ottawa pour assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec l\u2019APN. Le but de la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait de discuter de questions entourant la politique et le financement des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance en Ontario, et elle \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e avoir lieu dans les bureaux du ministre, \u00e0 Gatineau (Qu\u00e9bec). Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Grand Chef Randall Phillips, de l\u2019Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians, l\u2019avait invit\u00e9e, du fait de son expertise dans ce secteur. Elle faisait partie d\u2019un groupe de plusieurs personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es par les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union \u00e0 titre de conseillers techniques.\n[49] \u00c0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 se trouvait le cabinet du ministre, Mme Blackstock, en compagnie des 10 \u00e0 14 autres personnes accompagnant le Grand Chef Phillips, a franchi les contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et a pris l\u2019ascenseur menant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage o\u00f9 se trouvait le cabinet du ministre. L\u00e0, elle s\u2019est assise et a attendu dans la zone d\u2019accueil, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle de r\u00e9union. M. McArthur est arriv\u00e9 et, apr\u00e8s une br\u00e8ve discussion avec le Grand Chef Phillips au sujet du nombre des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, il a fait entrer ces derniers dans la salle de r\u00e9union un par un, accueillant chacun \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019il entrait.\n[50] Quand est venu le tour de Mme Blackstock d\u2019entrer dans la pi\u00e8ce, M. McArthur lui a demand\u00e9 de se nommer. Lorsqu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait, il a bloqu\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la salle, en disant : [traduction] \u00ab [e]h bien, nous vous verrons une autre fois, [\u2026] si j\u2019ai bien compris, vous avez un certain nombre de dol\u00e9ances, et nous vous verrons \u00e0 une autre occasion \u00bb, (voir la transcription de StenoTran Services Inc. du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2013, vol. 4, \u00e0 la p. 16, lignes 8 \u00e0 11). Mme Blackstock a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour discuter de la plainte et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0 \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re technique des chefs de l\u2019Ontario.\n[51] Le Grand Chef Phillips est intervenu en faveur de Mme Blackstock, et a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se trouvait l\u00e0 en tant que conseill\u00e8re technique. Apr\u00e8s quelques \u00e9changes entre les deux hommes, M. McArthur a dit au Grand Chef Phillips : [traduction] \u00ab Chef, si elle entre dans la pi\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y aura pas de r\u00e9union. C\u2019est aussi simple que cela \u00bb (voir la transcription de StenoTran Services Inc. du 15 juillet 2013, vol. 13, \u00e0 la p. 80, lignes 19 et 20). Le Grand Chef Phillips a donc acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de M. McArthur et il est entr\u00e9 dans la salle, laissant Mme Blackstock dans la zone d\u2019accueil. Une fois la r\u00e9union commenc\u00e9e, elle est rest\u00e9e l\u00e0 seule pendant 10 \u00e0 15 minutes, sous la surveillance d\u2019un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Mme Blackstock a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est partie avant la fin de la r\u00e9union. Le Grand Chef Phillips et M. McArthur ont tous deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, en bout de ligne, la r\u00e9union avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fructueuse pour les deux parties.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2009, Mme Blackstock a \u00e9crit au ministre Strahl pour lui demander une explication sur le fait d\u2019avoir exclue de la r\u00e9union. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab la seule explication raisonnable est que j\u2019ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre AINC \u00bb (voir la transcription de StenoTran Services Inc. du 17 juillet 2013, vol. 15, \u00e0 la p. 66, lignes 7 \u00e0 11). En r\u00e9ponse, elle a re\u00e7u une lettre le 29 janvier 2010, sign\u00e9e de la main de Laurie Throness, chef du cabinet du ministre Strahl. La lettre expliquait qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue de la r\u00e9union parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrite au d\u00e9part comme l\u2019un des participants et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019usage pour le cabinet du ministre d\u2019obtenir des informations sur les participants avant n\u2019importe quelle r\u00e9union, ce qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour elle. La lettre ajoutait que, de ce fait, M. McArthur avait jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appropri\u00e9 de la rencontrer \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. M. Throness a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Blackstock que M. McArthur avait dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait toutefois dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rencontrer \u00e0 une autre occasion, et il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 cette offre dans la lettre. Mme Blackstock ne s\u2019en est jamais pr\u00e9value.\n(i) Les positions des parties\n[53] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019exclusion de Mme Blackstock de la r\u00e9union \u00e9tait due au fait qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte et que cela constitue un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Grand Chef Phillips, Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re technique personnelle, en raison de ses connaissances sur les statistiques et les niveaux de financement, et que Mme Blackstock et lui avaient clairement fait savoir \u00e0 M. McArthur qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour parler de la plainte.\n[54] La plaignante rejette l\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de l\u2019exclusion de Mme Blackstock, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrite sur la liste des invit\u00e9s et que M. McArthur n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u d\u2019informations sur elle au pr\u00e9alable. Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule personne exclue de la r\u00e9union, m\u00eame si de nombreuses autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes ne figuraient pas sur la liste des invit\u00e9s. En fait, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019on attendait cinq personnes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, mais que c\u2019\u00e9tait un groupe de 10 \u00e0 14 personnes environ qui s\u2019y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. M. McArthur a \u00e9galement reconnu ne pas avoir re\u00e7u d\u2019informations sur les invit\u00e9s qui, savait-il, \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents. Le ton et l\u2019attitude inamicaux de M. McArthur, de m\u00eame que le fait d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de rester sur place et de surveiller Mme Blackstock pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait assise dans la salle d\u2019accueil, a aggrav\u00e9 les sentiments de honte et d\u2019humiliation de cette derni\u00e8re, des faits qui, selon la plaignante, constituaient tous un acte de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[55] L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il a expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable la d\u00e9cision d\u2019exclure Mme Blackstock de la r\u00e9union et que ce fait n\u2019\u00e9taye pas la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles. M. McArthur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les r\u00e9unions de ce genre \u00e9taient habituellement planifi\u00e9es longtemps \u00e0 l\u2019avance et s\u2019accompagnaient de trousses d\u2019information d\u00e9taill\u00e9es de la part d\u2019AADNC. Cette r\u00e9union-l\u00e0, organis\u00e9e la veille seulement, \u00e9tait une aberration \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et il n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu de la tenir que par mesure de courtoisie envers les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario, qui se trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 Ottawa, et par souci d\u2019affermir la relation entretenue avec l\u2019APN. M. McArthur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir appris que peu de temps avant la r\u00e9union qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que Mme Blackstock y assiste et que, tout en \u00e9tant au courant de la plainte, s\u2019il l\u2019avait exclue c\u2019\u00e9tait parce qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019\u00eatre convenablement renseign\u00e9, avant la r\u00e9union, sur une personne de l\u2019importance de Mme Blackstock. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait du fait que l\u2019on puisse soulever au cours de la r\u00e9union un large \u00e9ventail d\u2019autres questions, dont la plainte, et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019en discuter \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0.\n[56] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la preuve ne parvient pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Blackstock et que la perception de cette derni\u00e8re, au sujet des repr\u00e9sailles, est d\u00e9raisonnable. M. McArthur a agi de mani\u00e8re ferme envers Mme Blackstock, mais il s\u2019en est \u00e9galement excus\u00e9 et a offert de la rencontrer \u00e0 une autre occasion, une invitation \u00e0 laquelle Mme Blackstock n\u2019a jamais donn\u00e9 suite. Quant au gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 dans la salle d\u2019accueil en compagnie de Mme Blackstock pendant le d\u00e9roulement de la r\u00e9union, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cet homme se trouvait l\u00e0 parce qu\u2019il y avait eu un manquement \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 les chefs et les autres participants \u00e9taient entr\u00e9s dans l\u2019immeuble o\u00f9 se trouvait le cabinet du ministre. Le gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 se trouvait \u00e9galement l\u00e0 parce que les bureaux du sous\u2011ministre et du sous\u2011ministre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e9taient adjacents \u00e0 la zone d\u2019accueil o\u00f9 Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait assise.\n(ii) L\u2019analyse\n[57] Le Tribunal conclut que Mme Blackstock a \u00e9tabli par une preuve prima facie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue de la r\u00e9union avec les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario et M. McArthur. Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule des 10 \u00e0 14 personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 \u00eatre exclue de la r\u00e9union. De plus, les propos de M. McArthur selon lesquels il ne voulait pas la rencontrer parce qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab avait un certain nombre de dol\u00e9ances \u00bb dont il fallait discuter \u00e0 une autre occasion indiquent que la plainte \u00e9tait au moins un facteur qui constituait le motif de son exclusion. Si l\u2019on combine cela au fait qu\u2019un gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 semblait la surveiller pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait assise seule dans la salle d\u2019accueil et que la r\u00e9union se d\u00e9roulait, ce qui avait aggrav\u00e9 son sentiment de honte, la perception de Mme Blackstock selon laquelle ces agissements \u00e9taient des repr\u00e9sailles pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne est raisonnable.\n[58] L\u2019explication que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a donn\u00e9e pour l\u2019exclusion de Mme Blackstock repose sur le fait qu\u2019il a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour habitude d\u2019\u00e9tablir des trousses d\u2019information d\u00e9taill\u00e9es en pr\u00e9vision des r\u00e9unions tenues avec des groupes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, surtout lorsqu\u2019il est question de rencontrer une personne importante telle que Mme Blackstock. Ceci \u00e9tant dit avec \u00e9gards, le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une explication plausible. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a peut-\u00eatre bien pour habitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019obtenir des informations sur les participants au moment d\u2019organiser des r\u00e9unions de cette nature, mais cette pratique n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e aux autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes. La liste des personnes pr\u00e9sentes se composait au d\u00e9part de cinq invit\u00e9s et, pourtant, de 10 \u00e0 14 personnes ont pu entrer dans la salle de r\u00e9union. La plupart de ces derni\u00e8res n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avance. M. McArthur a \u00e9galement reconnu qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas personnellement les chefs ou les autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union et, en d\u00e9pit de cela, tous, sauf Mme Blackstock, ont pu y participer.\n[59] L\u2019expertise de Mme Blackstock dans le domaine des services de bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance est bien \u00e9tablie et le Tribunal accepte l\u2019explication selon laquelle sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 la r\u00e9union avait pour but de fournir des conseils techniques aux chefs. Tant Mme Blackstock que le Grand Chef Phillips ont fait clairement part de ce motif \u00e0 M. McArthur, mais sans succ\u00e8s. M. McArthur a aussi reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte et il n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 que s\u2019il avait exclu Mme Blackstock c\u2019\u00e9tait parce qu\u2019il craignait qu\u2019ils finissent par discuter de la plainte (voir la transcription de StenoTran Services Inc. du 17 juillet 3013, vol. 15, \u00e0 la p. 78, lignes 9 \u00e0 13). Cet aveu \u00e9taye la conclusion selon laquelle la plainte constituait le fondement de son exclusion et, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. De plus, l\u2019offre de M. McArthur de rencontrer Mme Blackstock \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 et le fait que les parties pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la r\u00e9union ont \u00e9t\u00e9 capables de r\u00e9gler les questions en litige l\u2019ont rendue superflue. Comme Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la r\u00e9union pour aider les chefs, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elle demande une r\u00e9union ult\u00e9rieure avec M. McArthur.\n[60] Pour ce qui est de la pr\u00e9sence du gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, qui montait la garde pendant que Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait assise dans la salle d\u2019attente, le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a bel et bien expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable cet aspect des incidents survenus ce jour\u2011l\u00e0. Le Tribunal a entendu une preuve convaincante sur l\u2019origine de l\u2019incident de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence du gardien. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable dans ces circonstances que Mme Blackstock se sente intimid\u00e9e et honteuse, mais il semble que cet aspect particulier de l\u2019incident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 une m\u00e9prise. Cependant, comme le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable le fait d\u2019avoir exclu Mme Blackstock de la r\u00e9union, cette constatation n\u2019a aucune incidence sur la conclusion du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante.\nC. La surveillance des interventions publiques de Mme Blackstock\n[61] \u00c0 la suite de demandes qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels Mme Blackstock a mis la main sur un certain nombre de documents qui indiquent qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte l\u2019intim\u00e9 a surveill\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s professionnelles. Selon la preuve, des fonctionnaires ont rendu compte des expos\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019un colloque sur les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille au Nouveau\u2011Brunswick \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2009, ainsi que dans le cadre d\u2019un groupe de travail international r\u00e9uni en mars 2010 \u00e0 Vancouver\u2011Nord en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir un rapport pour l\u2019Instance permanente sur les questions autochtones des Nations Unies (IPQANU), de m\u00eame que d\u2019un expos\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence nationale tenue \u00e0 Alice Springs (Australie) du 27 au 29 juillet 2010. L\u2019entrevue de Mme Blackstock avec le r\u00e9seau anglais de la SRC, le 23 novembre 2009, a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 transcrite et diffus\u00e9e au sein d\u2019AADNC. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que certains documents faisaient m\u00eame \u00e9tat de son absence \u00e0 une activit\u00e9. Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir trouv\u00e9 cette surveillance tr\u00e8s troublante.\n[62] Ces all\u00e9gations faisaient partie du fondement de la plainte que Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e le 6 mars 2012. Le Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e (CPVP) a fait enqu\u00eate sur ces faits et a publi\u00e9 ses conclusions le 28 mai 2013. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu dans ce document qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[63] La plaignante soutient que la surveillance \u00e9troite et proactive de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des pr\u00e9sences, des allocutions et des entrevues de Mme Blackstock constitue un acte de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 surtout qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La plaignante soutient que le seul t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, appel\u00e9 pour expliquer les nombreux comptes rendus de surveillance, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent qu\u2019\u00e0 une seule des activit\u00e9s en question et que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utile. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments expliquant le but de la surveillance, le Tribunal devrait tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable de cette attitude. La plaignante signale que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations et non de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 titre personnel. Compte tenu de ce fait, il est difficile de comprendre quelle est la pertinence des interventions publiques personnelles de Mme Blackstock pour le litige et, dans ce contexte, il \u00e9tait raisonnable que Mme Blackstock per\u00e7oive que cette surveillance \u00e9tait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte.\n[64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les comptes rendus des allocutions publiques de Mme Blackstock, surtout lorsque ces derni\u00e8res avaient trait \u00e0 des questions relatives au bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance, au travail men\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et \u00e0 la plainte, ne constituent pas un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. On s\u2019attendrait \u00e0 ce que ces activit\u00e9s de promotion publique int\u00e9ressent l\u2019intim\u00e9, compte tenu de ses activit\u00e9s et de ses programmes connexes, de m\u00eame que du litige en cours. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Blackstock et il est d\u2019avis que la perception de cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une surveillance importune, est d\u00e9raisonnable.\n(i) Les positions des parties\n(ii) L\u2019analyse\n[65] La plaignante soutient que Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re par l\u2019intim\u00e9 lors de ces activit\u00e9s de surveillance, mais un examen de la preuve d\u00e9note le contraire. Un grand nombre des documents produits en preuve consistent en des sommaires \u00e9tablis par des fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC qui avaient assist\u00e9 \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences o\u00f9 Mme Blackstock avait pris la parole. Ces sommaires portaient sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 de Mme Blackstock, mais aussi sur celui d\u2019autres pan\u00e9listes. Par exemple, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019un atelier sur le bien\u2011\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance tenu lors de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e sp\u00e9ciale des Chefs de l\u2019APN en 2011, un fonctionnaire d\u2019AADNC a produit un sommaire sur les personnes qui avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un expos\u00e9. Ce sommaire portait en d\u00e9tail sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 de Mme Blackstock, mais aussi sur celui de la professeure Vandna Sinha, de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 McGill, ainsi que sur celui de Jonathon Thompson, de l\u2019APN, lui aussi coplaignant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il ressort de la preuve que des employ\u00e9s d\u2019AADNC ont assist\u00e9 \u00e0 ces conf\u00e9rences et ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ces sommaires afin de pouvoir r\u00e9diger des infocapsules et des \u00ab questions et r\u00e9ponses \u00bb pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions de journalistes.\n[66] Mme Blackstock a reconnu qu\u2019avant de d\u00e9poser la plainte, elle entretenait une relation \u00e9troite avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. En plus de travailler ensemble \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des rapports Wen:de, Mme Blackstock et l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient particip\u00e9 ensemble \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences de cette nature. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal, il n\u2019est pas surprenant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait continu\u00e9 d\u2019assister \u00e0 ces conf\u00e9rences apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, et rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019il l\u2019ait fait dans le seul but de la surveiller en guise de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte.\n[67] Dans un grand nombre de ses interventions publiques lors de conf\u00e9rences, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la radio et \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, Mme Blackstock a parl\u00e9 de la plainte et de l\u2019instance du Tribunal, et a \u00e9galement fait part de son point de vue sur diverses questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des services destin\u00e9s aux Premi\u00e8res Nations ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019insuffisance de leur financement. La preuve confirme que cet aspect rev\u00eatait pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier. Par exemple, en diffusant \u00e0 l\u2019interne une transcription de l\u2019entrevue du 23 novembre 2009 de Mme Blackstock avec le r\u00e9seau anglais de la SRC, des fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC soulignent que le segment \u00ab radio \u00bb commence par une discussion portant sur le Tribunal ainsi que sur l\u2019ajournement r\u00e9cent de l\u2019audience (voir la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 14).\n[68] En mars 2010, Mme Blackstock a fait un expos\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un groupe de travail international qui devait \u00e9tablir un rapport \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019Instance permanente sur les questions autochtones des Nations-Unies. Un fonctionnaire d\u2019AADNC assistait aux conf\u00e9rences et il a transmis un sommaire de l\u2019expos\u00e9 et du m\u00e9moire de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 d\u2019autres fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC. Ce sommaire met en lumi\u00e8re les d\u00e9clarations que Mme Blackstock a faites au sujet de la plainte, ainsi que son appel aux Nations Unies afin que l\u2019on d\u00e9signe un observateur sp\u00e9cial pour suivre l\u2019instance du Tribunal. Dans la chaine de courriels relative \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 de Mme Blackstock, un fonctionnaire d\u2019AADNC demande : [traduction] \u00ab [i]nd\u00e9pendamment de ce que nous pourrions dire plus tard \u00e0 l\u2019Instance des NU, avons-nous des messages portant sur son expos\u00e9 si celui-ci obtient une certaine couverture? \u00bb (voir la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 14, chaine de courriels intitul\u00e9e [traduction]\u00ab (11\/4\/2010) Keith Smith-Rep. : Re : objet : expos\u00e9 de Cindy Blackstock \u00bb, \u00e0 la p. 1).\n[69] En exer\u00e7ant son droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression, Mme Blackstock a suscit\u00e9 une vive attention au sein des m\u00e9dias et du public. La campagne \u00ab Je suis un t\u00e9moin \u00bb, par exemple, compte des milliers d\u2019abonn\u00e9s. Pendant toutes ces fr\u00e9quentes interventions et d\u00e9clarations, Mme Blackstock a ouvertement critiqu\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour ses agissements et sa position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte, le mettant dans une situation o\u00f9 on lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer et de d\u00e9fendre certaines de ses mesures et de ses d\u00e9cisions. \u00c0 une occasion, par exemple, une station de radio a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019une entrevue avec Mme Blackstock, pr\u00e9vue pour le lendemain, afin d\u2019obtenir des commentaires du ministre sur la plainte. Il ressort de la preuve que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis des interventions publiques de Mme Blackstock est souvent li\u00e9 \u00e0 son d\u00e9sir d\u2019\u00eatre au courant de ces d\u00e9clarations et de ces all\u00e9gations afin d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure d\u2019y r\u00e9pliquer, au besoin.\n[70] Le Tribunal signale que certains des courriels que se sont \u00e9chang\u00e9s des fonctionnaires ont bel et bien fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Mme Blackstock d\u2019une mani\u00e8re peu professionnelle. Toutefois, rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019en faisant en sorte que ses repr\u00e9sentants assistent \u00e0 ces activit\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 essayait d\u2019intimider la plaignante. Toutes les activit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9es \u00e9taient des interventions publiques. M\u00eame si Mme Blackstock dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9e par la surveillance, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019en a eu connaissance qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses demandes en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Ce contexte factuel est diff\u00e9rent de celui dont il \u00e9tait question dans l\u2019affaire Cassidy, par exemple, o\u00f9 Mme Cassidy avait vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019observait et avait per\u00e7u que ce comportement \u00e9tait de l\u2019intimidation, en repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre elle (voir Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Raj Thambirajah, 2012 TCDP 29).\n[71] Cela dit, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur qui sous\u2011tend les agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En fait, ce dernier ne conteste pas que la plainte est l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles les interventions publiques de Mme Blackstock ont \u00e9t\u00e9 surveill\u00e9es. Il a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir agi de la sorte en pr\u00e9vision du pr\u00e9sent litige. En parlant publiquement de la plainte et de la pr\u00e9sente instance, Mme Blackstock a ouvert la porte \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fasse le suivi de ses all\u00e9gations de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir se d\u00e9fendre devant le Tribunal. Le droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9fense est un principe de common law fondamental, en vertu duquel une partie peut recueillir des informations susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre utiles \u00e0 sa cause. Bien que ce droit soit restreint par l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ainsi que par le droit oppos\u00e9 des autres parties \u00e0 la protection de leur vie priv\u00e9e, il n\u2019y a eu, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucune atteinte \u00e0 ces deux droits. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019en prenant ces mesures l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas de repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Blackstock ou la plaignante.\nD. La surveillance des pages Facebook\n[72] Les demandes que Mme Blackstock a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ont \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait surveill\u00e9 trois pages Facebook : la page Facebook personnelle de Mme Blackstock, la page Facebook de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et la page Facebook de la campagne \u00ab Je suis un t\u00e9moin \u00bb, toutes administr\u00e9es par Mme Blackstock. La surveillance a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par Mme Natalia Strelkova, technicienne juridique au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe du contentieux du minist\u00e8re de la Justice affect\u00e9e \u00e0 ce dossier, et ce, \u00e0 l\u2019instigation de l\u2019avocat principal. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Strelkova avait eu pour instruction de surveiller les pages en question et de signaler si Mme Blackstock mettait en ligne quoi que ce soit qui avait trait au litige en cours. Comme l\u2019acc\u00e8s au site Web de Facebook \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 par le syst\u00e8me de filtrage Internet du gouvernement, Mme Strelkova, avec l\u2019accord de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au service de TI une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au site Web en question. Elle a obtenu l\u2019autorisation n\u00e9cessaire aux environs du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2010 pour le reste de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile, qui prenait fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2010. Elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on prolonge ce d\u00e9lai.\n[73] Tant la page Facebook de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien que celle de la campagne \u00ab Je suis un t\u00e9moin \u00bb sont de nature publique et Mme Strelkova y a eu facilement acc\u00e8s durant cette p\u00e9riode. Selon la preuve, entre mai 2010 et juillet 2011, la page Facebook personnelle de Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement accessible au public parce que Facebook avait r\u00e9initialis\u00e9 ses param\u00e8tres relatifs \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. Mme Strelkova a surveill\u00e9 les trois sites, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son propre compte Facebook, les consultant quelques fois par semaine pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de nouveaux messages. Elle a rendu compte de ses constatations en transmettant \u00e0 intervalles p\u00e9riodiques des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran des pages en question \u00e0 son client, AADNC, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe juridique de ce dernier. Elle n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u de commentaires sur ces comptes rendus. En consultant ces pages Facebook, Mme Strelkova ne s\u2019int\u00e9ressait qu\u2019aux messages relatifs au litige, et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait tent\u00e9 de faire abstraction des renseignements de nature personnelle. Cependant, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, quelques-unes des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran qu\u2019elle avait copi\u00e9es contenaient bel et bien des renseignements de nature personnelle. Elle a surveill\u00e9 les sites Web jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle quitte ses fonctions en ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[74] Ces all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de la plainte que Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 6 mars 2012 aupr\u00e8s du commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, lequel a conclu que les all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s - AADNC et le minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada - avaient bel et bien [traduction] \u00ab recueilli des s\u00e9ries particuli\u00e8res d\u2019informations personnelles, non li\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles ordinaires, dans le cadre de la surveillance de m\u00e9dias sociaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante \u00bb. Le rapport signale \u00e9galement que le Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a toutefois pas trouv\u00e9 assez de preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9s \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle \u00e0 de nombreux employ\u00e9s des deux minist\u00e8res \u00bb (voir le compte rendu des constatations du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, document dat\u00e9 du 28 mai 2013, au par. 82). Le rapport se termine par une s\u00e9rie de recommandations et indique que les intim\u00e9s les ont toutes accept\u00e9es.\n[75] La plaignante soutient que, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la surveillance clandestine des interventions publiques de Mme Blackstock, l\u2019acc\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 sa page Facebook personnelle, acc\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience, n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec la plainte et constitue un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. Il ressort de la preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 consultait la page Facebook dans le but d\u2019essayer de trouver des renseignements personnels d\u00e9favorables sur Mme Blackstock en vue de la discr\u00e9diter, une d\u00e9marche que confirme davantage les questions profond\u00e9ment troublantes que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait pos\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Blackstock dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence, lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019avait interrog\u00e9e sur sa religion et lui avait demand\u00e9 si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en charge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait mineure. La plaignante soutient que l\u2019attitude et la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est un acte de repr\u00e9sailles et que Mme Blackstock a eu raison de se sentir cibl\u00e9e par ces mesures.\n[76] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu avoir surveill\u00e9 la page Facebook personnelle de Mme Blackstock au cours de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant de f\u00e9vrier 2010 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2011 environ, p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle cette page \u00e9tait accessible au public, de m\u00eame que les pages Facebook de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et de la campagne \u00ab Je suis un t\u00e9moin \u00bb. Il soutient que la surveillance n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite clandestinement et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e dans le cadre de sa pr\u00e9paration du litige qui allait \u00eatre entendu devant le Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019int\u00e9ressait qu\u2019aux renseignements concernant la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais il a recueilli en passant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information personnels. Dans son rapport, le Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e a signal\u00e9 ce fait, il a formul\u00e9 des recommandations \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et celui-ci y a souscrit. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9 que des parties engag\u00e9es dans un litige tentent de se renseigner l\u2019une sur l\u2019autre, et que cela inclut les raisons pour poursuivre le litige. Dans son rapport, le Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e (le rapport du CPVP) a reconnu ce fait et a signal\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab les tribunaux sont d\u2019avis qu\u2019une partie qui engage un litige consent implicitement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on fouille dans une certaine mesure dans ses affaires priv\u00e9es en vue de d\u00e9terminer comme il faut les questions en litige \u00bb (voir le compte rendu des conclusions du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, document dat\u00e9 du 28 mai 2013, au par. 76). L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la preuve ne fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune intention de sa part d\u2019user de repr\u00e9sailles et que, compte tenu des circonstances du litige, la perception de la plaignante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019est pas raisonnable.\n[77] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019affirmation de Mme Blackstock selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pos\u00e9 des questions [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s troublantes \u00bb lors d\u2019un contre\u2011interrogatoire portant sur une requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00eater serment pour son contre\u2011interrogatoire au sujet d\u2019un affidavit et que les questions pos\u00e9es visaient \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9solue \u00e0 dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il signale \u00e9galement que l\u2019avocat de la plaignante n\u2019avait soulev\u00e9 aucune objection \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[78] La Commission est d\u2019avis que ces all\u00e9gations soul\u00e8vent une question nouvelle, soit celle de savoir si la surveillance en ligne et syst\u00e9matique de la vie personnelle d\u2019un individu qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ou qui est la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e victime pour les besoins d\u2019un litige, peut constituer un acte de repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. Elle avait donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de limiter \u00e0 cette question ses arguments oraux et \u00e9crits d\u00e9finitifs et d\u2019examiner si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 ou justifi\u00e9 ses actes de mani\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[79] La Commission signale qu\u2019il ressortait de la preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 cherchait \u00e0 surveiller la page Facebook de Mme Blackstock pour des raisons directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte. Mme Strelkova a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son mandat consistait \u00e0 surveiller ce qui \u00e9tait communiqu\u00e9 sur la page Facebook afin d\u2019y relever des renseignements pouvant servir \u00e0 un contre\u2011interrogatoire. La preuve a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que certains des renseignements recueillis \u00e9taient des renseignements personnels accessoires, non li\u00e9s aux questions vis\u00e9es par l\u2019affaire et \u00e0 l\u2019objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la page en question.\n[80] La Commission soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun doute qu\u2019en surveillant la page Facebook personnelle de Mme Blackstock et en ne soumettant aucun autre t\u00e9moin ou plaignant \u00e0 une telle surveillance, l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a prise pour cible, du fait de son r\u00f4le actif dans la plainte. Cela dit, la surveillance a commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal et le d\u00e9but du litige. Ce litige, ainsi que le r\u00f4le de Mme Blackstock, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 hautement publicis\u00e9s et les renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient publiquement accessibles, en raison des param\u00e8tres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la page de Mme Blackstock. De l\u2019avis de la Commission, les justiciables doivent malheureusement faire souvent face \u00e0 une attente r\u00e9duite en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e dans le cas d\u2019un litige aussi public. La Commission soutient que m\u00eame si la collecte syst\u00e9matique de renseignements \u00e0 partir de la page Facebook de Mme Blackstock est probl\u00e9matique en raison des renseignements de nature personnelle qui ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis en passant, ce fait, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[81] Cependant, la Commission ajoute que m\u00eame si les agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne constituent peut\u2011\u00eatre pas un acte de repr\u00e9sailles ou de harc\u00e8lement, leur caract\u00e8re intrusif est inutile et peut raisonnablement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant un effet potentiellement n\u00e9gatif sur le pr\u00e9sent litige.\n(i) Les positions des parties\n(ii) L\u2019analyse\n[82] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Blackstock et son avocat ont attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur un certain nombre d\u2019exemples figurant dans la preuve documentaire o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait saisi des renseignements de nature personnelle sur la page Facebook de Mme Blackstock dans le cadre de ses captures d\u2019\u00e9cran. Parmi ces exemples figuraient les commentaires et les compliments d\u2019une enseignante, qui faisaient part \u00e0 Mme Blackstock de son int\u00e9r\u00eat et de son souhait de l\u2019appuyer dans ses initiatives. Ils comportaient \u00e9galement les propos d\u2019un enfant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 12 ans, qui lui faisait part de son soutien, ainsi que les commentaires d\u2019amis personnels qui la f\u00e9licitaient pour ses talents de cuisini\u00e8re, et ce, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un message dans lequel Mme Blackstock annon\u00e7ait qu\u2019elle distribuerait des biscuits \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[83] \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019on saisissait ces captures d\u2019\u00e9cran, les param\u00e8tres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la page Facebook de Mme Blackstock \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s \u00e0 un faible niveau, ce qui les rendait visibles au public. Elle a plus tard relev\u00e9 le niveau de ses param\u00e8tres afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que le public ait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 sa page Facebook personnelle. M\u00eame si, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la capture de ces commentaires personnels para\u00eet probl\u00e9matique, il ressort d\u2019un examen plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de cette preuve que dans les 44 captures d\u2019\u00e9cran tir\u00e9s de la page Facebook personnelle de Mme Blackstock, seul celui contenant les commentaires de l\u2019enseignante sur le travail de Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de tout autre message ou commentaire relatif \u00e0 la plainte soumise au Tribunal. Les 43 autres captures d\u2019\u00e9cran comportaient des messages qui traitent de l\u2019instance du Tribunal ou qui y font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[84] Le message relatif aux biscuits, par exemple, s\u2019inscrivait dans le cadre d\u2019une discussion plus vaste dans laquelle Mme Blackstock faisait l\u2019annonce de sa campagne \u00ab haveaheartcampaign \u00bb, qui co\u00efncidait avec la f\u00eate de la Saint\u2011Valentin, et de l\u2019audition, par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la plaignante au sujet de la d\u00e9cision prise par le Tribunal le 14 mars 2011 de rejeter la plainte. Dans ce message, Mme Blackstock incitait ses partisans \u00e0 envoyer des lettres de Saint\u2011Valentin \u00e0 leur d\u00e9put\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019au ministre. Le message se terminait par la mention, une fois de plus, des biscuits de la Saint\u2011Valentin.\n[85] Dans un autre message Facebook, Mme Blackstock a mis en ligne la transcription du contre\u2011interrogatoire d\u2019Odette Johnston, l\u2019une des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9, laquelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contre\u2011interrog\u00e9e sur son affidavit, qui appuyait la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue de faire rejeter la plainte. Les transcriptions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sous scell\u00e9, mais elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore accessibles au public. La d\u00e9cision de Mme Blackstock de les mettre en ligne a amen\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire au Tribunal pour attirer son attention sur ce fait. Le Tribunal a finalement envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de Mme Blackstock pour indiquer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait irr\u00e9gulier de mettre en ligne la transcription.\n[86] \u00c0 une occasion distincte, Mme Blackstock a \u00e9galement mis en ligne la transcription d\u2019une entrevue \u00e0 la radio du r\u00e9seau anglais de la SRC, dans laquelle elle parlait de la plainte, des mesures prises par le gouvernement \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes des anciens pr\u00e9sidents Sinclair et Chotalia du Tribunal dans cette affaire. Mme Blackstock a mentionn\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sident Sinclair avait annonc\u00e9 le d\u00e9but imminent de l\u2019audience, mais que la pr\u00e9sidente nouvellement nomm\u00e9e, Mme Chotalia, avait annul\u00e9 les dates d\u2019audition. Mme Blackstock s\u2019\u00e9tait dite pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par l\u2019annulation de ces dates. Une preuve additionnelle montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces d\u00e9clarations et de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019annuler les dates d\u2019audition.\n[87] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la preuve dans son ensemble montre que la grande majorit\u00e9 des pages Facebook que Mme Strelkova avait saisies contenaient des renseignements sur le Tribunal, l\u2019instance tenue devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou les all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte. Ces renseignements \u00e9taient publiquement disponibles dans des m\u00e9dias sociaux et, \u00e0 une occasion au moins, ils ont permis au public d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des informations qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore publiquement disponibles.\n[88] La preuve \u00e9taye la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des messages Facebook de Mme Blackstock est li\u00e9 \u00e0 ces commentaires en particulier. Comme dans le cas de la surveillance des interventions publiques de Mme Blackstock, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait le droit, en pr\u00e9vision du litige, d\u2019\u00eatre au courant des d\u00e9clarations publiques de la plaignante de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense.\n[89] Mme Strelkova a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas avocate et qu\u2019elle avait saisi des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran contenant des renseignements qui, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e9taient pertinents. Il ne fait aucun doute que la saisie de renseignements personnels de Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait un acte inopportun. Le commissaire \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e en a conclu autant, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis sa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant, le Tribunal n\u2019examine pas ces all\u00e9gations dans le contexte de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, mais plut\u00f4t dans celui de la LCDP. La question qui nous est soumise consiste \u00e0 savoir si les agissements de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont assimilables \u00e0 des actes de repr\u00e9sailles, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Compte tenu du contexte dans lequel s\u2019inscrivait la surveillance des pages Facebook dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus t\u00f4t, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que ce n\u2019est pas le cas.\nE. L\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier de Mme Blackstock figurant dans le Registre des Indiens\n[90] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2010 \u00e0 2011, Mme Blackstock a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 trois demandes distinctes en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la protection des renseignements personnels (AIPRP). La premi\u00e8re, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 19 octobre 2010, visait \u00e0 obtenir [traduction] \u00ab [t]out document ou toute communication contenant des renseignements personnels sur Cindy Blackstock, aussi appel\u00e9e Cynthia Blackstock) [\u2026] et produits depuis 2005 \u00bb (la premi\u00e8re demande). La deuxi\u00e8me, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 22 juin 2011, visait \u00e0 obtenir [traduction] \u00ab [t]out renseignement sur Cindy Blackstock, aussi appel\u00e9e Cynthia Blackstock ou Mme Blackstock, dat\u00e9, ou vraisemblablement dat\u00e9, du 9 juin 2010 au 22 juin 2011 \u00bb (la deuxi\u00e8me demande). La troisi\u00e8me demande, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2011, visait \u00e0 obtenir [traduction] \u00ab [t]out renseignement sur {Cindy Blackstock}, \u00e9galement appel\u00e9e {Cynthia Blackstock} ou {Mme Blackstock} dat\u00e9, ou vraisemblablement dat\u00e9, du 9 juillet 2011 au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2011 \u00bb (la troisi\u00e8me demande).\n[91] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de ces demandes, la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP d\u2019AADNC avait, aux termes de la loi, un d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pour les traiter. \u00c0 l\u2019exception de la premi\u00e8re demande, pour laquelle le Minist\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9valu de la prorogation de d\u00e9lai autoris\u00e9e par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15a) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, il semble que Mme Blackstock ait re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses demandes, assortie de pi\u00e8ces jointes, dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu de 30 jours.\n[92] Dans le cadre de la s\u00e9rie de documents contenus dans ces pi\u00e8ces jointes, Mme Blackstock a re\u00e7u deux copies de son dossier d\u2019Indienne inscrite (le dossier), extrait du Syst\u00e8me d\u2019inscription des Indiens (SII). Le SII est le syst\u00e8me officiel dans lequel sont consign\u00e9es les donn\u00e9es d\u2019identification de tous les Indiens inscrits au Canada. Le dossier du SII contenait des renseignements personnels sur Mme Blackstock, ainsi que des renseignements personnels sur certains membres de sa famille. Les copies indiquaient que l\u2019on avait consult\u00e9 le dossier du SII le 4 novembre 2010, ainsi que le 17 novembre 2011.\n[93] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas fait de demandes de renseignements personnels sur son statut d\u2019Indienne ou son dossier du SII depuis 2008, Mme Blackstock ne comprenait pas pourquoi - ou par qui - le dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 \u00e0 ces deux dates. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune demande en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels n\u2019\u00e9tait active \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 son dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 extrait du SII le 17 novembre 2011. Elle a \u00e9galement conclu que, m\u00eame si elle avait fait un certain nombre d\u2019autres demandes en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, le fait que le dossier n\u2019apparaissait pas dans chaque demande \u00e9tait inusit\u00e9.\n[94] Lors d\u2019une entrevue dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9mission \u00ab The Current \u00bb au r\u00e9seau anglais de la SRC, dans la matin\u00e9e du 17 novembre 2011, Mme Blackstock a fait publiquement part de son inqui\u00e9tude au sujet de ce qui lui semblait \u00eatre un acc\u00e8s irr\u00e9gulier aux renseignements concernant son statut d\u2019Indienne :\n[traduction] L\u2019un des points qui me pr\u00e9occupaient \u00e9tait les documents qu\u2019ils avaient extraits sur ma demande de statut. Et vous qui m\u2019\u00e9coutez, vous ignorez peut\u2011\u00eatre que sur cette demande figurent non seulement votre nom et votre date de naissance, mais aussi celles de vos parents et de vos s\u0153urs et de vos fr\u00e8res. Et ils ont extrait ces renseignements \u00e0 deux reprises et je n\u2019ai absolument aucune id\u00e9e de la raison pour laquelle cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Parce que je ne leur ai certainement pas demand\u00e9 de le faire, et jamais je n\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de renseignements sur mon statut au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[95] L\u2019entrevue de Mme Blackstock et les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle contient ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Mme Monica Fuijkschot, qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, \u00e9tait la directrice de la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP \u00e0 AADNC. Mme Fuijkschot a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 son avis, le message qui ressortait de ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9tait que Mme Blackstock mettait en doute le processus op\u00e9rationnel du Bureau du registraire des Indiens et les renseignements qu\u2019il fournissait en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Mme Fuijkschot a reconnu que Mme Blackstock n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte officielle sur cette affaire, m\u00eame si ce recours lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert dans les lettres envoy\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et auxquelles \u00e9taient jointes une copie de son dossier. N\u00e9anmoins, Mme Fuijkschot a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui incombait de veiller \u00e0 ce que les renseignements personnels qui \u00e9taient recueillis et plac\u00e9s sous le contr\u00f4le de la Direction en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00e9taient convenablement prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019institution. Vu la gravit\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations, Mme Fuijkschot a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen interne de l\u2019affaire afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu une divulgation irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et, dans l\u2019affirmative, de mettre en place une strat\u00e9gie d\u2019att\u00e9nuation afin de garantir que cela ne se reproduirait plus.\n[96] Le 17 novembre 2011, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019entrevue de la SRC, Mme Fuijkschot a eu acc\u00e8s au dossier de Mme Blackstock dans le cadre de cette enqu\u00eate. Il \u00e9tait impossible pour elle de savoir qui avait consult\u00e9 le dossier dans le syst\u00e8me, mais il est ressorti de l\u2019enqu\u00eate que l\u2019on avait consult\u00e9 son dossier en vue de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, demande qui avait pour but d\u2019obtenir [traduction] \u00ab [t]out document ou toute communication contenant des renseignements personnels sur Cindy Blackstock, aussi appel\u00e9e Cynthia Blackstock) [\u2026] produit depuis 2005 \u00bb. Mme Fuijkschot a conclu, de ce fait, qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu atteinte \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Mme Fuijkschot a conserv\u00e9 dans son bureau le dossier contenant les r\u00e9sultats de son examen interne.\n[97] Le 22 novembre 2011, l\u2019honorable John Duncan, c.p., d\u00e9put\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la situation par le sous\u2011ministre d\u2019AADNC, a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au commissaire \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada, pour porter \u00e0 son attention le fait que Mme Blackstock avait publiquement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019on avait consult\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 deux reprises, son dossier d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens. La lettre indiquait qu\u2019AADNC ne croyait pas qu\u2019il y avait eu d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019il souhaitait n\u00e9anmoins porter l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019attention du commissaire, l\u2019invitant \u00e0 mener sa propre enqu\u00eate. \u00c0 la lettre \u00e9tait jointe une s\u00e9rie de documents concernant les informations communiqu\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, de m\u00eame que de r\u00e9cents reportages dans les m\u00e9dias.\n[98] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011, le commissaire adjoint \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada a renvoy\u00e9 la s\u00e9rie de documents, disant que son bureau ne pouvait pas les recevoir sans le consentement de la personne concern\u00e9e. La lettre soulignait que le commissaire \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e \u00e9tait en mesure de d\u00e9poser une plainte s\u2019il concluait qu\u2019il y avait des motifs raisonnables d\u2019examiner si une institution gouvernementale avait contrevenu \u00e0 une disposition de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, et elle ajoutait qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab [\u00e9]tait en voie d\u2019\u00e9tudier la possibilit\u00e9 de lancer une enqu\u00eate sur la foi de renseignements publiquement disponibles et conform\u00e9ment aux proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies ainsi qu\u2019aux pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la Loi.\n[99] Mme Blackstock a port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e le 6 mars 2012. En plus d\u2019all\u00e9guer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait contrevenu aux articles 7 et 8 de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels en surveillant ses invitations \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences, ainsi qu\u2019en consultant et en surveillant ses messages socio\u2011m\u00e9diatiques, en particulier sa page Facebook personnelle, Mme Blackstock a soutenu que [traduction] \u00ab [d]es fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC ont consult\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises [mes] dossiers concernant [mon] statut d\u2019Indienne qui figurent dans la base de donn\u00e9es d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens du gouvernement du Canada, qui contenait non seulement [mes] renseignements personnels, mais aussi ceux d\u2019un certain nombre de membres de [ma] famille, alors que [mon] statut d\u2019Indienne ne pr\u00e9sentait aucun probl\u00e8me \u00bb (voir le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte dans le rapport du CPVP qui figure \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce R\u201112, onglet 48, par. 85).\n[100] Le Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e a fait enqu\u00eate sur ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements et, dans son rapport, il a conclu que les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s inopportun au dossier d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens de Mme Blackstock \u00e9taient sans fondement (voir le rapport du CPVP, au par.106).\n[101] La plaignante admet qu\u2019en d\u00e9finitive il n\u2019y avait pas assez de preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa crainte que l\u2019on avait consult\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens de Mme Blackstock en vue d\u2019essayer de se renseigner sur sa vie personnelle et de trouver des renseignements \u00e0 utiliser contre elle. Cependant, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Fuijkschot montre qu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 Mme Blackstock de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente parce que celle\u2011ci avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Mme Fuijkschot a omis de documenter son examen, n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Blackstock et, spontan\u00e9ment, a envoy\u00e9 les renseignements personnels de Mme Blackstock au commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e sans avoir obtenu l\u2019autorisation ou le consentement l\u00e9gitime de Mme Blackstock. La plaignante reconna\u00eet que bien que cette all\u00e9gation ne r\u00e9ponde pas au crit\u00e8re relatif aux mesures de repr\u00e9sailles qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans Virk, elle r\u00e9pond toutefois au crit\u00e8re correspondant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans Wong et Bressette.\n[102] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la preuve n\u2019\u00e9taye pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Blackstock selon laquelle des fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC ont consult\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inopportune son dossier. Comme l\u2019illustre la preuve, les protocoles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9gissent l\u2019acc\u00e8s au SII sont nombreux et stricts. Le dossier de Mme Blackstock lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis \u00e0 deux reprises, \u00e0 la suite de ses propres demandes en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Il n\u2019existe aucune preuve qui puisse \u00e9tayer l\u2019argument selon lequel des fonctionnaires d\u2019AADNC ont par ailleurs consult\u00e9 le dossier du SII pour un autre motif. L\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019a men\u00e9e Mme Fuijkschot \u00e0 la suite des all\u00e9gations publiques d\u2019inconduite de Mme Blackstock \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9e et valide et elle a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019acc\u00e8s inopportun au dossier de Mme Blackstock. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que rien ne d\u00e9note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante et que la preuve dans son ensemble, si on l\u2019examine objectivement, n\u2019\u00e9taye pas une conclusion de repr\u00e9sailles.\n(i) Les positions des parties\n(ii) L\u2019analyse\n[103] Le processus administratif qui suit le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une demande en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ou de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information est un travail technique et m\u00e9thodique. Cependant, pour mieux comprendre ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des demandes de Mme Blackstock, il est important de l\u2019examiner. M. Kent\u2011Daniel Glowinski, l\u2019actuel directeur de la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP \u00e0 AADNC, a pass\u00e9 ce processus en revue lors de son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal.\n[104] Selon ce t\u00e9moignage, une fois que le minist\u00e8re re\u00e7oit une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ou de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, les \u00e9tapes que franchit cette demande sont les suivantes :\n[traduction]\na) la demande est re\u00e7ue par le Groupe de l\u2019admission et du triage, le volet administratif de l\u2019unit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle de la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP, qui est charg\u00e9 de la r\u00e9ception des documents. \u00c0 cet endroit, on estampille la date sur la demande, ce qui marque le d\u00e9but du d\u00e9lai de 30 jours que prescrit la loi pour que le minist\u00e8re y r\u00e9ponde;\nb) l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019admission d\u00e9pose par-dessus la demande ce que l\u2019on appelle une feuille d\u2019assignation des t\u00e2ches. Cette feuille \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre d\u2019acronymes, qui d\u00e9signent divers bureaux de premi\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9 (BPR). Un BPR est un secteur du minist\u00e8re qui a le plus de chances de d\u00e9tenir les documents vis\u00e9s par la demande;\nc) \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le public utilise parfois le formulaire \u00e0 mauvais escient, toutes les demandes sont envoy\u00e9es au directeur pour examen, afin qu\u2019il puisse d\u00e9terminer si elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien cat\u00e9goris\u00e9es comme des demandes de communication de renseignements personnels ou des demandes d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information. Dans le cadre de cet examen, et en se fondant sur le texte de la demande, le directeur d\u00e9termine \u00e0 quel BPR ou, s\u2019il y en a plusieurs, auxquels BPR la demande doit \u00eatre confi\u00e9e en vue d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre;\nd) une fois que le directeur a pris cette d\u00e9cision, l\u2019\u00e9quipe de triage envoie la demande, ainsi que la feuille d\u2019assignation d\u00fbment remplie, aux repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019AIPRP qui sont situ\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rents BPR. Ces repr\u00e9sentants consultent ensuite les secteurs de programme particuliers qui rel\u00e8vent de ces BPR en vue d\u2019obtenir les documents demand\u00e9s. Il incombe aux secteurs de programme eux\u2011m\u00eames de faire preuve de la diligence voulue pour trouver les documents;\ne) il arrive parfois qu\u2019une demande soit renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP en vue d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9claircissements. Dans un tel cas, il est parfois possible que la demande soit renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 son auteur en vue d\u2019obtenir une fourchette de dates pr\u00e9cise ou de pr\u00e9ciser les recherches;\nf) une fois que le secteur de programme a obtenu les documents n\u00e9cessaires et les a envoy\u00e9s au BPR, celui-ci \u00e9value la teneur des documents et d\u00e9termine s\u2019ils contiennent, par exemple, des renseignements de tiers ou des informations qui peuvent \u00eatre soumis au privil\u00e8ge avocat\u2011client ou au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Le BPR \u00e9tablit ensuite un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 d\u2019impact, contenant ses recommandations au sujet des documents et des renseignements qu\u2019ils contiennent, et il renvoie le tout \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP;\ng) tous les documents trouv\u00e9s sont envoy\u00e9s par les diff\u00e9rents secteurs de programme et BPR \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP, o\u00f9 ils sont num\u00e9ris\u00e9s au moyen d\u2019un logiciel d\u2019AIPRP appel\u00e9 \u00ab Redaction \u00bb. Ce logiciel regroupe les diff\u00e9rents dossiers en un bloc coh\u00e9sif de documents et le soumet \u00e0 une convention d\u2019appellation. Les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels commencent par la lettre \u00ab P \u00bb, tandis que celles qui rel\u00e8vent de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information commencent par la lettre \u00ab A \u00bb. Cette lettre est suivie de l\u2019ann\u00e9e ainsi que d\u2019un num\u00e9ro constitutif, ce qui peut ressembler \u00e0 ceci : \u00ab A\u20112013\u20110001 \u00bb;\nh) une fois que les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits dans le logiciel, l\u2019analyste de l\u2019AIPRP qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande passe en revue les documents et d\u00e9termine s\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de consulter des tiers. S\u2019il juge que oui, la Direction demande une prorogation de d\u00e9lai. Si non, l\u2019analyste passe en revue le dossier afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il comporte des dispenses ou des exclusions applicables;\ni) une fois que ce processus est termin\u00e9, les documents sont r\u00e9unis et transmis \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de la demande.\n[105] M. Glowinski a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019un des principaux secteurs op\u00e9rationnels du Minist\u00e8re a pour t\u00e2che de s\u2019occuper de l\u2019enregistrement et des dossiers d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens (les dossiers), quand une personne pr\u00e9sente une demande en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP d\u2019AADNC en vue d\u2019obtenir des renseignements \u00e0 son sujet, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas pour les demandes de Mme Blackstock, l\u2019un des BPR logiques est le Secteur de la r\u00e9solution et des affaires individuelles (SRAI). C\u2019est ce secteur qui, sous l\u2019\u00e9gide du Bureau du registraire des Indiens, tient le SII et les dossiers. Selon M. Glowinski, c\u2019est \u00e0 cet endroit que la premi\u00e8re demande de Mme Blackstock aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise.\n[106] Mme McLenachan, agente des contestations, des appels et des litiges au Bureau du registraire des Indiens, a fourni un t\u00e9moignage qui a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 clarifier la mani\u00e8re dont on consulte le SII et les dossiers. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, seuls ont acc\u00e8s au SII les agents d\u2019AADNC, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ceux qui travaillent au Bureau du registraire des Indiens, les membres du personnel r\u00e9gional d\u2019AADNC qui travaillent dans les secteurs charg\u00e9s du Registre d\u2019inscription et des listes des bandes, les administrateurs du Registre des Indiens (ARI), qui sont des employ\u00e9s des conseils tribaux et de bande, de m\u00eame que les employ\u00e9s de certains minist\u00e8res avec lesquels AADNC a conclu un protocole d\u2019entente.\n[107] Pour avoir acc\u00e8s au SII, une personne doit remplir un formulaire d\u2019acc\u00e8s au Syst\u00e8me du Registre des Indiens et \u00e0 ses informations. En remplissant ce formulaire, la personne reconna\u00eet qu\u2019elle ne peut utiliser les informations qu\u2019aux fins pour lesquelles elle en a besoin et que ces informations sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Le sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat de la personne signe ensuite le formulaire, ce qui confirme la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\n[108] Dans le cas des ARI, le formulaire d\u2019acc\u00e8s est envoy\u00e9 au personnel du bureau r\u00e9gional d\u2019AADNC, qui veille \u00e0 ce que le bureau de la bande dispose de mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 appropri\u00e9es avant de transmettre la demande au sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019information \u00e0 l\u2019Administration centrale d\u2019AADNC qui a le pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, pour le compte du registraire des Indiens, d\u2019autoriser l\u2019acc\u00e8s.\n[109] Dans tous les cas, le niveau d\u2019acc\u00e8s assur\u00e9 d\u00e9pend du r\u00f4le qu\u2019occupe la personne. Il existe 40 niveaux d\u2019acc\u00e8s, allant du simple acc\u00e8s papier \u00e0 divers niveaux d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la version \u00e9lectronique du SII. Certains niveaux n\u2019offrent qu\u2019une capacit\u00e9 de lecture, tandis que d\u2019autres offrent une capacit\u00e9 de lecture et d\u2019\u00e9criture partielle, ce qui permet d\u2019ajouter des changements, ou une capacit\u00e9 de lecture et d\u2019\u00e9criture compl\u00e8te. Dans le cas de certains dossiers, il est \u00e9galement possible de restreindre l\u2019acc\u00e8s. L\u2019ARI d\u2019un conseil tribal, par exemple, n\u2019a acc\u00e8s qu\u2019aux dossiers du SII qui se rapportent aux bandes qu\u2019il administre.\n[110] Mme McLenachan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019environ 600 personnes ont pr\u00e9sentement acc\u00e8s au SII.\n[111] Mme McLenachan a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit la mani\u00e8re d\u2019acc\u00e9der au SII en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande que pr\u00e9sente un particulier en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ce qui est le cas des demandes que Mme Blackstock a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Une fois qu\u2019une demande est transmise au Bureau du registraire des Indiens par la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP, elle est affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un agent d\u00e9tenant le niveau et le type d\u2019acc\u00e8s appropri\u00e9s, qui effectue une recherche en vue de situer les documents qui correspondent \u00e0 la demande. Cet agent fait ensuite une copie des documents, et cela inclut, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, le dossier du SII de l\u2019auteur de la demande. Une analyse de risque des documents est faite et, si l\u2019agent juge qu\u2019il y a lieu de communiquer le dossier, celui\u2011ci est retransmis \u00e0 la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP ou \u00e0 la personne ou la partie qui en a fait la demande. Dans le cas d\u2019une demande \u00e9manant de la Direction de l\u2019AIPRP, c\u2019est son bureau qui d\u00e9termine en fin de compte ce qui doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 ou non \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de la demande.\n[112] Cette preuve, lorsqu\u2019on la combine au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Fuijkschot, aide \u00e0 clarifier le processus qu\u2019ont suivi les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Mme Blackstock en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Mme McLenachan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le SII ne tient pas de relev\u00e9 des personnes qui ont acc\u00e8s aux dossiers. Cette preuve concorde avec les conclusions que Mme Fuijkschot a tir\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de son examen interne. Malgr\u00e9 cela, selon les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019ont fournis ces t\u00e9moins, de m\u00eame que M. Glowinski, il y a eu acc\u00e8s au dossier de Mme Blackstock le 4 novembre 2010 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ainsi que le 17 novembre 2011, par Mme Fuijkschot, dans le cadre de son examen interne. Le dossier relatif \u00e0 cet examen interne, lequel contient le dossier d\u2019inscription au Registre des Indiens, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la suite de sa demande du 12 d\u00e9cembre 2011 en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Le Tribunal a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de ces trois personnes \u00e9tait digne de foi.\n[113] Mme Blackstock a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soup\u00e7onnait que l\u2019on avait eu acc\u00e8s de mani\u00e8re inopportune \u00e0 ses dossiers, laissant entendre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu tenter de la discr\u00e9diter de cette fa\u00e7on, mais aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taye cette pr\u00e9tention. L\u2019acc\u00e8s au SII est restreint et seules les personnes ayant le niveau d\u2019autorisation requis peuvent les consulter. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme McLenachan si la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la gestion et du r\u00e8glement des litiges d\u2019AADNC avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels en vue d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s aux renseignements du SII sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elle a r\u00e9pondu que non.\n[114] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement trait\u00e9 de la confusion de Mme Blackstock au sujet des copies de son dossier qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7ues en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 quelques\u2011unes de ses demandes, mais pas \u00e0 toutes, qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Mme Fuijkschot a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque le Registraire re\u00e7oit plus d\u2019une demande d\u2019une personne, au moment de traiter la seconde demande il examine les documents fournis dans le cadre de la premi\u00e8re et \u00e9vite de produire deux fois les m\u00eames.\n[115] La plaignante a fait valoir que l\u2019examen interne que Mme Fuijkschot a men\u00e9 ainsi que la d\u00e9cision que cette derni\u00e8re a prise de ne pas communiquer avec Mme Blackstock et de transmettre sans droit les renseignements personnels de Mme Blackstock au commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e montre qu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 Mme Blackstock de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente parce que celle\u2011ci avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[116] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 ces constatations directement \u00e0 Mme Blackstock, Mme Fuijkschot a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en s\u2019adressant directement aux m\u00e9dias sans faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 leur bureau au moyen du processus officiel d\u2019examen des plaintes, Mme Blackstock leur avait clairement signifi\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas travailler avec eux. De pair avec le litige actuellement soumis au Tribunal, Mme Fuijkschot a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison du litige dont le Tribunal \u00e9tait saisi, il lui fallait aborder l\u2019affaire avec prudence de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas causer ou provoquer une situation que l\u2019on pourrait mal interpr\u00e9ter. De plus, une fois que la question de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, l\u2019affaire n\u2019\u00e9tait plus de son ressort et l\u2019institution ne pouvait plus entrer en contact avec l\u2019auteur de la demande.\n[117] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal se prononce sur la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de cet examen interne ou sur celle de la d\u00e9cision de transmettre les renseignements obtenus par la suite au commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e. Le Tribunal doit simplement d\u00e9terminer si les gestes que Mme Fuijkschot a pos\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont assimilables ou non \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles. De l\u2019avis du Tribunal, le souhait de Mme Fuijkschot de d\u00e9terminer si son bureau \u00e9tait responsable ou non du pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acc\u00e8s inopportun au dossier de Mme Blackstock n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 dans la plainte, mais plut\u00f4t dans les all\u00e9gations publiques de Mme Blackstock. De plus, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019avis que ces gestes sont une forme de traitement d\u00e9favorable. L\u2019examen interne a \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9 et il a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu m\u00e9prise de la part de Mme Blackstock car aucune atteinte \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n\u2019avait eu lieu. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de la plaignante selon laquelle cela est assimilable \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles est, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal, non corrobor\u00e9e par la preuve.\n[118] En conclusion, compte tenu du processus op\u00e9rationnel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de la mani\u00e8re dont on a eu acc\u00e8s au dossier de Mme Blackstock, le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019explication que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a donn\u00e9e est raisonnable. Il conclut donc qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de repr\u00e9sailles en ce qui concerne l\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier de Mme Blackstock.\n[119] Le Tribunal signale qu\u2019il semble ressortir de la preuve que Mme Blackstock, le 17 novembre 2011, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019all\u00e9guer qu\u2019ils [traduction] \u00ab avaient extrait ces renseignements \u00e0 deux reprises \u00bb. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de son entrevue avec le r\u00e9seau anglais de la SRC, il semble que l\u2019on n\u2019avait consult\u00e9 son dossier qu\u2019une seule fois seulement, le 4 novembre 2011, et que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 la suite de la demande qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels pour qu\u2019on lui en envoie une copie. Ce n\u2019est que plus tard qu\u2019elle aurait pu apprendre que l\u2019on avait consult\u00e9 son dossier une seconde fois, le 11 novembre 2011, soit le jour m\u00eame que son entrevue, mais uniquement apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue (qui avait eu lieu dans la matin\u00e9e). Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9soudre cette diff\u00e9rence en mati\u00e8re de preuve. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune des conclusions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent ne s\u2019articule autour de cette all\u00e9gation, le Tribunal n\u2019a tout simplement accord\u00e9 aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision et la mesure de redressement\n[120] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte est justifi\u00e9e par les actes de repr\u00e9sailles de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de Mme Blackstock de la r\u00e9union tenue avec les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario au cabinet du ministre.\n[121] L\u2019avocat de la plaignante soutient que les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce justifient que le Tribunal accorde, conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 53(2) et 53(3) de la Loi, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral, ainsi que pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. La jurisprudence du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re d\u2019adjudication de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats p\u00e9cuniaires n\u2019est pas coh\u00e9rente, mais les affaires dans lesquelles un membre instructeur du Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019adjuger l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue de 20 000 $ donnent \u00e0 penser que l\u2019on ne r\u00e9serve de telles indemnit\u00e9s qu\u2019aux pires cas (voir Premakumar c. Air Canada, (2002) 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan, [1992] 2 CF 401. (CAF)). Par exemple le Tribunal a adjug\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 maximale en application du paragraphe 53(3) dans les affaires suivantes : Johnstone c. Agence des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20, conf. par 2013 CF 113, conf. par 2014 CAF 110; Seeley c. Canadian National Railway, 2010 TCDP 23, conf. par 2013 CF 117, conf. par 2014 CAF 111; Hicks c. Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2013 TCDP 20, conf. par 2015 CF 599. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles fait partie de la principale plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et que, de ce fait, l\u2019adjudication d\u2019une somme distincte sous forme de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires serait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et ne rel\u00e8verait pas du pouvoir que la loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal. De plus, soutient-il, une adjudication de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 la suite de la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles emp\u00eacherait de tirer une \u00e9ventuelle conclusion en mati\u00e8re de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la principale plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[122] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP vise un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 et distinct, et il oblige \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration un chef distinct de dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats. (Voir Cassidy, au paragraphe 196). Voir aussi Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), 2001 CanLII 8492 (TCDP), au paragraphe 292 et Gainer c. Exportation et D\u00e9veloppement Canada, 2006 CF 814 (CanLII), au paragraphe 36).\n[123] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les sentiments de honte et d\u2019humiliation de Mme Blackstock, dus au rejet professionnel et public qu\u2019elle a subi devant les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario auxquels elle souhaitait donner des conseils, sont compr\u00e9hensibles et m\u00e9ritent une forme quelconque d\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Le pr\u00e9judice moral est difficile \u00e0 quantifier. Cela dit, lorsqu\u2019une preuve \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019un tel pr\u00e9judice, il faut tenter de l\u2019indemniser (Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 115). Le Tribunal conclut que la somme de 10 000 $ constitue une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable pour le pr\u00e9judice que Mme Blackstock a subi.\n[124] Quant au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, il ne fait aucun doute que les gestes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 constituaient un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Mme Blackstock a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule personne exclue de la r\u00e9union, ce qui \u00e9taye sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour cible. Non seulement M. McArthur a-t-il reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de la plainte, mais il a aussi indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il craignait qu\u2019il en soit question lors de la r\u00e9union si on laissait Mme Blackstock y participer. Son t\u00e9moignage a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 le souhait d\u2019en exclure Mme Blackstock parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un m\u00e9pris pour les droits que prot\u00e8ge la Loi. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le genre de situation que l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi vise \u00e0 \u00e9viter. De l\u2019avis de la pr\u00e9sente formation, cette conduite justifie \u00e9galement l\u2019adjudication d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $.\n[125] Pour ces raisons, le Tribunal ordonne :\na) conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral;\nb) conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 de 10 000 $ pour son acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[126] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal, s\u2019il arrivait \u00e0 une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9, d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prendre part, en consultation avec la Commission, \u00e0 un programme de formation destin\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. Le Tribunal est manifestement en faveur de l\u2019id\u00e9e de rehausser, de fa\u00e7on constante, le degr\u00e9 de connaissance et de sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de la personne de divers particuliers, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019employ\u00e9s ou de membres du personnel de supervision et de direction. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le fait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la conclusion de repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019exclusion, par M. McArthur, de Mme Blackstock d\u2019une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle elle \u00e9tait en droit de participer, en raison de la plainte qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Les gestes de M. McArthur, m\u00eame s\u2019ils \u00e9taient manifestement fautifs, ne repr\u00e9sentaient pas n\u00e9cessairement ce que d\u2019autres gestionnaires au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9 auraient fait dans les circonstances. Cela \u00e9tant, le Tribunal n\u2019estime pas qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande de la Commission.\n[127] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance prescrivant au ministre d\u2019AADNC de pr\u00e9senter des excuses \u00e9crites et publiques \u00e0 Mme Blackstock et \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien. Cependant, dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Stevenson, 2003 CFPI 341, aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 35, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la Loi n\u2019habilite pas le Tribunal \u00e0 rendre une telle ordonnance. La demande d\u2019excuses publiques de la plaignante est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation coll\u00e9giale\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nEdward P.

Introduction\n[1] La plaignante, Karen McIlroy, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate contestant la date de fin de la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle elle avait exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles, d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par son ancien employeur, Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (\u00ab EDSC \u00bb) (anciennement Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (\u00ab RHDCC \u00bb) et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (\u00ab DSC \u00bb)), dans le cadre de la mise en \u0153uvre du Protocole d\u2019entente du 3 juillet 2012 (\u00ab PE \u00bb) entre, d\u2019une part, Ruth Walden et d\u2019autres, et d\u2019autre part, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Pour les motifs qui suivent, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nII. L\u2019instance principale : Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social)\n[2] Le PE est le r\u00e9sultat de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Ruth Walden et 416 autres plaignants entre 2004 et 2007, contestant la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux (\u00ab EM \u00bb), un groupe compos\u00e9 majoritairement de femmes infirmi\u00e8res prenant part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (\u00ab RPC \u00bb) et \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cisions statuant sur ces demandes, compar\u00e9s aux conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, un groupe compos\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019hommes m\u00e9decins travaillant aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des EM. Les plaignants all\u00e9guaient qu\u2019en raison de leur classification, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux recevaient une meilleure r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, de meilleurs avantages sociaux, une meilleure formation et une plus grande reconnaissance professionnelle et avait de meilleures possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement professionnel que les EM malgr\u00e9 le fait que les deux groupes exer\u00e7aient des fonctions analogues dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC et de la prise de d\u00e9cisions statuant sur ces demandes.\n[3] Aux termes d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 (Walden c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement social), 2007 TCDP 56 (\u00ab d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00bb), le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (\u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) a conclu que, bien qu\u2019il y ait certaines diff\u00e9rences dans les responsabilit\u00e9s quotidiennes des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et des EM, la [TRADUCTION] \u00ab fonction principale \u00bb de chaque poste \u00e9tait la m\u00eame et les deux postes requ\u00e9raient l\u2019application de connaissances et de comp\u00e9tences professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de demandeurs \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC. Le Tribunal a conclu que le refus du gouvernement de reconna\u00eetre la nature professionnelle du travail effectu\u00e9 par les EM d\u2019une mani\u00e8re proportionnelle \u00e0 la reconnaissance professionnelle accord\u00e9e au travail des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et violait les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H-6 modifi\u00e9e (\u00ab LCDP \u00bb). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision au terme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490.\n[4] Le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision distincte concernant les r\u00e9parations dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2009 : Walden et autres c. D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada et l\u2019Agence de gestion des ressources humaines de la fonction publique du Canada, 2009 TCDP 16 (\u00ab d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration \u00bb). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu que la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un nouveau sous-groupe Sciences infirmi\u00e8res (NU) au sein du groupe professionnel Services de sant\u00e9 (SH) pour le poste d\u2019EM reconna\u00eetrait convenablement les EM en tant que professionnels de la sant\u00e9, reconnaissant ainsi qu\u2019ils utilisent leurs connaissances professionnelles \u00e9tendues des sciences infirmi\u00e8res dans le cadre de leurs fonctions. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que cela constituerait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de corriger la pratique discriminatoire cern\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, et il a ordonn\u00e9 que des travaux en vue de la cr\u00e9ation du nouveau sous-groupe NU soient entrepris dans les 60 jours de la date de la d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal n\u2019a attribu\u00e9 par ailleurs aucune indemnit\u00e9 au titre de la perte de salaire et a accord\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral \u00e0 deux individus seulement.\n[5] Au terme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration (voir Canada Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 1135), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 les conclusions du Tribunal concernant la cr\u00e9ation du nouveau sous-groupe, mais elle a annul\u00e9 les conclusions du Tribunal concernant l\u2019indemnisation aux titres de la perte de salaires et de pr\u00e9judices moraux. La Cour a renvoy\u00e9 ces deux questions \u00e0 une formation diff\u00e9rente du Tribunal pour nouvelle d\u00e9cision. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision : D\u00e9veloppement social Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2011 CAF 202. Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal m\u2019a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour agir comme la nouvelle \u00ab formation \u00bb et m\u2019a saisi de l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9cembre 2010.\n[6] \u00c0 la suite de ces d\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le sous-groupe EM NU dans le cadre de la norme de classification Sciences infirmi\u00e8res de la fonction publique. Ce sous-groupe est d\u00e9fini comme suit : \u00ab Postes responsables de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale des demandeurs \u00e0 un programme gouvernemental ou de la prestation de conseils sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s et d\u2019experts dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale \u00bb; le sous-groupe comprend deux niveaux de postes d\u2019infirmier EM : le niveau NU-EMA-01, qui correspond aux fonctions d\u2019\u00ab [\u00e9valuation] des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux dans le but de d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 de demandeurs \u00e0 un programme du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, et le niveau NU-EMA-02, qui comprend \u00ab les postes de supervision des infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et de sp\u00e9cialistes techniques \u00e0 l'administration centrale ainsi qu'en r\u00e9gion \u00bb.\n[7] Les parties ont \u00e9galement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 des r\u00e8glements relatifs \u00e0 des r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es pour corriger la pratique discriminatoire : premi\u00e8rement, en concluant une entente relative \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation de pr\u00e9judices moraux, qui s\u2019est traduite par une ordonnance sur consentement dat\u00e9e du 26 octobre 2011; puis, le 3 juillet 2012, en concluant le PE, qui visait \u00e0 r\u00e9gler toutes les questions alors en suspens, dont la perte de salaires et d\u2019avantages sociaux. C\u2019est le PE qui est vis\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[8] Le PE accorde 16 500 $ par ann\u00e9e aux individus qui ont exerc\u00e9 des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb durant la [TRADUCTION] \u00ab p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00bb, soit entre le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1999 et le 30 septembre 2011. Le PE pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement le paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, d\u2019une autre indemnit\u00e9 pour les individus qui ont exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles durant des p\u00e9riodes ant\u00e9rieures au 1er d\u00e9cembre 1999 ainsi que d\u2019une indemnisation additionnelle du pr\u00e9judice moral en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP.\n[9] Les fonctions admissibles sont d\u00e9finies comme suit \u00e0 l\u2019article 1 du PE, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab D\u00e9finition de termes \u00bb :\n[TRADUCTION] \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb S\u2019entendent au sens de la d\u00e9finition de ce terme au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 26 octobre 2011, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, l\u2019individu \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 principalement dans le cadre du Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (RHDCC) soit \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e9valuer des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC et, dans l\u2019exercice de cette fonction, \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019utiliser les connaissances associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9) ou \u00e0 donner des conseils d\u2019expert aux personnes qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions ou \u00e0 superviser directement ces personnes.\n[10] Le 31 juillet 2012, le Tribunal a \u00e9mis une ordonnance sur consentement mettant en \u0153uvre les dispositions du PE. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa pleine comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler tout diff\u00e9rend ou controverse entourant le sens ou l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du PE \u00e0 la demande de toute partie ou de tout individu qui aurait pu exercer des fonctions admissibles au sens du PE. Le Tribunal a initialement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 cette comp\u00e9tence jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 2014, mais, depuis, il a repouss\u00e9 cette date au 31 mars 2015, puis, sur consentement, au 30 juin 2015 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question des paiements de majoration seulement.\nIII. Requ\u00eate en r\u00e9examen des fonctions admissibles\n[11] Le 21 ao\u00fbt 2014, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate contestant la date de fin des fonctions admissibles au sens du PE que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans son cas. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indemnis\u00e9 la plaignante au titre des fonctions admissibles qu\u2019elle avait exerc\u00e9es en tant qu\u2019EM entre le 22 janvier 1996 et le 4 septembre 2006. Cette p\u00e9riode et le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 correspondante ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. La plaignante demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre ses activit\u00e9s au travail comme des fonctions admissibles durant la p\u00e9riode du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007 au 30 septembre 2011 (\u00ab p\u00e9riode litigieuse \u00bb). La plaignante all\u00e8gue que, durant la p\u00e9riode du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007 au 23 janvier 2011, lorsqu\u2019elle a travaill\u00e9 comme gestionnaire de programme PM-05 au sein de la Division des d\u00e9cisions et des appels (\u00ab DDA \u00bb) de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (\u00ab Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC \u00bb), et durant la p\u00e9riode du 24 janvier 2011 au 30 septembre 2011, lorsqu\u2019elle a travaill\u00e9 comme conseill\u00e8re principale en mati\u00e8re de politiques au sein de cette division, elle \u00ab donnait des conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb ou \u00ab supervisait directement ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles du PE.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste cette requ\u00eate.\nIV. Le RPC et la structure institutionnelle\n[13] Lors de l\u2019examen des fonctions que la plaignante a exerc\u00e9es durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, il est utile de bien comprendre le r\u00f4le de la DDA et comment ce r\u00f4le se situe par rapport aux autres responsabilit\u00e9s r\u00e9parties relativement \u00e0 l\u2019administration du Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC (\u00ab Programme de PIRPC \u00bb) pris dans son ensemble. Pour cette raison, je donne ci-apr\u00e8s un aper\u00e7u du RPC, et en particulier de son volet relatif au Programme de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, et j\u2019explique comment et par qui ce programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 et est fourni. Cela permet de d\u00e9crire des aspects importants du contexte entourant le PE et le r\u00f4le des EM que le PE vise \u00e0 indemniser dans la foul\u00e9e du contentieux Walden en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\nA. Le RPC et le Programme de PIRPC\n[14] Le RPC est un programme d\u2019assurance sociale contributif reli\u00e9 au revenu qui vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger dans une certaine mesure un cotisant et sa famille contre la perte de revenus r\u00e9sultant de la retraite du cotisant, de son invalidit\u00e9 ou de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Avec un budget de 37 milliards de dollars, il s\u2019agit du plus gros programme du gouvernement du Canada.\n[15] Le Programme de PIRPC est un volet du RPC qui vise \u00e0 offrir aux cotisants au RPC qui y sont admissibles une protection contre la perte de revenus r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9. Le Programme de PIRPC accorde des prestations aux demandeurs qui ont une invalidit\u00e9 physique ou mentale grave et prolong\u00e9e et qui ont vers\u00e9 des cotisations suffisantes au RPC. Le Programme de PIRPC verse 4 milliards de dollars de prestations \u00e0 plus de 330 000 demandeurs chaque ann\u00e9e, ce qui en fait de loin le plus gros assureur de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 au pays.\n[16] L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 des prestations en vertu du Programme de PIRPC est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e suivant un processus qui comporte plusieurs \u00e9tapes. Les EM et les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux sont les principaux responsables de la d\u00e9termination de cette admissibilit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ce processus comme suit (d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 au paragraphe 36) [1] :\nune personne pr\u00e9sente une demande de prestations;\nune premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision est prise quant \u00e0 l'octroi des prestations en fonction des crit\u00e8res d'admissibilit\u00e9;\nsi la demande est rejet\u00e9e, le demandeur peut pr\u00e9senter une demande de r\u00e9examen de la d\u00e9cision;\nsi les prestations sont refus\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen, le demandeur peut interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision au Tribunal de r\u00e9vision (TR) (anciennement le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision);\nsi le TR rend une fois de plus une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable au sujet des prestations, le demandeur peut demander l'autorisation d'interjeter appel \u00e0 la Commission d'appel des pensions (CAP);\nsi le TR accorde les prestations au demandeur, le ministre responsable du programme du RPC peut demander une autorisation de pourvoi de la d\u00e9cision du TR;\nle demandeur et le ministre peuvent tous deux pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la CAP;\n\u00e0 toute \u00e9tape du processus, le demandeur peut pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux renseignements, m\u00e9dicaux ou non, ou des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires. Le d\u00e9cideur qui en est saisi examine les renseignements afin de d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC.\n[17] Il vaut la peine de mentionner que plus de quatre-vingt-dix pour cent de toutes les demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC re\u00e7oivent une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive au stade initial ou au stade du r\u00e9examen et que relativement peu de cas sont port\u00e9s en appel devant le TR ou la CAP. Encore plus rares sont les cas qui font l\u2019objet de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire : d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, au paragraphe 37.\n[18] Ce sont actuellement EDSC (RHDCC durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse) et Service Canada (\u00ab SC \u00bb) qui administrent le RPC et le Programme de PIRPC. EDSC est le minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada qui est responsable de l\u2019\u00e9laboration, de la gestion et de la prestation de programmes et services sociaux. SC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 au sein de RHDCC en 2005 pour servir de premier point d\u2019acc\u00e8s pour la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 de nombreux programmes et services du gouvernement du Canada. SC est l\u2019organe prestataire d\u2019EDSC et d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, et il fait partie d\u2019EDSC.\n[19] Avant la cr\u00e9ation de SC en 2005, le Programme de PIRPC \u00e9tait administr\u00e9 par RHDCC par l\u2019entremise de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC. L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que, durant cette p\u00e9riode, certains fonctionnaires travaillant au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ont exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles, notamment en donnant des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions. Mme McIlroy a \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9e au titre de ce type de fonctions admissibles jusqu\u2019en septembre 2006 pour cette raison. L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime toutefois que, depuis la cr\u00e9ation de SC, la vaste majorit\u00e9 des fonctionnaires qui exercent des fonctions admissibles (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire environ 400 EM) rel\u00e8vent de SC et ne font plus partie de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC.\n[20] En d\u00e9cembre 2008, RHDCC et SC ont sign\u00e9 un protocole d\u2019accord (\u00ab PA \u00bb) qui, entre autres choses, d\u00e9finit les r\u00f4les et les responsabilit\u00e9s de chacune des parties vis-\u00e0-vis du RPC. Aux termes de l\u2019article 7.4 du PA, RHDCC demeure pleinement responsable de la l\u00e9gislation, de la r\u00e9glementation et de l\u2019\u00e9laboration des politiques relatives au RPC, tandis que SC administre et ex\u00e9cute le RPC pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il est efficace, adapt\u00e9 aux besoins et \u00e9conomique.\n[21] En vertu du PA, la responsabilit\u00e9 du Programme de PIRPC est partag\u00e9e entre, d\u2019une part, la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du revenu et du d\u00e9veloppement social (\u00ab Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS \u00bb) de RHDCC, qui comprend la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC, et d\u2019autre part, SC. La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des op\u00e9rations de SC est par la suite devenue la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des services de traitement et de paiement (\u00ab DGSTP \u00bb). La DGSTP comprend : (i) l\u2019Administration centrale (\u00ab AC \u00bb), qui a notamment la responsabilit\u00e9 de donner des directives\/orientations aux EM qui travaillent dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, de les superviser, de leur assurer un soutien et de faire la liaison avec eux; et (ii) les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, o\u00f9 la vaste majorit\u00e9 des EM travaillent et rendent les d\u00e9cisions. Il y a \u00e9galement un petit nombre d\u2019EM qui travaillent \u00e0 l\u2019AC [2] .\n[22] En 2006-2007, suite \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de SC, la vaste majorit\u00e9 des postes des EM charg\u00e9s de statuer sur les demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et des postes des superviseurs de ces EM sont pass\u00e9s du c\u00f4t\u00e9 SC de RHDCC. La majorit\u00e9 des postes des niveaux PM-04 et PM-05 au sein de la DGSTP \u00e0 l\u2019AC ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA-02. Les postes d\u2019EM de niveau PM-04 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA-01. Il est acquis aux d\u00e9bats que la vaste majorit\u00e9 des plaignants et des non-plaignants dans l\u2019instance Walden travaillent ou ont travaill\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 SC de RHDCC (maintenant EDSC).\nB. La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC\n[23] La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS d\u2019EDSC comprend la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC, qui est une organisation distincte de la DGSTP de SC (\u00e0 l\u2019AC et dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux). Depuis 2005, la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC assure un leadership national dans le d\u00e9veloppement et la gestion courante du Programme de PIRPC. La Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9labore des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires et des politiques, et elle traduit ces politiques en directives fonctionnelles \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la DGSTP.\n[24] Durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC comportait quatre divisions : la Division des politiques, la Division de la conception de programmes, la Division de l\u2019expertise m\u00e9dicale (\u00ab DEM \u00bb) et la Division des d\u00e9cisions et des appels (\u00ab DDA \u00bb). Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les arguments dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate concernent les deux derni\u00e8res de ces divisions.\n[25] La DEM examinait toutes les d\u00e9cisions du TR et formulait des recommandations au Comit\u00e9 du contentieux concernant tout appel du ministre aupr\u00e8s du CAP. Elle pr\u00e9sentait la position du ministre devant la CAP. Elle fournissait \u00e9galement une expertise m\u00e9dicale dans tous les domaines des PIRPC, y compris aux EM de SC. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le petit nombre d\u2019EM qui sont demeur\u00e9s au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC ont travaill\u00e9 au sein de la DEM pour pr\u00eater main-forte dans les dossiers relatifs aux cas port\u00e9s en appel devant la CAP. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que tous ces individus occupaient des postes ayant soit le titre d\u2019\u00ab EM \u00bb ou celui de \u00ab gestionnaire, \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale \u00bb et qu\u2019ils exer\u00e7aient tous des fonctions qui cadraient avec la d\u00e9finition des fonctions de la norme de classification NU. Ces postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA.\n[26] La DDA, au sein de laquelle la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, assumait le r\u00f4le et la fonction suivants :\nassurer un soutien fonctionnel, une direction nationale et le d\u00e9veloppement du processus en ce qui a trait aux appels devant les tribunaux de r\u00e9vision;\nfaire la liaison entre la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et le Bureau du Commissaire des tribunaux de r\u00e9vision;\nappuyer la gestion strat\u00e9gique des appels en mati\u00e8re de PIRPC;\ndonner des conseils d\u2019expert et assurer une direction fonctionnelle relativement aux d\u00e9cisions concernant les PIRPC.\n[27] Dans le cadre du r\u00f4le d\u00e9crit ci-dessus, la DDA donnait notamment des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 SC relativement aux d\u00e9cisions et aux appels complexes en mati\u00e8re de PIRPC. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, son r\u00f4le comprenait les t\u00e2ches suivantes :\nr\u00e9pondre aux demandes de renseignements des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux relatives aux d\u00e9cisions, notamment en ce qui concerne les demandes initiales et les r\u00e9examens ainsi qu\u2019en ce qui a trait aux appels;\nconsulter des experts m\u00e9dicaux, l\u00e9gaux et autres relativement aux dossiers de d\u00e9cision et d\u2019appel en mati\u00e8re de PIRPC;\nassurer une direction fonctionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de SC et lui donner des conseils d\u2019expert relativement \u00e0 des dossiers d\u2019appel complexes;\nexaminer les documents de formation, les proc\u00e9dures et les outils de SC pour assurer leur conformit\u00e9 aux politiques.\n[28] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la plaignante a soutenu que les fonctions qu\u2019elle avait exerc\u00e9es comme PM-05 et comme PM-06 au sein de la DDA constituaient des fonctions admissibles en vertu du PE parce que ces fonctions consistaient principalement \u00e0 \u00ab donner des conseils d\u2019expert aux personnes qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions ou \u00e0 superviser directement ces personnes \u00bb conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE.\nV. Les positions des parties\nA. Les t\u00e2ches accomplies par la plaignante dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions comme PM-05 au sein de la DDA\n[29] Le 5 septembre 2006, la plaignante a quitt\u00e9 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC, o\u00f9 elle travaillait comme PM-04, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 promue \u00e0 un poste de niveau PM\u00ad05 dans un autre minist\u00e8re. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007, au d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, la plaignante est retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 RHDCC pour travailler au sein de la DDA de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des PIRPC comme PM-05, avec l\u2019appellation d\u2019emploi \u00ab gestionnaire de programme \u00bb (d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00ab responsable principale de projet \u00bb dans l\u2019organigramme de la DDA).\n[30] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que, durant ce temps, elle avait pour principale fonction de donner des conseils d\u2019expert aux EM qui travaillaient au sein de la DGSTP dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et \u00e0 l\u2019AC ainsi qu\u2019au sein de la DDA elle-m\u00eame. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019une partie de ses fonctions d\u2019emploi consistait \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des demandes de renseignements relatives \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis et \u00e0 aider ses coll\u00e8gues PM-05 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 de telles demandes de renseignements que la Division recevait d\u2019\u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux qui travaillaient dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et \u00e0 l\u2019AC. Dans le cadre de ses fonctions, la plaignante examinait les d\u00e9tails du dossier et mettait \u00e0 profit sa connaissance des politiques et du Programme ainsi que ses comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es d\u2019ancienne infirmi\u00e8re et \u00e9valuatrice m\u00e9dicale pour fournir une r\u00e9ponse. C\u2019\u00e9taient les EM qui rendaient les d\u00e9cisions finales statuant sur les dossiers, mais la plaignante a soutenu qu\u2019ils le faisaient en s\u2019appuyant sur les conseils d\u2019expert qu\u2019elle leur donnait.\n[31] En plus de donner ce type de conseils d\u2019expert relatifs \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis, la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle donnait \u00e9galement des conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux aux EM au sein de sa division \u2013 Mme Boland et Mme McGuire \u2013 ainsi qu\u2019aux EM qui travaillaient \u00e0 SC, principalement dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, et aux PM-05 \u00e0 l\u2019AC. La plaignante soutient que lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9laborait des politiques et lorsqu\u2019elle donnait des directives aux EM pour les aider \u00e0 rendre des d\u00e9cisions statuant sur des demandes, elle donnait \u00e9galement des conseils d\u2019expert au sens du PE. Pour que les EM puissent statuer sur des demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019ils doivent conna\u00eetre \u00e0 la fois les sciences infirmi\u00e8res et les politiques relatives aux PIRPC puisque ces deux domaines sont interreli\u00e9s et leur connaissance est n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer une application uniforme et \u00e9quitable de la l\u00e9gislation relative au RPC dans le cadre des d\u00e9cisions rendues statuant sur les demandes de PIRPC.\n[32] La plaignante soutient que sa position susmentionn\u00e9e est confort\u00e9e par le r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la DDA, qui est de donner des conseils d\u2019expert aux EM sur des questions reli\u00e9es aux d\u00e9cisions m\u00e9dicales. La plaignante conteste la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle les conseils d\u2019expert vis\u00e9s au PE excluent les conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La plaignante invoque \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, aux termes de laquelle le Tribunal a reconnu ce qui suit au paragraphe 65 :\nTant les conseillers que les EM peuvent participer aux activit\u00e9s de relations externes et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques. Le Dr Gregory travaille avec d'autres conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration et \u00e0 l'analyse de politiques. Ruth Walden a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle connaissait au moins un EM qui travaillait dans le domaine de l'\u00e9laboration de politiques. La description de poste des EM pr\u00e9cise que les \u00e9valuateurs peuvent faire partie d'\u00e9quipes qui travaillent \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration de formations et de politiques, ou diriger de telles \u00e9quipes.\n[33] La plaignante note en outre que le PE ne pr\u00e9cise nulle part quel type de \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb il vise. Selon l\u2019Oxford Dictionary, un expert est d\u00e9fini comme une personne form\u00e9e par la pratique, qui poss\u00e8de des comp\u00e9tences ou des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019avec ses 20 ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience comme infirmi\u00e8re, ses 10 ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience comme \u00e9valuatrice m\u00e9dicale et son exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de politiques, la plaignante peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme poss\u00e9dant des comp\u00e9tences et des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. Elle soutient que lorsqu\u2019elle donnait des conseils strat\u00e9giques \u00e0 des EM ou lorsqu\u2019elle conseillait des EM relativement \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis, elle appliquait ces connaissances \u00e0 leur profit.\n[34] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des conseils relatifs \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis et des conseils d\u2019expert strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 Mme Boland et \u00e0 Mme McGuire ainsi qu\u2019aux EM \u00e0 l\u2019AC et dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux de SC lorsqu\u2019elle est devenue PM-06 en janvier 2011. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle a donc donn\u00e9 des conseils d\u2019expert au sens du PE durant toute la p\u00e9riode litigieuse.\n[35] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fonde sa position contraire sur deux arguments principaux. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 plaide en faveur d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation plus \u00e9troite des \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb vis\u00e9s au PE, en soutenant que ces conseils se limitent aux conseils donn\u00e9s directement \u00e0 des EM lorsqu\u2019ils rendent des d\u00e9cisions statuant sur des cas pr\u00e9cis et ils ne comprennent pas le travail relatif aux politiques ni les conseils d\u2019expert donn\u00e9s par le truchement de deux interm\u00e9diaires. Deuxi\u00e8mement, selon cette interpr\u00e9tation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient, que bien que la plaignante ait pu exercer certaines fonctions admissibles lorsqu\u2019elle r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 des demandes de renseignements formul\u00e9es par des EM relativement \u00e0 des cas sp\u00e9cifiques, la plaignante n\u2019avait pas pour fonction d\u2019emploi principale de donner des conseils d\u2019expert, comme l\u2019exige la d\u00e9finition.\n[36] Pour ce qui concerne le premier argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9, celui-ci soutient que le r\u00f4le principal ou premier de la plaignante \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9laborer et d\u2019assurer une orientation strat\u00e9gique nationale pour le Programme de PIRPC, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui avait trait aux questions strat\u00e9giques relatives aux d\u00e9cisions et aux appels. Les conseils de la plaignante visaient \u00e0 assurer l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019application uniforme de politiques relatives aux PIRPC de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un cadre pour la prestation uniforme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale du Programme de PIRPC, y compris lors de la prise de d\u00e9cisions statuant sur les demandes et de la r\u00e9vision de cas en appel. Cela comprenait, par exemple, donner des conseils sur comment interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires et les politiques dans le cas de demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 complexes.\n[37] Les conseils d\u2019expert que la plaignante donnait concernaient les politiques relatives au Programme et s\u2019inscrivaient dans le cadre du r\u00f4le de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC consistant \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que la loi et les politiques \u00e9taient suffisamment claires et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient appliqu\u00e9es correctement. Ce n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, que les conseils d\u2019expert m\u00e9dicaux aux fins de la prise de d\u00e9cisions que le PE \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 viser. D\u2019ailleurs, sauf dans le cas de l\u2019unique exemple donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la note de bas de page ci-dessous, EDSC n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au titre de fonctions admissibles exerc\u00e9es durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse dans le cas d\u2019individus qui occupaient un poste substantif de gestionnaire de programme \/ responsable de projet au sein de la DDA de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC [3] .\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient \u00e9galement que la majorit\u00e9 des conseils d\u2019expert aux fins d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale que la plaignante a donn\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas donn\u00e9s directement aux EM, mais \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t donn\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs superviseurs ou \u00e0 des experts fonctionnels (anciennement appel\u00e9s chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe), qui donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert directement aux EM. La majorit\u00e9 des EM travaillaient dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux de SC et passaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par l\u2019AC pour obtenir tout conseil d\u2019expert non disponible dans leurs r\u00e9gions respectives. La fonction premi\u00e8re de la plaignante consistait \u00e0 donner des conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 l\u2019AC, et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, ses conseils \u00e9taient rarement donn\u00e9s directement aux EM r\u00e9gionaux. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que ce type de conseils d\u2019expert indirects, ou donn\u00e9s par le truchement d\u2019interm\u00e9diaires, d\u00e9borde le cadre de la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE.\n[39] Pour ce qui concerne maintenant le deuxi\u00e8me argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9, bien que celui\u00adci reconnaisse que, de temps \u00e0 autre, la plaignante a donn\u00e9 directement des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 des individus qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cela ne constituait pas une partie principale de son travail. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00ab principale \u00bb signifie plus de cinquante pour cent. M\u00eame si l\u2019on admet la description que la plaignante elle-m\u00eame fait de ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, les quelques activit\u00e9s dans le cadre desquelles elle a donn\u00e9 des conseils d\u2019expert relativement \u00e0 des dossiers de cas pr\u00e9cis et qui r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles ne repr\u00e9sentaient pas plus de cinquante pour cent de l\u2019ensemble de sa charge de travail.\n[40] C\u2019est pour ces raisons que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conclu que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles lorsqu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 comme PM-05 au sein de la DDA durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas indemniser la plaignante.\nB. Les t\u00e2ches accomplies par la plaignante dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions comme PM-06 au sein de la DDA\n[41] Le 24 janvier 2011, la plaignante s\u2019est vu offrir un poste de PM-06, avec le titre de poste \u00ab conseill\u00e8re principale en politiques \u00bb (l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a aussi d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme un poste d\u2019analyste principale de la politique). La plaignante all\u00e8gue que ce titre ne rendait pas bien compte de ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi r\u00e9elles parce que, plut\u00f4t que de cr\u00e9er un nouveau poste, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 ce poste d\u2019une autre division \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC. La plaignante soutient que, malgr\u00e9 ce titre de poste, elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 des EM qui travaillaient dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, \u00e0 l\u2019AC ou au sein de la DDA. Elle all\u00e8gue qu\u2019en cette qualit\u00e9, elle a aussi fr\u00e9quemment supervis\u00e9 les EM au sein de la DDA ainsi que les autres PM-05 en l\u2019absence du directeur, se trouvant ainsi \u00e0 \u00ab superviser directement les personnes qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE.\n[42] Selon la plaignante, les deux EM au sein de la DDA, Mme Boland et Mme McGuire, ne travaillaient pas sur des dossiers relatifs \u00e0 des demandes initiales au premier niveau ni sur des dossiers \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen, mais elles travaillaient sur des dossiers port\u00e9s en appel devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que Mme Boland et Mme McGuire devaient examiner tous les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux afin de fournir une explication au refus de la demande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que ce travail s\u2019apparente au travail d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et, par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Boland et Mme McGuire exer\u00e7aient des fonctions semblables \u00e0 celles des EM dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux. La plaignante note que Mme Boland et Mme McGuire \u00e9taient reconnues comme infirmi\u00e8res et classifi\u00e9es comme \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales. En 2012, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 converties \u00e0 la classification NU-EMA. Mme Boland et Mme McGuire ont toutes deux \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9es au motif qu\u2019elles avaient exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles durant le temps o\u00f9 elles avaient travaill\u00e9 au sein de la DDA.\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient, au contraire, que Mme Boland et Mme McGuire n\u2019exer\u00e7aient pas des fonctions d\u2019\u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales dans le cadre de leurs postes au sein de la DDA. Elles travaillaient notamment \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des rapports et \u00e0 fournir des \u00e9valuations relativement aux affaires port\u00e9es devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision. Elles faisaient \u00e9galement des recommandations aux EM dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux. Toutefois, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence des EM qui travaillaient dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, elles n\u2019avaient aucun pouvoir de r\u00e9gler des cas et elles ne rendaient pas de d\u00e9cisions. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le PE de mani\u00e8re lib\u00e9rale et a choisi d\u2019indemniser Mme Boland et Mme McGuire parce que leurs postes d\u2019attache \u00e9taient des postes d\u2019\u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales au sein de la DEM.\n[44] Si le Tribunal conclut que les fonctions de Mme Boland et Mme McGuire \u00e9taient des fonctions d\u2019\u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales vis\u00e9es au PE, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient \u00e9galement que la supervision de ces employ\u00e9es par la plaignante ne constituait pas sa principale fonction d\u2019emploi. En tant que PM-06, elle aurait aussi supervis\u00e9 plusieurs autres titulaires de postes PM-04 et PM-05. Durant les p\u00e9riodes au cours desquelles elle a remplac\u00e9 le directeur de la division, elle aurait supervis\u00e9 toute la DDA, ce qui, durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, aurait totalis\u00e9 environ quinze individus en plus de Mme Boland et Mme McGuire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 note \u00e9galement que, tout comme la plaignante \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards, M. Dub\u00e9, le gestionnaire principal PM-06, a \u00e9galement remplac\u00e9 le directeur de la division, mais il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du PE pour avoir supervis\u00e9 des EM.\n[45] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, pour ces motifs, la plaignante ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 comme PM\u00ad06.\nC. Les fonctions admissibles exerc\u00e9es par d\u2019autres PM-05 au sein de la DGSTP \u00e0 l\u2019AC\n[46] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que sa pr\u00e9tention est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conclu que d\u2019autres individus qui travaillaient au sein de la DGSTP \u00e0 l\u2019AC de SC (comme Marjorie Martin, une gestionnaire de projet avec qui la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 \u00e9troitement) et qui exer\u00e7aient des fonctions semblables \u00e0 celles de la plaignante donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions. La plaignante note qu\u2019elle avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et des fonctions comparables \u00e0 ceux des autres employ\u00e9s PM-05 travaillant \u00e0 l\u2019AC qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 classifi\u00e9s NU-EMA-02 et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles. Elle soutient que les employ\u00e9s PM-05 \u00e0 l\u2019AC s\u2019adressaient souvent \u00e0 elle ou \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues pour leur relayer des demandes de renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale provenant d\u2019EM des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux parce qu\u2019ils avaient besoin de ses conseils d\u2019expert. La plaignante affirme qu\u2019ils avaient une relation [TRADUCTION] \u00ab collaborative \u00bb et \u00ab d\u2019expertise partag\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[47] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante selon laquelle celle-ci exer\u00e7ait les m\u00eames fonctions que ses homologues PM-05 travaillant \u00e0 l\u2019AC. Tel qu\u2019il ressort du PA, il y avait d\u2019importantes diff\u00e9rences dans la nature du travail accompli par la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS, y compris la DDA, et la DGSTP de SC. Les individus occupant des postes de PM-05 au sein de la DGSTP qui ont re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du PE travaillaient soit comme gestionnaires de programme \/ responsables de projet, comme experts fonctionnels (anciennement chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe) ou comme EM principaux. Contrairement \u00e0 la plaignante, ils \u00e9taient les premiers points de contact des EM, \u00e0 qui ils donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert relativement \u00e0 des \u00e9valuations m\u00e9dicales ou qu\u2019ils supervisaient directement. De plus, ces postes requ\u00e9raient tous des connaissances et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de soins infirmiers comme qualification essentielle, et ils ont subs\u00e9quemment \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA-02 pour cette raison.\nD. La description du poste de la plaignante\n[48] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu une description de poste exacte pour ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre des postes PM-05 et PM-06 qu\u2019elle a occup\u00e9s durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse. L\u2019offre d\u2019emploi et le num\u00e9ro de poste figurant sur la description de poste qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis initialement \u00e0 la plaignante en septembre 2014 \u00e9taient inexacts. Bien qu\u2019elle ait par la suite obtenu une description de poste pour le poste PM-05 en novembre 2014 qui comportait le bon num\u00e9ro de poste, la liste des t\u00e2ches ne traduisait pas fid\u00e8lement les fonctions qu\u2019elle avait exerc\u00e9es. En outre, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que le poste PM-06 qu\u2019elle a occup\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019une autre division et elle n\u2019a jamais obtenu de description de poste. Elle note \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucune description de poste n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, au moment d\u2019examiner ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi pour d\u00e9terminer si elle exer\u00e7ait effectivement des fonctions admissibles, le Tribunal ne devrait accorder aucun poids aux descriptions de poste produites en preuve.\n[49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 conc\u00e8de qu\u2019il y a eu des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes \u00bb concernant l\u2019exactitude des descriptions de poste durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, mais il note que les descriptions de poste sont habituellement adapt\u00e9es au moyen d\u2019addendas qui fournissent davantage de pr\u00e9cisions. Cela \u00e9tant dit, bien que les trois descriptions de poste g\u00e9n\u00e9riques (\u00ab moins les addendas \u00bb qui \u00e9taient inexacts) qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve ne traduisent peut-\u00eatre pas fid\u00e8lement les fonctions de la plaignante, elles donnent un aper\u00e7u des fonctions qu\u2019elle et ses coll\u00e8gues exer\u00e7aient au sein de la DDA. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 note que, bien que les descriptions de travail aient \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es pour d\u00e9terminer qui avait exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles, elles ne constituaient pas le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment sur lequel ces d\u00e9cisions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement tenu compte du r\u00f4le global de la Division ainsi que des fonctions effectivement exerc\u00e9es par les employ\u00e9s, selon ce qu\u2019avaient communiqu\u00e9 les directeurs de divisions et ce qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans des rapports de travail courants.\nE. La qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e de la plaignante\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9 note que la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE exige que ceux qui rendent des d\u00e9cisions \u00ab [utilisent] les connaissances associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9 \u00bb, et il soutient que cette exigence s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 ceux qui donnent des conseils d\u2019expert et qui supervisent directement ceux qui rendent des d\u00e9cisions. \u00catre un infirmier autoris\u00e9 doit, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, constituer une qualification essentielle ou \u00ab requise \u00bb relativement au poste de l\u2019individu pour que celui-ci puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le PE doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du contexte plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du litige qui en est l\u2019origine. Le PE visait \u00e0 indemniser les [TRADUCTION] \u00ab victimes \u00bb (pour employer la terminologie de la LCDP [4] ) plaignantes et non plaignantes des pertes que leur avait occasionn\u00e9es la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elles avaient subie par rapport \u00e0 leurs homologues conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Presque tous ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9s \u00e9taient des infirmiers autoris\u00e9s. Cette exigence trouve \u00e9galement un \u00e9cho dans le fait que les d\u00e9finitions du sous-groupe NU-EMA, qui r\u00e9sultent de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, exigent que les titulaires des postes correspondants soient des infirmiers autoris\u00e9s [5] . L\u2019\u00e9laboration des descriptions de poste relatives aux postes NU-EMA et le choix des postes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chis, \u00e0 la suite de nombreuses consultations et discussions entre professionnels des ressources humaines. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, lorsque les parties ont conclu le PE, leur intention \u00e9tait de voir \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation des individus qui \u00e9taient tenus d\u2019\u00eatre des infirmiers autoris\u00e9s pour pouvoir occuper leurs postes. Cela comprend ceux qui donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert et qui supervisaient ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme comportant cette exigence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des individus appartenant \u00e0 ces deux cat\u00e9gories.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que les connaissances, les comp\u00e9tences et l\u2019expertise de la plaignante en mati\u00e8re de sciences infirmi\u00e8res et d\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale constituaient certainement un atout pour son poste, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une qualification essentielle pour son poste. La majorit\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches de la plaignante consistaient \u00e0 donner des conseils juridiques ou analytiques ou des conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9riques, et aucune de ces t\u00e2ches n\u2019exigeait la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019une telle expertise \u00e9tait requise, les employ\u00e9s au sein de la DDA pouvaient consulter la DEM. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cela \u00e9taye d\u2019autant plus sa position selon laquelle la plaignante n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse.\n[53] La plaignante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019\u00e9valuation que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait de son poste, et elle all\u00e8gue que ses nombreuses ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure comme infirmi\u00e8re et comme \u00e9valuatrice m\u00e9dicale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 essentielles \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, aussi bien comme PM-05 que comme PM-06. Le fait que tous les responsables de projet PM-05 au sein de la DDA avaient des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019infirmier et d\u2019EM \u00e9taye son argument selon lequel il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une exigence de son poste. La plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu implicitement que cette exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tait une exigence lorsqu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 de lui rembourser ses droits de permis d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re autoris\u00e9e et ses frais d\u2019adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 son ordre professionnel. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019effectuer ce remboursement a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu de la convention collective du groupe Services des programmes et de l\u2019administration (PA) au profit de ceux \u00ab qui, dans le cadre de leur travail r\u00e9gulier, ont besoin des connaissances m\u00e9dicales qui s'acqui\u00e8rent en faisant des \u00e9tudes, en suivant une formation et\/ou en obtenant un permis d'exercer \u00e0 titre d'infirmier licenci\u00e9 \u00bb. Ainsi, en acceptant de rembourser ces frais, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que la plaignante appliquait ses connaissances en sciences infirmi\u00e8res dans l\u2019exercice de ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi. La plaignante soutient que ce m\u00eame fait devrait \u00eatre pris en compte pour d\u00e9terminer les p\u00e9riodes durant lesquelles elle a exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles.\n[54] La plaignante conteste \u00e9galement la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles exige implicitement que la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9 corresponde \u00e0 une des exigences du poste de la plaignante. En fait, la plaignante conteste la pertinence de poss\u00e9der la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9 dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du PE. Le Tribunal a tout d\u2019abord ordonn\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation du sous-groupe NU dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration en 2009. Les parties ont ensuite pris des mesures pour mettre en \u0153uvre l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019elles ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les cat\u00e9gories NU-EMA. Malgr\u00e9 cela, le PE, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu en 2012, ne fait aucune mention des nouvelles cat\u00e9gories, de leurs d\u00e9finitions ou de l\u2019exigence de poss\u00e9der la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9. Aussi, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019admettre la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle l\u2019ajout de cette exigence \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles traduit l\u2019intention sous-jacente des parties lorsqu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le PE.\nVI. Analyse\n[55] Pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, je dois examiner le PE, notamment le sens ordinaire des mots qu\u2019il contient, les intentions des parties et, au titre d\u2019une analyse contextuelle, le litige plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en cause. Le \u00ab litige plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb comprend les plaintes effectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9paration et toute conclusion ou commentaire pertinent des tribunaux judiciaires dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou d\u2019un appel. Le PE est enracin\u00e9 dans les plaintes de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par plus de 400 EM, et il \u00e9nonce qu\u2019il vise \u00e0 \u00ab r\u00e9gler toutes les questions qui restent en litige et qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une ou plusieurs des plaintes \u00bb. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9 et conclu dans un vide.\n[56] Cela \u00e9tant dit, en d\u00e9finissant les fonctions admissibles, le PE \u00e9largit \u00e9galement dans les faits les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration que le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9e initialement dans les d\u00e9cisions concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9paration. Le membre Jensen avait conclu que les EM avaient subi un traitement diff\u00e9rent d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 comparer \u00e0 leurs homologues conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. Toutefois, le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas conclu que ceux qui donnaient des conseils d\u2019expert aux EM ou qui supervisaient les EM avaient \u00e9galement subi le m\u00eame traitement diff\u00e9rent. En convenant d\u2019inclure aussi ces individus parmi les personnes admissibles \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 en vertu du PE, les parties sont all\u00e9es au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019ordonnance initiale du Tribunal.\n[57] Bien que les dispositions du PE relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve de la comp\u00e9tence et l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement subs\u00e9quente aient une vaste port\u00e9e, elles ne peuvent pas conf\u00e9rer une comp\u00e9tence qui ne trouve aucun fondement dans la LCDP. Les deux ordonnances sur consentement comportent un pr\u00e9ambule qui reconna\u00eet que les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es \u00bb (faisant \u00e9cho au libell\u00e9 de la LCDP), selon la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9. Toute r\u00e9paration d\u00e9coulant de ces conclusions \u2013 y compris dans la d\u00e9cision concernant la r\u00e9paration elle-m\u00eame \u2013, d\u2019ententes entre les parties \u2013 comme le PE \u2013 ou d\u2019autres ordonnances du Tribunal doivent \u00eatre reli\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9senter un lien avec l\u2019objet des plaintes. Les requ\u00eates comme celle dont il est ici question ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme appelant simplement et uniquement un exercice d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contractuelle.\n[58] Mme McIlroy a le fardeau l\u00e9gal de prouver sa r\u00e9paration selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Bien qu\u2019elle soit une plaignante nomm\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Walden et autres et qu\u2019elle ait re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre pour une p\u00e9riode de dix ans (1996-2006) comme \u00e9valuatrice m\u00e9dicale et qu\u2019elle soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme une \u00ab plaignante \u00bb dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, sa demande d\u2019indemnisation dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pour la p\u00e9riode litigieuse de quatre ans est faite en qualit\u00e9 de \u00ab victime \u00bb non plaignante cherchant \u00e0 \u00eatre reconnue comme appartenant aux deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gories d\u2019individus vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE.\nA. Quelle intention animait les parties lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9tendu la r\u00e9paration?\n[59] Une question centrale se pose \u00e0 ce stade-ci : Quelle intention animait les parties au PE (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les plaignants, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le cabinet d\u2019avocats Armstrong Wellman, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 [6] ) lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9largi les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration aux deux groupes additionnels d\u2019individus?\n[60] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations sur ce point. Je note que le seul t\u00e9moin entendu par le Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait l\u2019unique t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mary Pichette, sous-ministre adjointe principale par int\u00e9rim, EDSC, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS. Elle s\u2019est jointe \u00e0 la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC en 2009. En mai 2010, elle est devenue directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale par int\u00e9rim, et son poste est devenu permanent en ao\u00fbt 2010. Bien que Mme Pichette n\u2019ait pas n\u00e9goci\u00e9 directement le PE (ce sont les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui s\u2019en sont charg\u00e9s), elle a pris part aux n\u00e9gociations et elle a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 des discussions concernant sa mise en \u0153uvre. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement une des principales hautes dirigeantes \u00e0 avoir pris part \u00e0 l\u2019examen de tous les emplois pertinents au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC et de SC qui a fait suite au litige Walden et aux ordonnances subs\u00e9quentes du Tribunal, y compris la nouvelle classification et la d\u00e9signation des emplois qui seraient reclassifi\u00e9s dans les cat\u00e9gories NU-EMA-01 et 02. J\u2019estime que Mme Pichette a \u00e9t\u00e9 passablement cr\u00e9dible comme t\u00e9moin, et je trouve son t\u00e9moignage fiable, en particulier quant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019intention qui animait les parties lorsqu\u2019elles ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gories d\u2019individus ayant exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles aux termes du PE. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les observations \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00e9tant entendu que la plaignante a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse.\n[61] Mme Pichette a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la [TRADUCTION] \u00ab premi\u00e8re ligne de d\u00e9fense \u00bb des EM lorsqu\u2019ils se trouvaient aux prises avec une question ou un probl\u00e8me complexe consistait \u00e0 s\u2019adresser \u00e0 leur superviseur au sein de leur propre bureau r\u00e9gional (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, gestionnaire, chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe). Si la question \u00e9tait irr\u00e9solue, elle \u00e9tait relay\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019AC, puis envoy\u00e9e dans la bo\u00eete de r\u00e9ception \u00e9lectronique de demandes de renseignements g\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Division de la conception de programmes de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC. Cette division d\u00e9cidait qui \u00e9tait le mieux \u00e0 m\u00eame de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question (p. ex., DEM, Division des politiques, DDA, etc.). Mme McIlroy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la DDA recevait la majorit\u00e9 de ces demandes de renseignements. Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] Ces demandes de renseignements ne concernaient pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale, elles concernaient \u00ab Comment j\u2019applique la politique? Quand c\u2019est un demandeur tardif, comment je sais s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un fait nouveau? \u00bb Elles [les demandes de renseignements] concernaient des cas pr\u00e9cis, mais elles concernaient \u00ab Comment appliquons-nous la politique dans ce cas-ci? \u00bb \u2026 Ces cas ne se sont jamais adress\u00e9s \u00e0 notre division pour dire \u00ab Veuillez statuer sur ce cas pour nous \u00bb, c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00ab Nous avons une question \u00bb. Bien souvent, les cas sont la meilleure fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9montrer les lacunes dans les politiques.\n[62] Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 que les [TRADUCTION] \u00ab d\u00e9cisions \u00bb ne sont qu\u2019un volet de l\u2019ensemble du Programme de PIRPC; celui-ci comporte divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Mme Pichette a soulign\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le de la DDA consistait \u00e0 appliquer la jurisprudence et la loi \/ les r\u00e8glements dans le contexte de [TRADUCTION] \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9volution des politiques \u00bb en rapport avec les d\u00e9cisions et les appels. Un [TRADUCTION] \u00ab volet additionnel \u00bb du r\u00f4le de la DDA, mais non sa partie principale ou le r\u00f4le premier de la DDA, consistait \u00e0 donner des conseils d\u2019expert relatifs \u00e0 des cas pris individuellement dans le contexte de l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de demandes de PIRPC en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des questions envoy\u00e9es dans la bo\u00eete de r\u00e9ception \u00e9lectronique de demandes de renseignements.\n[63] Mme Pichette a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait examin\u00e9 110 postes dans le cadre de l\u2019exercice, mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, de conversion d\u2019emplois en emplois des cat\u00e9gories NU-EMA en 2011. Elle a travaill\u00e9 avec Nancy Lawand, sa pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure comme directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec la mani\u00e8re dont Mme McIlroy qualifie les conseils d\u2019expert qu\u2019elle donnait :\n[TRADUCTION] Nous \u00e9tions des experts dans le domaine des politiques relatives au Programme qui fournissaient cette expertise aux experts du Programme au sein de la DGSTP [AC], qui la traduisaient ensuite en outils et en lignes directrices et en documents de formation pour les premi\u00e8res lignes \u2026 les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux r\u00e9gionaux [relevant de Service Canada]\u2026 Mme McIlroy a dit hier qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les fonctions qu\u2019elle exer\u00e7ait \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles de son homologue Marjorie Martin de la DGSTP. Et elle a indiqu\u00e9 que le poste de Mme Martin \u2013 de niveau PM-05 \u2013 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 converti en un poste NU-EMA[-02]\u2026 Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec cela, et, chose importante, ma pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure, Nancy Lawand, qui \u00e9tait bien au fait des fonctions, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec cela, et Sharon Shanks, qui \u00e9tait la directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale responsable de la DGSTP, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec cela. Il y avait d\u2019importantes diff\u00e9rences entre le travail effectu\u00e9 au sein de la DGSTP et le travail effectu\u00e9 au sein de notre direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [SRDS, qui comprend la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC], et nous avons pris soin de nous assurer que les r\u00f4les correspondaient aux r\u00f4les qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus aux termes du Protocole d\u2019accord.\nDans un ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es similaire, Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 plus tard :\n[TRADUCTION] C\u2019\u00e9taient des conseils d\u2019expert aux experts qui les donnaient ensuite aux \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux. Et, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, par la bo\u00eete de demandes de renseignements, des demandes de renseignements nous parvenaient par l\u2019entremise de la DGSTP. La Division de la conception de programmes acheminait \u00e0 divers individus, et dans ces cas-l\u00e0, est-ce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une expertise donn\u00e9e directement \u00e0 des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux? Nous avons entendu hier que oui, et je ne le conteste pas.\n[64] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Pichette s\u2019ils envisageaient que la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE supposerait que les conseils \u00e9taient donn\u00e9s directement \u00e0 des EM, ou si ces conseils seraient [TRADUCTION] \u00ab filtr\u00e9s \u00bb avant de parvenir \u00e9ventuellement aux EM r\u00e9gionaux. Le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu :\n[TRADUCTION] \u00c0 mon avis, en tant que personne qui a travaill\u00e9 sur le Protocole d\u2019entente, ce n\u2019est pas ce qui \u00e9tait envisag\u00e9, et, en fait, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment pas envisag\u00e9. Il y a ce qui s\u2019appelle des experts fonctionnels \u00e0 Service Canada au sein de la DGSTP [AC] et dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux qui ont par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 convertis en postes NU-EMA-2 et cette mention concernait ces postes-l\u00e0\u2026 Dans le Protocole d\u2019entente, quand nous parlons de conseils d\u2019expert puis nous parlons de ceux qui supervisent directement, la raison \u00e0 cela est parce qu\u2019\u00e0 Service Canada, il y a deux types de postes qui pouvaient \u00eatre convertis en fin de compte\u2026 Les conseils d\u2019expert donn\u00e9s par le truchement d\u2019interm\u00e9diaires n\u2019\u00e9taient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme relevant du champ d\u2019application du Protocole d\u2019entente\u2026 Deux types de conseils d\u2019expert \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, un \u00e9tait les experts fonctionnels dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, alors les personnes-ressources \u00e0 qui les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux r\u00e9gionaux soumettraient des questions complexes ainsi que les gens comme Marjorie Martin qui \u00e9taient leur premier point de contact s\u2019ils ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me\u2026 Parfois, ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des superviseurs, et c\u2019est pourquoi vous avez la distinction entre ceux qui donnent des conseils d\u2019expert et ceux qui supervisent directement. Parce que, dans certains bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, les superviseurs \u00e9taient les experts et dans certains cas, ils \u00e9taient en dehors des t\u00e2ches de supervision.\n[65] Pour ce qui concerne la cat\u00e9gorie de ceux qui \u00ab supervisent directement ceux qui rendent des d\u00e9cisions et leur donnent des conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb, Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 que le gouvernement envisageait d\u2019inclure aux fins d\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 la suite du contentieux Walden les experts fonctionnels et les EM principaux (PM-05) qui supervisaient des EM (PM-04). Elle a affirm\u00e9 plus tard :\n[TRADUCTION] Et nous avons exclu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019expertise en mati\u00e8re de politiques parce qu\u2019il y avait des PM-05 qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux qui donnaient des conseils strat\u00e9giques \u00e0 Service Canada\u2026J\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 de pr\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019examen de l\u2019intention qui sous-tendait ces mots\u2026 L\u2019intention [qui sous-tendait la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb] \u00e9tait d\u2019inclure les experts fonctionnels et les chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe au sein de Service Canada dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et \u00e0 l\u2019AC\u2026 Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019inclure l\u2019expertise en mati\u00e8re de politiques que l\u2019on retrouvait au sein de ma direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [Programme de PIRPC]. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cens\u00e9 inclure cela. Si l\u2019on avait voulu inclure cela, l\u2019on se serait retrouv\u00e9 avec des individus qui occupaient des postes PM-05 qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des infirmiers qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9s\u2026\n[66] Elle a affirm\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si \u00eatre un infirmier autoris\u00e9 \u00e9tait un atout, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une exigence du poste. Le t\u00e9moin a affirm\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Le contexte de cela \u00e9tait pour les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et les plaignants et les non-plaignants qui \u00e9taient des infirmiers autoris\u00e9s. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas envisag\u00e9 que les conseils d\u2019expert incluraient une expertise plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mati\u00e8re de politiques ou de l\u00e9gislation. \u00bb Interpr\u00e9ter le PE autrement, selon elle, ferait que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC et peut-\u00eatre d\u2019autres secteurs du minist\u00e8re, comme des professionnels des ressources humaines et des conseillers juridiques, pourraient demander une indemnit\u00e9 puisqu\u2019eux aussi donnaient des \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb \u00e0 des EM.\n[67] Poursuivant sur le m\u00eame sujet, Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision susmentionn\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre r\u00e9flexion et apr\u00e8s des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab discussions \u00bb avec plusieurs personnes, dont des membres du personnel de direction au sein de la DGSTP, Mme Shanks et elle-m\u00eame. Ils ont estim\u00e9 que les conseils des PM-05 au sein de la DDA (comme Mme McIlroy et ses trois coll\u00e8gues PM-05) \u00e9taient des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab conseils strat\u00e9giques donn\u00e9s aux EM par le truchement d\u2019au moins un interm\u00e9diaire mais plus souvent de deux \u00bb.\n[68] J\u2019admets le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Pichette sur ce point. Mme McIlroy a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale lors de l\u2019audition de sa requ\u00eate, mais elle n\u2019avait aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter concernant l\u2019intention des parties au PE. Elle aurait pu faire t\u00e9moigner Me Armstrong ou Me Wellman, les avocats qui avaient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la vaste majorit\u00e9 des plaignants dans l\u2019instance Walden et qui avaient n\u00e9goci\u00e9 le PE pour leur compte, ou, tant qu\u2019\u00e0 y \u00eatre, les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui avaient n\u00e9goci\u00e9 le PE pour le compte de leur client. Il me para\u00eet clair que les parties au PE n\u2019entendaient pas inclure les fonctions exerc\u00e9es par les PM-05 au sein de la DDA, comme Mme McIlroy, dans les deux cat\u00e9gories \u00e9tendues de \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb vis\u00e9es au PE.\nB. La plaignante donnait-elle des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 des EM?\n[69] Le d\u00e9saccord sur ce point r\u00e9side essentiellement dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb, que le PE n\u2019a pas d\u00e9fini. Lorsque j\u2019examine le contexte du litige plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui sous-tend le PE, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb doit \u00eatre reli\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale de cas et ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\n[70] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par des EM et elles concernaient la reconnaissance de leurs fonctions par rapport aux fonctions exerc\u00e9es par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux. En examinant la similarit\u00e9 des fonctions exerc\u00e9es par les deux groupes, le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab la principale responsabilit\u00e9 et fonction des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux autant que des EM est l'utilisation de leur expertise et de leurs connaissances professionnelles pour d\u00e9terminer l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9tapes du processus et\/ou de pr\u00e9parer les dossiers pour les appels et de repr\u00e9senter le ministre lors des audiences \u00bb : d\u00e9cision concernant la responsabilit\u00e9, au paragraphe 68.\n[71] Le Tribunal a ensuite examin\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail les fonctions des deux groupes, et il a conclu ce qui suit aux paragraphes 69 \u00e0 72 :\nPr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, tant les conseillers que les \u00e9valuateurs ont assum\u00e9 les fonctions suivantes \u00e0 divers moments pendant les trois p\u00e9riodes d\u00e9crites dans la plainte :\nformuler des recommandations et prendre des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de demandes initiales dont le degr\u00e9 de complexit\u00e9 et de difficult\u00e9s en termes de questions m\u00e9dicales et juridiques varie;\nformuler des recommandations et prendre des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de demandes de r\u00e9examen qui ont aussi divers degr\u00e9s de complexit\u00e9 et de difficult\u00e9;\npr\u00e9parer les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision, qui a ensuite pris le nom de Tribunal de r\u00e9vision;\ndemander aux demandeurs ou \u00e0 d'autres personnes des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et non m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet de demandes de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC;\npr\u00e9parer un dossier pour la Commission d'appel des pensions;\npr\u00e9senter une offre de r\u00e8glement ou une recommandation de r\u00e8glement (sans obtenir d'approbation au pr\u00e9alable);\nparticiper aux activit\u00e9s de relation externes et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques.\nAu cours des trois p\u00e9riodes, le temps que les conseillers et les \u00e9valuateurs ont consacr\u00e9 aux fonctions qui se chevauchaient s'est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 d'un poste \u00e0 l'autre. Cependant, la preuve d\u00e9montre que, de 1972 \u00e0 1999, des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux avaient pour fonction principale la formulation de recommandations ou la prise de d\u00e9cisions finales au sujet de demandes initiales et de demandes de r\u00e9examen, ainsi que la pr\u00e9paration de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de dossiers pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision. Les t\u00e2ches portant sur les demandes initiales et les demandes de r\u00e9examen repr\u00e9sentent une grande partie du travail des conseillers et des \u00e9valuateurs puisque plus de 90 p. 100 de toutes les demandes sont tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 l'une de ces deux \u00e9tapes [\u2026]\nDepuis 1999, les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux dans les r\u00e9gions effectuent essentiellement le m\u00eame travail que les conseillers ont effectu\u00e9 de 1972 \u00e0 1999 : rendre une d\u00e9cision finale au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape initiale et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape du r\u00e9examen.\n[Italiques ajout\u00e9s.]\n[72] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la plaignante que le Tribunal a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 69(vii) que les activit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques \u00e9taient une des t\u00e2ches accomplies par les EM. Toutefois, lorsque cet alin\u00e9a est lu ensemble avec le reste des conclusions du Tribunal concernant les fonctions exerc\u00e9es par les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux et les EM qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la discrimination, il devient clair que les principales t\u00e2ches en cause \u00e9taient celles qui portaient sur les demandes initiales et les demandes de r\u00e9examen. Ce point de vue est \u00e9tay\u00e9 en outre par le libell\u00e9 de la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE, qui n\u2019emploie pas le terme \u00ab EM \u00bb mais vise plut\u00f4t les individus qui \u00ab rendent des d\u00e9cisions (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e9valuer des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC [\u2026] \u00bb. Le fait de rendre des d\u00e9cisions, combin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, est donc au c\u0153ur de la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb et, par cons\u00e9quent, est donc central \u00e0 l\u2019attribution d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019ordonnance du membre Jensen et du PE et des ordonnances subs\u00e9quentes sign\u00e9es par moi-m\u00eame. \u00c0 mon avis, les individus qui demandent une indemnit\u00e9 soit pour avoir \u00ab donn\u00e9 des conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb \u00e0 des EM ou pour avoir \u00ab directement supervis\u00e9 \u00bb des EM doivent d\u00e9montrer que leurs t\u00e2ches sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de ces fonctions d\u00e9cisionnelles m\u00e9dicales.\n[73] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019admets la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle les conseils d\u2019experts \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s englober les experts fonctionnels \/ chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe et les superviseurs des EM qui \u00e9taient le premier point de contact des EM et qui leur donnaient directement des conseils lorsqu\u2019ils rendaient des d\u00e9cisions, ainsi que les individus travaillant \u00e0 l\u2019AC de SC qui [TRADUCTION] \u00ab traduisaient \u00bb les conseils donn\u00e9s par la DDA directement aux EM. Le r\u00f4le principal ou premier de la plaignante au sein de la DDA \u00e9tait celui d\u2019experte en mati\u00e8re de politiques relatives au Programme qui donnait des conseils d\u2019expert aux experts du Programme au sein de la DGSTP. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation de Mme Pichette selon laquelle bon nombre des exemples de la plaignante illustraient du [TRADUCTION] \u00ab travail d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques relatives au Programme \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019intention d\u2019un vaste \u00e9ventail d\u2019auditoires, comme la haute direction, les services juridiques, d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues au sein de RHDCC (y compris au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC), etc., et non principalement aux EM. Par exemple, Mme McIlroy a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents \u00e9crits et a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de son travail ([TRADUCTION] \u00ab participant davantage de la nature de conseils d\u2019expert g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00bb) pour le Secr\u00e9tariat du Comit\u00e9 du contentieux. Elle pr\u00e9parait les ordres du jour, des documents d\u2019arri\u00e8re-plan et les dossiers de d\u00e9cision, en collaboration avec les Services juridiques et la DEM. Ce type de t\u00e2che, bien qu\u2019important, ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la cat\u00e9gorie de la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles du PE correspondant aux individus qui \u00ab donnent des conseils d\u2019expert [\u2026] \u00e0 ceux qui rendent des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb. Je dis cela en consid\u00e9ration de la nature de la t\u00e2che et des groupes \u00e0 l\u2019intention desquels elle \u00e9tait accomplie.\n[74] Je ne conteste pas que la plaignante poss\u00e9dait une expertise ni qu\u2019elle donnait des conseils d\u2019expert. Je ne doute pas qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une fonctionnaire exemplaire. Je ne conteste pas non plus que les politiques orientaient le travail de ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, je conclus que les conseils d\u2019expert strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que la plaignante a d\u00e9crits ne pr\u00e9sentent pas, pour la plupart, un lien assez fort avec les fonctions d\u00e9cisionnelles m\u00e9dicales exerc\u00e9es par les EM dans des cas pr\u00e9cis. Ce n\u2019est pas, \u00e0 mon avis, ce que les parties au PE entendaient inclure comme \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb donnant ouverture \u00e0 indemnisation.\n[75] Si je devais \u00e9tendre l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des conseils d\u2019expert de la mani\u00e8re que pr\u00e9conise la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que j\u2019ouvrirais la porte \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation d\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019autres individus travaillant dans divers secteurs de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC et de SC, ce qui ne correspond pas \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties au PE. Les responsables des ressources humaines ou les conseillers juridiques, par exemple, pourraient se pr\u00e9senter et faire valoir qu\u2019eux aussi \u00ab [donnaient] des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 ceux qui [rendaient] des d\u00e9cisions \u00bb. Je conviens que cela ne traduirait pas l\u2019intention des parties lorsqu\u2019elles ont conclu le PE.\n[76] Avec cette interpr\u00e9tation des conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, je note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu \u2013 \u00e0 juste titre selon moi \u2013 que la plaignante avait donn\u00e9 certains conseils d\u2019expert (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 des EM en rapport avec des dossiers relatifs \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis) au sens du PE en tant que PM-05 et PM-06 au sein de la DDA. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, bien que la plaignante ait donn\u00e9 ces conseils d\u2019expert \u00e0 des EM, il ne s\u2019agissait pas de la principale fonction aff\u00e9rente \u00e0 ses postes comme l\u2019exige le PE. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces conseils d\u2019expert ne donnent pas ouverture \u00e0 indemnisation en vertu du PE.\n[77] En examinant la nature pr\u00e9cise des t\u00e2ches de la plaignante pour d\u00e9terminer si ces fonctions admissibles ont pu constituer sa principale fonction d\u2019emploi, je note la position de la Commission. Je n\u2019ai pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, mais j\u2019ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites qui mettaient en garde contre le danger qu\u2019il y aurait \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab se fier uniquement aux titres de postes, aux renseignements relatifs \u00e0 la position actuelle du poste dans la hi\u00e9rarchie et aux donn\u00e9es salariales, qui peuvent eux-m\u00eames traduire des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes fond\u00e9s sur le sexe \u00bb. Je n\u2019ai pris aucune position quant \u00e0 savoir si la plaignante avait \u00e9tabli le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa demande d\u2019indemnisation. Je suis d\u2019accord avec les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Commission. Bien que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que je viens d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer soient des facteurs \u00e0 prendre en compte individuellement et ensemble, ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre les seuls facteurs pris en compte, et il ne faut pas y accorder trop d\u2019importance. Il convient plut\u00f4t d\u2019accorder une grande importance aux fonctions effectivement exerc\u00e9es par l\u2019employ\u00e9e. J\u2019estime que c\u2019est ce que RHDCC a fait, et j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 une importance primordiale \u00e0 ce facteur des fonctions effectivement exerc\u00e9es dans mes conclusions.\n[78] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note \u00e9galement la critique que la plaignante a dirig\u00e9e contre l\u2019utilisation de descriptions de postes par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer si un individu avait exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles. Compte tenu en outre du propre aveu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel ces descriptions n\u2019\u00e9taient souvent pas des descriptions exactes et \u00e0 jour des fonctions exerc\u00e9es et les descriptions de travail relatives aux postes de Mme McIlroy (les addendas en particulier) posaient des [TRADUCTION] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes \u00bb, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 peu de poids \u00e0 ces documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve et qui correspondaient suppos\u00e9ment aux postes de niveaux PM-05 et PM-06 de la plaignante. Mes conclusions concernant les t\u00e2ches de la plaignante et la question de savoir si donner des conseils d\u2019expert avait constitu\u00e9 la principale fonction aff\u00e9rente \u00e0 ses postes sont principalement fond\u00e9es sur la description que la plaignante elle-m\u00eame a faite des t\u00e2ches qu\u2019elle avait accomplies dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions d\u2019emploi, description que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[79] Sur le fondement de la description que la plaignante avait faite de ses fonctions de travail, je lui ai demand\u00e9 de fournir une estimation du pourcentage de son travail qui consistait \u00e0 donner des conseils d\u2019expert concernant des cas pr\u00e9cis par opposition \u00e0 des conseils d\u2019expert strat\u00e9giques plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La plaignante a estim\u00e9 que durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle avait travaill\u00e9 comme PM-05, soixante pour cent de son travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reli\u00e9 aux politiques et quarante pour cent de son travail avait port\u00e9 sur des cas pr\u00e9cis. Quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle elle avait travaill\u00e9 comme PM-06, elle a estim\u00e9 que quarante pour cent de son travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reli\u00e9 aux politiques et vingt pour cent de son travail avait port\u00e9 sur des cas pr\u00e9cis (et quarante pour cent de son travail avait consist\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00ab superviser directement \u00bb). J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la liste des t\u00e2ches \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans le dossier de requ\u00eate et recueil conjoint de documents (pi\u00e8ces produites) de la plaignante et d\u00e9crites durant son t\u00e9moignage, et je conclus que l\u2019estimation qu\u2019elle a fournie traduit de mani\u00e8re raisonnablement juste les fonctions qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9es durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse.\n[80] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les conseils d\u2019expert au sens du PE ne comprennent pas les conseils strat\u00e9giques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019estimation de la plaignante confirme que donner des conseils d\u2019expert ne constituait pas sa principale fonction d\u2019emploi. Toutefois, le sens du mot \u00ab principal \u00bb, que le PE ne d\u00e9finit pas non plus, est \u00e9galement en litige dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9finit ce terme comme signifiant cinquante pour cent ou plus, la plaignante soutient que le terme n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 au pourcentage de travail, mais devrait plut\u00f4t \u00eatre associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la t\u00e2che ou du travail accompli.\n[81] L\u2019Oxford Dictionary d\u00e9finit \u00ab primary \u00bb (\u00ab principal \u00bb) comme [TRADUCTION] \u00ab d\u2019importance primordiale; principal \u00bb. D\u2019autres dictionnaires attribuent des significations semblables \u00e0 celle de l\u2019Oxford aux mots \u00ab primary \u00bb (\u00ab principal \u00bb) et \u00ab primarily \u00bb (\u00ab principalement \u00bb). Les interpr\u00e9tations des deux parties s\u2019accordent avec cette d\u00e9finition \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019importance de la t\u00e2che accomplie, par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du travail de l\u2019individu et l\u2019importance de la t\u00e2che pour l\u2019organisation en cause, ainsi que le pourcentage de son temps de travail que l\u2019individu consacre \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement de cette t\u00e2che, aident \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si une t\u00e2che qui correspond \u00e0 des fonctions admissibles au sens du PE peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme correspondant \u00e0 la principale fonction d\u2019emploi de cet individu.\n[82] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, toutefois, la plaignante ne satisfait \u00e0 ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre des deux volets de ce crit\u00e8re. Elle n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas des fonctions admissibles pendant plus de cinquante pour cent de son temps de travail, et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant le r\u00f4le de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC (et de la DDA en particulier) et de SC en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019administration du Programme de PIRPC selon le PA n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la pr\u00e9tention de la plaignante selon laquelle ces fonctions touchant des cas pr\u00e9cis constituaient les fonctions les plus importantes de son emploi. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et comme le PA l\u2019indique clairement, il y a d\u2019importantes diff\u00e9rences entre la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS et la DGSTP de SC, et, bien qu\u2019il se puisse que des individus employ\u00e9s au sein de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la SRDS aient exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles en tant que principales fonctions aff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 leurs postes, la nature de ces diff\u00e9rences rend ces types de cas exceptionnels. C\u2019est \u00e0 cause de ces diff\u00e9rences que je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 utile \u00e0 la cause de la plaignante l\u2019examen des fonctions exerc\u00e9es par les autres PM-05 travaillant au sein de la DGSTP \u00e0 l\u2019AC, comme Mme Martin, dont la plaignante soutenait que les fonctions d\u2019emploi \u00e9taient semblables aux siennes. Mme Pichette, a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019avait affirm\u00e9 la plaignante dans son t\u00e9moignage et dans ses observations, Mme Pichette et Mme Lawand avaient conclu que Mme McIlroy et Mme Martin n\u2019exer\u00e7aient pas les m\u00eames fonctions : elles faisaient [TRADUCTION] \u00ab des choses diff\u00e9rentes \u00bb. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j\u2019ai admis les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9montrant que la nature des fonctions aff\u00e9rentes aux postes de ces individus les amenait principalement \u00e0 travailler directement avec les EM, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas de la plaignante.\n[83] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la plaignante n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 des conseils d\u2019expert au sens du PE durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse.\n[84] Les parties ont \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations concernant la question de savoir si la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles exigeait que le titulaire de poste soit un infirmier autoris\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que j\u2019interpr\u00e8te la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles comme posant cette exigence, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer son application aux individus qui donnent des conseils \u00e0 ceux qui rendent des d\u00e9cisions et qui supervisent ces derniers. Puisque j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que donner des conseils d\u2019expert relativement \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis ne constituait pas la principale fonction de l\u2019emploi de la plaignante et que les conseils strat\u00e9giques d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019elle donnait ne constituaient pas des \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb au sens du PE, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur la question de savoir si l\u2019utilisation des \u00ab connaissances associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e9tait une exigence du poste de la plaignante et des deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gories de fonctions admissibles vis\u00e9es au PE.\nC. Est-ce que la plaignante supervisait directement des EM?\n[85] La plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019elle avait supervis\u00e9 Mme Boland et Mme McGuire dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions comme PM-06, elle avait supervis\u00e9 directement des \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales au sens du PE et avait donc exerc\u00e9 des fonctions admissibles donnant ouverture \u00e0 indemnisation en vertu du PE.\n[86] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indemnis\u00e9 Mme Boland et Mme McGuire au titre des fonctions que celles\u00adci avaient exerc\u00e9es au sein de la DDA durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse. Pourquoi ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9es? L\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 le fait que ces individus n\u2019exer\u00e7aient pas des fonctions qui r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de fonctions admissibles, leurs titres de postes et leurs descriptions de postes comprenaient l\u2019\u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale et leurs postes d\u2019attache \u00e9taient des postes d\u2019\u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales au sein de la DEM. Comme je l\u2019ai dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la DEM est, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la seule division de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Programme de PIRPC au sein de laquelle il restait un petit nombre d\u2019EM qui faisaient du travail de soutien dans le cadre des dossiers d\u2019appel devant la CAP. Cela s\u2019accordait avec la pratique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 consistant \u00e0 indemniser, pour des raisons d\u2019ordre administratif\/logistique, les titulaires de postes d\u2019EM m\u00eame si, dans les faits, ils ne rendaient pas de d\u00e9cisions m\u00e9dicales.\n[87] Je note que le PE n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019un individu poss\u00e8de le titre d\u2019EM pour que ses fonctions soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des fonctions admissibles. Un individu doit plut\u00f4t d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il rend des d\u00e9cisions qui, selon le PE, consistent \u00e0 \u00ab \u00e9valuer des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux aux fins de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 en vertu du RPC et, dans l\u2019exercice de cette fonction, \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019utiliser les connaissances associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019infirmier autoris\u00e9 \u00bb. Lorsque ce crit\u00e8re est appliqu\u00e9 aux fonctions de Mme Boland et de Mme McGuire au sein de la DDA durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse, il appert que ces individus n\u2019exer\u00e7aient pas des fonctions admissibles. Comme la plaignante l\u2019a reconnu, ni Mme Boland ni Mme McGuire ne rendaient des d\u00e9cisions, ce qui constitue la principale fonction d\u2019emploi des EM. Leurs fonctions consistaient plut\u00f4t \u00e0 fournir des explications relativement aux cas port\u00e9s en appel devant le Tribunal de r\u00e9vision et \u00e0 faire des recommandations aux EM r\u00e9gionaux. Elles n\u2019avaient pas le pouvoir de statuer sur des cas ni de r\u00e9gler des cas.\n[88] La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019indemniser les individus dont le poste d\u2019attache \u00e9tait un poste d\u2019EM, peu importe qu\u2019ils aient rendu ou non des \u00ab d\u00e9cisions m\u00e9dicales \u00bb dans les faits, a men\u00e9 au paiement d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s \u00e0 des individus comme Mme Boland et Mme McGuire. Je note que le PE ne pr\u00e9voit pas ce type de sc\u00e9nario et qu\u2019il ne semble pas que les parties l\u2019aient envisag\u00e9 en dehors de ces exceptions. Puisque j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le PE, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019intention des parties, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit indiqu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tendre la pratique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019indemnisation aux individus qui, comme la plaignante, ont supervis\u00e9 Mme Boland et Mme McGuire. Naturellement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est libre de le faire de son propre gr\u00e9.\n[89] En outre, lorsqu\u2019il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 combien de son temps elle consacrait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de ces fonctions de supervision, la plaignante a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019en tant que PM-06, elle avait pass\u00e9 environ quarante pour cent de son temps \u00e0 superviser directement les deux \u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales, m\u00eame si elle avait \u00e9galement supervis\u00e9 d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s aux \u00e9poques o\u00f9 son directeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 absent. Par ailleurs, la plaignante passait quarante pour cent de son temps \u00e0 donner des conseils strat\u00e9giques plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, et environ vingt pour cent de son temps \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des demandes de renseignements propres \u00e0 des cas pr\u00e9cis ou \u00e0 aider les PM-05 de sa division \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces demandes de renseignements. Combin\u00e9 au r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la DDA et \u00e0 la nature des t\u00e2ches des PM-04 et des PM-05 que la plaignante supervisait, cette estimation d\u00e9montre encore une fois que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas pour principale fonction d\u2019emploi de superviser directement ceux qui rendaient des d\u00e9cisions ni de leur donner des conseils d\u2019expert.\n[90] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la plaignante ne supervisait pas directement des EM comme l\u2019exige la d\u00e9finition des fonctions admissibles \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au PE.\nVII. Conclusion\n[91] Je sais que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision d\u00e9cevra Mme McIlroy. Mes conclusions et mes commentaires ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme un d\u00e9nigrement ou une d\u00e9consid\u00e9ration de son d\u00e9vouement et de son travail comme ancienne fonctionnaire.\nSign\u00e9 par\nMatthew D.

Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019explication de Mme McIlroy \u00e0 ce sujet : [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [\u2026] bien que la DGSTP couvre aussi bien les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux que l\u2019AC, les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux sont habituellement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par le nom de la r\u00e9gion; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, la R\u00e9gion de l\u2019Atlantique et non la DGSTP de la R\u00e9gion de l\u2019Atlantique, tandis que la DGSTP \u00e0 l\u2019AC peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e soit comme la DGSTP ou simplement comme l\u2019AC d\u00e9pendant du contexte. \u00bb\n[3] Mme Pichette a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019un seul individu de la DDA, un responsable principal de projet, avait re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 pour avoir donn\u00e9 des \u00ab conseils d\u2019expert \u00bb vis\u00e9s au PE durant la p\u00e9riode litigieuse et pour seulement deux mois en raison de \u00ab circonstances pr\u00e9cises \u00bb qu\u2019elle a expliqu\u00e9es.\n[4] Bien que cela n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a prononc\u00e9 de telles ordonnances au profit de \u00ab victimes \u00bb non plaignantes dans d\u2019autres affaires : Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c.

Contexte\n[1] Par voie de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 9 mars 2015, le plaignant demande la radiation des paragraphes 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 27, 29, 32, 37 et 41 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2015, au motif que [traduction] \u00ab ces paragraphes concernent des questions qui ne sont pas du ressort du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) ou qui n\u2019ont absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate \u00bb.\n[2] Le plaignant prie \u00e9galement le Tribunal de prononcer une ordonnance semblable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) dat\u00e9 du 23 janvier 2015, mais cette demande est d\u00e9sormais d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat puisque la Commission a retir\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et que, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 8 mai 2015, elle a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019elle ne prendrait plus pleinement part \u00e0 l\u2019instance. La Commission n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et ne compara\u00eetra pas lors de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[3] Les plaintes en question, dat\u00e9es du 30 mars 2012, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 4 avril 2012. Le 1er octobre 2013, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de les instruire ensemble, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[4] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes au nom de trois victimes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es (dont l\u2019une d\u2019elles est sa conjointe) qui ont consenti \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019occupe de faire les plaintes et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il les repr\u00e9sente. Les trois victimes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es sont des Indiens inscrits au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens (la Loi).\n[5] Dans les plaintes qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dat\u00e9 du 4 janvier 2015, le plaignant all\u00e8ge que, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 d\u2019inscrire (ou de consigner) au registre des terres de r\u00e9serve indienne, que le registraire des terres indiennes est charg\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme le pr\u00e9voit la Loi, certains documents constatant des op\u00e9rations ayant eu lieu entre les trois victimes \u2013 \u00e0 savoir les baux des lots 170-1 et 175 sur la r\u00e9serve indienne d\u2019Okanagan no 1, en Colombie\u2011Britannique, et une cession de bail pour le lot 175. Il affirme que l\u2019inscription (ou la consignation) de ces documents au registre des terres de r\u00e9serve est un service que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir obligatoirement, et ce, sans \u00e9tablir de distinctions, d\u00e8s la soumission des documents au registraire des terres indiennes. Il affirme que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi, compte tenu des politiques et pratiques administratives concernant le Syst\u00e8me de registre des terres indiennes publi\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans son Guide du Registre des terres indiennes, n\u2019autorisait pas le registraire des terres indiennes \u00e0 refuser d\u2019inscrire (ou de consigner) au registre des terres de r\u00e9serve indienne les documents qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nRegistre\n21. Il doit \u00eatre tenu au minist\u00e8re un registre, connu sous le nom de Registre des terres de r\u00e9serve, o\u00f9 sont inscrits les d\u00e9tails concernant les certificats de possession et certificats d\u2019occupation et les autres op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres situ\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9serve.\n[6] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9, entre le 29 juillet 2011 et le 30 septembre 2013, d\u2019inscrire (ou de consigner) ces documents au registre des terres de r\u00e9serve indienne, constitue une violation de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a priv\u00e9 d\u2019un service destin\u00e9 au public et l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture du service pour un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP \u2013 \u00e0 savoir la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[7] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 rejette les all\u00e9gations du plaignant. Il souligne qu\u2019\u00e0 moins d\u2019une cession (ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) les terres d\u2019une r\u00e9serve demeurent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne, comme le pr\u00e9voient les paragraphes 2(1) et 18(1) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que, pour que les terres puissent \u00eatre lou\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le ministre, agissant au nom de la Couronne, doit \u00eatre le donneur \u00e0 bail, comme le prescrit le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi. Les baux en question n\u2019incluaient pas le ministre et, pour cette raison, au dire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ils ne sont pas des documents valides en droit et ne peuvent donc pas \u00eatre inscrits au registre dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils ne constituent pas des \u00ab op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres situ\u00e9es dans une r\u00e9serve \u00bb, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 21 de la Loi.\n58(3). Location \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019occupant \u2013 Le ministre peut louer au profit de tout Indien, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, la terre dont ce dernier est en possession l\u00e9gitime sans que celle-ci soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 avance que la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce vise en fait \u00e0 contester un texte de loi : l\u2019article 21 de la Loi doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 en tenant compte, dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, du paragraphe 58(3) et de l\u2019exigence selon laquelle le ministre doit \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le donneur \u00e0 bail. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019\u00e0 moins de modifications \u00e0 la Loi il ne peut \u00e9carter le paragraphe 58(3) et doit refuser d\u2019inscrire les documents qui, selon lui, sont invalides si le ministre n\u2019est pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le donneur \u00e0 bail. En adoptant cette position dans sa d\u00e9fense, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il suit le principe appliqu\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [traduction] \u00ab dans Murphy, selon lequel une contestation mettant en cause des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pr\u00e9cises \u00e9chappe au champ d\u2019application de la LCDP si elle vise ces dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en soi et rien d\u2019autre \u00bb : voir Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Agence du revenu), 2012 CAF 7 (Murphy).\n[9] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse dat\u00e9e du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2015, le plaignant nie que les plaintes visent directement la Loi. Il avance plut\u00f4t qu\u2019elles ne visent : i) [traduction] \u00ab rien de plus que l\u2019application de l\u2019article 21 de la Loi sur les Indiens, tel qu\u2019il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9, \u00bb et que ii) le [traduction] \u00ab sens ordinaire et l\u2019objet tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 21 ne sont influenc\u00e9s de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit par d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens [\u2026] \u00bb. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t la position [traduction] \u00ab adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui soul\u00e8ve une question de comp\u00e9tence par application de la d\u00e9cision Murphy, et c\u2019est plut\u00f4t l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui, par son refus d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 21, tel qu\u2019il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9, conteste la loi. Cela soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si le plaignant lui\u2011m\u00eame est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019appuyer sur les principes d\u00e9gag\u00e9s par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy et appliqu\u00e9s par le Tribunal \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens dans les affaires Matson et Andrews \u00bb, pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019intim\u00e9 de contester le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 21 (voir Matson et al. c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 13, Andrews et al. c. Affaires indiennes et Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 21, conf. par Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CF 398).\nII. Requ\u00eate en radiation\n[10] Concernant la requ\u00eate, le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont tous deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations ax\u00e9es sur le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews selon lequel un texte de loi ne peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 directement en vertu de la LCDP. Selon le plaignant, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi est un service destin\u00e9 au public qui doit \u00eatre fourni sans \u00e9tablir de distinctions et qui rend obligatoire l\u2019inscription des documents constatant des op\u00e9rations relatives aux terres intervenues entre des Indiens inscrits, sans renvoi \u00e0 d\u2019autres conditions ou dispositions de la Loi. Le plaignant soutient que, suivant le sens ordinaire du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 21, le registraire des terres indiennes avait l\u2019obligation d\u2019inscrire les documents soumis en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sans s\u2019interroger quant \u00e0 savoir si les op\u00e9rations d\u00e9crites dans ces documents \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab valides en droit \u00bb en raison d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi qui, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 21. Pour le plaignant, le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews comme moyen de d\u00e9fense est d\u00e9pourvu de pertinence et outrepasse la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, car sa cause se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019application, et non \u00e0 une contestation, d\u2019un texte de loi obligatoire \u2013 \u00e0 savoir l\u2019article 21. En cons\u00e9quence, le plaignant prie le Tribunal de radier de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les paragraphes qui, selon lui, invoquent ce principe.\n[11] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019article 21 de la Loi fait partie d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif qui ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment des autres dispositions de la Loi. Pour bien interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 21, il faut le lire avec les autres dispositions de la Loi, y compris le paragraphe 58(3). Le service offert au public est le processus d\u2019inscription complet qui comprend l\u2019\u00e9tape d\u2019inscription d\u00e9taill\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 21. Ce service ne se limite pas \u00e0 la seule \u00e9tape de l\u2019inscription. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que ce processus est pr\u00e9vu par une loi d\u2019application obligatoire \u00e0 laquelle le registraire des terres indiennes ne peut se soustraire. S\u2019il inscrivait, en vertu de l\u2019article 21, des documents dont la validit\u00e9 est entach\u00e9e par l\u2019application d\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi, le registraire enfreindrait la loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que les plaintes visent \u00e0 contester un texte de loi obligatoire et rien d\u2019autre; il invoque \u00e0 l\u2019appui le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews comme moyen de d\u00e9fense principal et l\u00e9gitime. La th\u00e8se selon laquelle interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 21 sans tenir compte des autres dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens est une erreur ne constitue pas une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument du plaignant, le principe d\u00e9gag\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient de plus que, compte tenu de ce principe, si le plaignant souhaite contester le processus l\u00e9gislatif, en invoquant un motif discriminatoire, il doit le faire devant une cour de justice dans le cadre d\u2019une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, puisque le texte de loi en question est obligatoire et ne peut \u00eatre chang\u00e9 que par une modification l\u00e9gislative, et non par une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nIII. Question en litige\n[12] Le Tribunal devrait-il radier les paragraphes en question de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, comme le demande le plaignant?\nIV. Cadre l\u00e9gislatif r\u00e9gissant les requ\u00eates en radiation de pr\u00e9cisions\n[13] Il incombe au plaignant, en tant que partie requ\u00e9rante, de convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019il devrait faire droit \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate en radiation et emp\u00eacher l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, de soulever l\u2019argument selon lequel le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur les plaintes parce qu\u2019elles constituent une contestation directe du texte de loi, compte tenu des d\u00e9cisions Murphy, Matson et Andrews.\n[14] Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure (alin\u00e9a 50(3)e) de la LCDP), et il peut rejeter des parties d\u2019une plainte lorsqu\u2019il juge qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de le faire. Toutefois, lorsqu\u2019on lui demande de le faire \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire sans la tenue d\u2019une audience, le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire avec prudence et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs : Buffet c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 39. Voir aussi Desmarais c. Services correctionnels du Canada, 2014 TCDP 5, aux paragraphes 82 \u00e0 84.\n[15] La LCDP pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9j\u00e0 une fonction d\u2019examen, dont la Commission est charg\u00e9e, et le Tribunal a l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de donner aux parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte (paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP). Le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement rendre sa d\u00e9cision en se conformant aux r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Voir Buffet aux paragraphes 38 \u00e0 40; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (FNCFCS), conf. par Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2013 CAF 75, aux paragraphes 125, 131, 32 et 140.\n[16] Le Tribunal doit soupeser ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il doit faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant.\nV. Analyse\n[17] Il appara\u00eet clairement que le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont adopt\u00e9 des positions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es dans leurs observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au sujet d\u2019une question fondamentale dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Le fait que les parties ont toutes les deux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments sur le fond de cette question, au lieu de la requ\u00eate en radiation, indique bien la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat oral sur ce point. Le plaignant ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019il serait juste, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, sans la tenue d\u2019une audience, de radier les paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui sont vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate : ils constituent un moyen de d\u00e9fense important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019il vaudrait la peine d\u2019entendre. Radier les paragraphes en question priverait, \u00e0 mon avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\nVI. Ordonnance\n[18] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, la requ\u00eate du plaignant est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P. Lustig\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n23 juin 2015",

Confidentialit\u00e9\n[1] Au cours d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (la CTGI) tenue le 6 octobre 2014, j\u2019ai rendu une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyant ce qui suit :\n[traduction] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate soulevant des questions au sujet du processus de r\u00e8glement confidentiel, j\u2019ordonne, en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, que la pr\u00e9sente conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance et tous les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce depuis l\u2019avis de r\u00e8glement soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels.\nJ\u2019ordonne en outre que les parties ne divulguent aucun document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u, sauf dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire demand\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Tous les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ainsi que l\u2019enregistrement de la pr\u00e9sente conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique seront trait\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels par le Tribunal. Il est particuli\u00e8rement important de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Aucune partie ne doit divulguer cette entente ni son contenu \u00e0 quiconque, sauf si elle a obtenu au pr\u00e9alable la permission du Tribunal.\n[2] Compte tenu de cette ordonnance qui visait \u00e0 maintenir la confidentialit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du r\u00e8glement, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision n\u2019approfondira pas les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019affaire, sauf dans la mesure n\u00e9cessaire pour statuer sur la requ\u00eate. Le proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du r\u00e8glement demeure scell\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\n[3] La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) par le plaignant, Douglas George Cawson, le 19 octobre 2011. Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte, en vertu de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le moment, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, que le Tribunal \u00e9tudie \u00e0 fond les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte sous\u2011jacente. Avant qu\u2019une instruction ait lieu, l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par les parties au moyen du processus de m\u00e9diation volontaire du Tribunal.\n[4] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision concerne une requ\u00eate par laquelle le plaignant sollicite une ordonnance de r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019affaire. Au soutien de sa requ\u00eate, le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il y a eu violation de contrat relativement \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal du r\u00e8glement (l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement) et qu\u2019il a subi des pressions ou a fait l\u2019objet de contrainte pendant le processus de m\u00e9diation.\n[5] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011dessous, je rejette la requ\u00eate du plaignant.\nII. Contexte et r\u00e9sum\u00e9\n[6] Le 23 juillet 2013, le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Commission ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un processus de m\u00e9diation. La m\u00e9diation a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un membre du Tribunal qui agissait comme m\u00e9diateur.\n[7] L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par toutes les parties au terme de la m\u00e9diation.\n[8] L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement obligeait l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 verser des montants particuliers au plaignant, une fois que les parties auraient re\u00e7u la confirmation \u00e9crite de la Commission attestant qu\u2019elle approuvait le r\u00e8glement, dans un d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 compter de cette date.\n[9] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 30 ao\u00fbt 2013 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 5 septembre suivant, la Commission a inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e. La copie de cette entente d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le cadre la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate indique que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e et approuv\u00e9e par la Commission le 14 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[10] Le 6 septembre 2013, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour leur faire savoir qu\u2019il allait fermer son dossier \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission.\n[11] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e des 1er et 2 octobre 2013 (remarque : le plaignant a \u00e9crit deux lettres, une dat\u00e9e du 1er octobre 2013 et l\u2019autre, dont la num\u00e9rotation faisait suite \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re lettre, du 2 octobre 2013), le plaignant a \u00e9crit au Tribunal que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas envoy\u00e9 les sommes d\u2019argent qu\u2019elle devait payer dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Le plaignant all\u00e9guait qu\u2019il y avait eu violation du contrat, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement, qu\u2019il avait le sentiment que le m\u00e9diateur avait un parti pris et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait dormi que trois heures la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la m\u00e9diation, ce qui avait eu un effet sur lui pendant le processus de m\u00e9diation. De plus, la lettre traitait de mani\u00e8re approfondie du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il aimerait que son dossier soit rouvert. Cette lettre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la Commission.\n[12] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 novembre 2013 qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, le plaignant all\u00e9guait qu\u2019il avait l\u2019impression de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme il l\u2019aurait pu par le m\u00e9diateur et qu\u2019il avait le sentiment que celui\u2011ci \u00e9tait favorable aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau que lui et sa femme avaient tr\u00e8s peu dormi la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la m\u00e9diation. Le plaignant a aussi d\u00e9crit la mani\u00e8re dont il se sentait \u00e0 cause de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement et du processus de m\u00e9diation. Il a \u00e0 nouveau fait des assertions et mis de l\u2019avant des arguments concernant le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Enfin, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait encaiss\u00e9 le premier ch\u00e8que qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais pas le deuxi\u00e8me parce que celui\u2011ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 en retard et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab content lorsque le deuxi\u00e8me ch\u00e8que d\u2019Air Canada \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 en retard parce cela me donnait l\u2019occasion de dire ce que je pensais de la d\u00e9cision que j\u2019avais obtenue \u2013 en ce qui concerne ma s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. Ils ont fait une gaffe. Tant mieux pour moi, j\u2019esp\u00e8re. \u00bb Enfin, le plaignant a dit qu\u2019il aimerait avoir une autre chance de faire valoir son point de vue dans le cadre d\u2019une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation ou d\u2019une audience. Cette lettre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la Commission.\n[13] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au Tribunal qu\u2019il aimerait d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture de son dossier. C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que le plaignant avisait le Tribunal qu\u2019il allait d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate. Le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau qu\u2019il avait l\u2019impression de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e9quitablement par le m\u00e9diateur et il a d\u00e9crit comment il se sentait \u00e0 cause du processus. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 certaines des all\u00e9gations contenues dans ses lettres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et a d\u00e9fendu encore une fois le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de ses plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait encaiss\u00e9 le premier ch\u00e8que envoy\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement, car ce ch\u00e8que repr\u00e9sentait [traduction] \u00ab les d\u00e9penses que j\u2019avais encourues, etc., jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience de m\u00e9diation \u00bb.\n[14] Le registraire du Tribunal a, par la suite, transmis une copie de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant, dat\u00e9 du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2014, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la Commission. Le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli avec toutes les parties un calendrier des dates de d\u00e9p\u00f4t des observations en r\u00e9ponse.\n[15] Dans les observations qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse le 17 mars 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 la requ\u00eate du plaignant pour diverses raisons, notamment le fait que le processus de m\u00e9diation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi, qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement valide avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, que les conditions du r\u00e8glement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es, que le Tribunal \u00e9tait functus officio et que le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019un r\u00e8glement devait l\u2019emporter \u2013 en d\u2019autres termes, que la confirmation de la validit\u00e9 des conditions d\u2019un r\u00e8glement convenu par les parties r\u00e9pond \u00e0 un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.\n[16] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses observations en r\u00e9ponse le 27 mars 2014. Dans ses observations, il a d\u00e9crit de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9taill\u00e9e la teneur de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. De plus, il affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas peur, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait simplement nerveux et n\u2019avait pas beaucoup dormi la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la m\u00e9diation. Il soutient que le m\u00e9diateur \u00e9tait partial parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait peut\u2011\u00eatre d\u00e9j\u00e0 intervenu dans des cas int\u00e9ressant l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas content de l\u2019issue de la m\u00e9diation et qu\u2019il avait assimil\u00e9 le processus de n\u00e9gociation men\u00e9 dans le cadre de la m\u00e9diation \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations semblables qui surviennent lorsqu\u2019une personne ach\u00e8te une voiture.\n[17] La Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal et toutes les parties qu\u2019elle ne d\u00e9poserait pas d\u2019observations relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[18] Le 6 octobre 2014, une CTGI a r\u00e9uni toutes les parties. Un certain nombre de questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es, notamment le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et la transmission \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e des communications que le plaignant avait eues avant le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2014. Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les lettres datant d\u2019avant f\u00e9vrier 2014, puis de d\u00e9poser des observations additionnelles.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations additionnelles le 29 octobre 2014. Dans ces observations, elle faisait notamment valoir que le plaignant avait mal calcul\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement dans lesquels elle devait remplir ses obligations, que le plaignant ne pouvait pas accepter une partie de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement puis pr\u00e9tendre maintenant que celle\u2011ci est nulle, et que le plaignant ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9 de son fardeau de prouver la contrainte.\nIII. Analyse et constatations\n[20] Je dois trancher les questions suivantes :\nA) Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux ententes de r\u00e8glement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP?\nSi le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence :\nB) De la contrainte a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e au point o\u00f9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e?\nC) L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 entra\u00eener sa nullit\u00e9?\nA. Comp\u00e9tence du tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux ententes de r\u00e8glement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP\n[21] Dans ses observations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e remet en cause la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour trancher les questions soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant. Elle soutient que le Tribunal est functus officio puisqu\u2019il a ferm\u00e9 son dossier apr\u00e8s que la Commission a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, j\u2019estime que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux ententes de r\u00e8glement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP.\n[22] Le r\u00f4le confi\u00e9 au Tribunal par la LCDP consiste \u00e0 instruire les plaintes qui lui sont renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission (par. 49(2) et art. 50) et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une plainte est fond\u00e9e ou non (art. 53). Contrairement \u00e0 la Commission (voir l\u2019art. 47), le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le mandat l\u00e9gal explicite de mener une m\u00e9diation. Il offre plut\u00f4t aux parties de participer \u00e0 un processus de m\u00e9diation sur une base volontaire et informelle. Cela \u00e9tant dit, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s utile d\u2019offrir la m\u00e9diation aux parties. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019expertise et \u00e0 la connaissance en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du membre du Tribunal qui agit comme m\u00e9diateur, les parties peuvent explorer les possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e8glement qui permettront de r\u00e9gler une plainte \u00e0 leur satisfaction, tout en \u00e9conomisant le temps, les efforts et le co\u00fbt qu\u2019exige des deux parties et du Tribunal la tenue d\u2019une audience. Si une affaire n\u2019est pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation peut tout de m\u00eame servir \u00e0 circonscrire les questions en litige ou \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre des questions de proc\u00e9dure. Dans l\u2019ensemble, la m\u00e9diation est un outil important dont le Tribunal se sert pour g\u00e9rer sa charge de travail et pour r\u00e9gler sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (voir le par. 48.9(1)).\n[23] Bien que le Tribunal n\u2019ait pas, en vertu de la loi, le mandat explicite de mener des m\u00e9diations, la LCDP pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement soit conclu avant l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal :\n48. (1) Les parties qui conviennent d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, mais avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience d\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne, en pr\u00e9sentent les conditions \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission.\n(2) Dans le cas pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission certifie sa d\u00e9cision et la communique aux parties.\n(3) Le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie ou de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de cette juridiction et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle.\n[24] Sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 48 de la LCDP, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019approuver les conditions d\u2019un r\u00e8glement a pour effet de mettre un terme \u00e0 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette plainte. De plus, cette d\u00e9cision est susceptible de contr\u00f4le juduciaire (voir, par exemple, Johnson c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CF 1021). Le paragraphe 48(3) pr\u00e9voit aussi que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peut r\u00e9soudre les diff\u00e9rends concernant les ententes de r\u00e8glement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par la Commission. J\u2019estime donc que, lorsqu\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019a plus comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne faisant l\u2019objet du r\u00e8glement, ni pour traiter les diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e0 cette entente.\n[25] Je mentionne en outre que la volont\u00e9 des parties de participer au processus de m\u00e9diation avec le Tribunal peut \u00eatre compromise si les parties qui ont conclu un r\u00e8glement relativement \u00e0 leur plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 se manifester, apr\u00e8s l\u2019approbation du r\u00e8glement soumis \u00e0 la Commission, et \u00e0 tenter de poursuivre leur plainte maintenant r\u00e9gl\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Je souscris au passage suivant tir\u00e9 de Nolan c Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, 2014 HRTO 1604, au paragraphe 43 :\n[traduction] [\u2026] Lorsque deux parties conviennent de r\u00e9gler un diff\u00e9rend juridique, le principe du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances exige que le contrat prenne effet et emp\u00eache les parties de d\u00e9battre de questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019existe des raisons imp\u00e9rieuses d\u2019annuler le contrat. La plupart des litiges aboutissent \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement et presque tous les r\u00e8glements renferment une disposition par laquelle le plaignant d\u00e9gage enti\u00e8rement l\u2019intim\u00e9 de toute r\u00e9clamation \u00e9ventuelle relative \u00e0 l\u2019objet du r\u00e8glement. Il faut que les r\u00e8glements soient d\u00e9finitifs pour \u00eatre efficaces, sinon rien n\u2019inciterait les parties \u00e0 conclure des r\u00e8glements pour mettre fin \u00e0 leur litige. [\u2026]\n[26] Ce paragraphe de la d\u00e9cision Nolan traitait de la question de savoir si une demande de r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une affaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9voyait une d\u00e9charge compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9finitive constituait un abus de proc\u00e9dure, mais j\u2019estime qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre bien \u00e9galement \u00e0 quel point il est important que les tribunaux et les cours de justice confirment le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des ententes de r\u00e8glement lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison imp\u00e9rieuse de les annuler.\n[27] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune question concernant la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 la suite de la m\u00e9diation avec le Tribunal. La Commission a alors examin\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d\u2019approuver le r\u00e8glement. Si le plaignant est d\u2019avis que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement soul\u00e8ve des probl\u00e8mes ou, subsidiairement, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite faire ex\u00e9cuter celle\u2011ci, ils sont libres de faire appel \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme le pr\u00e9voit la LCDP.\n[28] Bien qu\u2019il y ait des affaires o\u00f9 la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux administratifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des diff\u00e9rends relatifs \u00e0 une entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue (voir, par exemple, Amos c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CAF 38), je crois que le cas du Tribunal est diff\u00e9rent en raison du r\u00e9gime particulier de la LCDP (en particulier l\u2019art. 48).\n[29] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, je ne crois pas que le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour traiter les affaires soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant relativement \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[30] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne reconnais pas que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue sous l\u2019effet de la contrainte ou que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a viol\u00e9 les conditions de cette entente, comme je l\u2019expliquerai dans les pages qui suivent.\nB. De la contrainte a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e au point o\u00f9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e?\n[31] Les parties ont conclu une entente de r\u00e8glement sous la supervision d\u2019un membre du Tribunal. La Commission \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un sp\u00e9cialiste du MARC lors de la m\u00e9diation. Celle\u2011ci et la signature de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement sont survenues le 23 juillet 2013.\n[32] Le plaignant indique dans les lettres qu\u2019il a adress\u00e9es au Tribunal et dans sa requ\u00eate qu\u2019il avait le sentiment que le m\u00e9diateur avait un parti pris et qu\u2019il ne le repr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e9quitablement. Il a indiqu\u00e9 aussi qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas peur, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait simplement nerveux et avait dormi seulement trois heures la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la m\u00e9diation, ce qui a eu un effet sur lui pendant la s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation. Il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas content du r\u00e9sultat.\n[33] En ce qui concerne d\u2019abord le r\u00f4le du m\u00e9diateur, les Proc\u00e9dures de m\u00e9diation \u00e9valuative du Tribunal indiquent clairement que le r\u00f4le d\u2019un m\u00e9diateur du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 favoriser la conclusion d\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement par les parties. Ces proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remises \u00e0 toutes les parties avant la m\u00e9diation. On y explique tr\u00e8s clairement que le m\u00e9diateur du Tribunal ne repr\u00e9sente pas les parties en plus d\u2019y indiquer que les parties qui ne sont pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es disposent de sept jours \u00e0 compter de la signature de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement pour obtenir des conseils juridiques ou pour se retirer de l\u2019entente. Le r\u00f4le du m\u00e9diateur consiste \u00e0 faciliter les discussions en vue d\u2019un r\u00e8glement, non de donner des conseils juridiques aux parties. Le m\u00e9diateur et le Tribunal n\u2019ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel dans l\u2019issue de la m\u00e9diation et le m\u00e9diateur n\u2019est pas un repr\u00e9sentant, juriste ou non-juriste, de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties. Toutes les parties sont inform\u00e9es du fait que le m\u00e9diateur n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019imposer un r\u00e8glement ou les conditions d\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement. Au bout du compte, le plaignant avait la possibilit\u00e9 de ne pas se pr\u00e9valoir de la m\u00e9diation et de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une audience. Le plaignant ne mentionne nulle part dans ses documents qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit en erreur quant au r\u00f4le du m\u00e9diateur.\n[34] Le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019un conseiller juridique lors de la m\u00e9diation le 23 juillet 2013, mais de sa femme. Il n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 dans ses documents s\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 des conseils juridiques apr\u00e8s cette date ou non. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal la premi\u00e8re fois afin de se retirer de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement les 1er et 2 octobre 2013, soit bien apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9flexion de sept jours accord\u00e9e aux parties qui ne sont pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors des s\u00e9ances de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal.\n[35] Cela \u00e9tant dit, je dois encore d\u00e9cider si les \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus au cours de la m\u00e9diation \u00e9quivalaient \u00e0 de la contrainte. Le crit\u00e8re juridique a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019affaire Taber c Paris Boutique & Bridal Inc, 2010 ONCA 157, qui indique, au paragraphe 9, au sujet de la contrainte pouvant faire en sorte qu\u2019une entente devient inex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une partie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de la conclure :\n[traduction] Or, ce ne sont pas toutes les formes de pression, \u00e9conomique ou autre, qui constituent de la contrainte \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 tel que cela entra\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences sur le plan juridique. Deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents : ce doit \u00eatre une forme de pression que la loi consid\u00e8re comme ill\u00e9gale, et elle doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e dans une mesure telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une \u00ab coercition exerc\u00e9e sur la volont\u00e9 \u00bb de la partie qui invoque ce concept.\n[36] Rien dans les documents du plaignant ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet de pressions ill\u00e9gales pour le forcer \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend ou pour accepter l\u2019entente offerte ou n\u00e9goci\u00e9e avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ou qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune solution de rechange. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait peut\u2011\u00eatre pas en pleine forme ou il se sentait peut\u2011\u00eatre fatigu\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du manque de sommeil, et il \u00e9tait fort probablement nerveux comme c\u2019est le cas de bon nombre de parties, qu\u2019elles soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ou non. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de pressions ill\u00e9gales.\n[37] La m\u00e9diation est un processus qui vise \u00e0 encourager les parties \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 leurs options et, parfois, \u00e0 effectuer une analyse co\u00fbts\u2011b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de ce qui est dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat. Un m\u00e9diateur peut, afin d\u2019aider une partie \u00e0 examiner son plan d\u2019action, tenir compte de facteurs comme les points forts et les points faibles de la th\u00e8se du plaignant, la p\u00e9riode de temps pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019audience et le stress pouvant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ressenti tout au long du processus jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue. Faire ressortir ces facteurs n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 une coercition exerc\u00e9e sur la volont\u00e9 dans une mesure telle que le plaignant n\u2019a d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019accepter un r\u00e8glement. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire du m\u00e9diateur ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme si une personne \u00e9tait sous l\u2019effet d\u2019une contrainte ill\u00e9gale. En fait, lorsque le processus de m\u00e9diation est men\u00e9 par des membres du Tribunal, une partie a l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre parler des forces, des faiblesses et des d\u00e9fis que pr\u00e9sente sa th\u00e8se par un membre qui conna\u00eet bien la jurisprudence du Tribunal, ce qui peut l\u2019aider \u00e0 prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e9clair\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de faire valoir son point de vue. Une partie peut trouver difficile d\u2019entendre une opinion sur son dossier, en particulier si les faiblesses sont plus nombreuses que les forces; au bout du compte, la partie a toujours le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de faire instruire sa plainte.\n[38] Il faut noter que, selon les Proc\u00e9dures de m\u00e9diation \u00e9valuative du Tribunal, le membre qui joue le r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur n\u2019est pas celui qui pr\u00e9side l\u2019audience dans la plupart des cas. Ce n\u2019est que dans les cas o\u00f9 toutes les parties donnent leur consentement que le membre du Tribunal qui est intervenu en qualit\u00e9 de m\u00e9diateur instruira la plainte. \u00c0 d\u00e9faut de consentement de toutes les parties, un membre diff\u00e9rent sera charg\u00e9 de l\u2019audience. En outre, le processus de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal est enti\u00e8rement confidentiel, de sorte que tous les renseignements \u00e9chang\u00e9s et communiqu\u00e9s pendant ce processus (y compris l\u2019\u00e9change de documents avant et pendant la m\u00e9diation) ne sont pas communiqu\u00e9s aux autres membres du Tribunal si la m\u00e9diation ne m\u00e8ne pas \u00e0 une entente de r\u00e8glement. Ainsi, les parties sont certaines, si elles choisissent de faire instruire leur plainte, d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur ind\u00e9pendant et impartial qui pr\u00e9sidera l\u2019audience sans rien savoir des renseignements \u00e9chang\u00e9s au cours du processus de m\u00e9diation.\n[39] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que les exemples de pression mentionn\u00e9s par le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9quivalent pas \u00e0 de la contrainte ou ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re de la contrainte selon la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Bien que le plaignant ait eu l\u2019impression de subir des pressions pendant la m\u00e9diation, il n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas rejeter les conditions du r\u00e8glement que lui offrait l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En outre, les proc\u00e9dures qui doivent \u00eatre suivies lors des m\u00e9diations du Tribunal sont structur\u00e9es pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour donner \u00e0 un plaignant non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un d\u00e9lai de sept jours pour \u00ab se calmer \u00bb et prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sans subir les pressions de la salle de m\u00e9diation.\nC. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 entra\u00eener sa nullit\u00e9?\n[40] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait parvenir les sommes d\u2019argent qu\u2019elle devait dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Il soutient plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment (dans la lettre qu\u2019il a adress\u00e9e au Tribunal le 1er octobre) qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u le premier ch\u00e8que le 25 septembre 2013, soit, selon ses calculs, 65 jours apr\u00e8s la signature de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Il mentionne que le deuxi\u00e8me ch\u00e8que est arriv\u00e9 le 2 octobre 2013 et il all\u00e8gue, dans sa requ\u00eate du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2014, que c\u2019est ce ch\u00e8que qui lui est parvenu en retard qui cause une violation du contrat.\n[41] Le paragraphe 1 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n[traduction]\n1) Dans les quarante\u2011cinq (45) jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de la lettre de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) attestant qu\u2019elle a approuv\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\nA) remet au plaignant XX [1] $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral, une somme \u00e0 laquelle aucune d\u00e9duction imposable ne sera appliqu\u00e9e;\nB) remet au plaignant XX [2] $ au titre des honoraires, une somme \u00e0 laquelle les d\u00e9ductions pr\u00e9vues par la loi seront appliqu\u00e9es.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[42] Bien que l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Commission le 14 ao\u00fbt 2013, aucune des parties n\u2019a affirm\u00e9 savoir que l\u2019approbation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette date.\n[43] En fait, l\u2019approbation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e avant le 4 septembre 2013 par l\u2019avocat de la Commission. Celle\u2011ci a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement et, le 5 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u une lettre d\u2019accompagnement dat\u00e9e du 30 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[44] Le d\u00e9lai applicable \u00e0 l\u2019obligation incombant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de se conformer au paragraphe 1 de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir seulement lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u une lettre de la Commission l\u2019informant que celle\u2011ci avait approuv\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement. Il ne fait aucun doute, \u00e0 mon avis, que le d\u00e9but du d\u00e9lai de 45 jours sur lequel le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e se sont entendus est le 5 septembre 2013.\n[45] Selon le plaignant, le premier ch\u00e8que est arriv\u00e9 le 25 septembre 2013, soit 20 jours apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u notification de l\u2019approbation de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement par la Commission. Quant au deuxi\u00e8me ch\u00e8que, le plaignant l\u2019a re\u00e7u le 2 octobre 2013, soit 27 jours apr\u00e8s que la Commission a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par \u00e9crit, qu\u2019elle avait approuv\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a manifestement pas viol\u00e9 le contrat, car elle a envoy\u00e9 les ch\u00e8ques dans le d\u00e9lai de 45 jours sur lequel les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient entendues.\n[47] Le plaignant a fait une erreur en calculant le d\u00e9lai de 45 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de la signature de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement par le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou \u00e0 compter de la date \u00e0 laquelle la Commission a approuv\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Le d\u00e9lai a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir seulement lorsque les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es par \u00e9crit de l\u2019approbation.\n[48] M\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai devait commencer \u00e0 courir le 4 septembre 2013, soit la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019avocat de la Commission a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que la Commission avait approuv\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement, ou si la date du 30 ao\u00fbt 2013, soit la date \u00e0 laquelle la Commission a envoy\u00e9 sa lettre, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e, les deux ch\u00e8ques sont parvenus au plaignant dans le d\u00e9lai de 45 jours civils convenu par les parties.\n[49] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu violation de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[50] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire des observations sur le fait que le plaignant a choisi d\u2019accepter le respect d\u2019une partie de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement puis de demander l\u2019annulation de l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019entente. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u le premier ch\u00e8que de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1A) de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Il a indiqu\u00e9 dans ses documents qu\u2019il avait encaiss\u00e9 ce ch\u00e8que parce qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait [traduction] \u00ab les d\u00e9penses que j\u2019avais encourues, etc., jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience de m\u00e9diation \u00bb. L\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voit tr\u00e8s clairement que le premier ch\u00e8que visait \u00e0 compenser le plaignant pour \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb, ce qui renvoie probablement aux dommages que le Tribunal peut accorder en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. Le plaignant ne peut pas prendre de mesures pour accepter une partie de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement \u2013 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en d\u00e9posant et en encaissant le ch\u00e8que \u2013 puis tenter de pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019entente est nul. Les mesures qu\u2019il a prises montraient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il avait accept\u00e9 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[51] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019affaire est rejet\u00e9e.\n[52] Il reste une question \u00e0 trancher. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019envoi de deux ch\u00e8ques au plaignant. Celui\u2011ci reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u les deux ch\u00e8ques, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a encaiss\u00e9 que le premier. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que je comprends, les ch\u00e8ques sont valides au Canada pendant une p\u00e9riode de six mois \u00e0 compter de la date qui y est inscrite. Le deuxi\u00e8me ch\u00e8que serait donc maintenant p\u00e9rim\u00e9 en raison de l\u2019\u00e9coulement du temps. Il faudra que l\u2019intim\u00e9e envoie au plaignant un nouveau ch\u00e8que du m\u00eame montant que le deuxi\u00e8me ch\u00e8que.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n21 juillet 2015\n[1] Mentionnons que le montant indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement est confidentiel, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente intervenue entre les parties et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[2] Ibid.",

La plainte et le contexte\n[1] Le 21 mai 2008, Mme Tabor a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle elle soutenait que la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook (Millbrook) avait l\u2019habitude de refuser aux femmes, dont elle\u2011m\u00eame, des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans son exploitation de p\u00eache en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Elle soutenait \u00e9galement que Millbrook lui avait refus\u00e9 un emploi en raison de son \u00e9tat matrimonial.\n[2] Le 16 janvier 2009, Mme Tabor a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, une autre plainte dans laquelle elle soutenait que Millbrook avait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[3] Les deux plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 7 mars 2011. Le 10 avril 2013, le Tribunal a accueilli une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 modifier les plaintes pour y ajouter des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles (voir Tabor c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9). Les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 instruites conjointement \u00e0 Truro, en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, du 28 juillet au 7 ao\u00fbt 2014, puis le 16 septembre 2014. Dans Tabor c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, 2015 TCDP 9 (Tabor no 1), j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Tabor en vertu des articles 7 et 10 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision qui suit porte sur sa plainte de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et examin\u00e9 toute la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je conclus que la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles est elle aussi en partie justifi\u00e9e.\nII. Analyse\nA. Cadre juridique\n[5] Suivant l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, constitue un acte discriminatoire.\n[6] C\u2019est au plaignant qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles en pr\u00e9sentant une preuve suffisante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Autrement dit, le plaignant doit produire une preuve qui, si on lui ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict portant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28 [O\u2019Malley]). Pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de repr\u00e9sailles, le plaignant doit montrer qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, qu\u2019il a subi, par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de la part de la personne vis\u00e9e par la plainte ou d\u2019une personne agissant en son nom et que la plainte a constitu\u00e9 un facteur \u00e0 l\u2019origine du traitement pr\u00e9judiciable (voir Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33).\n[7] Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est agi de montrer qu\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au plaignant, le Tribunal a parfois exig\u00e9 du plaignant qu\u2019il prouve une intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles (voir Virk c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 2; Malec, Malec, Kaltush, Ishpatao, Tettaut, Malec, Mest\u00e9pap\u00e9o, Kaltush c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2010 TCDP 2 et Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Raj Thambirajah, 2012 TCDP 29). Dans d\u2019autres cas, au lieu d\u2019exiger une preuve de l\u2019intention, le Tribunal a plut\u00f4t retenu le fait que les mesures prises \u00e9taient per\u00e7ues par le plaignant comme des repr\u00e9sailles, si cette perception \u00e9tait raisonnable (voir Wong c. Banque royale du Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (CHRT) et Bressette c. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40). Dans le second groupe de d\u00e9cisions, le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la perception du plaignant est mesur\u00e9, le but \u00e9tant d\u2019\u00e9viter que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit tenu responsable de l\u2019angoisse ou des r\u00e9actions exag\u00e9r\u00e9es du plaignant.\n[8] \u00c0 mon avis, le fait d\u2019exiger une preuve de l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles revient \u00e0 imposer au plaignant, pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de cet acte discriminatoire, un fardeau de preuve plus lourd que pour tous les autres actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s par la LCDP. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire est incompatible avec le principe voulant que la LCDP et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les lois sur les droits de la personne doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada), 2015 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 3 \u00e0 28).\n[9] Selon la LCDP, les repr\u00e9sailles constituent un acte discriminatoire (voir les articles 4 et 39 de la LCDP). La LCDP vise avant toute chose \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la discrimination plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 punir les auteurs d\u2019actes discriminatoires. Il s\u2019ensuit que \u00ab les motifs ou les intentions des auteurs d\u2019actes discriminatoires ne constituent pas une des pr\u00e9occupations majeures du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb (Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), 1987 CanLII 73 (CSC), au paragraphe 10 [Robichaud]). Au contraire, la LCDP \u00ab vise \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des conditions socialement peu souhaitables, et ce, sans \u00e9gard aux raisons de leur existence \u00bb (Robichaud, au paragraphe 10). De plus, exiger une preuve de l\u2019intention afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de discrimination serait comme \u00ab \u00e9lever une barri\u00e8re pratiquement insurmontable pour le plaignant qui demande r\u00e9paration \u00bb, car \u00ab [i]l serait extr\u00eamement difficile dans la plupart des cas de prouver le mobile \u00bb (O\u2019Malley, au paragraphe 14). Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 de multiples reprises, \u00ab [l]a discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire \u00bb (Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP)).\n[10] Par ailleurs, il y a, \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, d\u2019importantes consid\u00e9rations de principe qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de prouver l\u2019intention pour fonder une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles. L\u2019interdiction d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles pr\u00e9serve l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP en offrant aux plaignants qui pourraient craindre de faire valoir leurs droits en vertu de cette loi une certaine protection contre de telles repr\u00e9sailles. Elle donne aussi l\u2019assurance aux plaignants que des mesures de redressement seront prises s\u2019ils ont fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte. Ainsi, l\u2019article peut \u00e9galement avoir un effet dissuasif sur ceux qui songent \u00e0 exercer des repr\u00e9sailles. Le fait d\u2019exiger la preuve d\u2019une intention pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des objectifs de l\u2019article 14.1.\n[11] En fait, avant que l\u2019article 14.1 ne soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la LCDP, les repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des infractions punissables sur d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 par proc\u00e9dure sommaire, r\u00e9gies par les articles 59 et 60 de la LCDP. Peu de poursuites ont eu lieu en vertu de ces articles, et celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9es n\u2019ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas abouti. Cela s\u2019explique par la difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 r\u00e9unir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire \u00e0 prouver hors de tout doute raisonnable que des mesures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019un plaignant avec l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles. Par cons\u00e9quent, le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP conviendrait mieux que les tribunaux de juridiction criminelle pour traiter ces affaires (voir Parlement du Canada, LS\u2011298F, Projet de loi S\u20115 : Loi modifiant la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, le Code criminel et la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, par Nancy Holmes (Division du droit et du gouvernement, 1998), partie C3, en ligne : Parlement du Canada <http:\/\/www.parl.gc.ca\/About\/Parliament\/LegislativeSummaries\/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&ls=S5&Parl=36&Ses=1&Language=F - Repr\u00e9saillestext>).\n[12] Pour ces raisons, j\u2019estime qu\u2019un plaignant ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenu de prouver l\u2019intention pour fonder une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. \u00c0 mon sens, il lui faut simplement pr\u00e9senter une preuve permettant d\u2019affirmer que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 lui avoir fait subir par la suite, que ce soit sur la base d\u2019une perception raisonnable ou autrement. S\u2019il produit suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles, il incombe alors au Tribunal d\u2019examiner ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 ceux que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor\n[13] Mme Tabor a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle soutient que Millbrook (1) a fait obstacle \u00e0 son travail au sein d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de recherche sur les p\u00eaches; (2) a pris des mesures injustifi\u00e9es \u00e0 son endroit dans le cadre de son r\u00e9gime d\u2019aide sociale; (3) a tard\u00e9 \u00e0 lui d\u00e9livrer un certificat d\u2019occupation de la r\u00e9sidence de son p\u00e8re d\u00e9funt dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, puis a pris des mesures injustifi\u00e9es contre elle et sa famille; (4) lui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le co\u00fbt d\u2019une nouvelle cuisini\u00e8re, alors qu\u2019elle en assume g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ce co\u00fbt; (5) lui a imput\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019encaissement frauduleux par un tiers de ch\u00e8ques qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 libell\u00e9s \u00e0 son ordre pour qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tienne ces sommes en fiducie pour un mineur; (6) a refus\u00e9 d\u2019acquitter sa facture d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, alors qu\u2019elle assume g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ces frais; (7) lui a refus\u00e9 des fonds pour lui permettre de se rendre \u00e0 Halifax pour passer un examen en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi, alors qu\u2019elle assume g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ces frais; (8) lui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le paiement d\u2019un loyer; (9) lui a refus\u00e9 un stage professionnel au centre de sant\u00e9 de Millbrook.\n[14] Je conclus que les all\u00e9gations relatives au poste au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche sur les p\u00eaches et au refus d\u2019accorder une aide financi\u00e8re pour un d\u00e9placement sont fond\u00e9es. Les autres all\u00e9gations sont rejet\u00e9es.\n(i) Les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es\n(a) L\u2019obstacle au travail au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche sur les p\u00eaches\n[15] Le 23 juin 2008, Mme Tabor a postul\u00e9 un emploi dans le domaine de la recherche pour un projet intitul\u00e9 \u00ab A Study of the Critical Success Factors in the First Nation Fishery in Atlantic Canada \u00bb. Le poste \u00e9tait offert dans le cadre d\u2019un partenariat entre l\u2019Atlantic Policy Congress Council of First Nations Chiefs et l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Memorial. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le chef de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, Lawrence Paul, \u00e9tait copr\u00e9sident du conseil de direction de l\u2019Atlantic Policy Congress.\n[16] Le 26 juin 2008, Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par M. Tom Cooper au sein du projet de recherche. M. Terrence Hickey participait lui aussi au projet de recherche. Dans le cadre de ce projet, les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche \u00e9taient notamment appel\u00e9s \u00e0 aller rencontrer des p\u00eacheurs appartenant aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones afin de recueillir leurs vues concernant le sujet de la recherche ainsi que diverses donn\u00e9es.\n[17] Puisque Millbrook faisait partie des communaut\u00e9s \u00e0 visiter, Mme Tabor a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Cooper le 27 juillet 2008 afin de l\u2019informer de la plainte de discrimination qu\u2019elle venait de d\u00e9poser contre la Premi\u00e8re nation. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor, M. Cooper aurait dit qu\u2019il ne pensait pas que cela allait poser probl\u00e8me, mais qu\u2019il allait en discuter avec M. Hickey.\n[18] Aucune difficult\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que MM. Cooper et Hickey arrivent en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse pour commencer les entrevues. Le 4 septembre 2008, lorsque ces derniers ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Tabor \u00e0 Truro, ils lui ont dit que le chef de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, Lawrence Paul, leur avait fait part de sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 permettre au secteur des p\u00eaches de Millbrook de prendre part \u00e0 la recherche si Mme Tabor devait faire partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. Selon Mme Tabor, par ses propos, M. Cooper lui conseillait de quitter la r\u00e9serve de Millbrook parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019y \u00e9tait pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas nuire au projet et qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9senterait sa d\u00e9mission s\u2019il le fallait. MM. Cooper et Hickey lui ont dit qu\u2019elle pouvait continuer de faire partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche, ajoutant que leur patron d\u00e9sapprouverait leur d\u00e9cision s\u2019ils devaient accepter sa d\u00e9mission pour un tel motif.\n[19] Toutefois, le 17 septembre 2008, M. Cooper a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor pour lui dire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter sa d\u00e9mission, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Millbrook refusait de prendre part \u00e0 la recherche si elle continuait de faire partie de leur \u00e9quipe. \u00c0 partir de cette date, Mme Tabor a cess\u00e9 de travailler au projet.\n[20] En raison de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, Mme Tabor croit que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de travail au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe du projet de recherche sur les p\u00eaches.\n[21] M. Alex Cope, conseiller et administrateur de la bande de Millbrook, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il soutient n\u2019avoir jamais parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Cooper ou M. Hickey et ne pas \u00eatre au courant de quoi que ce soit de n\u00e9gatif qui aurait pu leur \u00eatre dit au sujet de Mme Tabor. Il affirme aussi que Millbrook n\u2019a pas incit\u00e9 les p\u00eacheurs \u00e0 refuser de prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude parce que Mme Tabor y participait.\n[22] Ni M. Hickey ni le Dr Cooper n\u2019ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. En revanche, M. Hickey a souscrit un affidavit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 joint en tant que pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de M. Cope, tandis que M. Cooper a souscrit un affidavit qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit comme pi\u00e8ce lors de l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire. Ces affidavits n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits comme preuve de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leur contenu.\n[23] Dans son affidavit, M. Hickey d\u00e9clare qu\u2019au d\u00e9part, M. Cooper et lui \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s rencontrer des repr\u00e9sentants de Millbrook Fisheries le 4 septembre 2008, mais que la rencontre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e.\n[24] M. Hickey affirme que lorsque M. Cooper et lui ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Tabor plus tard ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ce qu\u2019avait dit le chef Lawrence Paul. Mme Tabor aurait plut\u00f4t d\u00e9clar\u00e9 spontan\u00e9ment que si M. Cooper ou lui\u2011m\u00eame souhaitait la licencier, elle d\u00e9missionnerait de ce pas sans jamais faire allusion \u00e0 ce qui venait de se passer. Selon M. Hickey, les propos de Mme Tabor ne s\u2019inscrivaient dans aucun contexte particulier, si bien qu\u2019il les a ignor\u00e9s. Le 17 septembre 2008, M. Cooper lui a fait savoir qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9venu Mme Tabor du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait plus besoin de ses services.\n[25] L\u2019affidavit de M. Cooper comporte des renseignements qui sont absents de celui de M. Hickey, mais certains de ses paragraphes sont identiques. M. Cooper affirme que vers le 2 juillet 2008, il a eu avec Mme Tabor une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique au cours de laquelle celle\u2011ci lui a appris qu\u2019elle venait d\u2019intenter des poursuites contre le chef et le conseil de Millbrook. M. Cooper aurait alors inform\u00e9 Mme Tabor qu\u2019elle aurait la responsabilit\u00e9 des entrevues avec les Premi\u00e8res nations de Pictou Landing et d\u2019Indian Brook, mais qu\u2019en raison des poursuites qu\u2019elle avait intent\u00e9es, il lui demandait de s\u2019abstenir de communiquer avec Millbrook Fisheries ou d\u2019intervenir dans ce dossier.\n[26] Tout comme M. Hickey, M. Cooper affirme que lorsque M. Hickey et lui ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Tabor le 4 septembre 2008, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ce qu\u2019avait dit le chef Lawrence Paul. Mme Tabor aurait plut\u00f4t d\u00e9clar\u00e9 spontan\u00e9ment que si M. Hickey ou lui\u2011m\u00eame souhaitait la licencier, elle d\u00e9missionnerait de ce pas sans jamais faire allusion \u00e0 ce qui venait de se passer. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de M. Hickey, M. Cooper signale que les propos de Mme Tabor ne s\u2019inscrivaient dans aucun contexte particulier, si bien qu\u2019il les a ignor\u00e9s.\n[27] En ce qui concerne la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Tabor, M. Cooper d\u00e9clare ceci :\n[traduction]\n12. Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre rentr\u00e9 de Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, j\u2019ai appris [\u2026] que Stacey Tabor \u00e9tait all\u00e9e rencontrer le chef et le conseil de Millbrook et leur avait dit qu\u2019elle travaillait pour l\u2019Atlantic Policy Congress et qu\u2019il lui fallait organiser des entretiens avec les p\u00eacheurs de Millbrook.\n13. Ayant appris que Mme Tabor avait pris contact avec Millbrook Fisheries apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on lui eut dit qu\u2019elle s\u2019occupait seulement des exploitations de p\u00eache de Pictou Landing et d\u2019Indian Brook, j\u2019ai t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re, le 17 septembre 2008 ou vers cette date, je lui ai rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb communiquer avec Millbrook Fisheries, je lui ai dit qu\u2019on n\u2019avait plus besoin de ses services et je l\u2019ai remerci\u00e9 du travail qu\u2019elle avait accompli.\n[28] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il convient de ne pas accorder trop de poids aux affidavits de M. Hickey et de M. Cooper puisque ces derniers n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner afin d\u2019en pr\u00e9ciser ou d\u2019en \u00e9claircir le contenu, ni soumis \u00e0 un contre-interrogatoire permettant de v\u00e9rifier l\u2019exactitude de leurs d\u00e9clarations. Cela dit, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que MM. Hickey et Cooper ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal, il se trouve que leurs d\u00e9clarations ne concordent pas avec la plus grande partie de la preuve relative \u00e0 cet aspect des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[29] Premi\u00e8rement, Mme Tabor a produit en preuve une s\u00e9rie de courriels qu\u2019elle a \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec M. Hickey et qui contredisent l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle M. Cooper ne voulait pas qu\u2019elle communique avec Millbrook Fisheries ou intervienne dans ce dossier. Le 28 ao\u00fbt 2008, M. Hickey a \u00e9crit ceci \u00e0 Mme Tabor et \u00e0 M. Cooper :\n[traduction] Bonjour Tom et Stacy, Adrian Gloade de Millbrook nous a demand\u00e9 de [mots tronqu\u00e9s] Pictou Landing. La messagerie \u00e9lectronique ne fonctionne pas bien lorsque vient le temps de communiquer. [Mots tronqu\u00e9s].\n[30] Le m\u00eame jour, Mme Tabor a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Hickey :\n[traduction]\nbonjour terry,\nsi vous voulez, je peux donner \u00e0 adrian un aper\u00e7u de la teneur de la recherche et l\u2019informer de vos intentions pour la semaine prochaine. t\u00e9l\u00e9phonez-moi demain matin ou envoyez-moi un courriel. stacy\n[31] Toujours le m\u00eame jour, M. Hickey a r\u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Tabor :\n[traduction]\nBonjour Stacy,\nJe vous en prie \u2013 vos d\u00e9marches seront tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9es!\nMerci\n[32] Le 4 septembre 2008, M. Hickey a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Tabor :\n[traduction]\nBonjour Stacy,\nJe voulais simplement savoir si Adrian avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment il lui \u00e9tait possible de nous rencontrer.\nPar ailleurs, \u00e0 quoi ressemble votre emploi du temps aujourd\u2019hui?\nMerci\nTerry\n[33] Si M. Hickey a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor de prendre contact avec Millbrook, pourquoi alors a\u2011t\u2011il trouv\u00e9 raisonnable que M. Cooper d\u00e9cide de ne pas la garder dans l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche pour cette raison? La s\u00e9rie de courriels contredit l\u2019affidavit de M. Cooper et M. Hickey ne dit rien \u00e0 ce sujet dans son propre affidavit. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que les d\u00e9clarations de MM. Hickey et Cooper concernant la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Tabor au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche ne sont pas dignes de foi.\n[34] Deuxi\u00e8mement, M. Hickey et M. Cooper affirment tous deux que Mme Tabor a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 spontan\u00e9ment que si l\u2019un d\u2019eux souhaitait la licencier, elle d\u00e9missionnerait de ce pas sans jamais faire allusion \u00e0 ce qui venait de se passer. Ils disent que ces propos ne s\u2019inscrivaient dans aucun contexte particulier et qu\u2019ils les ont ignor\u00e9s. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 encore d\u2019une d\u00e9claration non digne de foi. Pourquoi Mme Tabor proposerait-elle de d\u00e9missionner sans raison apparente alors qu\u2019elle vient de commencer \u00e0 travailler comme adjointe \u00e0 la recherche? De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, pourquoi M. Hickey et M. Cooper se sont-ils content\u00e9s d\u2019ignorer un commentaire de cette nature, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient au courant de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Tabor contre Millbrook en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne? Cette explication n\u2019est tout simplement pas raisonnable, surtout si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que Mme Tabor a confirm\u00e9 avoir propos\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner de son poste si sa pr\u00e9sence au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche venait \u00e0 constituer un obstacle.\n[35] Dans l\u2019ensemble, j\u2019ajoute foi au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor concernant l\u2019ing\u00e9rence de Millbrook dans son travail au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de recherche sur les p\u00eaches et le fait que cette ing\u00e9rence a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant finalement pouss\u00e9 M. Cooper \u00e0 se passer de ses services. Sur cette question, Mme Tabor a offert un t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et cr\u00e9dible qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 par le contre\u2011interrogatoire.\n[36] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Millbrook en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019avait que peu de valeur et, pour les raisons expos\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, je l\u2019ai trouv\u00e9e d\u00e9raisonnable et peu digne de foi. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est plus probable que Millbrook ait refus\u00e9 de prendre part au projet de recherche dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 Mme Tabor continuait d\u2019en faire partie. Au final, cela a contribu\u00e9 au fait que Mme Tabor a perdu son poste d\u2019adjointe \u00e0 la recherche au sein du projet. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Tabor au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n(b) Le refus d\u2019accorder une aide financi\u00e8re pour un d\u00e9placement\n[37] Mme Tabor soutient que Millbrook a fait en sorte qu\u2019il lui soit difficile d\u2019obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re pour actualiser ses comp\u00e9tences professionnelles et parfaire son \u00e9ducation.\n[38] En 2009, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Millbrook une aide financi\u00e8re pour elle\u2011m\u00eame et pour son mari, M. Craig Tabor, afin qu\u2019ils puissent se rendre \u00e0 Halifax pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 un concours leur permettant de se qualifier pour devenir fonctionnaires du minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans (MPO). Mme Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019emploi en question consistait \u00e0 patrouiller le long des c\u00f4tes pour lutter contre la p\u00eache ill\u00e9gale et \u00e0 effectuer des recherches sur des sujets comme l\u2019habitat et les migrations.\n[39] Pour demander cette aide financi\u00e8re, Mme Tabor s\u2019est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Bill Pictou, agent des services de formation professionnelle de Millbrook. M. Pictou lui aurait dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 cette aide parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tudiante au Nova Scotia Community College.\n[40] Mme Tabor a ensuite communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Margaret Poulette, agente d\u2019aide sociale pour le service de d\u00e9veloppement social de Millbrook. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 si le service pouvait faire quelque chose pour financer son voyage \u00e0 Halifax. Mme Poulette a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au bureau du service des p\u00eaches et de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 Michelle Gloade.\n[41] Mme Tabor affirme que lorsqu\u2019elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au bureau de l\u2019exploitation de p\u00eache, M. Thomas Gloade lui a raccroch\u00e9 au nez apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle se fut nomm\u00e9e. Elle a alors rappel\u00e9 Mme Poulette pour lui expliquer ce qui venait de se produire. Mme Poulette a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au service des p\u00eaches et demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on rappelle Mme Tabor.\n[42] Michelle Gloade, du bureau du service des p\u00eaches, a alors rappel\u00e9 Mme Tabor en la priant d\u2019excuser le geste de M. Gloade, puis lui a dit qu\u2019elle soumettrait sa demande d\u2019aide financi\u00e8re \u00e0 M. Adrian Gloade, qui \u00e9tait directeur de Millbrook Fisheries.\n[43] Quelques jours plus tard, Mme Tabor a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gloade pour lui demander si une d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue au sujet de sa demande. Mme Gloade lui a r\u00e9pondu que la demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e.\n[44] Mme Tabor a alors appel\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau Mme Poulette pour savoir si elle pouvait faire autre chose. Mme Poulette lui a offert de la mettre en rapport avec M. Barry Martin, administrateur du d\u00e9veloppement social pour Millbrook.\n[45] M. Martin a communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Tabor. Il a affect\u00e9 des fonds provenant du budget d\u2019entretien de la maison de Mme Tabor au financement de son voyage \u00e0 Halifax.\n[46] Mme Tabor fait valoir qu\u2019en d\u00e9finitive, elle s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e \u00e0 payer elle\u2011m\u00eame les frais de son voyage \u00e0 Halifax en sacrifiant une partie des allocations auxquelles elle avait droit pour l\u2019entretien de sa maison. Millbrook devrait donc lui rembourser l\u2019argent pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 sur ce fonds.\n[47] M. Cope reconna\u00eet que Millbrook a fait en sorte qu\u2019il soit difficile pour Mme Tabor d\u2019obtenir des fonds pour financer ses \u00e9tudes et sa formation. Cela est d\u00fb au fait que Mme Tabor a commenc\u00e9 des formations par le pass\u00e9, mais qu\u2019elle a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d\u2019en terminer toutes les \u00e9tapes. Par cons\u00e9quent, chaque demande de formation qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sente fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le plus strict. Aux dires de M. Cope, la fa\u00e7on dont Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e est li\u00e9e au bilan de ses r\u00e9alisations et n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne. En t\u00e9moignage, il a ajout\u00e9 que Millbrook applique les normes et les lignes directrices de financement des cours \u00e9tablies par Service Canada. En raison de ces normes et du fait que les fonds sont limit\u00e9s, une personne ne peut recevoir d\u2019aide financi\u00e8re \u00e0 titre d\u2019 [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tudiant professionnel \u00bb. Ils doivent choisir un m\u00e9tier et ne peuvent en apprendre plusieurs. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Mme Tabor faisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des \u00e9tudes pour devenir assistante m\u00e9dicale, Millbrook n\u2019a pas voulu financer son voyage pour passer l\u2019examen du MPO.\n[48] Sur cette question, la r\u00e9ponse de Millbrook est pratiquement identique \u00e0 celle qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Tabor no 1 concernant les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles s\u2019\u00e9tait heurt\u00e9e Mme Tabor en tentant d\u2019obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re pour une formation de capitaine. En effet, dans son affidavit, M. Cope a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Millbrook \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de payer la formation de capitaine de Mme Tabor en 1998 parce qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 inscrite \u00e0 cette formation en 1997 sans la terminer. Or, dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Cope a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 une tout autre raison pour justifier qu\u2019une aide lui ait initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e en 1998. \u00c0 mon avis, cette nouvelle justification a \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la version donn\u00e9e par Mme Tabor en t\u00e9moignage pour expliquer qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pu terminer le cours en 1997 : il lui fallait prendre soin de son p\u00e8re malade. Millbrook n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 cette explication et j\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une raison l\u00e9gitime pour abandonner le cours en 1997. Dans l\u2019ensemble, j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 que l\u2019explication offerte par Millbrook concernant la difficult\u00e9 de Mme Tabor d\u2019obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re pour sa formation de capitaine \u00e9tait peu convaincante et non digne de foi (voir Tabor no 1, aux paragraphes 72 \u00e0 82).\n[49] Millbrook avance un argument semblable pour contrer cette all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. Selon moi, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 aussi d\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[50] Si l\u2019on excepte l\u2019\u00e9pisode de 1997 o\u00f9 elle n\u2019a pas termin\u00e9 sa formation de capitaine pour prendre soin de son p\u00e8re malade, la preuve, dans son ensemble, ne permet pas d\u2019affirmer, comme le fait M. Cope, que Mme Tabor a l\u2019habitude d\u2019entreprendre des formations sans en terminer toutes les \u00e9tapes. Au contraire, la preuve port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal concernant la formation de Mme Tabor indique qu\u2019elle a obtenu un brevet de capitaine avec restrictions en 1998, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres certificats de formation maritime dans les domaines de la navigation \u00e9lectronique simul\u00e9e, des fonctions d\u2019urgence en mer et d\u2019op\u00e9rateur radio. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement appris que Mme Tabor avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 bien une formation d\u2019assistante de bureau de m\u00e9decin en 2010.\n[51] Fait int\u00e9ressant, dans son affidavit, M. Cope d\u00e9clare que M. Tabor a lui aussi l\u2019habitude de demander de l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re, puis de ne pas entreprendre ou terminer la formation vis\u00e9e. Encore une fois, cette affirmation n\u2019est pas \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la preuve. En t\u00e9moignage, M. Tabor a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019une fois, on lui avait refus\u00e9 une aide financi\u00e8re pour suivre un cours de grutier au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas termin\u00e9 un cours par le pass\u00e9. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, M. Tabor avait termin\u00e9 le cours en question. Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Millbrook pour \u00e9lucider la question, celle\u2011ci s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019elle avait confondu M. Tabor avec son fr\u00e8re. M. Tabor a finalement obtenu aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une autre source l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire au cours de grutier et il a r\u00e9ussi la formation.\n[52] \u00c0 mon avis, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Tabor en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant men\u00e9 au refus de Millbrook de lui accorder des fonds pour son voyage. Cela s\u2019est produit apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, et Millbrook \u00e9tait au courant de la d\u00e9marche. De plus, selon ce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en t\u00e9moignage, Mme Tabor avait senti que Millbrook lui mettait des b\u00e2tons dans les roues en lui refusant constamment des possibilit\u00e9s. Selon moi, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une perception raisonnable de la part de Mme Tabor puisqu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu refuser la possibilit\u00e9 de p\u00eacher, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 discriminatoire dans la d\u00e9cision Tabor no 1, ainsi que la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre part \u00e0 des recherches sur les p\u00eacheries, ce qui constituait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les conclusions tir\u00e9es plus haut dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Tabor vient par ailleurs conforter la perception de Mme Tabor.\n[53] La raison donn\u00e9e par M. Cope pour expliquer le refus de Millbrook d\u2019accorder une aide financi\u00e8re \u00e0 Mme Tabor pour son voyage renforce aussi son impression d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles. Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la preuve n\u2019\u00e9taye pas les propos de M. Cope selon lesquels Mme Tabor aurait l\u2019habitude d\u2019entreprendre des formations sans en terminer toutes les \u00e9tapes. En fait, la preuve que cette derni\u00e8re a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal d\u00e9montre l\u2019inverse. De plus, aucun document n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la d\u00e9claration de Millbrook voulant que l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re ait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e sur la base de l\u2019application des normes ou des lignes directrices \u00e9tablies par Service Canada. Au final, je trouve que l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par Millbrook en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Tabor n\u2019est pas digne de foi. Par cons\u00e9quent, sur cette question, lorsque la preuve de Millbrook est soupes\u00e9e au regard de celle de Mme Tabor, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est plus probable que Millbrook ait pris des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles contre Mme Tabor.\n(ii) Les all\u00e9gations non fond\u00e9es\n[54] Souvent, lorsqu\u2019une personne est victime de discrimination sur une longue p\u00e9riode et que le tout est exacerb\u00e9 par les repr\u00e9sailles qu\u2019elle subit apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, elle en vient \u00e0 croire que toutes les mesures qui sont prises et la d\u00e9savantagent sont des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles, surtout si elles sont le fait de personnes nomm\u00e9es dans la plainte ou ayant un lien avec celles\u2011ci. Or, toute situation d\u00e9favorable cons\u00e9cutive au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment le fruit de repr\u00e9sailles. J\u2019estime que ce constat s\u2019applique aux autres all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor. Comme cela ressort de la d\u00e9cision Tabor no 1, un conflit oppose les parties depuis longtemps. Selon moi, certaines des autres all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor d\u00e9coulent possiblement de ce conflit persistant. D\u2019autres semblent \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un simple malentendu ou d\u2019une erreur humaine. Voil\u00e0 qui r\u00e9sume les raisons pour lesquelles j\u2019ai conclu que les autres all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor n\u2019\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9es. J\u2019examinerai maintenant successivement chacune de ces all\u00e9gations.\n(a) La prise de mesures injustifi\u00e9es dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019aide sociale\n[55] Mme Tabor soutient que Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit en se trompant dans le calcul des prestations d\u2019aide sociale auxquelles elle avait droit, puis en exigeant qu\u2019elle rembourse une partie de ces trop-pay\u00e9s se montant \u00e0 10 447,87 $.\n[56] Dans la demande d\u2019aide sociale qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010, Mme Tabor a indiqu\u00e9 n\u2019avoir eu aucun revenu alors qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui avait dit que le demandeur d\u2019aide sociale qui travaille au plus deux jours par semaine n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de d\u00e9clarer le revenu que ce travail lui rapportait. De plus, elle recevait ce revenu dans le cadre d\u2019un stage de travail li\u00e9 au cours d\u2019adjointe administrative qu\u2019elle suivait, un autre aspect qui l\u2019avait incit\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 le d\u00e9clarer dans sa demande d\u2019aide sociale.\n[57] Millbrook a jug\u00e9 que ni Mme Tabor ni son mari ne pouvaient toucher des prestations d\u2019aide sociale en 2010 puisqu\u2019ils travaillaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et que le revenu total du m\u00e9nage \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait fix\u00e9 pour y avoir droit.\n[58] Mme Tabor a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019appel sur l\u2019aide, \u00e0 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (la Commission). La Commission a conclu que Millbrook, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de disposer d\u2019un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de Mme Tabor par p\u00e9riode de paie, s\u2019\u00e9tait servi d\u2019estimations de ses revenus pour d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 l\u2019aide sociale. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il appartenait \u00e0 Mme Tabor de fournir les documents pertinents \u00e0 Millbrook, la Commission lui a accord\u00e9 30 jours pour le faire, faute de quoi les montants estimatifs utilis\u00e9s au d\u00e9part par Millbrook serviraient de base pour le calcul des sommes auxquelles elle avait droit.\n[59] Mme Tabor a remis \u00e0 Millbrook les documents exig\u00e9s par la Commission dans le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours. N\u00e9anmoins, Millbrook a d\u2019abord \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Commission que Mme Tabor ne lui avait pas fourni les documents. Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au Tribunal en date du 28 ao\u00fbt 2012, Millbrook a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une \u00ab erreur \u00bb de sa part et, dans un envoi portant la m\u00eame date, a fait suivre les documents de Mme Tabor \u00e0 la Commission. En se fondant sur ces documents, Millbrook a continu\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer que Mme Tabor avait re\u00e7u des paiements en trop au titre de l\u2019aide sociale, mais elle a r\u00e9duit le montant du trop-pay\u00e9 \u00e0 10 148,00 $.\n[60] De nouveau, Mme Tabor a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook \u00e0 la Commission au motif que la Premi\u00e8re nation avait omis de d\u00e9duire certaines sommes de son revenu.\n[61] Millbrook soutient que Mme Tabor a sciemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses revenus pour 2010 de mani\u00e8re trompeuse dans le but d\u2019\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 l\u2019aide sociale. M\u00eame si la premi\u00e8re v\u00e9rification des prestations d\u2019aide sociale vers\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Tabor \u00e9tait inexacte du fait d\u2019une erreur figurant dans le feuillet T4 \u00e9tabli par le Native Council of Nova Scotia \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Tabor, cela n\u2019a pas influenc\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat final : Mme Tabor n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019aide sociale en 2010. Millbrook pr\u00e9tend que Mme Tabor a reconnu avoir fait dans sa demande d\u2019aide sociale des d\u00e9clarations inexactes qu\u2019elle qualifie d\u2019erreurs. Selon Millbrook, Mme Tabor a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une v\u00e9rification d\u2019usage men\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et transparente \u00e0 l\u2019issue de laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de rembourser des sommes pour des raisons l\u00e9gitimes. Ainsi, \u00e0 son avis, ses all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles ne sont pas fond\u00e9es au regard de cette question.\n[62] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les parties ont beaucoup d\u00e9battu du fond de ce diff\u00e9rend concernant l\u2019aide sociale. Or, il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider si Mme Tabor avait ou non droit \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019aide sociale, et le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de quel ordre. Il existe \u00e0 cette fin une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel et un organe sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 que les parties ont saisi de la question. Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 \u00e9valuer si, ainsi que l\u2019all\u00e8gue Mme Tabor, Millbrook lui a fait subir une v\u00e9rification et a mal calcul\u00e9 ses prestations d\u2019aide sociale parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[63] S\u2019il est vrai que Millbrook s\u2019est tromp\u00e9e en calculant les prestations d\u2019aide sociale de Mme Tabor en se fiant au feuillet T4 de M. Tabor, cette erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence de celle qu\u2019avait faite le Native Council of Nova Scotia. Parce que Mme Tabor attribue cette erreur \u00e0 Millbrook, je suis port\u00e9e \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable que Mme Tabor per\u00e7oive une forme de repr\u00e9sailles dans cette affaire et, \u00e0 mon sens, cela d\u00e9coule de la d\u00e9gradation des rapports entre les parties au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et notamment, des actes de discrimination. Je ne suis pas non plus convaincue que Millbrook a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification du dossier de Mme Tabor en repr\u00e9sailles au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte. La preuve produite n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les gestes de Millbrook \u00e9taient motiv\u00e9s par un d\u00e9sir de vengeance, et en pr\u00e9sentant son revenu de mani\u00e8re inexacte, Mme Tabor ne sert pas sa cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je pr\u00eate foi aux dires de Mme Tabor lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que ses d\u00e9clarations inexactes correspondent \u00e0 une erreur de bonne foi qu\u2019elle a commise parce qu\u2019elle a mal compris la teneur de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9claration de revenus. Je ne suis pas pour autant convaincue que Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle.\n(b) Le refus de payer la facture d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\n[64] Parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle Millbrook aurait pris des mesures injustifi\u00e9es \u00e0 son \u00e9gard dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019aide sociale de la Premi\u00e8re nation, Mme Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2008, alors que sa famille avait besoin d\u2019aide pour payer ses factures, elle a \u00e9galement transmis son compte d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de la Nova Scotia Power au service de d\u00e9veloppement social de Millbrook pour que ce dernier le r\u00e8gle. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait par le pass\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019instar d\u2019autres membres de la communaut\u00e9, et que Millbrook avait acquitt\u00e9 ces factures. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Tabor a m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019elle connaissait des membres de la communaut\u00e9 dont les factures d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es par Millbrook m\u00eame s\u2019ils travaillaient et ne touchaient pas d\u2019aide sociale.\n[65] Le 1er mai 2008, Mme Tabor a re\u00e7u du service de d\u00e9veloppement social de Millbrook la lettre suivante :\n[traduction] Bien que, par le pass\u00e9, le service de d\u00e9veloppement social de Millbrook ait gracieusement accept\u00e9 de vous aider \u00e0 acquitter votre compte de la Nova Scotia Power, cette aide ne pourra \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9e sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Malheureusement, plusieurs d\u2019entre vous ont pris l\u2019habitude d\u2019envoyer leurs factures \u00e0 notre bureau sans autre explication quant aux raisons pour lesquelles ils ont besoin d\u2019aide pour les acquitter et sans exprimer la moindre gratitude pour les paiements que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 faits en leur nom.\nVeuillez noter qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de maintenant, vous \u00eates pri\u00e9s d\u2019adresser toute demande d\u2019aide, par \u00e9crit ou en personne, \u00e0 Barry Martin, administrateur du d\u00e9veloppement social. Nous vous demandons \u00e9galement de faire des efforts de votre c\u00f4t\u00e9 avant de demander notre aide et de nous fournir la preuve de ces efforts (au moyen des originaux des re\u00e7us confirmant vos paiements) si vous faites une telle demande. Rappelez-vous que l\u2019aide que nous vous apportons \u00e0 l\u2019occasion est une marque de courtoisie. Nous ne sommes nullement tenus d\u2019effectuer vos paiements \u00e0 votre place.\n[66] Je constate que la lettre du 1er mai 2008 est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Tabor fond\u00e9e sur les articles 7 et 10, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e plus tard, soit le 20 mai 2008. Cela suffit \u00e0 r\u00e9gler le sort de cette all\u00e9gation, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Millbrook ne peut avoir refus\u00e9 de payer la facture d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de Mme Tabor en raison de sa plainte. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas produit suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour soutenir que Millbrook payait les factures d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 d\u2019autres membres de la communaut\u00e9 alors qu\u2019elle avait refus\u00e9 de payer les siennes. Vraisemblablement, sachant que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, elle aurait pu produire d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sous forme de t\u00e9moignages et de documents. Les d\u00e9clarations impr\u00e9cises de Mme Tabor \u00e0 cet effet ne suffisent pas \u00e0 me convaincre que des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es par Millbrook dans ce cas.\n(c) La r\u00e9sidence du p\u00e8re d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9\n[67] Mme Tabor soutient qu\u2019au moment de mourir, son p\u00e8re a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Millbrook que sa maison soit confi\u00e9e en fiducie \u00e0 Mme Tabor au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de son petit\u2011fils le plus vieux \u2013 le fils de Mme Tabor \u2013 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa majorit\u00e9. Millbrook a consenti \u00e0 la demande et a convenu avec Mme Tabor qu\u2019elle lui remettrait un certificat d\u2019occupation lui conf\u00e9rant la d\u00e9tention de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en fiducie pour le compte de son fils. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ce dernier atteigne l\u2019\u00e2ge de la majorit\u00e9, Mme Tabor devait louer la r\u00e9sidence et d\u00e9poser les loyers dans un fonds en fiducie.\n[68] Au bout de deux ans, Millbrook n\u2019avait toujours pas d\u00e9livr\u00e9 le certificat d\u2019occupation pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 cela, dans l\u2019intervalle, Mme Tabor a permis \u00e0 des membres de Millbrook qui touchaient de l\u2019aide sociale de vivre dans la maison. Elle n\u2019exigeait pas de loyer fixe; les occupants la payaient \u00e0 la mesure de leurs moyens. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les prestataires d\u2019aide sociale re\u00e7oivent une allocation de logement, Millbrook a exig\u00e9 que Mme Tabor rembourse une partie des prestations d\u2019aide sociale de ces locataires. De plus, avant de d\u00e9livrer le certificat d\u2019occupation, Millbrook a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que Mme Tabor fasse l\u2019entretien du jardin de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[69] Mme Tabor pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas la responsabilit\u00e9 de louer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de veiller \u00e0 son entretien avant que le certificat d\u2019occupation ne lui soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9. Elle soutient qu\u2019en exigeant qu\u2019elle rembourse les prestations d\u2019aide sociale et entretienne le jardin tout en retardant la d\u00e9livrance du certificat, Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit.\n[70] Au sujet de cette all\u00e9gation, Mme Tabor affirme \u00e9galement que des livraisons de mazout ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de son p\u00e8re et que les factures lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9es m\u00eame si quelqu\u2019un vivait l\u00e0 et touchait de l\u2019aide sociale. Elle estime que les factures de mazout auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre envoy\u00e9es au programme d\u2019aide sociale de Millbrook. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, Mme Tabor signale que du mazout a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre r\u00e9sidence et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 factur\u00e9 au programme d\u2019aide sociale de Millbrook m\u00eame si elle ne recevait pas d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[71] En t\u00e9moignage, M. Cope a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019est \u00e0 celui qui demande un certificat d\u2019occupation qu\u2019il revient de demander \u00e0 ce que l\u2019attribution de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 soit approuv\u00e9e par r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande. Selon lui, Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de certificat avant mai 2011. Par la suite, il n\u2019a fallu que deux mois pour que ce certificat soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9. Millbrook pr\u00e9tend que m\u00eame sans certificat d\u2019occupation, Mme Tabor avait l\u2019usage et le contr\u00f4le de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[72] Sur ce point, j\u2019estime que les actes de Millbrook ne constituaient pas des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles. Millbrook a respect\u00e9 le souhait du p\u00e8re de Mme Tabor, qui \u00e9tait de confier la responsabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019entretien de sa demeure \u00e0 Mme Tabor jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le fils de cette derni\u00e8re atteigne l\u2019\u00e2ge de la majorit\u00e9. Pour honorer leur engagement, les parties ont conclu une entente pr\u00e9voyant que Mme Tabor d\u00e9tiendrait la maison en fiducie pour son fils. On ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun contrat \u00e9crit; cependant, Mme Tabor et M. Cope ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Il \u00e9tait implicitement entendu, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019entente, que Mme Tabor ne pourrait louer la maison qu\u2019\u00e0 des membres de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook qui lui verseraient un loyer. S\u2019il en \u00e9tait all\u00e9 autrement, elle n\u2019aurait rien \u00e0 d\u00e9poser dans le compte en fiducie de son fils. M\u00eame si Mme Tabor croyait que l\u2019entente n\u2019entrerait en vigueur qu\u2019\u00e0 compter de la d\u00e9livrance du certificat d\u2019occupation, elle a quand m\u00eame fait usage de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, notamment en la louant et en permettant \u00e0 des membres de la famille de l\u2019habiter. Elle a m\u00eame produit des documents dans lesquels elle se pr\u00e9sente comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9taire-bailleresse de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[73] \u00c0 mon avis, ces actes d\u00e9montrent que Mme Tabor savait qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019usage et la possession de la maison. Elle a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019entente intervenue avec Millbrook sans avoir re\u00e7u le certificat d\u2019occupation, mais elle a ignor\u00e9 son obligation de ne pas louer la maison \u00e0 des prestataires d\u2019aide sociale. Elle n\u2019a pas non plus pourvu \u00e0 l\u2019entretien de la maison. Pour ces raisons, j\u2019estime que Millbrook a pris des mesures raisonnables qui ne s\u2019inscrivaient pas dans une volont\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles. Bien qu\u2019elle ait tard\u00e9 dans une certaine mesure \u00e0 d\u00e9livrer le certificat d\u2019occupation, je ne vois pas en quoi ce retard a pu avoir un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur Mme Tabor puisque cela n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019impact sur son usage de la maison.\n[74] En ce qui concerne les livraisons de mazout, Mme Tabor a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de courriels qu\u2019elle a \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec le chef Bob Gloade, propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019entreprise de livraison de mazout. Dans l\u2019un de ces courriels, le chef Gloade r\u00e9pond aux questions que lui adresse Mme Tabor au sujet des livraisons de mazout et donne des pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites aux deux r\u00e9sidences. La livraison de mazout \u00e0 la maison du p\u00e8re de Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la demande de cette derni\u00e8re au cours des mois d\u2019hiver pour \u00e9viter que des tuyaux ne g\u00e8lent. Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 cette facture. Le chef Gloade a offert de lui faire une faveur en radiant la dette. Le mazout livr\u00e9 \u00e0 sa propre r\u00e9sidence semble l\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 par erreur. Autrement, la s\u00e9rie de courriels ne nous \u00e9claire pas quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les livraisons de mazout \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du p\u00e8re de Mme Tabor auraient d\u00fb ou non \u00eatre pay\u00e9es par le programme d\u2019aide sociale de Millbrook. Le reste de la preuve ne permettait pas non plus d\u2019\u00e9tayer cette pr\u00e9tention.\n[75] Apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve et du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Mme Tabor sur cette question, je ne suis pas convaincue que celle\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, encore moins que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur ayant motiv\u00e9 un tel traitement.\n(d) Le co\u00fbt de remplacement de la cuisini\u00e8re\n[76] Aux dires de Mme Tabor, toutes les maisons dont la bande est propri\u00e9taire sont \u00e9quip\u00e9es d\u2019une cuisini\u00e8re. En janvier 2011, la cuisini\u00e8re de la maison occup\u00e9e par Mme Tabor et appartenant \u00e0 la bande a cess\u00e9 de fonctionner; Mme Tabor en a donc command\u00e9 une nouvelle, qu\u2019elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se faire rembourser par Millbrook. Toutefois, cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas rembours\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor le co\u00fbt de la nouvelle cuisini\u00e8re.\n[77] En t\u00e9moignage, M. Cope a reconnu que la Premi\u00e8re nation payait le co\u00fbt de remplacement des \u00e9lectrom\u00e9nagers d\u00e9faillants, mais il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait d\u2019abord en approuver l\u2019achat, lequel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rembours\u00e9 lorsque le membre de la bande commandait un mod\u00e8le non approuv\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable. La cuisini\u00e8re command\u00e9e par Mme Tabor ne faisait pas partie des mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9approuv\u00e9s, et c\u2019est pourquoi Millbrook n\u2019en a pas pay\u00e9 le co\u00fbt.\n[78] L\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par Millbrook en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Tabor est raisonnable. Il semble logique de faire approuver au pr\u00e9alable les achats de cette nature. Cela permet \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re nation de tenter de r\u00e9parer l\u2019appareil ou de le remplacer par un mod\u00e8le qu\u2019elle a approuv\u00e9. On ne sait pas trop si Mme Tabor a inform\u00e9 Millbrook du fait que la cuisini\u00e8re ne fonctionnait plus. Devan\u00e7ant l\u2019approbation, Mme Tabor a command\u00e9 une nouvelle cuisini\u00e8re, puis en a demand\u00e9 le remboursement. On ignore aussi ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne cuisini\u00e8re, si elle pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9e et ce qu\u2019on en a fait par la suite. Certes, on n\u2019a pas rembours\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor la diff\u00e9rence de prix entre sa nouvelle cuisini\u00e8re et les mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9approuv\u00e9s, mais j\u2019attribue ce fait au d\u00e9saccord entre les parties concernant l\u2019application de la politique de Millbrook sur cette question. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas produit suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour me convaincre que sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook de ne pas lui rembourser le co\u00fbt de sa nouvelle cuisini\u00e8re.\n(e) Les ch\u00e8ques encaiss\u00e9s frauduleusement\n[79] En ao\u00fbt 2011, Mme Tabor s\u2019\u00e9tait vu confier le soin d\u2019un mineur sans foyer. Le mineur recevait des prestations d\u2019aide sociale que Millbrook versait \u00e0 Mme Tabor pour qu\u2019elle les d\u00e9tienne en fiducie. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, le mineur a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre pris en charge par Mme Tabor et celle\u2011ci en a inform\u00e9 la Premi\u00e8re nation. Toutefois, des ch\u00e8ques en fiducie ont continu\u00e9 de lui arriver. Deux de ces ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encaiss\u00e9s sans que Mme Tabor les signe. L\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e \u00e0 la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC), mais aux dires de Mme Tabor, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue. Mme Tabor affirme que Millbrook la tient responsable du remboursement des sommes en cause m\u00eame si elle l\u2019a avis\u00e9e du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus le soin de l\u2019enfant et m\u00eame si elle n\u2019a pas sign\u00e9 les deux ch\u00e8ques re\u00e7us par erreur.\n[80] Millbrook fait valoir que le fiduciaire est responsable des sommes qui lui sont vers\u00e9es en fiducie au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019un tiers mineur. Millbrook ne sait pas qui a sign\u00e9 les deux autres ch\u00e8ques \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mme Tabor en fiducie, mais elle pr\u00e9tend que c\u2019est contre cet individu que Mme Tabor dispose d\u2019un recours.\n[81] On ne sait pas vraiment pourquoi des ch\u00e8ques ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9mis \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Mme Tabor alors qu\u2019elle avait inform\u00e9 Millbrook du fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus le soin du mineur. Toutefois, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne permet pas d\u2019affirmer que Millbrook a \u00e9mis ces ch\u00e8ques en guise de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. On ne conna\u00eet pas non plus la raison pour laquelle Millbrook exige que Mme Tabor rembourse les sommes dans ces circonstances. Toutefois, l\u00e0 encore, la preuve ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la position de Millbrook sur cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de Mme Tabor. Au contraire, sa position semble d\u00e9couler du fait qu\u2019un fraudeur dont l\u2019identit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas connue est m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Bien que la situation soit regrettable pour Mme Tabor, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de repr\u00e9sailles.\n(f) L\u2019obligation de payer un loyer\n[82] Mme Tabor pr\u00e9tend que Millbrook a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019elle paie un loyer pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle vit dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re nation. Or, selon elle, les membres de la bande n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 payer de loyer.\n[83] M. Cope a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC) verse une allocation de logement aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d\u2019aide sociale. Ces allocations sont retenues par le service de d\u00e9veloppement social de Millbrook et remises \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de logement de la Premi\u00e8re nation avant que les prestations d\u2019aide sociale soient vers\u00e9es aux membres. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Tabor affirme qu\u2019elle devait payer un loyer, Millbrook soutient qu\u2019elle ne faisait que retenir l\u2019allocation de logement sur les prestations d\u2019aide sociale qui lui \u00e9taient dues.\n[84] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Tabor a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas savoir que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d\u2019aide sociale recevaient une allocation de logement d\u2019AADNC. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son loyer n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 sur ses prestations d\u2019aide sociale, mais plut\u00f4t sur le ch\u00e8que de la rente qu\u2019elle recevait au titre d\u2019un trait\u00e9.\n[85] Il est clair que la retenue des allocations de logement sur les prestations d\u2019aide sociale de Mme Tabor d\u00e9coule d\u2019un malentendu entre les parties. Bien que Mme Tabor aille plus loin en affirmant que Millbrook n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb pr\u00e9lever son allocation de logement sur son ch\u00e8que de rente, il est difficile de voir en quoi sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a constitu\u00e9 un facteur d\u2019influence dans le traitement dont elle a fait l\u2019objet. \u00c0 mon sens, la situation est le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un malentendu et d\u2019un manque de communication entre les parties, et non de repr\u00e9sailles cons\u00e9cutives au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de Mme Tabor.\n(g) Le stage refus\u00e9 au centre de sant\u00e9\n[86] En 2010, Mme Tabor \u00e9tait inscrite \u00e0 un programme d\u2019assistance de bureau de m\u00e9decin. L\u2019une des conditions du programme consistait \u00e0 effectuer un stage professionnel. Elle s\u2019est enquise de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer son stage au centre de sant\u00e9 de Millbrook aupr\u00e8s du Dr Murdo Ferguson, qui y travaillait comme m\u00e9decin. Selon Mme Tabor, le Dr Ferguson lui aurait r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il allait voir si c\u2019\u00e9tait possible et qu\u2019il lui ferait part de sa r\u00e9ponse.\n[87] Mme Tabor affirme que par la suite, le Dr Ferguson lui aurait dit qu\u2019il avait appris de Mme Elizabeth Paul, directrice du centre de sant\u00e9, que le centre n\u2019acceptait pas d\u2019\u00e9tudiants. Il a donc offert \u00e0 Mme Tabor d\u2019effectuer son stage \u00e0 sa clinique de Truro, offre que Mme Tabor a accept\u00e9e.\n[88] Mme Tabor pr\u00e9tend que le centre de sant\u00e9 de Millbrook avait accept\u00e9 des \u00e9tudiants inscrits au m\u00eame programme qu\u2019elle lors de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. M\u00eame si elle croit qu\u2019au final, la d\u00e9cision relative au stage a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par Mme Paul, elle pense aussi que cette derni\u00e8re a pu \u00eatre influenc\u00e9e par la mauvaise opinion que Millbrook avait \u00e0 son sujet.\n[89] Mme Paul a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Bien qu\u2019il lui arrive de consulter le conseil de bande de Millbrook, notamment M. Cope, sur des questions d\u2019embauche, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en dernier ressort, les d\u00e9cisions en la mati\u00e8re lui appartenaient. En ce qui a trait plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au placement d\u2019\u00e9tudiants, Mme Paul a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en avisait le conseil de bande [traduction] \u00ab apr\u00e8s coup dans les cas indiqu\u00e9s \u00bb, mais elle a insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019elle ne demandait jamais l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du conseil.\n[90] Quant \u00e0 Mme Tabor, Mme Paul n\u2019avait pas souvenir d\u2019avoir parl\u00e9 de stage directement avec elle, ni d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e par le Dr Ferguson au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle effectue un stage ou de la question des stages d\u2019\u00e9tudiants en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Mme Paul a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si le Dr Ferguson lui avait demand\u00e9 si des \u00e9tudiants pouvaient effectuer des stages en 2010, elle aurait r\u00e9pondu que le centre n\u2019avait pas de place \u00e0 offrir \u00e0 des \u00e9tudiants puisqu\u2019il comptait d\u00e9j\u00e0 deux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein au sein des services administratifs.\n[91] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019affirmation de Mme Tabor selon laquelle le centre de sant\u00e9 avait accept\u00e9 des \u00e9tudiants inscrits \u00e0 son programme lors de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, Mme Paul a reconnu que c\u2019\u00e9tait en effet le cas. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9tudiante en question avait effectu\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re semaine de son stage au centre de sant\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pu le terminer \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle l\u2019avait commenc\u00e9. Par ailleurs, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il n\u2019y avait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein aux services administratifs. Hormis cette \u00e9tudiante qui n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente que pendant une semaine, Mme Paul ne se souvenait d\u2019aucun autre placement d\u2019\u00e9tudiant au sein du personnel administratif du centre de sant\u00e9.\n[92] Sur cette question, Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage convaincant. En contre\u2011interrogatoire, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait avoir la certitude que Millbrook avait influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de Mme Paul de ne pas lui donner la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer un stage au centre de sant\u00e9. En revanche, j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Paul \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible et digne de foi et que l\u2019explication qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations de Mme Tabor \u00e9tait raisonnable. Apr\u00e8s avoir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que la plainte de Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas constitu\u00e9 un facteur de motivation dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui accorder un stage au centre de sant\u00e9.\nIII. Ordonnance\n[93] Puisque j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte est en partie fond\u00e9e, je peux rendre une ordonnance contre la Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP. Toutefois, les parties ont accept\u00e9 de scinder les plaidoiries relatives \u00e0 la question de la r\u00e9paration de celles portant sur le fond de la plainte. \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire Tabor no 1, j\u2019ai invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 engager des discussions en vue de parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement qui tienne compte de mes conclusions et j\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 que je leur demanderais un compte rendu apr\u00e8s la publication de mes motifs (voir Tabor no 1, au paragraphe 148). Les parties m\u2019ont finalement fait savoir que leurs discussions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuses. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal communiquera sous peu avec elles pour les inviter \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9senter leurs observations concernant la question de la r\u00e9paration au regard des deux d\u00e9cisions.\n[94] Le Tribunal restera donc saisi des deux affaires jusqu\u2019au r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finitif de la question de la r\u00e9paration eu \u00e9gard aux deux plaintes de Mme Tabor.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n23 juillet 2015\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1658\/01311 et T1659\/1411\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nStacey Lee Tabor c.

La plainte\n[1] Le 22 mai 2012, Sharon Tanner (la plaignante ou Mme Tanner), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler (l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou la Nation), dont elle est membre. Elle all\u00e8gue que la Nation a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit \u00e0 cause de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et\/ou de sa situation de famille, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), lorsque la Nation a \u00e9tabli et appliqu\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle visant \u00e0 emp\u00eacher toutes les personnes qui ne sont pas des descendants unis par les liens du sang \u00e0 John Falcon Tanner de se pr\u00e9senter aux \u00e9lections pour les postes de chef ou de conseiller de la Nation (la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance) (premi\u00e8re question en litige : la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance). La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en lui refusant l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un certain nombre de services, notamment \u00e0 l\u2019aide au revenu, \u00e0 la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale et au service de d\u00e9neigement, de m\u00eame qu\u2019en lui interdisant l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux installations de la bande et en l\u2019excluant des activit\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re (deuxi\u00e8me question en litige : autre traitement diff\u00e9rentiel).\n[2] Enfin, la plaignante fait valoir que, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles. Selon la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi comme agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique du conseil de bande, parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour atteinte aux droits de la personne (troisi\u00e8me question en litige : repr\u00e9sailles).\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un examen de la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 et a renvoy\u00e9 celle\u2011ci au Tribunal, le 3 octobre 2013.\nII. Premi\u00e8re question : la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance\nA. Les faits pertinents\n[4] La plaignante est une femme autochtone, inscrite \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab Indienne \u00bb sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, ch. I\u20115. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 sa naissance membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Sagkeeng, aussi connue sous le nom de Premi\u00e8re Nation de Fort Alexander, au Manitoba.\n[5] En 1981, Mme Tanner a \u00e9pous\u00e9 son d\u00e9funt \u00e9poux, Alex Tanner, qui \u00e9tait membre de la Nation. Par suite de ce mariage, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Mme Tanner a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Sagkeeng et est devenue membre de la Nation. Depuis ce temps, Mme Tanner vit dans la r\u00e9serve de la Nation. L\u2019\u00e9poux de Mme Tanner est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1985. Toutefois, elle vit toujours sur le territoire de la Nation avec sa fille, Charlene Tanner, qui est n\u00e9e en 1982 et qui est aussi membre de la Nation.\n[6] Depuis 1985, l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la Nation est r\u00e9gie par l\u2019article 10 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Cet article reconna\u00eet la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 ses effectifs en adoptant des r\u00e8gles d\u2019appartenance \u00e9crites qui d\u00e9terminent qui a le droit de voir son nom figurer sur la liste des membres. La Nation s\u2019est pr\u00e9value de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et aurait adopt\u00e9 son propre code d\u2019appartenance, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal.\n[7] Depuis le milieu des ann\u00e9es 1970, la Nation choisit aussi son chef et les membres du conseil suivant ses propres proc\u00e9dures \u00e9lectorales coutumi\u00e8res. Depuis ce temps, elle est r\u00e9gie par un conseil constitu\u00e9 d\u2019un chef \u00e9lu et deux conseillers \u00e9lus.\n[8] En 1993, la Nation a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab 1993 Custom Regulations \u00bb (le R\u00e8glement de 1993 sur les coutumes) qui visait \u00e0 officialiser cette pratique. Ce r\u00e8glement exige qu\u2019un candidat qui d\u00e9sire se pr\u00e9senter comme chef ou conseiller :\nsoit un membre inscrit qui r\u00e9side habituellement dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler;\nsoit \u00e2g\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 18 ans;\nqu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable d\u2019un acte criminel au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de sa candidature;\nfasse en sorte que sa candidature soit propos\u00e9e et appuy\u00e9econform\u00e9ment au R\u00e8glement de 1993 sur les coutumes.\n[9] Le document mentionne que le R\u00e8glement de 1993 sur les coutumes a franchi l\u2019\u00e9tape de la deuxi\u00e8me lecture, le 2 novembre 1993, mais il ne mentionne pas, cependant, s\u2019il a franchi l\u2019\u00e9tape de la troisi\u00e8me lecture. Le document n\u2019a en outre jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9. Il est difficile de savoir si le R\u00e8glement a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 en vigueur ou si ses dispositions refl\u00e8tent un large consensus parmi les membres de la Nation en ce qui concerne les pratiques \u00e9lectorales coutumi\u00e8res.\n[10] En 2006\u20112007, la Nation a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 codifier ses pratiques \u00e9lectorales coutumi\u00e8res avec une nouvelle loi et une nouvelle constitution sur l\u2019appartenance. Le chef et le conseil ont embauch\u00e9 M. Larry Catagas, conseiller en gouvernance et agent d\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques aupr\u00e8s du West Region Tribal Council, en tant que tiers ind\u00e9pendant pour aider \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un code \u00e9lectoral et pour tenir un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum afin que les membres de la bande puissent voter sur l\u2019adoption de ce code. La Nation a \u00e9labor\u00e9 trois projets de loi, soit le Band Custom Election Law (la loi \u00e9lectorale), le Gambler First Nation Membership Law (la loi r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appartenance) et la Gambler First Nation Constitution (la constitution Gambler).\n[11] L\u2019article 4.2 de la loi \u00e9lectorale \u00e9num\u00e8re les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 pour les postes de chef et de conseiller.

LeDoux et les conseillers Roy Vermette et Ronnie Ducharme ont sign\u00e9 un document d\u2019une page, qui semble indiquer l\u2019adoption officielle de la loi \u00e9lectorale de 2007.

La candidature de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour l\u2019\u00e9lection au poste de chef. M.

Observations des parties et analyse\n(i) Question pr\u00e9liminaire : La plainte porte\u2011t-elle sur les postes de conseillers de m\u00eame que sur celui de chef?\n[17] Dans sa plainte, la plaignante fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en l\u2019emp\u00eachant d\u2019\u00eatre candidate au poste de chef de la Nation parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une descendante unie par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la plainte, qui s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance aux conseillers.\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plainte ne comportait aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au poste de conseiller et que la plaignante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour corroborer l\u2019assertion selon laquelle elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature au poste de conseiller ou qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de cette possibilit\u00e9 en raison de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. La pr\u00e9sente affaire doit, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, se limiter \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la plaignante ne pouvait se porter candidate au poste de chef de la Nation.\n[19] En d\u00e9pit des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur cette question, il ne semble pas que la port\u00e9e de la plainte fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation. La Commission n\u2019a fait aucune observation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a raison d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019assertion selon laquelle la plaignante n\u2019a pu se porter candidate au poste de conseiller en raison de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. En fait, la plaignante n\u2019a m\u00eame pas fait pareille all\u00e9gation. Au paragraphe 36 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante mentionne \u00e0 quel moment elle pr\u00e9tend que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9gard :\n[traduction]\nLe 29 f\u00e9vrier 2012, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour \u00eatre candidate au poste de chef. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle ne pouvait se porter candidate \u00e0 ce poste parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une descendante unie par les liens du sang \u00e0 John Falcon Tanner. C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que la plaignante \u00e9tait avis\u00e9e du rejet de sa candidature.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[20] Les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au poste de conseiller par la Commission ou la plaignante apparaissent dans le contexte du libell\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, qui donner \u00e0 penser que celle\u2011ci serait applicable \u00e0 toute personne qui n\u2019est pas une descendante unie par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner et qui veut se porter candidate au poste de chef ou de conseiller. La plaignante et la Commission ont, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve laissant entendre que la r\u00e8gle n\u2019avait pas, dans le pass\u00e9, \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re uniforme, parce que d\u2019anciens conseillers, y compris la plaignante, auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 se porter candidats, m\u00eame s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des descendants unis par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner. Cet argument est celui qui vise \u00e0 contester la validit\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, et il est loisible \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 la plaignante de le faire. \u00c0 mon avis, cela ne modifie pas la port\u00e9e de la plainte qui concerne le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a appliqu\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance \u00e0 la plaignante lorsque celle\u2011ci a voulu se porter candidate au poste de chef pendant les \u00e9lections de 2012.\n(ii) La preuve de discrimination de Mme Tanner : la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et son application \u00e0 la plaignante par la Nation, qui privent la plaignante du droit de se porter candidate au poste de chef, constituent\u2011elles une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\n[21] Il incombe \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. \u00c0 cette fin, la plaignante doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve qui, s\u2019il y a des raisons d\u2019y croire, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision en sa faveur, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O\u2019Malley). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, et dans le contexte de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Tanner doit d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019ascendance est une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination selon la LCDP, que la Nation l\u2019a trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente et pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019un service, et que son ascendance a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans le fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on (voir Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33).\n[22] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans les pages suivantes, je conclus que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nL\u2019ascendance est\u2011elle une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination selon la LCDP?\n[23] La r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance \u00e9tablit une distinction entre les personnes selon les liens du sang avec John (Falcon) Tanner. Les parties consid\u00e8rent que cette distinction repose sur la [traduction] \u00ab lign\u00e9e \u00bb ou [traduction] l\u2019\u00ab ascendance \u00bb. Ni la \u00ab lign\u00e9e \u00bb ni l\u2019\u00ab ascendance \u00bb ne figurent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans les motifs de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. La question qui s\u2019ensuit consiste \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019\u00ab ascendance \u00bb ou la \u00ab lign\u00e9e \u00bb peut relever de l\u2019un des motifs de discrimination illicite?\n[24] La position de la Commission, \u00e9galement adopt\u00e9e par la plaignante, peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante : puisque les motifs fond\u00e9s sur la \u00ab race \u00bb, l\u2019\u00ab origine nationale ou ethnique \u00bb et la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb ne sont pas d\u00e9finis dans la LCDP, une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de la LCDP, comme l\u2019a exig\u00e9e la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans des arr\u00eats comme Zurich Insurance Co. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321 et Insurance Corp. Of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145, appuie l\u2019inclusion de l\u2019ascendance. Les cours ont souhait\u00e9 ardemment qu\u2019il y ait uniformit\u00e9 au sein des lois canadiennes sur les droits de la personne, et plusieurs lois provinciales sur les droits de la personne ont inclus l\u2019ascendance dans leurs motifs de distinction illicite. La Commission se fonde sur l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie\u2011Britannique c. Berg, [1993] 2 RCS 353 (Berg), o\u00f9 les observations suivantes sont formul\u00e9es, au paragraphe 372 :\nSi les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es en fonction de l\u2019objet vis\u00e9, les diff\u00e9rences de formulation entre les provinces ne devraient pas masquer les fins essentiellement semblables de ces dispositions, \u00e0 moins que la formulation n\u2019indique la poursuite d\u2019une fin diff\u00e9rente de la part d\u2019une l\u00e9gislature provinciale particuli\u00e8re.\n[25] La Commission soutient que le fait d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la LCDP d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui exclut l\u2019ascendance des motifs de discrimination donnerait lieu \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 une personne pourrait \u00eatre victime de discrimination en raison de son ascendance dans certaines provinces, mais pas dans d\u2019autres, et va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des objectifs de la Loi.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour sa part, fait valoir que l\u2019exigence selon laquelle un chef doit \u00eatre un descendant uni par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner r\u00e9pond parfaitement \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019ascendance appel\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab lign\u00e9e \u00bb par le Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Toutefois, de nombreuses provinces ont explicitement inclus l\u2019ascendance comme motif de discrimination dans leurs lois respectives en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cela laisse entendre que l\u2019ascendance se distingue en fait des motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ainsi que sur la situation de famille. Le fait d\u2019attribuer un sens tr\u00e8s large \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 englober l\u2019ascendance aurait non seulement pour effet de banaliser les motifs de distinction illicite, mais ne serait pas non plus conforme aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dans l\u2019ensemble du pays. Une approche ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois relatives aux droits de la personne ne peut pas, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, permettre de d\u00e9celer dans le libell\u00e9 de la LCDP un motif qui n\u2019existe pas.\n[27] Essentiellement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019ascendance rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019exception \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Berg, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire que la formulation indique la poursuite d\u2019une fin diff\u00e9rente de la part des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales ayant adopt\u00e9 ce motif. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019inclusion de l\u2019ascendance dans la LCDP, qui n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 ce motif, reviendrait \u00e0 aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[28] Comme l\u2019ont soulign\u00e9 les parties dans leurs observations, la question sur laquelle je dois maintenant me pencher est de savoir si l\u2019ascendance, qui est incluse comme un motif distinct dans les lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne (voir, par exemple, le Alberta Human Rights Act, 2000 ch. A\u201125.5, le Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, RRS ch. S\u201124.1, le Code des droits de la personne (Ontario), LRO 1990, ch. H.19, la Loi sur les droits de la personne (Nouveau\u2011Brunswick), LRN\u2011B 2011, ch. 171 et le Human Rights Code (Colombie-Britannique), RSBC 1996, ch. 210), est n\u00e9anmoins prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par les motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou la situation de famille selon la LCDP. Autrement dit, l\u2019ascendance ou la lign\u00e9e peut\u2011elle \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme relevant de la port\u00e9e de ces lois? Pour les raisons qui suivent, je r\u00e9ponds \u00e0 cette question par l\u2019affirmative.\n[29] Un certain nombre d\u2019instruments juridiques lient clairement la notion d\u2019ascendance \u00e0 celle de la race. Dans certaines lois provinciales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, lorsque l\u2019ascendance est explicitement mentionn\u00e9e, celle\u2011ci figure aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race et la couleur. Le paragraphe 9(2) du Code des droits de la personne du Manitoba, qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les motifs de distinction illicite, couvre \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) : \u00ab l\u2019ascendance, y compris la couleur et les races identifiables \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi sur les droits de la personne du Yukon est aussi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle internationale, la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale, 660 R.T.N.U. 195, adopt\u00e9e par les Nations Unies en 1965 et ratifi\u00e9e par le Canada en 1970, int\u00e8gre la notion d\u2019\u00ab ascendance \u00bb \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de la \u00ab discrimination raciale \u00bb. La Convention d\u00e9finit ainsi ce type de discrimination :\ntoute \u00ab distinction, exclusion, restriction ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence fond\u00e9e sur la race, la couleur, l\u2019ascendance ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique \u00bb, et \u00ab qui a pour but ou pour effet de d\u00e9truire ou de compromettre la reconnaissance, la jouissance ou l\u2019exercice, dans des conditions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales \u00bb.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[30] Compte tenu de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion du Canada \u00e0 la Convention, les lois canadiennes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant une port\u00e9e similaire (voir Walter S. Tarnopolsky, Discrimination and the Law (Toronto, Thomson Reuters, 2004), \u00e0 5\u20119), ce qui milite contre l\u2019approche fragment\u00e9e pour interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019ascendance, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a propos\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[31] L\u2019ascendance est \u00e9galement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine ethnique. La signification de l\u2019expression \u00ab ethnic group \u00bb (groupe ethnique) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e par la Chambre des lords dans la d\u00e9cision Mandla c. Dowell Lee, (1993) 1 All E.R. 1062 (Mandla). Dans cette affaire, la Chambre des lords a conclu que l\u2019un des traits essentiels qu\u2019un groupe doit poss\u00e9der pour former un \u00ab groupe ethnique \u00bb, aux fins de la loi concern\u00e9e, \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab soit une origine g\u00e9ographique ou une ascendance commune, limit\u00e9e \u00e0 un petit nombre d\u2019anc\u00eatres communs \u00bb. Le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision Mandla et sa d\u00e9finition du \u00ab groupe ethnique \u00bb dans la d\u00e9cision Rivers c. Conseil de la bande indienne de Squamish, 1994 CanLII 1217 (TCDP) (Rivers), lorsqu\u2019il a conclu que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9 gitksan ou squamish peut \u00eatre tenu comme le fait le poss\u00e9der une origine nationale ou ethnique diff\u00e9rente. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019ascendance, \u00e0 mon avis, fait \u00e9galement partie de l\u2019ethnicit\u00e9.\n[32] Enfin, l\u2019ascendance a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme relevant de la port\u00e9e du motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille. Comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 la Commission, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que le motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille recouvre la notion d\u2019ascendance dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 1988 CanLII 4504 (TCDP) (Schaap), inf. pour d\u2019autres motifs (1988), 56 D.L.R. (4th) 105 (C.A.F.) (voir aussi Rivers, aux pages 40 et 41).\n[33] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap, aux pages 26 et 27, le Tribunal s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019analyse que fait le professeur Tarnopolsky du motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille et conclut ce qui suit :\nPar ailleurs, la signification naturelle et ordinaire de l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb devrait, je pense, englober la relation qui d\u00e9coule des liens du mariage, de la consanguinit\u00e9, de l\u2019adoption l\u00e9gale, y compris, pour reprendre les termes du Pr Tarnopolsky, les relations ancestrales, qu\u2019elles soient l\u00e9gitimes, ill\u00e9gitimes ou d\u2019adoption, ainsi que les relations entre \u00e9poux, fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, beaux\u2011fr\u00e8res et belles\u2011s\u0153urs, oncles ou tantes et neveux ou ni\u00e8ces, cousins, etc. Je n\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 aucun texte faisant autorit\u00e9 qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9largir le sens du mot \u00ab famille \u00bb au-del\u00e0 du type de relations d\u00e9crites ci-dessus.\n[34] L\u2019intim\u00e9e attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur la derni\u00e8re phrase de cette citation. Elle soutient que l\u2019expression \u00ab relations ancestrales \u00bb \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans cette d\u00e9cision est limit\u00e9e aux relations entre \u00ab \u00e9poux, fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, beaux\u2011fr\u00e8res et belles\u2011s\u0153urs, oncles ou tantes et neveux ou ni\u00e8ces, cousins, etc. \u00bb et ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 un anc\u00eatre d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 il y a environ 170 ans.\n[35] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne peux pas admettre cette interpr\u00e9tation. En effet, une simple lecture de la d\u00e9finition ne va pas dans le sens de cette conclusion. L\u2019utilisation des mots \u00ab ainsi que \u00bb, entre \u00ab les relations ancestrales, qu\u2019elles soient l\u00e9gitimes, ill\u00e9gitimes ou d\u2019adoption \u00bb et les relations \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es qui suivent montre clairement que les \u00ab relations ancestrales \u00bb doivent \u00eatre prises en consid\u00e9ration en plus des autres relations \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es et ne sont pas limit\u00e9es par celles\u2011ci. En outre, l\u2019emploi du terme \u00ab etc. \u00bb \u00e0 la fin des relations \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es indique que cette liste n\u2019est pas exhaustive.\n[36] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement reconnu que la situation de famille pouvait inclure les relations ancestrales dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mossop, [1991] 1 C.F. 18 (C.A.F.); confirm\u00e9 [1993] 1 R.C.S. 554. Dans cet arr\u00eat, le juge Stone a examin\u00e9 l\u2019historique de la loi par laquelle les mots \u00ab family status \u00bb (situation de famille) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s aux motifs de distinction illicite qui figuraient dans la LCDP et a dit ceci :\nLorsqu\u2019il a comparu devant le Comit\u00e9 permanent de la Chambre des communes qui \u00e9tudiait la modification propos\u00e9e, le ministre de la Justice de l\u2019\u00e9poque a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur la situation d\u00e9crite ci\u2011dessus et a fait la remarque suivante au sujet de la notion de \u00ab family status \u00bb (situation de famille) dont on proposait l\u2019adoption :\n[\u2026] il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019interdire toute discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les relations entre les personnes par suite d\u2019un mariage, de la consanguinit\u00e9 ou de l\u2019adoption l\u00e9gale. Cela inclut les relations ancestrales, qu\u2019elles soient l\u00e9gitimes, ill\u00e9gitimes ou adoptives, de m\u00eame que les relations entre les conjoints, les enfants, les liens par alliance, les oncles ou les tantes, les neveux ou les ni\u00e8ces, les cousins etc. Il incombera \u00e0 la Commission, aux tribunaux qu\u2019elle nommera et en dernier ressort, aux tribunaux, d\u2019\u00e9tablir dans chacun des cas la signification de ces notions. [Comit\u00e9 permanent de la justice et des questions juridiques, Proc\u00e8s\u2011verbaux et t\u00e9moignages, fascicule no 114, \u00e0 la p. 17. (Dossier d\u2019appel, volume 3, page 326.)]\n\u00c0 mon avis, ce t\u00e9moignage indique clairement que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention de limiter ce nouveau motif de distinction illicite de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas inclure la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019orientation sexuelle.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[37] Ces cas et ces lois d\u00e9montrent que l\u2019ascendance, bien qu\u2019elle constitue un motif distinct dans plusieurs l\u00e9gislations provinciales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, est une notion qui peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme faisant partie des trois motifs, soit les motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la situation de famille. Compte tenu de cela, j\u2019estime que l\u2019ascendance, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019ascendance raciale, nationale ou ethnique, ou encore, d\u2019ascendance familiale, est une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination selon la LCDP.\n[38] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Nation fait valoir que l\u2019ascendance raciale et l\u2019ascendance nationale ou ethnique ne sont pas en cause. Elle soutient plut\u00f4t que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance vise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si une personne a ou non comme anc\u00eatre John (Falcon) Tanner. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 que John (Falcon) Tanner \u00e9tait un homme blanc et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance cr\u00e9e une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la race, mais aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou argument n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour avancer que Mme Tanner est d\u2019une race ou d\u2019une origine nationale ou ethnique diff\u00e9rente de celle de John (Falcon) Tanner. En effet, la race et l\u2019ethnicit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre, d\u2019un point de vue anthropologique, arch\u00e9ologique et ethnologique, des questions complexes \u00e0 trancher sans une certaine expertise (voir, par exemple, la d\u00e9cision Rivers).\n[39] \u00c0 mon avis, le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire concerne davantage le motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, comme le fait valoir la Nation, que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance vise l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un membre de la famille ou d\u2019un anc\u00eatre en particulier. Le libell\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance elle\u2011m\u00eame renvoie m\u00eame \u00e0 un [traduction] \u00ab arbre g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique \u00bb. Comme le motif fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille s\u2019applique aux plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un membre de la famille en particulier (voir B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66, aux paragraphes 39 \u00e0 41), j\u2019estime que la pr\u00e9sente affaire doit \u00eatre analys\u00e9e comme une plainte li\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation de famille.\nMme Tanner a\u2011t\u2011elle subi des effets pr\u00e9judiciables relativement \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP?\n[40] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP interdit les pratiques discriminatoires dans la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou d\u2019h\u00e9bergement habituellement destin\u00e9s au public :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[41] Il ne fait aucun doute que Mme Tanner a subi les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance figurant dans la loi \u00e9lectorale. Cette r\u00e8gle l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019occuper un poste au sein du gouvernement de la Nation. La question est de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance\/loi \u00e9lectorale sont un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[42] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170 (Watkin), un \u00ab service \u00bb vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP s\u2019entend de \u00ab quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u2018\u2018offert\u2019\u2019 ou \u2018\u2018mis \u00e0 la disposition\u2019\u2019 du public [\u2026] \u00bb et qui s\u2019inscrit \u00ab [\u2026] dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique [\u2026] \u00bb (Watkin, au paragraphe 31).\n[43] Selon la Commission, en \u00e9tablissant si un candidat est admissible au poste de chef ou de conseiller, par l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019application de la loi \u00e9lectorale et la prise de d\u00e9cision de son directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections, la Nation a fourni un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. La Commission all\u00e8gue que l\u2019approbation du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections conf\u00e8re l\u2019avantage au candidat de pouvoir occuper un poste qui lui permettra de contribuer \u00e0 la bonne gouvernance de sa collectivit\u00e9 et lui procure une source de revenu. En outre, elle soutient que les processus \u00e9lectoraux constituent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment crucial de la relation publique entre les gouvernements et la collectivit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre gouvern\u00e9e.\n[44] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette question ou r\u00e9pondu aux arguments de la Commission.\n[45] \u00c0 mon avis, une question l\u00e9gitime pourrait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir si le processus d\u2019\u00e9laboration et d\u2019application de la loi \u00e9lectorale est un \u00ab service \u00bb (voir les d\u00e9cisions Matson et al c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 13, et Andrews et al. c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 21, conf. par 2015 CF 398). Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette question. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne dispose d\u2019aucun argument ou \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui contredit les observations de la Commission. En cons\u00e9quence, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019accepte la position de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir que la Nation a fourni un service dans le cadre de son processus d\u2019\u00e9laboration et d\u2019application de la loi \u00e9lectorale et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\nL\u2019ascendance joue\u2011t-elle un r\u00f4le important dans les effets pr\u00e9judiciables?\n[46] Voyant que Mme Tanner ne pouvait se porter candidate au poste de chef du seul fait de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, une r\u00e8gle qui \u00e9tablit une distinction fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019ascendance que j\u2019estime \u00eatre une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP, je conclus que l\u2019ascendance a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de Mme Tanner. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime que cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n(iii) Motif justifiable : si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a\u2011t\u2011elle d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la pratique comporte un motif justifiable?\n[47] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, j\u2019analyserai maintenant la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Compte tenu de la preuve prima facie, cette derni\u00e8re peut \u00e9viter une conclusion d\u00e9favorable en pr\u00e9sentant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que ses actes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires ou en invoquant un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui justifie son acte discriminatoire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) de la LCDP, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il y a un motif qui justifie l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. Pour prouver qu\u2019elle disposait d\u2019un motif justifiable, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit d\u00e9montrer :\nqu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction de chef ou de conseiller;\nque la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi, en croyant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte de la fin ou du but en question;\nque la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour accomplir la fin ou le but poursuivi, en ce sens quel\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut pas composer avec les personnes qui ne sont pas les descendantes unies par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner sans subir une contrainte excessive.\n(Voir les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c.

Mme Tanner et d\u2019autres descendants qui ne sont pas unis par les liens du sang ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus conseillers et ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la bonne gouvernance de la Premi\u00e8re Nation.\n[50] En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que l\u2019adoption d\u2019une loi \u00e9lectorale, ainsi que d\u2019une constitution et d\u2019un code d\u2019appartenance, est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la bonne gouvernance de la Nation. Toutefois, les dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de la loi \u00e9lectorale ne font pas l\u2019objet de la plainte. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t l\u2019exigence particuli\u00e8re de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance qui est en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e9taient insuffisants pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle le fait d\u2019\u00eatre un descendant uni par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner contribue \u00e0 la bonne gouvernance de la Nation. Celle\u2011ci a un lien historique particulier avec John (Falcon) Tanner, lien qui est abord\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail ult\u00e9rieurement dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, mais j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de lien entre cette histoire et la [traduction] \u00ab bonne \u00bb gouvernance de la Nation. En fait, comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 la Commission, Mme Tanner et d\u2019autres descendants qui ne sont pas unis par les liens du sang ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus conseillers et ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la gouvernance de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\n[51] En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance n\u2019est pas rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la fonction de chef ou de conseiller et qu\u2019elle ne peut donc \u00eatre honn\u00eatement justifi\u00e9e. Bien que cette conclusion seule corrobore la plainte, j\u2019examinerai n\u00e9anmoins le reste des arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLa r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi, en croyant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019atteinte de la fin ou du but en question?\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la loi \u00e9lectorale a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi. La Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur celle\u2011ci dans le cadre d\u2019un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum; la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par une majorit\u00e9 simple des voix. En revanche, la plaignante et la Commission soutiennent que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour exclure plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment Mme Tanner de la gouvernance de la Premi\u00e8re Nation.\n[53] Les faits entourant l\u2019\u00e9laboration et l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale sont contest\u00e9s et il \u00e9tait difficile de les confirmer. Les t\u00e9moins ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages contradictoires et certains semblaient marqu\u00e9s par les tensions sous-jacentes d\u00e9coulant de querelles pass\u00e9es. D\u2019autres, comme Albert Tanner, le seul a\u00een\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, souffraient visiblement de troubles mentaux. Une grande partie de la preuve documentaire \u00e9tait \u00e9galement peu fiable de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[54] Cela \u00e9tant dit, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que Mme Tanner \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Elle \u00e9tait directe dans son t\u00e9moignage et ne semblait pas l\u2019avoir embelli ou afficher une attitude vindicative. J\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage, de m\u00eame que la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis par Larry Catagas, le directeur du scrutin pendant le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum de 2007, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utiles pour confirmer les faits entourant la d\u00e9cision de la Nation de mettre en place une exigence concernant la descendance li\u00e9e aux liens du sang pour les postes de chef et de conseiller. Je constate, bien que j\u2019aie conclu que M. Catagas \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin impartial et, dans l\u2019ensemble, un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible, que des parties de son t\u00e9moignage contredisaient son affidavit en date du 5 novembre 2010, trois ans apr\u00e8s le vote r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire (pi\u00e8ce C1, onglet 1), qui d\u00e9crivait les \u00e9v\u00e9nements entourant le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. La confusion r\u00e9sultant de ces contradictions a amen\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 poser des questions au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Catagas. Ce dernier a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait subi, au cours des quatre derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, deux accidents vasculaires c\u00e9r\u00e9braux et deux crises cardiaques et qu\u2019il souffrait depuis de pertes de m\u00e9moire. Ainsi qu\u2019il est soulign\u00e9 ci\u2011dessous, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 peu de poids \u00e0 ces parties de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[55] Pour les motifs ci-dessous, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas adopt\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance de bonne foi.\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rendum de 2007\n[56] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Catagas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses services avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus, \u00e0 la fin de 2006, par le chef et le conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, alors compos\u00e9 de Gordon LeDoux, de Ron Vermette et de Ronnie Ducharme, et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait vu confier le mandat d\u2019\u00e9laborer la loi r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appartenance, la constitution et la loi \u00e9lectorale de la Nation. Il devait \u00e9galement agir en qualit\u00e9 de directeur du scrutin pour le processus r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019adoption de ces lois et constitution par les membres. M. Catagas a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 avec un ensemble g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de lois, puis qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u les commentaires des membres de la Nation afin de pouvoir adapter le contenu \u00e0 leurs besoins. M. Catagas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir organis\u00e9 trois ou quatre consultations publiques avec les membres de la bande; pendant ces consultations, ils avaient discut\u00e9, entre autres, de la loi \u00e9lectorale. Sharon et Charlene Tanner ont toutes les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ignoraient que ces consultations avaient eu lieu.\n[57] En ce qui concerne le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, M. Catagas a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait obtenu d\u2019AINC la liste des membres votants de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler et qu\u2019il avait modifi\u00e9 la liste en tenant compte des suggestions des membres pour d\u00e9terminer les personnes qui avaient le droit de vote. Une fois la liste finale dress\u00e9e, M. Catagas avait envoy\u00e9, par poste prioritaire, la trousse contenant les bulletins de vote aux membres de la Nation qui ne demeuraient pas dans la collectivit\u00e9. Les membres vivant dans la collectivit\u00e9 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s par un avis de la tenue du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum; l\u2019avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par la poste \u00e0 tous ceux dont les adresses \u00e9taient connues de la bande et affich\u00e9 aux endroits cl\u00e9s de la collectivit\u00e9, en l\u2019occurrence au bureau de la bande, \u00e0 la salle de bande et au centre de sant\u00e9. Les membres qui avaient avis\u00e9 M. Catagas qu\u2019ils ne seraient pas disponibles le jour du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum avaient re\u00e7u une trousse en vue du vote par anticipation; ils pouvaient ensuite retourner leur bulletin de vote par la poste. Les bulletins de vote retourn\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s directement par la poste \u00e0 M. Catagas et plac\u00e9s dans un endroit ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 clef.\n[58] Sharon et Charlene Tanner ont toutes deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais vu ou re\u00e7u un avis les informant de la tenue du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Sharon Tanner a affirm\u00e9 avoir appris que le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum avait eu lieu en parlant avec des membres de la collectivit\u00e9, dont un grand nombre d\u2019entre eux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contents du fait de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s de la tenue de ce r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. M. Catagas a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que certains membres l\u2019avaient appel\u00e9 pour lui dire qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas re\u00e7u la trousse relative au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Il a admis que, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas envoy\u00e9 les trousses par courrier recommand\u00e9 ou par messager, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de rep\u00e9rer ceux qui avaient re\u00e7u la trousse et ceux qui ne l\u2019avaient pas re\u00e7ue. M. Catagas ne pouvait se rappeler combien de trousses avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 post\u00e9es ni combien avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9es. Il a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait qu\u2019il y avait environ 75 membres de la bande qui demeuraient \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la collectivit\u00e9. Il a constat\u00e9 que, selon la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, soit une copie de la liste des \u00e9lecteurs qui semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e par une personne assise avec M. Catagas le jour du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, 32 bulletins de vote avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us par la poste. Eugene Tanner a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait qu\u2019environ 90 trousses avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par la poste et qu\u2019environ une soixantaine d\u2019entre elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9es.\n[59] Le 17 mai 2007, soit le jour du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, M. Catagas a compt\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame les bulletins de vote, en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autres personnes, dont Eugene Tanner. M. Catagas a utilis\u00e9 la liste finale des \u00e9lecteurs qu\u2019il avait dress\u00e9e pour rep\u00e9rer les personnes qui avaient vot\u00e9 en rayant leurs noms. Selon la liste des \u00e9lecteurs figurant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, sur 124 \u00e9lecteurs admissibles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s au moment du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, 32 personnes ont envoy\u00e9 leurs bulletins de vote par la poste et 19 personnes ont vot\u00e9 en personne, pour un total de 51 \u00e9lecteurs participants. Parmi ceux\u2011ci, 29 ont vot\u00e9 en faveur de la loi \u00e9lectorale et 20 ont vot\u00e9 contre.\n[60] Selon cette liste des \u00e9lecteurs, il semblerait que les trois projets de loi, soit la loi r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appartenance, la constitution et la loi \u00e9lectorale, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 simple, ce qui, selon la loi \u00e9lectorale, correspond \u00e0 [ traduction] \u00ab 50 pour 100 plus un de ceux qui ont vot\u00e9 \u00bb. M. Catagas a mentionn\u00e9 que la loi \u00e9lectorale n\u2019exigeait qu\u2019un vote \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 simple, parce qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s difficile d\u2019obtenir une double majorit\u00e9 en raison des d\u00e9fis que pose le fait d\u2019avoir la participation d\u2019un nombre suffisant d\u2019\u00e9lecteurs : [traduction] \u00ab autrement, vous ne cesseriez de recommencer le processus sans jamais pouvoir rejeter ou adopter un projet de loi donn\u00e9 \u00bb (transcription, \u00e0 la page 594). M. Catagas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de tenue d\u2019\u00e9lections pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations, il y a habituellement un vote \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 simple.\n[61] M. Catagas a mentionn\u00e9 que la liste des \u00e9lecteurs de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, le laissait perplexe et qu\u2019il ne reconnaissait pas ce document. Il a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de la liste de suivi officielle. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019indique la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, M. Catagas a rappel\u00e9 que seule la loi \u00e9lectorale a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 ce r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, compte tenu de cela et en raison du fait que les trois projets de loi renfermaient encore des ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s, il avait conseill\u00e9 que le chef et le conseil mettent en place un processus d\u2019examen et d\u2019amendements en vue de tenir un deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. M\u00eame si M. Catagas croyait qu\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum avait eu lieu, au cours duquel la loi \u00e9lectorale avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e, il ne se souvenait pas quand cela se serait pass\u00e9. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tayant ce r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9.\n[62] La fiabilit\u00e9 de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question par le t\u00e9moignage de Harlene Swain, qui a affirm\u00e9 avoir vot\u00e9 au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, et pourtant son nom n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9 de la liste. En outre, alors que la liste indique que le total des \u00e9lecteurs participants s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 51, un comptage manuel des noms ray\u00e9s sur la liste donne 52. Je partage le point de vue de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir que la fiabilit\u00e9 de ce document est discutable. La liste de suivi officielle ne faisait pas partie de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[63] Trois ans apr\u00e8s le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, soit le 5 novembre 2010, M. Catagas a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit \u00e0 la demande du chef David Albert LeDoux. Le paragraphe 3 de cet affidavit \u00e9nonce ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nEn raison de documents manquants, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019\u00e0 cette date ou vers celle-ci, le Conseil signe les documents et confirme par la pr\u00e9sente leur validit\u00e9. Cela est fait dans l\u2019espoir de mettre un terme aux points litigieux et afin que le gouvernement de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler (repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le chef Gordon LeDoux et les conseillers Roy Vermette et Ronnie Ducharme) soit reconnu et exerce son r\u00f4le, et reconnaisse les attentes des gens (les membres) dans le cadre de la loi \u00e9lectorale et de la constitution, en d\u2019autres termes par la tenue de r\u00e9unions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res de la bande, la transparence, la mise en place de m\u00e9canismes de recours et une bonne communication entre toutes les parties.\n[64] En d\u00e9posant cet affidavit, M. Catagas a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9soudre le conflit entourant la validit\u00e9 de la loi r\u00e9gissant l\u2019appartenance, la constitution et la loi \u00e9lectorale de la Nation. Malheureusement, le document ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ces questions litigieuses et a, en fait, accentu\u00e9 la confusion lorsque M. Catagas a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 2 :\n[traduction]\nLa constitution de la bande est un document valide, dans lequel est reconnu le r\u00f4le consultatif du Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s. La constitution pr\u00e9sente les pouvoirs du chef et du conseil ainsi que des membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler. Le fait que le document n\u2019a pas pass\u00e9 au premier r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, en raison de l\u2019exigence de la double majorit\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 au deuxi\u00e8me exigeant une majorit\u00e9 simple. Les dates exactes ne sont pas connues en raison de documents manquants au bureau de la bande.\n[65] Malgr\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration, la constitution ne fait aucunement mention d\u2019une double majorit\u00e9. Seule la loi \u00e9lectorale fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019une double majorit\u00e9 et uniquement aux fins de la modification de la loi \u00e9lectorale apr\u00e8s son adoption initiale. La loi en question pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2o) que la [traduction] \u00ab double majorit\u00e9 \u00bb correspond \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab 50 pour 100 plus un de tous les \u00e9lecteurs admissibles selon la liste des \u00e9lecteurs \u00bb. M. Catagas n\u2019a pu expliquer cette divergence.\n[66] Je reconnais que, selon la loi \u00e9lectorale, un vote \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 simple, majorit\u00e9 qui est compos\u00e9e des personnes ayant pris part au scrutin, est suffisant pour l\u2019adoption de cette loi. Je ne suis toutefois pas convaincu que la preuve montre que cette majorit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue. En plus de la fiabilit\u00e9 douteuse de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 2, qui est le seul document \u00e0 faire \u00e9tat des r\u00e9sultats qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum de 2007, le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum commportait de nombreux probl\u00e8mes de proc\u00e9dure, notamment le manque de preuve attestant signification aux membres, le manque d\u2019affichage ad\u00e9quat en vue d\u2019informer les membres de la tenue du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum et l\u2019absence de documents.\nAutres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant l\u2019adoption de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance\n[67] Sharon Tanner a affirm\u00e9 avoir entendu parler pour la premi\u00e8re fois d\u2019une exigence relative \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance pour les postes de chef et de conseillers, en 2005\u20112006, lorsqu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre plus active sur le plan politique. Elle all\u00e8gue que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle repr\u00e9sentait une menace pour les dirigeants de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, du fait qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de la confiance et du soutien de nombreux membres de la bande.\n[68] Mme Tanner a expliqu\u00e9 que, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les conseillers Gordon LeDoux, qui est le fr\u00e8re du chef David Ledoux, et Donna McGillivray, la cousine germaine du chef, \u00e9taient soup\u00e7onn\u00e9s d\u2019utiliser les fonds de mani\u00e8re abusive. Le 1er novembre 2006, le m\u00e9contentement croissant des membres de la bande \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs dirigeants a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une manifestation \u00e0 laquelle ont particip\u00e9 plus de 50 membres du bureau de la bande qui demandaient une rencontre avec le chef et les membres du conseil. Ceux-ci ont refus\u00e9 d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 cette demande et les membres ont donc tenu leur propre r\u00e9union au cours de laquelle ils ont adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution de la bande visant \u00e0 \u00e9vincer Donna McGillivray. Mme Tanner a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la r\u00e9solution de la bande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 AINC et que, lorsque, le 9 novembre 2006, les membres ont tenu une \u00e9lection partielle en vue de trouver un rempla\u00e7ant, AINC a envoy\u00e9 un repr\u00e9sentant, M. McDougall, pour qu\u2019il agisse en qualit\u00e9 de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections. Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lue par acclamation au poste de conseill\u00e8re. Ce t\u00e9moignage est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par la liste des chefs et conseillers de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler de 1885 \u00e0 2008, qui se trouve \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 36. Ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, Mme Tanner figure sur cette liste comme conseill\u00e8re.\n[69] Lorsque Mme Tanner s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le lendemain au bureau de la bande, le bureau \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 clef. Gordon LeDoux et Mme McGillivray avaient avis\u00e9 Mme Tanner qu\u2019ils ne la reconnaissaient pas comme conseill\u00e8re et que Mme McGillivray exer\u00e7ait toujours la charge de conseill\u00e8re de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler. Mme Tanner \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer cette charge.\n[70] Ce m\u00eame jour, Gordon LeDoux et Donna McGillivray ont adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande qui refusait \u00e0 Mme Tanner l\u2019acc\u00e8s au bureau de la bande, au service de sant\u00e9 (sauf en situation d\u2019urgence), au b\u00e2timent polyvalent et au chantier de construction. Selon la r\u00e9solution, Mme Tanner s\u2019\u00e9tait adress\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s de la bande sur le chantier, en prof\u00e9rant des [traduction] \u00ab menaces de licenciement et de recrutement qui mettaient en p\u00e9ril notre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 fonctionner en tant que bande \u00bb; il \u00e9tait estim\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab si nous voulons exercer nos fonctions comme dirigeants de notre Premi\u00e8re Nation, nous devons \u00e9viter tout dissident qui souhaite semer le trouble et cr\u00e9er des perturbations ici sur les lieux de travail \u00bb : pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 23. Mme Tanner a affirm\u00e9 que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans la r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande n\u2019avaient jamais eu lieu et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait cibl\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait per\u00e7ue par les conseillers comme une [traduction] \u00ab fautrice de troubles \u00bb.\n[71] La collectivit\u00e9 a continu\u00e9 d\u2019exprimer son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses dirigeants pendant les ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi. Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, en 2008, la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler a re\u00e7u trois millions de dollars et qu\u2019un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 un million est disparu. Le 9 ao\u00fbt 2010, le Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s a tenu une r\u00e9union avec les membres pour discuter de ces questions. Selon le compte rendu de la r\u00e9union (pi\u00e8ce HRC\u20111, onglet 4), plus de 50 personnes \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes. Soixante\u2011deux membres de la bande ont vot\u00e9 pour la r\u00e9vocation du chef Gordon LeDoux et de la conseill\u00e8re Donna McGillivray; Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e chef par int\u00e9rim et Rose Demontigny, conseill\u00e8re par int\u00e9rim. Mme Tanner all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que les membres l\u2019avaient d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, elle ainsi que Eugene Tanner et Harlene Swain, pour aller rencontrer les responsables de Vanguard Credit Union et faire la lumi\u00e8re sur ce qui \u00e9tait advenu des fonds manquants.\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante au sujet de sa nomination \u00e0 titre de chef par int\u00e9rim, ce qui porte \u00e0 croire que les signatures figurant sur la pi\u00e8ce HRC\u20111, onglet 4, sont fausses. Eugene Tanner et Harlene Swain ont tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Tanner n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme chef par int\u00e9rim, mais ils ont reconnu qu\u2019une p\u00e9tition avait circul\u00e9 pour d\u00e9mettre de leurs fonctions, le chef et les membres du conseil. Ils soutiennent que personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu chef par int\u00e9rim \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas vot\u00e9 pour Mme Tanner parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas une descendante unie par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner. Cependant, ils ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient accompagn\u00e9 Mme Tanner \u00e0 Vanguard Credit Union, le 10 ao\u00fbt 2010.\n[73] La plaignante a fait valoir que son engagement politique est \u00e0 la base de la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 l\u2019adoption du crit\u00e8re exigeant une descendance consanguine. Elle soutient que ce n\u2019est pas un hasard si, le 5 novembre 2010, soit moins de trois mois apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union des a\u00een\u00e9s o\u00f9 elle soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour agir comme chef par int\u00e9rim, le chef Gordon LeDoux a demand\u00e9 que Larry Catagas d\u00e9pose un affidavit affirmant ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nJe d\u00e9clare en outre, en ce qui concerne la question litigieuse relative \u00e0 la loi \u00e9lectorale et \u00e0 la constitution de la bande, ainsi qu\u2019aux pouvoirs du chef et du conseil, y compris le pouvoir du Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s :\n1.

Elle fait valoir que l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la loi \u00e9lectorale a \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e par AINC; que la Nation a conclu un contrat avec un tiers en vue de l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la loi \u00e9lectorale pour veiller \u00e0 ce que les \u00e9lections se d\u00e9roulent correctement, que le tiers a rencontr\u00e9 les membres \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises et que celui-ci a \u00e9labor\u00e9 la loi \u00e9lectorale en fonction des commentaires qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7us de l\u2019ensemble des membres. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la loi \u00e9lectorale \u00e9tait un stratag\u00e8me n\u2019est, essentiellement, rien d\u2019autre qu\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se laissant entendre que le recours aux services d\u2019un tiers, le processus de consultation au complet et le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre avec l\u2019intention cach\u00e9e d\u2019exclure la plaignante de la gouvernance, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019au moment du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, la plaignante ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais port\u00e9e candidate pour devenir chef et que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements avaient eu lieu avant que cette derni\u00e8re participe au rassemblement visant \u00e0 d\u00e9mettre de leurs fonctions le chef et les membres du conseil en 2006.\n[76] Mme Tanner b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la confiance et du soutien de nombreux membres de sa collectivit\u00e9 comme en t\u00e9moigne son \u00e9lection \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re en 2006 et le fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour rencontrer les responsables de Vanguard Credit Union afin de faire la lumi\u00e8re sur ce qui \u00e9tait advenu des fonds manquants de la bande en 2010. \u00c0 mon avis, les dirigeants de la Nation, en particulier Gordon LeDoux, lorsque la plupart de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont eu lieu, se sentaient menac\u00e9s par l\u2019engagement politique de Mme Tanner. La r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande de 2006, publi\u00e9e le jour suivant l\u2019\u00e9lection comme conseill\u00e8re de Mme Tanner, t\u00e9moigne clairement de cette crainte et de ce d\u00e9sir d\u2019emp\u00eacher Mme Tanner de nuire davantage \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de leur autorit\u00e9. Je ne peux pas d\u00e9terminer de fa\u00e7on concluante que la principale motivation pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la direction, mais l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale trois ans apr\u00e8s le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum initial sur la question jette une ombre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[77] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pu fournir une explication cr\u00e9dible relativement au fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en 2010, d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale. Eugene Tanner a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la loi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par AINC, mais Larry Catagas a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019un tel d\u00e9lai avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 et, malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une lettre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, aucun document de cette nature n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. En outre, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Larry Catagas d\u2019expliquer pourquoi la loi \u00e9lectorale avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e trois ans apr\u00e8s le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, il n\u2019a pu fournir d\u2019explication. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne fait que renforcer les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et la preuve contradictoire entourant l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale. Il m\u2019incite \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il est plus probable que, m\u00eame si la loi \u00e9lectorale ou la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e au d\u00e9part en toute bonne foi, son adoption officielle en 2010 visait, du moins en partie, \u00e0 emp\u00eacher Mme Tanner de se porter candidate au poste de chef.\n[78] En cons\u00e9quence, outre ma conclusion selon laquelle la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance n\u2019est pas rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la fonction de chef ou de conseiller de la Nation, je conclus \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi. J\u2019aborderai maintenant les autres arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les contraintes excessives.\nLa r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance est\u2011elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, en ce sens que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut pas composer avec les personnes qui ne sont pas les descendants unis par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner sans subir une contrainte excessive?\n[79] L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la question de savoir si la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance contenue dans la loi \u00e9lectorale est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire soul\u00e8ve deux questions :\nL\u2019\u00e9tendue du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale par la Premi\u00e8re Nation : le droit de la Premi\u00e8re Nation \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale inclut\u2011il le droit de d\u00e9terminer qui est apte \u00e0 gouverner la Premi\u00e8re Nation?\nIl y a aussi la question au sujet de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1.2 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.C. 2008, ch. 30, et de l\u2019incidence des traditions juridiques et des r\u00e8gles de droit coutumier des Premi\u00e8res Nations sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP.\nLe droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale\n[80] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, une Premi\u00e8re Nation a un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et ce droit est essentiel (raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire) pour l\u2019avenir et l\u2019autosuffisance des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Elle fait valoir que le gouvernement du Canada a adopt\u00e9 une approche strat\u00e9gique qui consid\u00e8re l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale autochtone comme un droit inh\u00e9rent selon le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. En outre, elle signale que cette approche est conforme aux articles 3 et 4 de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il est important de permettre l\u2019\u00e9laboration de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures propres \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation pour garantir le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Si une Premi\u00e8re Nation n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00e9laborer des politiques conformes \u00e0 la culture unique de la Premi\u00e8re Nation et qu\u2019il lui faut plut\u00f4t \u00e9laborer des politiques internes conformes aux lois en vigueur au Canada, alors le droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale est d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de sens. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Nation soutient que des politiques et des proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9lections sont particuli\u00e8rement importantes, parce que l\u2019\u00e9lection des dirigeants, de par sa nature m\u00eame, fait partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale.\n[81] Comme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans ses observations, un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme faisant n\u00e9cessairement partie du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je constate que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 RCS 821, au paragraphe 27, que \u00ab [l]es droits ancestraux, y compris toute revendication du droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances propres \u00e0 chaque affaire et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019histoire et de la culture particuli\u00e8res du groupe autochtone qui revendique le droit \u00bb. Mis \u00e0 part les arguments en mati\u00e8re de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle dispose d\u2019un droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale compte tenu de son histoire et de sa culture particuli\u00e8res.\n[82] En outre, m\u00eame si la Nation avait \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019un tel droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, cela ne met pas n\u00e9cessairement ses mesures \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un r\u00e8glement pris en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation du Canada, y compris la LCDP.

Big Eagle, [1992] A.C.F. no 16 (QL) (Bigstone), la \u00ab coutume \u00bb doit inclure \u00ab des pratiques touchant le choix d\u2019un conseil qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement acceptables pour les membres de la bande, qui font donc l\u2019objet d\u2019un large consensus \u00bb. Si un litige survient au sujet d\u2019une coutume, il incombe \u00e0 la partie qui invoque la coutume, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de prouver son existence et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui la composent, et de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle fait r\u00e9ellement l\u2019objet d\u2019un large consensus parmi les membres de la bande (Francis c. Conseil mohawk de Kanesatake, [2003] 4 RCF 1133, aux paragraphes 21 \u00e0 24 (Francis); et voir \u00e9galement McArthur c. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 1992 CanLII 8090 (C.B.R. Sask.)).\n[88] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bigstone, le juge Strayer (alors juge de la Section de premi\u00e8re instance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) a conclu que, lors de l\u2019examen de la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une coutume ou de la constitution r\u00e9gissant la composition et le choix des membres d\u2019un conseil de bande, la question v\u00e9ritable semble se rattacher \u00e0 la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 politique, et non juridique. Les cours qui se retrouvent dans cette situation doivent r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question suivante : \u00ab la constitution r\u00e9sulte-t-elle de l\u2019accord de la majorit\u00e9 de ceux qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve produite, paraissent \u00eatre des membres de la bande? \u00bb Ce faisant, une cour doit cependant appliquer des crit\u00e8res juridiques discernables.\n[89] Ces crit\u00e8res juridiques sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s aux paragraphes 22 \u00e0 24 et 26 dans la d\u00e9cision Francis (voir \u00e9galement Shotclose c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Stoney, 2011 CF 750, au paragraphe 69). Une coutume doit inclure : (1) les \u00ab pratiques \u00bb touchant le choix d\u2019un conseil; (2) des pratiques qui sont \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement acceptables pour les membres de la bande \u00bb; (3) des pratiques qui font l\u2019objet d\u2019un \u00ab large consensus \u00bb. Les \u00ab pratiques \u00bb peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies soit par des actes r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, soit au moyen d\u2019une mesure isol\u00e9e comme l\u2019adoption d\u2019un code \u00e9lectoral. Afin qu\u2019une pratique soit \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement acceptable pour les membres de la bande \u00bb, elle doit indiquer \u00ab la manifestation de la volont\u00e9 des personnes souhaitant l\u2019adoption de r\u00e8gles relatives au mode d\u2019\u00e9lection des membres d\u2019un conseil de bande d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9es par une r\u00e8gle ou pratique donn\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[90] Ce qui constitue un \u00ab large consensus \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini plus amplement aux paragraphes 36 et 37 de la d\u00e9cision Francis, o\u00f9 le juge Martineau a \u00e9crit ceci :\nPour qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle devienne une coutume, la pratique se rapportant \u00e0 une question ou situation donn\u00e9e qui est vis\u00e9e par cette r\u00e8gle doit \u00eatre fermement \u00e9tablie, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et suivie de mani\u00e8re uniforme et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e par une majorit\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9, ce qui d\u00e9montrera un \u00ab large consensus \u00bb quant \u00e0 son applicabilit\u00e9. Cette description exclurait les comportements sporadiques visant \u00e0 corriger des difficult\u00e9s d\u2019application exceptionnelles \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 ainsi que d\u2019autres pratiques qui sont manifestement consid\u00e9r\u00e9es au sein de la communaut\u00e9 comme des pratiques suivies \u00e0 titre d\u2019essai. S\u2019il existe, ce \u00ab large consensus \u00bb prouvera la volont\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 de ne pas consid\u00e9rer le code \u00e9lectoral adopt\u00e9 comme un document exhaustif et exclusif. Ce consensus aura pour effet d\u2019exclure de l\u2019\u00e9quation un nombre infime de membres d\u2019une bande qui se sont constamment oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019adoption d\u2019une r\u00e8gle r\u00e9gissant les \u00e9lections \u00e0 titre de r\u00e8gle coutumi\u00e8re.\n\u00c0 mon avis, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les d\u00e9cisions susmentionn\u00e9es, la v\u00e9ritable question qui se pose quant \u00e0 la mesure dans laquelle une r\u00e9solution ou d\u00e9cision d\u2019une bande ou un code \u00e9lectoral adopt\u00e9 traduit la coutume de la bande en question peut \u00eatre formul\u00e9e comme suit : la r\u00e9solution, la d\u00e9cision ou le code est-il fond\u00e9 sur un consensus majoritaire de toutes les personnes qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve existante, semblent \u00eatre membres de la bande, quel que soit leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence?\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[91] Bien que ces affaires fournissent un cadre juridique large pour nous aider \u00e0 examiner la loi \u00e9lectorale et sa r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la question de savoir si la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9nonce des pratiques qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement acceptables pour les membres de la bande et qui font l\u2019objet d\u2019un large consensus \u00bb demeure une plainte de nature tr\u00e8s factuelle.\n[92] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la loi \u00e9lectorale ne constituait pas la premi\u00e8re tentative de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler de codifier son processus \u00e9lectoral. Plus de dix ans avant la tenue du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, la Nation a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9bauche du R\u00e8glement de 1993 sur les coutumes dans l\u2019optique de cr\u00e9er une codification similaire. La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cet effort est expliqu\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9ambule du document :\n[traduction]\nPar le pass\u00e9, la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler a assez bien fonctionn\u00e9 sans r\u00e8gles ni proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites. Dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 contemporaine, il faut consigner toutes les op\u00e9rations et \u00e9laborer des r\u00e8gles et des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites pour l\u2019observation de la loi et le maintien de l\u2019ordre. Les membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler se sont aper\u00e7us qu\u2019ils doivent eux aussi \u00e9laborer des r\u00e8gles et des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites, surtout en raison des questions complexes qui sont soulev\u00e9es quotidiennement. Il est donc convenu que les membres adopteront les r\u00e8gles et les proc\u00e9dures suivantes pour le bienfait et le mieux-\u00eatre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\n[93] Des t\u00e9moins ont confirm\u00e9 l\u2019existence du R\u00e8glement sur les coutumes, notamment Sharon Tanner et Larry Catagas, et leur t\u00e9moignage respectif n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le document pr\u00e9cise que le R\u00e8glement sur les coutumes a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une premi\u00e8re lecture et d\u2019une seconde lecture les 4 octobre et 4 novembre 1993. Toutefois, la preuve ne permet pas de confirmer s\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une troisi\u00e8me lecture. Il n\u2019est donc pas clairement \u00e9tabli si le R\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 ou non.\n[94] Le R\u00e8glement sur les coutumes permet d\u2019\u00e9tayer le t\u00e9moignage de Sharon Tanner, dans lequel elle a reconnu que la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler d\u00e9tenait des pratiques qui pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des lois coutumi\u00e8res ou des traditions. Par exemple, le R\u00e8glement sur les coutumes reconnaissait l\u2019importance accord\u00e9e aux a\u00een\u00e9s :\n[traduction]\nConseil des a\u00een\u00e9s : la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler a reconnu et respecte le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par les a\u00een\u00e9s, pour leur sagesse, leurs conseils d\u2019ordre spirituel et leurs d\u00e9cisions, dans le souci d\u2019assurer le mieux-\u00eatre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler. Le Conseil des a\u00een\u00e9s sera pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e9unions du Conseil.\n[95] Par contre, le R\u00e8glement sur les coutumes ne faisait nul renvoi \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle limitant le poste de chef aux descendants de John (Falcon) Tanner, et Sharon Tanner a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention de cette limitation durant les ann\u00e9es 1980 et 1990, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle sache. Ce point de vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par divers t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de leur t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019exigence voulant que le chef et les membres du conseil soient des descendants de la lign\u00e9e de John (Falcon) Tanner constituait depuis fort longtemps un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de leur patrimoine et de leur identit\u00e9.\n[96] Durant la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages qui ont confirm\u00e9 l\u2019histoire unique de John (Falcon) Tanner et son importance par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 culturelle de la Nation. Le t\u00e9moignage de Rose LeDoux, qui est l\u2019\u00e9pouse du chef David LeDoux et n\u2019est pas une descendante de John (Falcon) Tanner par les liens du sang, n\u2019a aucune valeur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Rose LeDoux, le chef David LeDoux, Roxanne Brass et Eugene Tanner ont tous t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la richesse de leur histoire et le caract\u00e8re unique de leur lign\u00e9e commune constituaient une source de fiert\u00e9.\n[97] Sharon Tanner n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 l\u2019importance que rev\u00eat l\u2019h\u00e9ritage de John (Falcon) Tanner. Son \u00e9poux, ses enfants et ses petits-enfants sont tous ses descendants. Mme Tanner a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a pass\u00e9 30 ans au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler et qu\u2019elle la consid\u00e8re comme sa collectivit\u00e9 d\u2019origine. Elle conteste toutefois le fait que cet h\u00e9ritage se traduise par une exigence voulant que les chefs et les conseillers soient des descendants unis par les liens du sang. Je souligne que, lorsque les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se sont fait demander si une personne, non descendante par les liens du sang, pouvait poss\u00e9der la sagesse, le souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la patience ainsi qu\u2019une solide compr\u00e9hension des traditions juridiques et des r\u00e8gles de droit coutumier de la Nation, de bonnes qualit\u00e9s pour les postes de chef et de conseiller, ils ont tous convenu que c\u2019\u00e9tait possible.\n[98] En outre, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e n\u2019a pas permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on concluante que tous les chefs de la Nation \u00e9taient des descendants unis par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Roxanne Brass a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle croyait que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 moins qu\u2019un, dont je ne suis pas au courant, ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se faufiler \u00bb et la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 36, qui dresse la liste des chefs et des conseillers par le pass\u00e9, comporte un long intervalle o\u00f9 il n\u2019y aucun ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent en ce qui a trait aux titulaires de ces postes. Le chef David LeDoux et son \u00e9pouse Rose LeDoux ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que des experts avaient publi\u00e9 des ouvrages sur l\u2019histoire de John (Falcon) Tanner et qu\u2019ils avaient parl\u00e9 du caract\u00e8re unique de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, mais aucune de ces publications n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve. Les a\u00een\u00e9s de la collectivit\u00e9 seraient sans doute les mieux plac\u00e9s pour fournir une perspective historique quant \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et toutes les parties ont convenu que les a\u00een\u00e9s ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 au sein de la collectivit\u00e9. Toutefois, Albert Tanner \u00e9tait le seul t\u00e9moin qui pouvait raisonnablement \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019a\u00een\u00e9, et il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sur ce point.\n[99] Le Tribunal se retrouve donc avec le t\u00e9moignage contradictoire de la plaignante, dont la relation avec la bande et la collectivit\u00e9 et la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au sein de celle-ci sont les plus longues sans interruption, et le t\u00e9moignage de Roxanne Brass, qui a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans la collectivit\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 1990, celui d\u2019Eugene Tanner, qui n\u2019a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 que tout r\u00e9cemment au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, et ceux de David et de Rose LeDoux qui ont d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 au sein de la collectivit\u00e9 en 2009. Je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante est plus convaincant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[100] M\u00eame si je pouvais parvenir \u00e0 la conclusion que tous les chefs de la Nation par le pass\u00e9 \u00e9taient des descendants de John (Falcon) Tanner, je ne crois pas que cela permettrait d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une \u00ab coutume \u00bb. Parmi les 256 membres de la Nation, seulement quatre ou cinq n\u2019appartiennent pas \u00e0 la lign\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne serait pas surprenant que personne ne faisant pas partie de la lign\u00e9e n\u2019ait agi comme chef. Autrement dit, bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse sans doute d\u2019une pratique que les chefs appartiennent \u00e0 la lign\u00e9e, cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 peut tout simplement exister en raison de la situation d\u00e9mographique de la Nation et cela n\u2019am\u00e8ne pas \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il existe un large consensus parmi les membres de la bande selon lequel les membres qui ne font pas partie de la lign\u00e9e n\u2019ont pas le droit d\u2019occuper ce poste.\n[101] Je suis par ailleurs convaincu que la loi \u00e9lectorale n\u2019est pas \u00ab fermement \u00e9tablie, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et suivie de mani\u00e8re uniforme et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e par une majorit\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb du fait qu\u2019elle requiert que les candidats tant au poste de chef que celui de conseiller soient des descendants unis par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 assez clairement que les conseillers pouvaient \u00eatre des personnes ne faisant pas partie de la lign\u00e9e. En plus de Mme Tanner, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e \u00e0 ce poste en 2006, sa m\u00e8re, Patricia Tanner, de m\u00eame que Darlene Tanner ont agi \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8res et elles n\u2019\u00e9taient ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des descendantes unis par les liens du sang.\n[102] Enfin, compte tenu des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et de la preuve contradictoire entourant le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum de 2007 sur la loi \u00e9lectorale, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que la pratique consistant \u00e0 limiter le poste de chef aux descendants de John (Falcon) Tanner fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un large consensus. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je fais remarquer que seulement 51 des 124 \u00e9lecteurs admissibles ont vot\u00e9 lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection, et que seulement 57 pour 100 d\u2019entre eux ont vot\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale.\n[103] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fonde sa r\u00e9ponse sur la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Premi\u00e8re Nation du Lac des Mille-Lacs c. Chapman, 1998 CanLII 8004 (CF) (Chapman), o\u00f9, malgr\u00e9 un taux de participation de 28 pour 100 aux \u00e9lections, et o\u00f9 environ 21 pour 100 des membres ayant un droit de vote ont vot\u00e9 en faveur d\u2019un code d\u2019\u00e9lection des chefs et conseillers selon la coutume, la Cour a conclu qu\u2019il existait un consensus assez large pour conclure que le code constituait une coutume. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, toutefois, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 la situation particuli\u00e8re des membres de cette Premi\u00e8re Nation : au nombre des 300 membres qui avaient droit de vote seulement 130 environ pouvaient \u00eatre localis\u00e9s (Chapman, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a soulign\u00e9, en outre, qu\u2019il y avait une tendance \u00e0 la non-participation dans cette collectivit\u00e9, m\u00eame parmi les membres connus qui avaient droit de vote (Chapman, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a donc conclu ce qui suit :\nla participation de 86 membres votants et le fait qu\u2019il y a eu 73 votes exprim\u00e9s (64 pour, 7 contre, un sans avis et un bulletin nul) constitue un assez large consensus dans les circonstances pour que le code d\u2019\u00e9lection soit assimilable \u00e0 la coutume de la bande.\n(Chapman, au paragraphe 29)\n[104] Le vote dans la d\u00e9cision Chapman a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une approbation du code de s\u00e9lection dans une proportion de 87 pour 100. Par contre, la loi \u00e9lectorale dans cette affaire-l\u00e0 a seulement \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e dans une proportion de 57 pour 100, et le taux de participation \u00e9lectorale \u00e9tait peu \u00e9lev\u00e9. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune circonstance sp\u00e9ciale permettant d\u2019expliquer le faible taux de participation \u00e9lectorale ou l\u2019adoption du code \u00e9lectoral par une faible majorit\u00e9. J\u2019estime donc que l\u2019affaire Chapman se distingue des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, o\u00f9 je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il existe un large consensus selon lequel la loi \u00e9lectorale, y compris la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, constitue une coutume de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\n[105] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance constitue une \u00ab tradition juridique ou r\u00e8gle de droit coutumier \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 1.2 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Vu cette conclusion, il n\u2019y a pas lieu que j\u2019examine la question de savoir si l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1.2 appuie une interpr\u00e9tation large des facteurs de contrainte excessive suivant le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[106] Par ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019autres arguments concernant une contrainte excessive. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\nD. Conclusion au sujet de la premi\u00e8re question : plainte jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e\n[107] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de justification r\u00e9elle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la preuve prima facie de discrimination de la plaignante. Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun lien rationnel entre la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et la fonction de chef ou de conseiller, que la r\u00e8gle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte concernant la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance est fond\u00e9e.\nIII. Deuxi\u00e8me question : autre traitement diff\u00e9rentiel all\u00e9gu\u00e9\n[108] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance n\u2019est pas la seule manifestation de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 son \u00e9gard parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas une descendante de John (Falcon) Tanner. En avril 2011, la plaignante s\u2019est vue refuser sa demande d\u2019aide au revenu, faisant ainsi en sorte qu\u2019elle a perdu son allocation de logement (A. Refus d\u2019accorder une aide au revenu). Elle all\u00e8gue en outre qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vue refuser l\u2019utilisation de la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale (B. Refus d\u2019utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale). Enfin, elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 bannie du bureau du conseil de bande, ainsi que des installations m\u00e9dicales et du centre communautaire de la bande, et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue des activit\u00e9s et services communautaires (C. Expulsion des installations de la bande et exclusion des activit\u00e9s et des services).\n[109] Avant d\u2019examiner chacune de ces all\u00e9gations, il importe de souligner que la relation entre les parties est difficile depuis bon nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet de deux r\u00e9solutions de la bande qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es en mars 2000 en vue de renvoyer la plaignante de la collectivit\u00e9, ainsi que de la retirer des postes qu\u2019elle occupait au sein de la bande \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante en sant\u00e9 communautaire et d\u2019intervenante dans le cadre du Programme de lutte contre l\u2019abus de l\u2019alcool et des drogues chez les Autochtones, postes que la plaignante occupait depuis 12 ans. Cette situation \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 une violente altercation survenue entre la plaignante, sa fille et le petit ami de sa fille et d\u2019autres membres de la collectivit\u00e9. Finalement, la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e de la collectivit\u00e9, mais elle a perdu les postes qu\u2019elle occupait au sein de la bande. La plaignante a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un conflit avec Roxanne Brass, la s\u0153ur du chef, en 2004 pendant le festival du bl\u00e9 d\u2019Inde, et il ressort de la preuve que des tensions existaient entre les deux femmes, ainsi qu\u2019entre Mme Tanner et la famille LeDoux. Dans ce contexte, il \u00e9tait parfois difficile de savoir si certains incidents concernant la plaignante se sont produits uniquement en raison de ce conflit qui persiste, ou si les incidents \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 son statut en qualit\u00e9 de personne ne faisant pas partie de la lign\u00e9e de John (Falcon) Tanner.\nA. Refus d\u2019accorder une aide au revenu\n(i) Les faits pertinents\n[110] Le 1er avril 2011, Mme Tanner a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Terry Tanner, l\u2019administrateur responsable de l\u2019aide sociale, une demande d\u2019aide au revenu. Selon Mme Tanner, Terry Tanner a rempli le formulaire pour elle et elle l\u2019a sign\u00e9. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la seule r\u00e9sidente \u00e0 son domicile. \u00c0 la ligne 205, apr\u00e8s la question [traduction] \u00ab Le demandeur est-il admissible \u00e0 recevoir une aide? \u00bb, Terry Tanner a inscrit un \u00ab X \u00bb \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du [traduction] \u00ab Oui \u00bb. Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019attendait \u00e0 recevoir une aide au revenu. Depuis 2001 environ, elle touchait des prestations d\u2019aide au revenu.\n[111] En avril 2011, peu apr\u00e8s que Mme Tanner eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande, Terry Tanner a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle et l\u2019a avis\u00e9e qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 une aide au revenu. Terry Tanner n\u2019a pas justifi\u00e9 le refus.\n[112] Le 10 juin 2011, Mme Tanner a de nouveau rempli une demande d\u2019aide au revenu avec l\u2019aide de Terry Tanner. Suivant la recommandation de Terry Tanner, la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait une automobile \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 17 000 $. Par ailleurs, et ce malgr\u00e9 l\u2019affirmation de la plaignante selon laquelle son ami, Fernand Barthelette, ne r\u00e9sidait pas avec elle, Terry Tanner a avis\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019elle devait inclure l\u2019information sur le revenu concernant toute personne qui \u00e9tait chez elle. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle le formulaire incluait le revenu mensuel de M. Barthelette.\n[113] Dans une lettre intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab lettre de rejet \u00bb, dat\u00e9e du 5 juillet 2011, Terry Tanner, en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019administrateur responsable de l\u2019aide au revenu, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Tanner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 une aide au revenu pour la raison suivante :\n[traduction]\nFern Barthelette touche une pension de vieillesse de 1 000 $ qui couvrira vos (Sharon Tanner) propres co\u00fbts en mati\u00e8re de besoins fondamentaux, d\u2019alimentation, de logement et de frais d\u2019utilisation. L\u2019aide au revenu couvrira les frais d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 quand ceux-ci d\u00e9passent le montant \u00e9tabli pour vos (Sharon Tanner) besoins fondamentaux.\n[114] Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7u cette lettre et qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait vue pour la premi\u00e8re fois alors qu\u2019elle se pr\u00e9parait pour la tenue de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n\u2019avoir eu que des conversations verbales avec Terry Tanner. Mme Tanner a appris qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 une aide au revenu lorsque, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, une aide \u00e9tait fournie et que Terry Tanner a dit \u00e0 sa fille, Charlene, qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible.\n[115] Mme Tanner a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait eu une conversation, peu de temps apr\u00e8s, avec l\u2019ancien chef Gordon LeDoux au sujet du fait qu\u2019une aide au revenu lui \u00e9tait refus\u00e9e. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Gordon LeDoux avait r\u00e9pondu en lui disant quelque chose comme : [traduction] \u00ab Eh bien, pourquoi vous ne retournez pas \u00e0 Sagkeeng, l\u2019endroit d\u2019o\u00f9 vous venez? L\u00e0, vous recevrez de l\u2019aide sociale. \u00bb (transcription, \u00e0 la page 85).\n[116] Mme Tanner a aussi parl\u00e9 au chef David LeDoux, qui lui a dit de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 AINC. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait communiqu\u00e9 avec AINC, mais que rien n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Elle a de nouveau pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019aide au revenu le 25 septembre 2013 et elle a inscrit M. Barthelette en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9poux, encore une fois suivant les conseils de Terry Tanner. Au moment de l\u2019audience, Mme Tanner n\u2019avait toujours pas re\u00e7u d\u2019aide au revenu. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa fille Charlene la soutenait financi\u00e8rement.\n(ii) Observations des parties et analyse\n[117] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages et des observations d\u00e9taill\u00e9s en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si la plaignante vivait en union de fait avec M. Barthelette. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais eu autre chose qu\u2019un lien d\u2019amiti\u00e9 avec M. Barthelette, qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet depuis les ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 elle fr\u00e9quentait le coll\u00e8ge, et elle soutient qu\u2019elle entretenait, en fait, une relation avec un autre homme pendant une partie de cette p\u00e9riode. Mme Tanner a ajout\u00e9 M. Barthelette \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sident \u00e0 son domicile et plus tard \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9poux sur ses demandes d\u2019aide au revenu uniquement parce que Terry Tanner lui avait conseill\u00e9 de le faire. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Barthelette \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 chez elle quelques fois durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e, pendant le temps des F\u00eates et au printemps, pour l\u2019aider avec son jardin. Elle a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 chez elle environ trois mois par ann\u00e9e. Elle a ni\u00e9 l\u2019avoir appel\u00e9 son [traduction] \u00ab vieux \u00bb et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne lui avait fourni aucun soutien financier.\n[118] La plaignante fait par ailleurs valoir que le Tribunal devrait tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que Terry Tanner n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Charles Baptiste, un conseiller aux affaires sociales pour le West Region Tribal Council, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 pour parler de la question de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide au revenu, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec la plaignante et il ne s\u2019est pas occup\u00e9 de ses demandes d\u2019aide au revenu.\n[119] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la preuve appuie une conclusion selon laquelle la plaignante entretenait une relation conjugale avec M. Barthelette et que, dans ces circonstances, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Baptiste, ils sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant l\u00e9galement mari\u00e9s par AINC aux fins de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide au revenu. De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le fait que AINC a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate et a \u00e9tabli que le dossier de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 convenablement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que la preuve appuie une conclusion selon laquelle la plaignante s\u2019est vue refuser \u00e0 juste titre l\u2019aide au revenu. Elle souligne que, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision, le refus de la demande de la plaignante n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une descendante de John (Falcon) Tanner et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne peut \u00eatre affirm\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision est discriminatoire.\n[120] Monsieur Baptiste a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a examin\u00e9 le formulaire de profil du locataire de la Premi\u00e8re Nation, o\u00f9 elle a inscrit M. Barthelette \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sident \u00e0 son domicile, les cartes d\u2019enregistrement de la plaignante et de M. Barthelette \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Manitoba, qui indiquent la m\u00eame adresse postale, ainsi que sa demande d\u2019aide au revenu pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 10 juin 2011, dans laquelle la pension de M. Barthelette est inscrite comme partie de son [traduction] \u00ab revenu non gagn\u00e9 \u00bb, et qu\u2019elle ne serait pas admissible \u00e0 l\u2019aide au revenu. Cela est attribuable au fait que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve am\u00e8neraient M. Baptiste \u00e0 conclure que la plaignante et M. Barthelette vivaient en union de fait et que, puisque ce dernier touche une pension de vieillesse, Mme Tanner ne serait pas admissible \u00e0 l\u2019aide sociale.\n[121] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin de formuler des commentaires au sujet d\u2019un document produit par AINC dans le cadre de ses [traduction] \u00ab Politiques et proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aide au revenu \u00bb, intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Liste de contr\u00f4le no 3 : liens de d\u00e9pendance \u00bb. Selon le document, la liste de contr\u00f4le renferme :\n[traduction]\ndes facteurs pouvant indiquer qu\u2019un demandeur vit avec une autre personne, soit \u00e0 titre de conjoint de fait ou \u00e0 titre de partenaire de m\u00eame sexe. Leur utilisation n\u2019est pas obligatoire, mais les administrateurs responsables de l\u2019aide au revenu ainsi que leur personnel peuvent les juger utiles afin d\u2019administrer le Programme d\u2019aide au revenu de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et objective.\nIl y est aussi mentionn\u00e9 que : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019interd\u00e9pendance financi\u00e8re constitue le facteur le plus important. La preuve de l\u2019existence de deux de ces trois facteurs est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une union de fait \u00bb. Au facteur d\u2019interd\u00e9pendance financi\u00e8re, qui peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par la confirmation de l\u2019existence d\u2019un ou de plusieurs des sous-facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, s\u2019ajoutent d\u2019autres facteurs d\u00e9terminants, \u00e0 savoir [traduction] l\u2019\u00ab interd\u00e9pendance familiale \u00bb et le [traduction] \u00ab lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb.\n[122] Monsieur Baptiste a soutenu qu\u2019il connaissait ces facteurs et que, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la demande et les documents s\u2019y rapportant am\u00e8neraient l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une union de fait entre Mme Tanner et M. Barthelette. Il a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas personnellement Mme Tanner ou M. Barthelette.\n[123] Madame Tanner a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Barthelette \u00e9tait un ami qui venait rester chez elle \u00e0 l\u2019occasion et qui ne lui fournissait aucune aide financi\u00e8re. Roxanne Brass a contest\u00e9 le fait que M. Barthelette \u00e9tait un simple ami de Mme Tanner et elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait entendu Mme Tanner faire allusion \u00e0 lui comme \u00e9tant son vieux et que Charlene l\u2019appelait le petit ami de sa m\u00e8re.\n[124] Madame Tanner a affirm\u00e9 avoir inscrit M. Barthelette \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sident au sein de son m\u00e9nage et plus tard \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9poux uniquement parce que Terry Tanner lui avait conseill\u00e9 de le faire. Son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, puisque Terry Tanner, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit sur la liste des t\u00e9moins, n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[125] Toutefois, comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la question ici n\u2019est pas de savoir si Mme Tanner s\u2019est vue refuser l\u2019aide au revenu \u00e0 juste titre, ou m\u00eame si elle vivait en union de fait avec M. Barthelette, mais plut\u00f4t de savoir si les conseils que Terry Tanner lui a donn\u00e9s au moment de remplir sa demande d\u2019aide au revenu ont \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s par le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas une descendante unie par les liens du sang \u00e0 John (Falcon) Tanner, ou comme l\u2019a fait valoir la plaignante, en raison de sa situation de famille.\n[126] C\u2019est l\u00e0 que r\u00e9side la faiblesse de la position de la plaignante. Alors que les conseils de Terry Tanner peuvent avoir entra\u00een\u00e9 le rejet de la demande d\u2019aide sociale de la plaignante, rien dans la preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que ses conseils \u00e9taient li\u00e9s de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit \u00e0 la situation de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de personne ne faisant pas partie de la lign\u00e9e de John (Falcon) Tanner, ou m\u00eame que ses conseils \u00e9taient malavis\u00e9s. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le l\u2019existence d\u2019un conflit l\u00e9gitime sur la question de savoir si Mme Tanner vivait en union de fait avec M. Barthelette. Ce n\u2019est toutefois pas au Tribunal que revient la t\u00e2che d\u2019\u00e9tablir la situation matrimoniale de la plaignante. Le Tribunal doit plut\u00f4t \u00e9tablir s\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019ascendance constituait un facteur dans les conseils donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante par Terry Tanner, ou dans le rejet ultime de sa demande d\u2019aide sociale. Dans l\u2019ensemble, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les gestes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ayant men\u00e9 au rejet de sa demande d\u2019aide sociale \u00e9taient discriminatoires de quelque fa\u00e7on qui soit.\nB. Refus d\u2019utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale\n[127] En f\u00e9vrier 2012, la plaignante a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de cancer et, plus tard, le pronostic selon lequel il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un cancer en phase terminale. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation d\u2019utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale de la Nation pour se rendre \u00e0 des rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait fait dire que la fourgonnette \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e ou, pour quelque autre raison, non disponible.\n[128] La fille de la plaignante, Charlene Tanner, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que d\u2019autres personnes lui avaient dit qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas utiliser la fourgonnette, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 que cela ne venait pas directement du chef ou des conseillers. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait reconduit sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 des rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 79 reprises, \u00e0 raison d\u2019environ 40 $ par voyage, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un montant total de 3 160 $. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a pr\u00e9tendu que le fait de refuser \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale constituait un m\u00e9pris sans borne \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[129] Le chef David LeDoux a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tous les membres de la Nation pouvaient utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale, que son utilisation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux descendants unis par les liens du sang.\n[130] \u00c0 part avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait vue refuser l\u2019utilisation de la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un acte de m\u00e9pris, les all\u00e9gations de Mme Tanner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne permettent pas de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite constituait un facteur dans le refus de lui laisser utiliser la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale, sur le fondement de l\u2019ascendance ou autrement. Il n\u2019y a pas eu non plus de preuve pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019absence de disponibilit\u00e9 de la fourgonnette m\u00e9dicale. Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie pour cette partie de sa plainte.\nC. Expulsion des installations de la bande et exclusion des activit\u00e9s et des services\n[131] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que la Nation a tent\u00e9 de l\u2019expulser de la collectivit\u00e9 et lui a refus\u00e9 divers services qui sont offerts aux autres membres de la bande, notamment des articles de jardinage, des r\u00e9novations, le d\u00e9neigement et la tonte de la pelouse.\n[132] En ce qui concerne l\u2019expulsion, deux r\u00e9solutions du conseil de bande \u00e9taient en cause. Voici ce que pr\u00e9voit la r\u00e9solution en date du 2 mars 2000 :\n[traduction]\nAttendu que les membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler vivant dans la r\u00e9serve s\u2019engagent \u00e0 lutter contre la violence au sein de la collectivit\u00e9.\nAttendu que les membres ne tol\u00e9reront pas les actes assimilables \u00e0 des actes perp\u00e9tr\u00e9s en groupe contre les membres, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les a\u00een\u00e9s qui se trouvent dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\nAttendu que les membres s\u2019entendent pour prendre des mesures afin que nous puissions vivre chez nous sans crainte.\nIl est r\u00e9solu que la majorit\u00e9 des membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler vous retirent, Sharon J. Tanner, Trait\u00e9 no 2940017602, le droit de r\u00e9sidence ici \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\nIl est r\u00e9solu que la majorit\u00e9 des membres de la bande vivant dans la r\u00e9serve et en \u00e2ge de voter conviennent que vous, Sharon J. Tanner, soyez renvoy\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on permanente de la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\n[133] Voici ce que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019autre r\u00e9solution en date du 3 mars 2000 :\n[traduction]\nAttendu que les membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler vivant dans la r\u00e9serve s\u2019engagent \u00e0 lutter contre la violence au sein de la collectivit\u00e9.\nAttendu que les membres ne tol\u00e9reront pas les actes assimilables \u00e0 des actes perp\u00e9tr\u00e9s en groupe contre les membres, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les a\u00een\u00e9s qui se trouvent dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler.\nAttendu que votre travail consiste \u00e0 aider les personnes dans le besoin, dans le cadre d\u2019emplois en sant\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante en sant\u00e9 communautaire (RSC) et d\u2019intervenante au sein du PNLAADA.\nIl est r\u00e9solu que la majorit\u00e9 des membres de la bande vivant dans la r\u00e9serve et en \u00e2ge de voter, conviennent de vous cong\u00e9dier, Sharon J. Tanner, de votre emploi de RSC et de celui d\u2019intervenante au sein du PNLAADA.\n[134] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ces r\u00e9solutions adopt\u00e9es par le conseil de bande faisaient suite aux actes violents de la plaignante et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec sa situation en tant que personne n\u2019\u00e9tant pas descendante de John (Falcon) Tanner par les liens du sang. Ces r\u00e9solutions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es quatre jours apr\u00e8s que la plaignante eut \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019incident violent avec d\u2019autres membres de la bande. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les dates d\u2019adoption des r\u00e9solutions du conseil de bande et les renvois sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 la [traduction] \u00ab violence \u00bb et aux [traduction] \u00ab actes assimilables \u00e0 des actes perp\u00e9tr\u00e9s en groupe \u00bb, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la preuve permet d\u2019\u00e9tayer une conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019expulsion de la plaignante \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 sa violence et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec son statut de personne qui n\u2019est pas une descendante par les liens du sang.\n[135] Il est ressorti de la preuve que les r\u00e9solutions du conseil de bande adopt\u00e9es en 2000 l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un incident violent auquel la plaignante avait pris part. La preuve a en outre r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, au fil des ans, Mme Tanner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule personne \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9e de la Nation. M\u00eame des descendants unis par les liens du sang l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9. Dans l\u2019ensemble, la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son ascendance constituait un facteur dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent traitement.\n[136] En ce qui a trait aux services li\u00e9s aux articles de jardinage, aux r\u00e9novations, au d\u00e9neigement et \u00e0 la tonte de pelouse, la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment des autres membres de la collectivit\u00e9, et encore moins que son ascendance constituait un facteur dans le cadre de tout traitement pr\u00e9judiciable. Le chef LeDoux a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations et il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019AINC assure uniquement un financement pour d\u00e9blayer les routes principales et les chemins des r\u00e9sidences dot\u00e9es de r\u00e9servoirs d\u2019eau; que les membres sont responsables de tondre leur propre pelouse; que les articles de jardinage sont fournis aux membres qui en font la demande, et que des r\u00e9novations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de la plaignante. Il s\u2019ensuit donc que cette partie de la plainte est \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. Troisi\u00e8me question : repr\u00e9sailles\n[137] Outre le fait d\u2019all\u00e9guer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire envers elle au moment d\u2019appliquer la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. L\u2019article 14.1 est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[138] Pour prouver que cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreint, comme c\u2019est le cas en ce qui concerne les autres actes discriminatoires, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En appliquant les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore dans le contexte de repr\u00e9sailles, la plaignante doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante pour justifier le fait que sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne constituait un facteur dans le cadre de tout traitement pr\u00e9judiciable dont elle a fait l\u2019objet suivant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu que la perception de repr\u00e9sailles par un plaignant, pourvu qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une perception raisonnable, peut constituer une preuve suffisante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (voir Wong c. Banque royale du Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (TCDP), aux paragraphes 218 \u00e0 223 (Wong)). Comme c\u2019est le cas pour d\u2019autres actes discriminatoires, il n\u2019existe \u00e9galement aucune exigence selon laquelle la plaignante, afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, doit prouver l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles (voir Wong, aux paragraphes 221 et 222; et First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. c. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2015 CHRT 14, aux paragraphes 3 \u00e0 27). Si une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles est \u00e9tablie, le Tribunal \u00e9tablira si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les deux parties, il est plus probable que le contraire qu\u2019il y ait eu des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[139] C\u2019est en gardant ce cadre juridique \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que j\u2019examinerai les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nA. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits pertinents\n[140] Le 26 juin 2012, un peu plus d\u2019un mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, la plaignante a pos\u00e9 sa candidature au poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 une entrevue. Le 4 juillet 2012, Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de vive voix par le conseiller Ron Ducharme qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e pour le poste. Le contrat, bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9, devait s\u2019appliquer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019exercice (29 mars 2013) et pouvait \u00eatre renouvell\u00e9 pour les prochaines ann\u00e9es. Mme Tanner devait commencer \u00e0 travailler le 9 juillet 2012, \u00e0 un salaire de 12 $ l\u2019heure, vers\u00e9 aux deux semaines, pour 80 heures de travail.\n[141] Deux jours plus tard, soit le 6 juillet 2012, le chef et le conseil ont re\u00e7u une copie de la plainte de Mme Tanner relative aux droits de la personne.\n[142] Dans une lettre en date du 9 juillet 2012, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par Rose LeDoux, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du chef, et sign\u00e9e par le chef, celui-ci a avis\u00e9 Mme Tanner qu\u2019elle avait obtenu le poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique \u00e0 condition qu\u2019elle accepte de retirer sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e relativement aux droits de la personne. La lettre est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nMadame Tanner,\nVous avez obtenu le poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler commen\u00e7ant le 9 juillet 2012, sous r\u00e9serve de lib\u00e9rer la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, le chef David LeDoux et le conseiller Roy Vermette de toute action intent\u00e9e contre eux dans le cadre de la plainte que vous avez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Une discussion de la pr\u00e9sente affaire a eu lieu en compagnie du conseiller Ronnie Ducharme, du conseiller Roy Vermette, de la directrice des finances Harlene Swain et du chef David LeDoux le 6 juillet 2012.\nM. Harold Cochrane, avocat, s\u2019occupera de r\u00e9diger une lettre d\u2019exon\u00e9ration \u00e0 cet effet.\nLe poste d\u2019agent de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique est un poste contractuel, sous r\u00e9serve de renouvellement chaque ann\u00e9e. Votre poste durant le pr\u00e9sent exercice s\u2019\u00e9tendra du 9 juillet 2012 au 29 mars 2013 et [sic] d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de huit (8) mois. Vous serez soumise \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de probation pendant les trois (3) premiers mois; la description de travail est en cours de pr\u00e9paration.\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er, Madame Tanner, l\u2019expression de nos sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\nChef David LeDoux\n[143] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de cette lettre, Sharon Tanner a rencontr\u00e9 le chef LeDoux, Rose LeDoux et Harlene Swain. Lors de cette r\u00e9union, Rose LeDoux a remis \u00e0 Mme Tanner des copies d\u2019une exon\u00e9ration et renonciation \u00e0 des conseils juridiques ind\u00e9pendants. Le chef LeDoux a avis\u00e9 Mme Tanner qu\u2019elle pouvait toujours garder son emploi si elle signait les documents. Elle a refus\u00e9 parce que les conseillers Roy Vermette et Ron Ducharme \u00e9taient absents et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait donc pas le quorum n\u00e9cessaire dans le cadre de cette r\u00e9union.\n[144] Mme Tanner a quand m\u00eame obtenu le poste. Elle a occup\u00e9 cette fonction pendant trois mois, durant lesquels elle a travaill\u00e9 principalement sur une proposition concernant le Programme de logements adapt\u00e9s : a\u00een\u00e9s autonomes (LAAA), programme qui assure un financement permettant d\u2019apporter de petites modifications au logement des a\u00een\u00e9s afin de leur permettre de vivre chez eux de fa\u00e7on autonome. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que, \u00e0 la demande du chef, elle a travaill\u00e9 sur un projet de construction d\u2019une patinoire et quelques autres projets pour les personnes voulant retourner aux \u00e9tudes ou celles, comme Doreen Mitchell, qui cherchaient du travail.\n[145] En ao\u00fbt, Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inappropri\u00e9 pour Harlene Swain, en qualit\u00e9 de directrice des finances, de partager un bureau avec elle et, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun autre espace de travail dans le bureau de la bande, Mme Tanner a am\u00e9nag\u00e9 son bureau chez elle avec l\u2019aide des conseillers Roy Vermette et Ron Ducharme. Elle a travaill\u00e9 depuis son domicile jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[146] Le 24 septembre 2012, Harlene Swain a fait parvenir une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante, au nom du chef, lui demandant de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union le 1er octobre dans le but d\u2019\u00e9valuer son rendement, puisque la fin de sa p\u00e9riode de probation approchait. Dans la lettre, Mme Tanner \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pri\u00e9e d\u2019apporter ses [traduction] \u00ab rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9s mensuels, rapports de financement et copies de propositions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[147] Mme Tanner a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9ception de la lettre, elle l\u2019a montr\u00e9e aux conseillers Roy Vermette et Ron Ducharme. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre au courant de cette r\u00e9union et ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient satisfaits de son travail. Les conseillers auraient dit \u00e0 la plaignante que, vu qu\u2019ils constituaient \u00e0 eux deux un quorum, tout ce qu\u2019il fallait \u00e0 la bande pour rendre une d\u00e9cision, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e d\u2019assister \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Mme Tanner ne s\u2019est donc pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union.\n[148] Le 2 octobre 2012, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, sign\u00e9e par Harlene Swain. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la lettre que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas particip\u00e9 aux r\u00e9unions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res du personnel tel qu\u2019il est exig\u00e9, ou pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9s mensuels, rapports de d\u00e9penses et copies de propositions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, il serait recommand\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Il y \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019une r\u00e9union de la bande se tiendrait \u00e0 cette fin au bureau de la bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, le 9 octobre 2012 \u00e0 10 h. La plaignante a de nouveau discut\u00e9 de la lettre avec les conseillers Roy Vermette et Ron Ducharme, qui n\u2019en avaient pas re\u00e7u copie et ne savaient rien auparavant au sujet de la r\u00e9union. Ils ont rassur\u00e9 Mme Tanner en lui disant qu\u2019il fallait un quorum au chef pour prendre une telle d\u00e9cision.\n[149] Le 9 octobre 2012, le chef a tenu une r\u00e9union avec des membres de la bande afin de discuter, entre autres, de la cessation d\u2019emploi de Mme Tanner. Cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union; toutefois, Charlene Tanner, la fille de Mme Tanner \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente, et elle a pris la parole en d\u00e9fense de sa m\u00e8re. Le conseiller Roy Vermette \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9sent.\n[150] Dans une lettre en date du 9 octobre 2012, le chef David LeDoux a avis\u00e9 la plaignante de ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Puisque vous \u00eates en probation et que vous ne vous \u00eates pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 votre \u00e9valuation, par la pr\u00e9sente, il est mis fin \u00e0 votre emploi \u00bb. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir montr\u00e9 la lettre aux conseillers; ceux-ci lui ont dit qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas au courant et que le chef avait pris cette d\u00e9cision en l\u2019absence de quorum.\n[151] Le 13 novembre 2012, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte au titre du Code canadien du travail. Malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle e\u00fbt pr\u00e9tendument fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement \u00e0 juste titre, Mme Tanner a re\u00e7u par la suite 5 672 $ et un autre 1 221,12 $ en guise de paye de vacances et de salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis.\nB. Observations des parties et analyse\n[152] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son rendement. Ashley Smith, la fille du chef David LeDoux et b\u00e9n\u00e9vole au sein du comit\u00e9 du logement durant cette p\u00e9riode, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019une proposition de LAAA consiste pour l\u2019essentiel \u00e0 remplir une liste de contr\u00f4le, et qu\u2019il faut environ une heure pour la remplir. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que cette preuve contredit le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante selon lequel elle a travaill\u00e9 sur cette proposition pendant la majeure partie de ses trois mois d\u2019emploi, et que cette preuve appuie la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. En outre, selon le chef LeDoux, le Programme LAAA est un programme de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques et de logement qui fait partie du portefeuille du logement dont Ronnie Ducharme est responsable, et ne fait pas partie des responsabilit\u00e9s d\u2019un agent de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique. L\u2019omission de la plaignante de s\u2019acquitter des t\u00e2ches qui incombent \u00e0 un agent de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, combin\u00e9e \u00e0 son omission d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de son rendement et de fournir ses rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9s mensuels, rapports de financement et copies de ses propositions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, ont constitu\u00e9 le fondement de son cong\u00e9diement.\n[153] Madame Tanner a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son travail effectu\u00e9 sur la proposition de LAAA comprenait bien davantage que le fait de remplir une liste de contr\u00f4le. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsque le financement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, elle avait d\u00fb faire venir les charpentiers pour effectuer les travaux de r\u00e9novation et faire \u00e9valuer le travail afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien fait. Mme Tanner a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u des directives de Cindy McCabe du West Region Tribal Council ainsi que des conseillers, \u00e0 qui elle faisait rapport, et que tous \u00e9taient satisfaits de son travail. Sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas assister \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement et aux r\u00e9unions ult\u00e9rieures reposait sur les conversations qu\u2019elle avait eues avec les conseillers et sur l\u2019absence apparente de quorum. La plaignante r\u00e9fute la position adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement \u00e0 juste titre en raison de son rendement insuffisant, et elle pr\u00e9tend que le fait qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u un salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis et une paye de vacances contredit l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 juste titre.\n[154] Il ne fait aucun doute que les param\u00e8tres d\u2019emploi de la plaignante en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler n\u2019\u00e9taient pas bien d\u00e9finis. Aucun contrat n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et la plaignante n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u de description de travail. Mme Tanner a re\u00e7u des directives de Cindy McCabe, et aussi des conseillers, et elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait eu peu de contacts avec le chef durant cette p\u00e9riode. Dans ce contexte, il est difficile d\u2019accepter l\u2019affirmation du chef selon laquelle elle a commis une erreur en travaillant sur le Programme LAAA, puisque cela ne semblait pas faire partie de ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Il est \u00e9galement difficile de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019omission de Mme Tanner de fournir les rapports d\u2019activit\u00e9s mensuels et de financement demand\u00e9s appuie la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, si le chef ne pouvait se rappeler si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que la pr\u00e9paration des rapports faisait partie de ses t\u00e2ches de travail (transcription, aux pages 752 et 753).\n[155] Cela dit, des parties du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tanner concernant le travail qu\u2019elle a fait \u00e9taient contradictoires et manquaient de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision selon laquelle elle ne pouvait pas partager le bureau de Harlene Swain comme la cessation de son emploi : [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019avais pas de bureau o\u00f9 travailler. J\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus moins cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00bb (transcription, \u00e0 la page 134). Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9tabli si, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle a r\u00e9ellement continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler depuis son domicile : [traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai pas eu le temps de travailler sur l\u2019autre [l\u2019autre proposition que celle concernant le LAAA]. Comme je l\u2019ai dit, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de mon bureau. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc la seule proposition que j\u2019ai pu terminer \u00bb (transcription, \u00e0 la page 134). Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les conseillers, \u00e0 qui elle faisait rapport, \u00e9taient satisfaits de son rendement. Cela n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas surprenant puisque la seule maison approuv\u00e9e dans le cadre de la proposition concernant le LAAA sur laquelle elle a travaill\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e9tait la r\u00e9sidence du conseiller Roy Vermette. Ce dernier est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 depuis, et, bien que Ronnie Ducharme ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un affidavit qui appuie l\u2019observation de la plaignante voulant qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas eu \u00ab quorum \u00bb lors de son cong\u00e9diement, celui-ci n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[156] La question de l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab quorum \u00bb, en tant qu\u2019exigence aux fins de la prise de d\u00e9cisions par la bande, est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plupart des arguments entourant ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Mme Tanner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises lors de son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle ne reconnaissait pas les d\u00e9cisions du chef parce qu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l\u2019insu et sans le consentement des conseillers, et, par cons\u00e9quent, sans un \u00ab quorum \u00bb ou une majorit\u00e9. Selon l\u2019affidavit du conseiller Ronnie Ducharme, celui-ci semble \u00eatre du m\u00eame avis. Le chef David LeDoux a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les deux conseillers pensaient qu\u2019ils avaient un \u00ab quorum \u00bb :\n[traduction]\nMe TOUET : Pouvez-vous parler de la gouvernance durant la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e lorsque Ronnie et Roy \u00e9taient tous deux pr\u00e9sents?\nM. LEDOUX : En gros, ils n\u2019aimaient pas la mani\u00e8re dont je m\u2019effor\u00e7ais de rendre les choses \u00e9quitables pour tous \u00e0 Gambler. Ils ont toujours dit qu\u2019ils avaient le quorum, ce qui signifie, j\u2019imagine, que deux des trois \u00e9lus se prononcent, qu\u2019ils ont le dernier mot.\n[157] Le chef David LeDoux a exprim\u00e9 un avis diff\u00e9rent quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un quorum :\n[traduction]\nMe TOUET : D\u2019accord. Selon vous, \u00e0 quelle fin un quorum est-il n\u00e9cessaire?\nM. LEDOUX : Un quorum serait une chose sur laquelle il faut se pencher et qui touche les membres. Par exemple, pour le retrait du chef du conseil de bande, il faut plus qu\u2019un quorum, il faut avoir la conviction n\u00e9cessaire, quelle qu\u2019elle soit. Mon id\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e9tait de faire participer les membres et de prendre des d\u00e9cisions. Je n\u2019aime pas vraiment l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019\u00eatre dirig\u00e9 par un chef ou un conseiller qui prend des d\u00e9cisions pour moi, et j\u2019ai donc tent\u00e9 de faire participer les membres et de r\u00e9gler les questions en recourant aux membres. Ils [Roy Vermette et Ronnie Ducharme] n\u2019aimaient pas \u00e7a du tout, mais pas du tout.\n[\u2026]\nMe TOUET : Selon votre compr\u00e9hension du quorum, un quorum est-il n\u00e9cessaire pour les d\u00e9cisions de tous les jours?\nM. LEDOUX : Non, nous avons nos propres politiques et proc\u00e9dures en place. Notre politique administrative, notre politique sur la conduite, et celle sur la confidentialit\u00e9, et cela a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un vote. Le personnel doit composer avec les employ\u00e9s selon nos politiques et proc\u00e9dures.\nMe TOUET : Ainsi, pour convoquer des r\u00e9unions avec le personnel, serait\u2011il n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir un quorum pour ce genre de situation?\nM. LEDOUX : Non.\nTranscription, aux pages 695, 696, 700 et 701.\n[158] Le chef David LeDoux a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait [traduction] \u00ab pas les m\u00eames id\u00e9es que bon nombre des membres de [l\u2019]administration ou [du] conseil de bande par le pass\u00e9 \u00bb (transcription, aux pages 688 et 689), ce qui comprend les conseillers Roy Vermette et Ronnie Ducharme. Selon le proc\u00e8s-verbal de la r\u00e9union de la bande du 9 octobre 2012, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le chef LeDoux, la r\u00e9union m\u00eame o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise, Ronnie Ducharme s\u2019est vu retirer son droit de signature et son portefeuille, et ses honoraires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 Roy Vermette. La tension existant au sein des membres du conseil de bande est devenue \u00e9vidente dans le cadre du t\u00e9moignage du chef LeDoux, et l\u2019argument concernant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un quorum n\u2019en est qu\u2019une autre preuve. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019existence de ce conflit, il est difficile de tenir Mme Tanner responsable, en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9e de la bande, d\u2019avoir suivi les directives des deux conseillers plut\u00f4t que celles du chef, qui semblait ne pas savoir grand-chose au sujet du travail accompli par Mme Tanner et qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne pas avoir lu la proposition qu\u2019elle lui avait remise.\n[159] Cependant, la question qui se pose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas de savoir si Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 juste titre, mais plut\u00f4t de savoir si son d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne constituait un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. La lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avisant Mme Tanner que son emploi pour le compte de la bande \u00e9tait conditionnel \u00e0 sa signature d\u2019une exon\u00e9ration concernant sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9occupante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a admis ce fait :\n[traduction]\nMe TOUET : Nous avons entendu dire en preuve que Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9e de signer une exon\u00e9ration concernant sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne?\nM. LEDOUX : Oui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 nous traitions de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les autres que j\u2019avais cong\u00e9di\u00e9s; alors, l\u2019avocat M. Cochrane je crois, Sonny Cochrane, a dit que ce n\u2019est pas bon d\u2019embaucher quelqu\u2019un qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre vous, alors voyons si nous pouvons r\u00e9gler cette question. J\u2019ignore quelle autre entreprise embaucherait quelqu\u2019un qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Voil\u00e0 donc la raison.\nLa lettre faisait \u00e9galement partie du dossier de preuve.\n[160] M\u00eame si la plaignante a obtenu le poste, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle avait refus\u00e9 de signer le document d\u2019exon\u00e9ration, la r\u00e9ponse initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant l\u2019embauche de Mme Tanner est troublante et constitue assez clairement \u00e0 elle seule une menace de repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019avis de la Commission selon lequel cette r\u00e9ponse fournit au Tribunal l\u2019optique dans laquelle il devrait examiner la question de savoir pourquoi Mme Tanner a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e relativement aux droits de la personne n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas constitu\u00e9 le seul facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier celle-ci, mais la lettre, conjugu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019engagement ult\u00e9rieur du chef relativement au travail de Mme Tanner \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, et la faiblesse d\u2019un certain nombre de motifs invoqu\u00e9s pour expliquer le cong\u00e9diement, font en sorte qu\u2019il est difficile de croire que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019un des facteurs ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la prise de cette d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le cong\u00e9diement constitue des repr\u00e9sailles et contrevient \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\nV. Ordonnance\n[161] Ayant conclu que les parties de la plainte concernant la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et les repr\u00e9sailles sont fond\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, je peux rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler. Le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance, en vertu du paragraphe 53(2), ne vise pas \u00e0 punir la personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, mais \u00e0 \u00e9liminer \u2013 autant que possible \u2013 les effets discriminatoires de l\u2019acte (voir Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13). Il faut pour cela que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement en ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 des principes, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37). Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire ainsi qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\n[162] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e); une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale aux termes du paragraphe 53(3); ainsi qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), pour son cong\u00e9diement du poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique. De plus, la Commission demande que la Nation cesse de d\u00e9clarer inadmissibles des candidats \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection sur le fondement de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et qu\u2019elle examine sa loi \u00e9lectorale afin d\u2019y supprimer les renvois \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. La Commission demande que cet examen soit effectu\u00e9 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nA. Ordonnance de cessation et de d\u00e9sistement\n[163] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner :\nde mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables\n[164] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission demande au tribunal de rendre les ordonnances suivantes :\nque la Nation cesse et s\u2019abstienne de d\u00e9clarer des candidats inadmissibles aux \u00e9lections sur le fondement de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\nque la Nation examine la version \u00e9crite de son code \u00e9lectoral coutumier et qu\u2019elle prenne les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour supprimer de cette version \u00e9crite de son code \u00e9lectoral coutumier les renvois \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\nque les mesures d\u00e9crites \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a b) ci-dessus soient prises dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[165] Compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance est discriminatoire, j\u2019estime que la demande de la Commission, selon laquelle le Tribunal devrait rende une ordonnance conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, est n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher que ne se reproduisent des actes discriminatoires semblables \u00e0 ceux dont Mme Tanner a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. J\u2019ordonne donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cesser d\u2019appliquer la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance et d\u2019examiner la loi \u00e9lectorale pour supprimer les renvois \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. L\u2019examen de la loi \u00e9lectorale devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, sous r\u00e9serve de mon ordonnance rendue au paragraphe 180 ci\u2011dessous.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral\n[166] La plaignante demande un montant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 par chacun des actes discriminatoires. Il s\u2019agit du montant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximal que le Tribunal peut accorder au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019accorde ce montant maximal que dans les cas les plus graves : quand l\u2019\u00e9tendue et la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019un plaignant a subi du fait de l\u2019acte discriminatoire justifient l\u2019octroi du plein montant.\n[167] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de la plaignante de poser sa candidature au poste de chef, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve quant \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9lue chef de la Premi\u00e8re Nation. L\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne qu\u2019il y avait cinq autres candidats qui ont brigu\u00e9 le poste de chef lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection de 2012. Elle ajoute que la dur\u00e9e du mandat est de huit mois, \u00e0 raison d\u2019un salaire annuel d\u2019environ 20 000 $, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 13 333 $ pour la p\u00e9riode de huit mois. En supposant que la plaignante avait la m\u00eame chance que tout autre candidat dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9lection, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la part du salaire du chef pour 2012 revenant \u00e0 la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8verait \u00e0 2 666,66 $. Selon l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, c\u2019est le montant maximal auquel la plaignante devrait avoir droit pour le pr\u00e9judice moral li\u00e9 au fait de l\u2019avoir priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 de briguer le poste de chef. Pour ce qui est de repr\u00e9sailles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de son emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique.\n[168] Mme Tanner est une personne qui a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le actif au sein de sa collectivit\u00e9 depuis bon nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es et milit\u00e9 en faveur du maintien de l\u2019ordre et d\u2019une bonne gouvernance. Elle est une membre respect\u00e9e au sein de la Nation, comme en t\u00e9moigne sa nomination \u00e0 plusieurs reprises aux postes de conseiller et de chef, de m\u00eame que le fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e pour examiner les finances de la Nation. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que son exclusion de l\u2019\u00e9quipe dirigeante de la Nation, fond\u00e9e sur la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, et ce, apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9cu pendant plus de 30 ans \u00e0 titre de membre au sein de la collectivit\u00e9, a fait en sorte qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie marginalis\u00e9e, triste, isol\u00e9e et embarrass\u00e9e. Une douleur qu\u2019elle ressent toujours aujourd\u2019hui. En tenant compte de tout cela, j\u2019estime que l\u2019octroi d\u2019un montant de 12 500 $ est appropri\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que la plaignante a subi en raison de l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance. Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e relatives au salaire du chef et \u00e0 la perte de possibilit\u00e9 ne sont pas pertinentes pour \u00e9valuer le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par la plaignante. Elles se rattachent mieux \u00e0 l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour pertes de salaire, que la plaignante n\u2019a pas r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la partie de la plainte relative \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\n[169] Dans la m\u00eame optique, les circonstances entourant la partie de la plainte relative \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019humiliation accrue de la plaignante au sein de la collectivit\u00e9. Elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de travailler au bureau du conseil de bande, et son \u00e9thique du travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9e en public et sans fondement par le chef lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union du conseil de bande. C\u2019\u00e9tait blessant et embarrassant pour la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019octroie un montant de 2 500 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par la plaignante en raison des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nC. Indemnisation sp\u00e9ciale\n[170] La plaignante demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9e verse un montant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour avoir exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, suivant le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. La Commission estime \u00e9galement qu\u2019il convient de verser une indemnit\u00e9 au titre de ce paragraphe pour la partie de la plainte relative \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\n[171] Au paragraphe 154 de la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, confirm\u00e9e dans 2014 CAF 110, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit eu \u00e9gard au paragraphe 53(3) :\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. Pour conclure que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, il faut que l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne aient \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels. On entend par \u00ab acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante.\n[172] R\u00e9p\u00e9tons encore une fois que 20 000 $ est le montant maximal que le Tribunal peut accorder au titre du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP et qu\u2019il ne devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 que dans les cas les plus graves.\n[173] En ce qui concerne la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la Premi\u00e8re Nation n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 la loi \u00e9lectorale sans \u00e9gard aux cons\u00e9quences. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9e par Larry Catagas en consultation avec des membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Gambler, a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au vote des membres lors d\u2019un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum et a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par une majorit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lecteurs. Encore une fois, en ce qui concerne l\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de son emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique.\n[174] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la partie de la plainte relative \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait incapable de donner une explication cr\u00e9dible quant \u00e0 la question de savoir pour quelle raison elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en 2010, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de la loi \u00e9lectorale. C\u2019\u00e9tait trois ans apr\u00e8s la tenue du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum initial sur la question, lequel, comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9, comportait plusieurs irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, et \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Tanner exprimait un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe dirigeante de la Nation. Cela m\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il est plus probable que la loi \u00e9lectorale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 2010, du moins en partie, afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher Mme Tanner de briguer le poste de chef. Cela \u00e9tant dit, je ne peux pas affirmer de fa\u00e7on concluante que les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment discriminatoires. Toutefois, compte tenu des circonstances, je suis convaincu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de m\u00e9pris et d\u2019indiff\u00e9rence envers la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019octroie un montant de 10 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pour la partie de la plainte relative \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019ascendance.\n[175] En ce qui concerne la partie de la plainte relative aux repr\u00e9sailles, je conclus que les actes commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e touchent \u00e0 l\u2019essentiel de la protection contre les repr\u00e9sailles pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Le fait d\u2019offrir \u00e0 la plaignante le poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique \u00e0 condition qu\u2019elle retire sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne constituait une menace flagrante de repr\u00e9sailles. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette menace et que la plaignante ait finalement obtenu le poste, la menace initiale, conjugu\u00e9e \u00e0 la faiblesse de motifs expliquant le cong\u00e9diement, m\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que la plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Tanner repr\u00e9sentait au moins un facteur ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son contrat. \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9sente preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019il y avait, dans une certaine mesure, un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et planifi\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de mettre fin au contrat de la plaignante \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, ce qui justifie l\u2019octroi d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale dans la gamme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019octroie un montant de 15 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pour la partie de la plainte relative aux repr\u00e9sailles.\nD. Indemnisation pour perte de salaire\n[176] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), la plaignante demande un montant de 10 328 $ pour salaire impay\u00e9 en raison de son cong\u00e9diement du poste d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique.\n[177] Le montant de 10 328 $ au titre de salaire impay\u00e9 que demande la plaignante est bas\u00e9 sur la dur\u00e9e de son contrat (huit mois) moins les sommes qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ues (5 672 $ \u00e0 titre de salaire et 1 221,12 $ \u00e0 titre de paye de vacances et de salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis). Ayant conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre la plaignante en mettant fin \u00e0 son contrat \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, j\u2019ordonne le paiement du montant de 10 328 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9 au titre de salaire impay\u00e9.\nE. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence\n[178] La Commission demande au Tribunal de conserver sa comp\u00e9tence et de rester saisi de l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties confirment que les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es ci-dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en oeuvre. La Commission demande au Tribunal de recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, d\u2019entendre d\u2019autres arguments et\/ou de rendre des ordonnances suppl\u00e9mentaires si les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou de l\u2019application d\u2019une mesure de redressement ordonn\u00e9e.\n[179] Des questions d\u2019ordre pratique pourraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019examen de la version \u00e9crite du code \u00e9lectoral coutumier dans un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an, tel qu\u2019il est ordonn\u00e9 plus haut. Afin de garantir une application efficace et raisonnable de cet aspect de mon ordonnance par toutes les parties, je conserverai comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cet aspect de l\u2019ordonnance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties ait confirm\u00e9 son application.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Introduction [1] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate (la requ\u00eate en divulgation ou la requ\u00eate) en vue d\u2019obtenir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e produise :\n[traduction]\n\u2022 tous les documents \u00ab potentiellement pertinents \u00bb en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9e;\n\u2022 un exemplaire complet et non expurg\u00e9 du Simulation Exercise Administration Manual (Manuel d\u2019administration des exercices de simulation) de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (le Manuel), y compris des pages pr\u00e9cises, indiqu\u00e9es ci-dessous, de m\u00eame que les autres pages manquantes dans la version du Manuel que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9e.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e se sert du Manuel dans le cadre de son programme de Formation des recrues pour les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (FORPE) en vue de soumettre les stagiaires \u00e0 des exercices de simulation et d\u2019\u00e9valuer leur rendement par rapport \u00e0 certaines comp\u00e9tences de nature comportementale lors des deux \u00e9tapes d\u2019examen de ce programme.\n[3] L\u2019avis de requ\u00eate demande que l\u2019on produise des pages pr\u00e9cises du Manuel, lesquelles sont indiqu\u00e9es ci-dessous, de pair avec la br\u00e8ve description g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du plaignant sur les sujets qui y sont abord\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ayant pas mis en doute ces descriptions, celles-ci sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme exactes pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\na) Pages 20 \u00e0 87 et 269 \u00e0 277.\n[4] Ces pages ont trait au processus d\u2019examen D\u2011I des exercices de simulation.\nb) Pages 123 \u00e0 129.\n[5] Ces pages ont trait \u00e0 une version de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des simulations appel\u00e9e \u00ab Version B \u00bb.\nc) Pages 137 \u00e0 171.\n[6] Ces pages forment un chapitre qui se rapporte \u00e0 une version de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des simulations appel\u00e9e \u00ab Version C \u00bb.\nd) Pages 280 \u00e0 282 et 284 \u00e0 287.\n[7] Ces pages figurent dans un chapitre intitul\u00e9 \u00ab D\u2011II Recruit Simulation Background Information \u00bb (Renseignements de base sur les simulations \u2013 Stagiaires \u2013 \u00c9tape D-II) qui se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des simulations men\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D\u2011II.\ne) Toute autre page manquante du Manuel.\n[8] Au paragraphe 17 de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 les pages 102 \u00e0 115 du Manuel. L\u2019alin\u00e9a e) susmentionn\u00e9 les englobe.\nII. Les motifs de la requ\u00eate en divulgation [9] La requ\u00eate du plaignant est fond\u00e9e sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n1. les articles 3 et 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles);\n2. le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi);\n3. le fait que les pages demand\u00e9es (les pages demand\u00e9es) sont potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement que demande le plaignant et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination envers lui de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nIII. Le contexte de la plainte [10] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate uniquement, voici un sommaire contextuel tr\u00e8s bref et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du programme de FORPE et de ce que le plaignant a v\u00e9cu dans le cadre de ce dernier.\n[11] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour un poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers (ASF). Il a franchi avec succ\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de s\u00e9lection, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre part au programme de FORPE \u00e0 titre de stagiaire.\n[12] Le programme de FORPE comporte deux \u00e9tapes d\u2019\u00e9valuation appel\u00e9es \u00ab \u00e9tapes de d\u00e9termination \u00bb : l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination I (D-I), subie au cours de la quatri\u00e8me semaine, et l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination II (D-II), subie \u00e0 la fin de la formation. Les stagiaires doivent suivre avec succ\u00e8s la totalit\u00e9 du programme de FORPE pour faire partie du bassin des personnes admissibles \u00e0 un poste d\u2019ASF.\n[13] L\u2019\u00e9valuation D-I se compose de deux examens \u00e9crits et de trois simulations. Chacune des simulations de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I \u00e9value sept comp\u00e9tences de nature comportementale : souci du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, soutien des valeurs de l\u2019ASFC, r\u00e9flexion analytique, prise de d\u00e9cisions, communication interactive efficace, techniques de recherche de l\u2019information, et l\u00e9gislation, politiques et proc\u00e9dures.\n[14] Lors de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournit \u00e9galement une r\u00e9troaction sur les deux comp\u00e9tences suivantes : contr\u00f4le des situations difficiles et confiance en soi. Ces deux comp\u00e9tences ne sont pas officiellement \u00e9valu\u00e9es lors de cette \u00e9tape, mais elles le sont \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II.\n[15] L\u2019\u00e9valuation D-II se compose d\u2019une autre s\u00e9rie d\u2019examens \u00e9crits, d\u2019une simulation de tactiques de ma\u00eetrise et de d\u00e9fense, ainsi que de trois autres simulations. Lors de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II, les simulations permettent chacune d\u2019\u00e9valuer les m\u00eames comp\u00e9tences qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I, plus les deux comp\u00e9tences suivantes : contr\u00f4le des situations difficiles et confiance en soi.\n[16] Le plaignant a pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s tous les examens \u00e9crits et toutes les \u00e9valuations des comp\u00e9tences comportementales de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I.

Il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation de toutes les comp\u00e9tences comportementales dans le cadre des simulations de cette \u00e9tape, et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au bassin d\u2019\u00e9ventuels ASF.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de modification et la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 [17] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Itty c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 TCDP 33 (la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de modification), le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant en vue de faire modifier la plainte par l\u2019ajout des mots [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 \u00bb. La troisi\u00e8me phrase du premier paragraphe de la plainte est donc libell\u00e9e ainsi :\n[traduction] Je crois que le programme de Formation des recrues pour les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (FORPE) de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) a fait preuve \u00e0 mon endroit de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique en ma qualit\u00e9 de candidat \u00e0 un emploi d\u2019agent des services frontaliers, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 et \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[18] Une seconde d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, Itty c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 CHRT 34 (la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9), ordonne aux parties de garder certains documents confidentiels. L\u2019un de ces documents est le Manuel.\nV. La question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate [19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est-elle tenue de divulguer les pages demand\u00e9es?\nVI. Le droit et les r\u00e8gles du Tribunal applicables [20] L\u2019article 7 de la Loi dispose :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[21] L\u2019article 10 de la Loi dispose :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[22] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit en partie ce qui suit :\nLe membre instructeur [\u2026] instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 [toutes les parties ayant re\u00e7u l\u2019avis] la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations.\n[23] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les passages pertinents de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles sont :\n(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\n[\u2026]\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9 en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n(5) Une partie doit divulguer et produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires :\nb) si elle constate qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e correctement ou compl\u00e8tement aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) [\u2026].\nVII. La norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents [24] Il est bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et au paragraphe (5) des R\u00e8gles, est que les documents doivent \u00eatre \u00ab potentiellement pertinents \u00bb \u00e0 un fait, \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e, y compris les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties. Pour qu\u2019un document soit potentiellement pertinent, il doit y avoir un lien rationnel entre le document dont on demande la divulgation et le fait, la question ou la forme de redressement demand\u00e9e ou ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties (Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (Seeley), au paragraphe 6). Une demande de divulgation \u00ab ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u201cpartie de p\u00eache\u201d \u00bb (Johanne Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34 (Guay), au paragraphe 43.\nVIII. Les observations du plaignant [25] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il y a lieu de divulguer les pages demand\u00e9es pour les raisons suivantes :\n\u2022 elles ont un lien direct avec les principales questions en litige;\n\u2022 leur divulgation garantira que le plaignant aura \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de participer \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi;\n\u2022 elles sont toutes n\u00e9cessaires pour que le plaignant puisse montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli des pratiques ou des politiques discriminatoires;\n\u2022 le seuil de la pertinence potentielle est tr\u00e8s faible (Guay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 44) et, dans la jurisprudence, on tend \u00e0 pr\u00e9coniser une divulgation accrue.\nIX. Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019en ce qui concerne le Manuel, elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 :\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du Manuel qui se rapportent aux comp\u00e9tences \u00e9valu\u00e9es;\n\u2022 tous les d\u00e9tails relatifs aux simulations auxquelles le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9 et dans lesquelles il pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination \u00bb (paragraphe 15 de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate).\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9e groupe en trois parties les parties non divulgu\u00e9es du Manuel, et elle soutient ne pas les avoir divulgu\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles ne sont pas pertinentes pour le plaignant. Il s\u2019agit des parties suivantes :\n1. D\u00e9tails des simulations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I, y compris :\na) celles auxquelles le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi;\nb) celles que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait subir au groupe du plaignant;\n1. Les simulations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait subir au groupe du plaignant;\n2. Les simulations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II auxquelles le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi.\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient avoir fait subir la m\u00eame version de tous les exercices de simulation \u00e0 chacun des membres du groupe du plaignant. Il n\u2019y a donc pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de comparaison pour le plaignant et, dans les simulations auxquelles son groupe n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, il n\u2019y a pas de lien avec les questions en litige dans la plainte.\n[29] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 propos des simulations est que la plainte ne concerne pas celles des \u00e9tapes D-I ou D-II auxquelles le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi, mais celles de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II auxquelles il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas pu faire preuve de discrimination envers le plaignant dans des simulations auxquelles il n\u2019a pas pris part. C\u2019est donc dire que tout ce qui n\u2019est pas directement li\u00e9 aux examens de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II auxquels le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9 n\u2019est pas potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 la plainte et n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9.\nX. L\u2019analyse [30] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne traitera pas de la demande, incluse dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, qui visait \u00e0 obtenir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e produise [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] tous les documents potentiellement pertinents en sa possession, relativement aux questions en litige [\u2026] \u00bb. L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles englobe d\u00e9j\u00e0 cette demande, y compris l\u2019exigence selon laquelle la divulgation doit \u00eatre continue.\n[31] Je conclus, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, que le plaignant souhaite prouver que :\n\u2022 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du programme de FORPE pour les motifs illicites de l\u2019\u00e2ge, de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi;\n\u2022 dans le programme de FORPE, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fix\u00e9 ou appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi pour les m\u00eames motifs illicites, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[32] Je conclus par ailleurs, pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, qu\u2019il existe une liste non exhaustive d\u2019exemples dont le plaignant souhaite se servir pour prouver la discrimination susmentionn\u00e9e :\n1) l\u2019intim\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab voulait [que le plaignant] \u00e9choue \u00bb \u00e0 cause de son \u00e2ge (plainte, paragraphe 10), et elle a appliqu\u00e9 une politique ou une pratique de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge dans le cadre du programme de FORPE (ibidem et expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, au paragraphe 34), ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 et \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi;\n2) pour \u00e9valuer le plaignant, les \u00e9valuateurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019ont trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, \u00e0 son d\u00e9triment, car ils l\u2019ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une norme plus stricte par rapport \u00e0 des candidats blancs et plus jeunes, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 et \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi;\n3) les comp\u00e9tences comportementales qui ont servi \u00e0 \u00e9valuer le plaignant et d\u2019autres recrues lors des simulations effectu\u00e9es aux \u00e9tapes D-I et D-II sont, en soi, [traduction] \u00ab hautement subjectives \u00bb (expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, au paragraphe 54) et donc vuln\u00e9rables aux pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s des \u00e9valuateurs, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi;\n4) les pratiques utilis\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer le rendement du plaignant par rapport aux comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur des aspects relatifs \u00e0 son \u00e2ge, \u00e0 sa race ou \u00e0 son origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[33] Dans les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 prouver, le plaignant ne fait pas de distinction entre les simulations auxquelles il a r\u00e9ussi et celles auxquelles il a \u00e9chou\u00e9. Il existe un lien entre toutes les simulations, les m\u00e9thodes employ\u00e9es pour les \u00e9valuer et les questions en litige. Toutes les simulations auxquelles on a soumis le plaignant aux \u00e9tapes D-I et D-II sont, de ce fait, potentiellement pertinentes, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait les divulguer.\n[34] Selon le paragraphe 24 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant a pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le volet \u00ab simulations \u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I. L\u2019expos\u00e9 mentionne \u00e9galement, en partie :\n[traduction] Bien que [le plaignant] ait r\u00e9ussi, les \u00e9valuateurs ont relev\u00e9 le besoin qu\u2019il s\u2019am\u00e9liore dans divers secteurs. En fait, [le plaignant] a re\u00e7u la note \u00ab \u00e9chec \u00bb de l\u2019un de ses \u00e9valuateurs pour ce qui est de la comp\u00e9tence de la communication interactive efficace. M\u00eame si la confiance en soi et le contr\u00f4le des situations difficiles sont des comp\u00e9tences qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I, les \u00e9valuateurs ont fait des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs sur les deux et ont mentionn\u00e9 que [le plaignant] devrait s\u2019am\u00e9liorer s\u2019il souhaitait r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation D-II.\n[35] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que le paragraphe 24 fait simplement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des commentaires qu\u2019ont faits les \u00e9valuateurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I au sujet du rendement du plaignant par rapport aux comp\u00e9tences de la confiance en soi et du contr\u00f4le des situations difficiles et que ces commentaires ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents parce que la plainte vise l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II, et non l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I.\n[36] Le paragraphe 14 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9crit un aspect particulier de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-1 :\n[traduction] Les candidats re\u00e7oivent aussi des commentaires sur le contr\u00f4le des situations difficiles et la confiance en soi, mais ces deux comp\u00e9tences ne sont pas officiellement \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I.\n[37] Je conclus que les \u00e9valuateurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont fait des [traduction] \u00ab commentaires n\u00e9gatifs \u00bb sur le rendement du plaignant par rapport \u00e0 ces deux comp\u00e9tences non pas en passant ou par hasard, mais plut\u00f4t parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait pour politique ou pratique de le faire, ainsi qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 14 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Il existe donc un lien entre ce que le plaignant souhaite prouver \u00e0 propos de la discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique et les parties du Manuel qui ont trait aux simulations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I et aux m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9valuation.\n[38] Les parties du Manuel qui traitent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments des simulations effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I sont donc potentiellement pertinentes et l\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue de les divulguer.\n[39] Le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pas soumis le groupe du plaignant \u00e0 certaines simulations n\u2019emp\u00eache pas automatiquement ces derni\u00e8res d\u2019\u00eatre potentiellement pertinentes, pas plus que l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle les m\u00eames simulations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es \u00e0 tous les membres de ce groupe. Par exemple, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 au paragraphe 10 de la plainte que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait \u00e9chouer [traduction] \u00ab [d]eux autres hommes plus \u00e2g\u00e9s \u00bb dans [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019autres groupes \u00bb \u00e0 cause d\u2019une politique ou d\u2019une pratique de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Au paragraphe 34 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant soutient que [traduction] \u00ab [d]e nombreux autres candidats d\u2019autres groupes qui n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi au programme de FORPE \u00e9taient d\u2019\u00e2ge moyen, comme M. Itty \u00bb.\n[40] Une autre all\u00e9gation du plaignant vise \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019au cours de la FORPE, l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres candidats et que les commentaires qu\u2019on lui a faits sur la raison pour laquelle il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 trois des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient vagues. Cela d\u00e9note, selon lui, [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026 qu\u2019] on a fix\u00e9 un seuil d\u00e9raisonnable pour ce qui est de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 chacune des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00bb (plainte, au paragraphe 13).\n[41] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant poursuit sur ce th\u00e8me, mais il le qualifie diff\u00e9remment, all\u00e9guant au paragraphe 27 que [traduction] \u00ab [p]endant tout le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00bb l\u2019intim\u00e9e a [traduction] \u201csoumis\u201d [le plaignant] \u00e0 une norme plus stricte que celle que l\u2019on appliquait \u00e0 d\u2019autres stagiaires jeunes et blancs \u00bb, qui ont commis de graves erreurs mais ont n\u00e9anmoins r\u00e9ussi. Cette derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, concerne le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation tout entier, y compris les examens que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait passer au plaignant.\n[42] Il y a donc un lien entre, d\u2019une part, ce que le plaignant souhaite prouver \u00e0 propos de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge et la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et, d\u2019autre part, les pages du Manuel portant sur les simulations des \u00e9tapes D-I et D-II que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait subir au groupe du plaignant.\n[43] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e divulguera la totalit\u00e9 des pages du Manuel qui ne l\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9, et ce, sous forme non expurg\u00e9e, y compris celles qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate du plaignant.\n[44] Je tiens \u00e0 signaler que la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 (Itty c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 TCDP 34) demeure toujours en vigueur. Le Manuel fait partie des documents qu\u2019elle vise et, de ce fait, cette d\u00e9cision s\u2019applique aussi aux parties du Manuel qu\u2019il est par la pr\u00e9sente ordonn\u00e9 de divulguer.\n[45] Je signale \u00e9galement que le fait d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019un document soit divulgu\u00e9 ne veut pas dire que celui-ci est admissible en preuve \u00e0 une audience. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une audience est une question nouvelle et distincte qui doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience et pour laquelle le crit\u00e8re est diff\u00e9rent de celui qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la divulgation.\nXI.

Introduction \u2013 Requ\u00eate en sursis\n[1] L\u2019intim\u00e9, Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada (CIC), demande l\u2019ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en attendant qu\u2019un jugement soit rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (CAF) dans une autre affaire. CIC croit que le jugement de la Cour d\u00e9terminera en partie le r\u00e9sultat pour la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nII. Contexte\nA. Pr\u00e9sente plainte en vertu de la LCDP\n[2] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante, Maiia Mykolayivna Zaafrane, le 22 avril 2014, aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission). Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2015, la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[3] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que CIC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, pour des motifs religieux, en l\u2019emp\u00eachant de prendre part \u00e0 une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Zaafrane n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de remplir les exigences \u00e0 respecter pour devenir un citoyen canadien. Mme Zaafrane n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie parce qu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de retirer son niqab, v\u00eatement qui couvre la t\u00eate et le visage \u00e0 l\u2019exception des yeux.\n[4] CIC a une politique qui exige que l\u2019on retire les v\u00eatements couvrant le visage pour pr\u00eater le serment de citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne lors d\u2019une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de citoyennet\u00e9 (la Politique). Mme Zaafrane soutient qu\u2019elle porte son niqab en public dans le cadre de sa religion et que, \u00e0 ce titre, CIC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit pour des motifs religieux en appliquant la politique \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et en lui interdisant de prendre part \u00e0 une c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de citoyennet\u00e9 avec son niqab.\nB. L\u2019affaire devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : : Canada (A.G.) c. Ishaq\n[5] Dans une affaire semblable, une femme du Pakistan nomm\u00e9e Zunera Ishaq a demand\u00e9 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne. Mme Ishaq porte elle aussi un niqab et elle soutient que le port de ce niqab fait partie de ses croyances religieuses. Mme Ishaq a satisfait \u00e0 toutes les exigences pour obtenir la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, mais elle n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie afin de pr\u00eater serment de citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne. Connaissant la politique, Mme Ishaq a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et elle a sollicit\u00e9 une ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 CIC d\u2019appliquer la politique \u00e0 son \u00e9gard lors de la prochaine c\u00e9r\u00e9monie de citoyennet\u00e9. (Ishaq c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2015 CF 156.)\n[6] Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2015, le juge Boswell de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la demande de Mme Ishaq.\n[7] Le d\u00e9fendeur a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision du juge Boswell \u00e0 la CAF. L\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre entendu de fa\u00e7on acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e en septembre 2015.\n[8] Dans le cas de la plainte relative \u00e0 la LCDP dont je suis saisi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate d\u2019ajournement de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019affaire Ishaq soit entendue par la CAF. Mme Zaafrane ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la mise en suspens de sa plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq soit entendu et tranch\u00e9. Toutefois, la Commission s\u2019y oppose et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations dans lesquelles elle demandait que le Tribunal ne mette pas en suspens la plainte de Mme Zaafrane jusqu\u2019au r\u00e8glement de l\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq.\n[9] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nIII. Observations de CIC en vue d\u2019un sursis\n[10] CIC a fait valoir que la question de savoir si la Politique est l\u00e9gitime et valide ou non est au c\u0153ur de la plainte de Mme Zaafrane et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la r\u00e9solution de cette plainte repose partiellement sur la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 venir de la CAF. CIC ajoute que le fait d\u2019obliger les parties \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte serait contraire aux principes de justice naturelle.\nIV. Analyse\nA. La r\u00e9solution repose-t-elle sur la d\u00e9cision de la CAF?\n[11] L\u2019argument de CIC selon lequel les conclusions de la CAF dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la Politique r\u00e8gleront n\u00e9cessairement la plainte de Mme Zaafrane, en tout ou en partie, ne me convainc pas. Bien que la d\u00e9cision de la CAF puisse en effet avoir une influence sur la position de CIC quant \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement possible avec Mme Zaafrane, les questions dont est saisi le Tribunal sont assez diff\u00e9rentes.\n[12] Dans sa demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, Mme Ishaq demandait \u00e0 obtenir les r\u00e9parations suivantes :\nune d\u00e9claration portant que la Politique porte atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2a) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, Partie 1 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada, 1982, ch. 11 (la Charte);\nune d\u00e9claration portant que la Politique porte atteinte au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte;\nune d\u00e9claration portant que la Politique n\u2019est pas compatible avec la loi applicable et outrepasse donc les pouvoirs de CIC;\nune d\u00e9claration portant que la Politique entrave ind\u00fbment le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des juges de la citoyennet\u00e9;\nune ordonnance interdisant \u00e0 CIC et \u00e0 tout agent de ce dernier de lui refuser la citoyennet\u00e9 en raison de la Politique;\nses d\u00e9pens.\n[13] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli la demande de Mme Ishaq parce que dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Politique entrave l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a un juge de la citoyennet\u00e9 d\u2019accorder aux candidats \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 la plus grande libert\u00e9 possible pour ce qui est de la profession de foi religieuse ou de l\u2019affirmation solennelle, elle est ill\u00e9gale. (Ishaq, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 68). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 les questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de Mme Ishaq.\n[14] Bien que les arguments fond\u00e9s sur la Charte puissent jouer un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de la CAF, il se peut \u00e9galement qu\u2019ils ne soient pas pris en consid\u00e9ration. Il est probable que l\u2019appel reposera principalement sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la Politique \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de son manque de coh\u00e9rence avec les r\u00e8glements pris en vertu de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9. Les questions \u00e0 savoir si la Politique porte ou non atteinte \u00e0 la Charte sont toujours en litige dans l\u2019appel et il est possible que la CAF ait \u00e0 les examiner (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration c. Ishaq, 2015 FCA 151, par. 4).\n[15] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est ax\u00e9e sur des questions non li\u00e9es \u00e0 la Charte, l\u2019opinion de la CAF quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la Politique sera peu pertinente pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si la Politique est conforme \u00e0 la LCDP.\n[16] Mme Zaafrane voudrait que ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination soient examin\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP, et non de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9, ni de ses r\u00e8glements. Un crit\u00e8re diff\u00e9rent sera appliqu\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur des motifs de distinction illicite. De plus, il se peut que Mme Zaafrane et la Commission cherchent \u00e0 obtenir des mesures de redressement tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de celles demand\u00e9es par Mme Ishaq. Par exemple, en vertu du par. 53(2) de la LCDP, le Tribunal peut ordonner le paiement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019issue du dossier de Mme Zaafrane ne d\u00e9pend pas n\u00e9cessairement de l\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il devrait proc\u00e9der ind\u00e9pendamment.\nB. Principes de justice naturelle\n[17] CIC fait valoir l\u2019argument selon lequel si cette plainte \u00e9tait instruite avant l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire Ishaq, cela serait contraire aux principes de justice naturelle. CIC soutient qu\u2019il devrait donner suite \u00e0 l\u2019affaire sans avoir tous les faits en main. De plus, il soutient qu\u2019il faut attendre la d\u00e9cision de la CAF dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq pour comprendre la nature exacte du litige. CIC avance aussi que la d\u00e9cision de la CAF pourrait avoir une incidence sur la mesure de redressement qui pourrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[18] Normalement, le Tribunal s\u2019efforce d\u2019instruire les plaintes le plus rapidement possible. Le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n\u00ab L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. \u00bb\n[19] Des motifs imp\u00e9rieux sont requis pour justifier une d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, pour obtenir un ajournement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00ab doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il subirait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle si l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal poursuivait son cours normal. \u00bb (Marshall c. Cerescorp Company 2011 TCDP 5). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il incombe \u00e0 CIC de persuader le Tribunal qu\u2019il y aurait atteinte \u00e0 la justice naturelle en l\u2019absence d\u2019un ajournement. Je n\u2019en suis pas convaincu.\n[20] Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour les parties, le Tribunal offrirait naturellement aux parties l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser des observations additionnelles sur tout jugement rendu par un tribunal ayant un pouvoir de surveillance entre le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction et la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive du Tribunal si un tel jugement du tribunal concerne une question en litige devant le Tribunal. Certainement, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je vais donner aux parties amplement l\u2019occasion de traiter de la d\u00e9cision de la CAF dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq si elle est rendue avant une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a aucun risque que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne connaisse pas [traduction]\u00ab les faits qu\u2019on entend lui opposer \u00bb ou qu\u2019il soit priv\u00e9 de son [traduction] \u00ab droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendu \u00bb.\n[21] Je ne crois pas qu\u2019un ajournement est n\u00e9cessaire pour obtenir des pr\u00e9cisions au sujet des questions de fait et, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il se peut que les questions juridiques devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es par la CAF ne soient pas du tout les m\u00eames. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les mesures de redressement applicables \u00e0 Mme Zaafrane en vertu de la LCDP repr\u00e9sentent ses mesures de redressement et elles n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement un caract\u00e8re syst\u00e9mique. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si le dossier progresse \u00e0 ce moment-ci.\n[22] M\u00eame si la CAF conclut que la Politique est invalide et ill\u00e9gale, cette d\u00e9cision peut tout de m\u00eame avoir peu de r\u00e9percussions sur les questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, la question est purement sp\u00e9culative.\n[23] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rendues par le Tribunal dans lesquelles une suspension avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e en attendant un jugement de cours sup\u00e9rieures dans une autre affaire : Bailie et al c. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilot Association, 2012 TCDP 6; Renaud, Sutton et Morgeau c. Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 30. Selon moi, la pr\u00e9sente affaire se distingue parce qu\u2019on ne demande pas au Tribunal d\u2019attendre l\u2019issue de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un autre tribunal ou de l\u2019examen par une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal. Les ajournements dans les affaires cit\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s en se fondant sur des questions pratiquement identiques express\u00e9ment port\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la CF ou de la CAF dans des instances en cours. Dans ces cas, il ne faisait aucun doute que des directives tr\u00e8s pertinentes suivraient (voir Bailie, par. 26; Renaud, par. 16 et 17; voir \u00e9galement Congr\u00e8s juif canadien c. Henry Makow, 2010 TCDP 13, par. 8; Ligue des droits de la personne de B'nai Brith, Abrams c. Topham, Arthur, 2010 TCDP 14, par. 9). Il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre certain que la question relative \u00e0 l\u2019art. 15 de la Charte dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq sera tranch\u00e9e par la CAF. La Cour est saisie d\u2019autres questions en litige, dont une est une question non constitutionnelle. Voir le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Ishaq, 2015 CF 156, par. 66 et 67.\nV. D\u00e9cision\n[24] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal rejette la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la plainte suivra son cours selon le processus normal de gestion des instances pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Le contexte\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 30 octobre 2011 par Munglegeet \u00ab Penny \u00bb Kaur Siddoo, la plaignante (ci\u2011apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e, \u00e0 sa demande, Mlle Siddoo), contre le Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502, l\u2019intim\u00e9 (le syndicat), dans laquelle celle\u2011ci all\u00e8gue que le syndicat a commis \u00e0 son endroit des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] Dans sa plainte, Mlle Siddoo all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement, de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel, d\u2019agression physique, d\u2019intimidation et de menaces de mort par le syndicat. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations d\u2019intimidation collective, de harc\u00e8lement criminel collectif, de terrorisme psychologique et de harc\u00e8lement manifeste.\n[3] Le 2 juillet 2013, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte.\n[4] Mlle Siddoo a comparu et t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle se repr\u00e9sentait elle-m\u00eame. Mlle Siddoo a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que son t\u00e9moignage allait porter sur deux incidents s\u2019\u00e9tant produits lors de formations en 2010. Bien que des incidents pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s, ils sont consid\u00e9rablement ant\u00e9rieurs aux deux incidents en cause et ne font pas l\u2019objet de la plainte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude.\n[5] Le syndicat \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat, Me Bruce Laughton, c.r., et un repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, M. Chris Verbeek, a comparu en tant que t\u00e9moin. La Commission n\u2019a pas comparu \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nII. La d\u00e9cision\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tay\u00e9e. Elle est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. Les faits\n[7] Dans l\u2019ensemble, les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Cependant, les parties ont une perception tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente des incidents ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte.\n[8] Mlle Siddoo s\u2019identifie comme \u00e9tant une femme indo-canadienne c\u00e9libataire ayant une d\u00e9ficience. En d\u00e9cembre 2004, elle a re\u00e7u une carte d\u2019identit\u00e9 de la British Columbia Maritime Employers\u2019 Association (la BCMEA), qui lui a permis de poser sa candidature pour obtenir du travail occasionnel par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du syndicat.\n[9] La BCMEA est une association d\u2019employeurs multiples, au sens du Code canadien du travail, qui repr\u00e9sente environ 65 propri\u00e9taires de navires, agents, d\u00e9bardeurs et exploitants de terminaux et de conteneurs sur la c\u00f4te ouest du Canada. La BCMEA repr\u00e9sente ces employeurs pour tout ce qui touche aux relations de travail et aux relations employeurs-employ\u00e9s. Le syndicat est l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur des d\u00e9bardeurs affect\u00e9s au centre de r\u00e9partition de New Westminster, en Colombie-Britannique (le centre de r\u00e9partition). Le syndicat poss\u00e8de et exploite le centre de r\u00e9partition et la BCMEA lui paye une partie des d\u00e9penses d\u2019exploitation. Les affectations de travail et les d\u00e9cisions quant aux personnes appel\u00e9es \u00e0 suivre des formations sont r\u00e9gies par la convention collective conclue entre la BCMEA et le syndicat. Mlle Siddoo \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e occasionnelle au sens de la convention collective et \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le syndicat en mati\u00e8re de relations de travail. Les d\u00e9bardeurs comme Mlle Siddoo sont embauch\u00e9s par des employeurs membres de la BCMEA uniquement \u00e0 la journ\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une affection par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du centre de r\u00e9partition.\n[10] Mlle Siddoo a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir du travail du centre de r\u00e9partition en tant que manoeuvre et, \u00e0 partir de juin 2005, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de la formation, elle a travaill\u00e9 quelques fois comme conductrice d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 roues motrices multiples. Selon ses dires, Mlle Siddoo a accumul\u00e9 environ 1 100 heures de travail par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du centre de r\u00e9partition en 2006.\n[11] Alors qu\u2019elle se rendait au travail le 10 janvier 2007 ou vers cette date, Mlle Siddoo a eu un accident de voiture. Il neigeait abondamment \u00e0 Vancouver ce jour-l\u00e0, et la voiture de Mlle Siddoo a gliss\u00e9 hors de la chauss\u00e9e deux fois. Apr\u00e8s \u00eatre entr\u00e9e en collision avec un poteau, Mlle Siddoo a abandonn\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule et, suivant l\u2019avis que lui avait donn\u00e9 le centre de r\u00e9partition, a termin\u00e9 son trajet en taxi. \u00c0 son arriv\u00e9e au travail, Mlle Siddoo s\u2019est rendue \u00e0 la station de premiers soins puis, pendant un certain temps cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0, elle a conduit un v\u00e9hicule de chargement de type gerbeur. En raison des blessures qu\u2019elle a subies dans l\u2019accident de voiture, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a plus travaill\u00e9 par la suite durant une longue p\u00e9riode. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, elle a tent\u00e9 de reprendre le travail un ou deux jours par semaine \u00e0 partir de novembre ou d\u00e9cembre 2007, jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier de 2008. Cependant, des douleurs au bas du dos l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 roues motrices multiples et son m\u00e9decin lui a conseill\u00e9 de cesser de travailler.\n[12] Au d\u00e9but de 2010, Mlle Siddoo a travaill\u00e9 comme b\u00e9n\u00e9vole aux Jeux olympiques d\u2019hiver. Elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9prouv\u00e9 de difficult\u00e9s physiques, elle a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait suffisamment r\u00e9tablie pour envisager un retour au travail par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du syndicat. Elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec ce dernier par courriel le 31 mai 2010 et a discut\u00e9 avec M. Verbeek des diverses possibilit\u00e9s pour un retour au travail qui r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 ses besoins. M. Verbeek lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de suivre une formation au port Delta, afin qu\u2019elle puisse \u00e9viter les emplois exigeants sur le plan physique. Mlle Siddoo a demand\u00e9 une formation de perfectionnement sur le tracteur \u00e0 roues motrices multiples, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u2019un ou deux jours, afin qu\u2019elle puisse v\u00e9rifier comment elle s\u2019en ressentirait physiquement. Environ une semaine plus tard, M. Verbeek a inscrit Mlle Siddoo \u00e0 une formation de perfectionnement de deux jours sur le tracteur \u00e0 roues motrices multiples.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s cette formation, Mlle Siddoo a conclu qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas endurer les secousses du v\u00e9hicule et leurs r\u00e9percussions sur sa colonne vert\u00e9brale et sa hanche. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin, Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Verbeek le 14 juin 2010 et a propos\u00e9 une formation pour un emploi diff\u00e9rent, ayant moins de r\u00e9percussions physiques.\n[14] Peu apr\u00e8s, Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite \u00e0 une formation de \u00ab v\u00e9rificateur \u00bb dans les locaux de Terminal Systems Inc. (TSI), l\u2019un des employeurs appartenant \u00e0 la BCMEA. La formation de Mlle Siddoo a commenc\u00e9 le 5 juillet 2010 ou vers cette date. Il y avait deux formateurs et Mlle Siddoo \u00e9tait l\u2019un des quatre employ\u00e9s qui assistaient \u00e0 la formation. On a pens\u00e9 que le poste de v\u00e9rificateur \u00e9tait moins exigeant physiquement et qu\u2019il conviendrait donc mieux aux besoins de Mlle Siddoo. Apr\u00e8s avoir suivi la formation, Mlle Siddoo serait admissible \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 du travail de v\u00e9rificateur par le syndicat.\n[15] \u00c0 la troisi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de sa formation de v\u00e9rificateur, les deux formateurs ont conclu que Mlle Siddoo \u00e9tait beaucoup moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e que ses coll\u00e8gues de formation. Ils ont jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il valait mieux la remplacer par une personne plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que le groupe ne soit ralenti. On lui a dit qu\u2019elle serait r\u00e9inscrite \u00e0 une formation de v\u00e9rificateur avec un groupe de personnes ayant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame niveau d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et elle a repris la formation deux mois plus tard.\n[16] Cependant, au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la formation de v\u00e9rificateur, le 7 juillet 2010, Mlle Siddoo \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t boulevers\u00e9e. Ce soir-l\u00e0, elle a \u00e9crit un courriel \u00e0 M. Verbeek et \u00e0 plusieurs autres personnes, dans lequel elle all\u00e9guait que son retrait de la formation \u00e9tait discriminatoire et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement. En r\u00e9ponse, M. Verbeek a parl\u00e9 aux deux formateurs, puis le lendemain, il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mlle Siddoo pour lui expliquer les motifs des formateurs. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision d\u2019inscrire Mlle Siddoo dans un groupe diff\u00e9rent, compos\u00e9 de personnes plus \u00e0 son niveau. Dans son courriel, il a aussi \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nCeci m\u2019am\u00e8ne aux accusations contenues dans votre lettre. Penny, l\u2019un des formateurs est Indien d\u2019Asie. Deux des autres \u00e9tudiants et la personne qui vous a remplac\u00e9e sont des femmes. Pourtant, vous pr\u00e9tendez dans votre lettre que \u00ab quelqu\u2019un leur (les formateurs) a dit de vous larguer \u00bb. Vous vous demandez si vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9e parce que vous \u00eates une femme.\n[17] M. Verbeek a ensuite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019impression que ces accusations \u00e9taient ridicules et que, en fait, c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait harcel\u00e9 par Mlle Siddoo. Le lendemain, celle-ci lui a envoy\u00e9 un courriel dans lequel elle le traitait de menteur et exigeait de recevoir sa formation \u00e0 un autre endroit. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019acrimonie de Mlle Siddoo \u00e0 son endroit, il a pris les mesures pour qu\u2019elle soit admise \u00e0 la prochaine formation de v\u00e9rificateur, qui commen\u00e7ait le 13 septembre 2010.\n[18] Une semaine avant le d\u00e9but de sa nouvelle formation de v\u00e9rificateur, Mlle Siddoo a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 dix dirigeants du syndicat, y compris les plus hauts dirigeants et M. Verbeek. Ce courriel semblait \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019origine une demande concernant le remboursement des co\u00fbts de transport pour les employ\u00e9s handicap\u00e9s. Cependant, le courriel \u00e9tait d\u2019une bonne longueur et critiquait le syndicat \u00e0 cause de la fin abrupte de sa formation en juillet 2010 et portait des accusations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019abus de pouvoir, de mauvais jugement et de discrimination de la part du syndicat.\n[19] N\u00e9anmoins, Mlle Siddoo a recommenc\u00e9 sa formation de v\u00e9rificateur le 13 septembre 2010, laquelle devait se poursuivre durant environ huit semaines. Au d\u00e9but de novembre 2010, Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue de sa formation. Selon le syndicat, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e du travail sans explication le 22 octobre 2010 et avait quitt\u00e9 son poste avant l\u2019heure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 une autre occasion. Il semblerait \u00e9galement que l\u2019employeur, TSI, \u00e9prouvait certaines r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 son comportement.\n[20] Par cons\u00e9quent, la formation de Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue et on lui a demand\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 des griefs et des attestations le 9 novembre 2010 pour un examen des all\u00e9gations. Elle ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. Elle a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de convocation. Dans sa preuve, le syndicat soutient avoir remis l\u2019avis dans le \u00ab plat \u00bb de Mlle Siddoo au centre de r\u00e9partition, ce qui \u00e9tait la pratique habituelle pour remettre des communications aux employ\u00e9s.\n[21] Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut rat\u00e9 la r\u00e9union du 9 novembre 2010, on a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mlle Siddoo pour avoir ds explications. Elle a r\u00e9pondu en envoyant un courriel au pr\u00e9sident du syndicat dans lequel elle l\u2019informait qu\u2019elle avait port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et qu\u2019elle pensait porter plainte \u00e0 la police. Elle a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du syndicat si on allait [traduction] \u00ab encore mettre sa t\u00eate \u00e0 prix? \u00bb Dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience, Mlle Siddoo a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu\u2019elle croyait que quelqu\u2019un chez le syndicat avait pass\u00e9 une commande pour qu\u2019on la tue.\n[22] Dans la r\u00e9ponse au courriel qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9 plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e, M. Verbeek a expos\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations d\u2019absent\u00e9isme et expliqu\u00e9 que TSI avait certaines r\u00e9serves quant au comportement de Mlle Siddoo. Selon lui, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une mesure appropri\u00e9e que de maintenir la suspension de sa formation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la prochaine r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 des griefs et des attestations, pr\u00e9vue pour le 4 janvier 2011, o\u00f9 elle pourrait pr\u00e9senter sa version des faits. Entretemps, elle pouvait venir au centre de r\u00e9partition et porter sa candidature pour du travail occasionnel si elle le d\u00e9sirait.\n[23] Mlle Siddoo a produit en preuve un courriel de M. Chris Fletcher, un superviseur de formation sur le terrain de la BCMEA, dat\u00e9 du 10 novembre 2010. Ce courriel est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre coll\u00e8gues de M. Fletcher \u00e0 la BCMEA et d\u00e9taille une conversation que celui-ci venait d\u2019avoir avec M. Verbeek au sujet de Mlle Siddoo. M. Fletcher y d\u00e9clare avoir dit \u00e0 M. Verbeek que ni l\u2019employeur (TSI) ni les formateurs ne l\u2019avaient inform\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes de comportement ou de discipline concernant Mlle Siddoo. Il y affirme \u00e9galement avoir dit \u00e0 M. Verbeek que Mlle Siddoo pourrait recommencer sa formation de v\u00e9rificateur d\u00e8s le 15 novembre 2010. Le courriel se conclut en faisant \u00e9tat que M. Verbeek n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord et que celui-ci allait discuter avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre du fait que Mlle Siddoo allait recommencer sa formation.\n[24] M. Fletcher n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, de sorte que l\u2019on ne peut accorder beaucoup d\u2019importance \u00e0 son courriel produit en preuve. De toute fa\u00e7on, la question des raisons pour lesquelles le syndicat n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 la demande de M. Fletcher de rappeler Mlle Siddoo pour terminer sa formation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[25] Mlle Siddoo s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 des griefs et des attestations le 4 janvier 2011. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e, notamment en fournissant une lettre d\u2019un physioth\u00e9rapeute expliquant son absence du 22 octobre 2010, dont le syndicat a accept\u00e9 la validit\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une note de son m\u00e9decin dans laquelle il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab En date du 4 janvier 2011, Penny est physiquement apte \u00e0 reprendre sa formation de v\u00e9rificateur. \u00bb Le syndicat a accept\u00e9 la note, mais, avant d\u2019autoriser Mlle Siddoo \u00e0 reprendre sa formation, il a demand\u00e9 au m\u00e9decin de celle-ci de remplir un formulaire plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Tableau r\u00e9capitulatif d\u2019analyse des exigences physiques \u00bb. Le formulaire, fourni par la BCMEA, \u00e9tait propre au poste de v\u00e9rificateur en chef et \u00e9num\u00e9rait les diverses exigences pour ce travail.\n[26] Le m\u00e9decin de Mlle Siddoo a rempli ce formulaire le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2011. Toutefois, sa r\u00e9ponse indiquait que Mlle Siddoo \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches n\u00e9cessitant de se tenir debout ou de marcher. Il a \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9 un retour au travail graduel, de quatre heures par jour.\n[27] Selon le courriel qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du syndicat le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2011, Mlle Siddoo venait de d\u00e9poser en personne le formulaire du m\u00e9decin de la BCMEA au centre de r\u00e9partition ce jour-l\u00e0. Le lendemain, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse, elle a envoy\u00e9 un autre courriel au syndicat, pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019elle d\u00e9posait la plainte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Elle n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de terminer sa formation de v\u00e9rificateur et elle ne s\u2019est plus port\u00e9e candidate pour obtenir du travail par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du centre de r\u00e9partition. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en avoir assez et avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9fendre sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Le syndicat n\u2019a plus fait d\u2019autres tentatives pour embaucher Mlle Siddoo.\nIV. L\u2019analyse\nA. L\u2019exigence d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire\n[28] En mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, il incombe au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte. La preuve \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue est \u00ab celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de [l\u2019]intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28). Pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue dans le contexte de la LCDP, les plaignants doivent montrer : 1) qu\u2019ils ont une ou plusieurs des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la LCDP contre la discrimination; 2) qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 une situation vis\u00e9e aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP; 3) que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (voir Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33). Les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (voir Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, aux paragraphes 55-69).\n[29] Le Tribunal a reconnu la difficult\u00e9 de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination par des preuves directes. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) [Basi] : \u00ab La discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. \u00bb Il faut plut\u00f4t prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble des circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 dans Basi de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\nB. Les motifs de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\n[30] La premi\u00e8re question sur laquelle le Tribunal doit se pencher est celle de savoir quels sont les motifs de distinction illicites en cause dans les all\u00e9gations de Mlle Siddoo. Sa plainte initiale soulevait les motifs de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, de la religion, du sexe, de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et de la d\u00e9ficience. En contre-interrogatoire, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que sa plainte portait principalement sur les deux formations de 2010, elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle estimait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la premi\u00e8re formation de v\u00e9rificateur parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une femme indienne d\u2019Asie ayant une d\u00e9ficience. Pour ce qui est de la seconde formation, elle a affirm\u00e9 que sa suspension \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[31] Les motifs de la religion et de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s dans le contexte des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement soulev\u00e9es par Mlle Siddoo. Elle soutient qu\u2019on a fait des commentaires \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 son endroit ou en sa pr\u00e9sence.\nC. L\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite\n[32] Le Tribunal doit ensuite examiner les questions suivantes : Mlle Siddoo a-t-elle subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 une situation vis\u00e9e aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP? Les motifs de distinction illicites invoqu\u00e9s ont-ils constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de cet effet pr\u00e9judiciable? Les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Mlle Siddoo au Tribunal portent principalement sur les articles 7, 10 et 14 de la LCDP. Sa plainte initiale faisait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 9. Je vais commencer par examiner ensemble les all\u00e9gations touchant les articles 7, 9 et 10, puis je pr\u00e9senterai une analyse distincte pour ses all\u00e9gations touchant l\u2019article 14.\n(i) Les all\u00e9gations touchant les articles 7, 9 et 10\n[33] Les articles 7, 9 et 10 de la LCDP portent essentiellement sur la discrimination dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 9(1)c) interdit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux organisations syndicales d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 limiter les chances d\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne ou de la priver de ses chances d\u2019emploi. Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de chances d\u2019emploi en \u00e9tant retir\u00e9e deux fois de la formation de v\u00e9rificateur, en juillet 2010 et en novembre 2010. Elle n\u2019a pas repris la formation de v\u00e9rificateur et elle n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9e au centre de r\u00e9partition apr\u00e8s novembre 2010, malgr\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019exigence du syndicat de faire remplir le formulaire m\u00e9dical par son m\u00e9decin. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis convaincu qu\u2019elle a subi un effet d\u00e9favorable vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9(1)c) de la LCDP.\n[34] Cela dit, en aucun temps Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, le sexe ou la d\u00e9ficience ont constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans son retrait de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des formations de v\u00e9rificateur en 2010. Elle a produit en preuve divers courriels qu\u2019elle a \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec des repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat, ainsi que des copies de messages \u00e9chang\u00e9s sur Facebook avec des coll\u00e8gues. Bien que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait exprim\u00e9, \u00e0 juste titre, certaines r\u00e9serves \u00e0 propos des messages \u00e9chang\u00e9s sur Facebook, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les personnes concern\u00e9es dans les conversations n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9es sur leurs d\u00e9clarations, cette pi\u00e8ce est admissible en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP, car j\u2019estime qu\u2019elle peut aider Mlle Siddoo \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa version des faits. Cependant, la plupart de ces messages pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent les incidents de 2010, et rien dans les documents tir\u00e9s de Facebook ne concerne la discrimination en milieu de travail. M\u00eame si ces documents \u00e9taient probants, je leur accorderais peu de valeur dans les circonstances.\n[35] Bien que les courriels et les messages de Facebook donnent \u00e0 penser que M. Verbeek et d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues aient pu entretenir une certaine animosit\u00e9 envers Mlle Siddoo, rien n\u2019indique que cette possible animosit\u00e9 f\u00fbt fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[36] En ce qui concerne le premier retrait de Mlle Siddoo de la formation, M. Verbeek a produit en preuve la r\u00e9ponse suivante, qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9e par courriel le 8 juillet 2010 :\n[traduction]\nJ\u2019ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 [D.K.] et \u00e0 [D.G.]. Les deux formateurs sont d\u2019avis que les trois autres candidats, [G.C.], [R.H.] et [A.O.] ont beaucoup plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience que vous. Ils sont tous deux d\u2019accord pour dire que ce serait injuste autant pour vous que pour les autres candidats d\u2019ajuster la formation \u00e0 votre niveau d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. [G] a 17 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur les quais, notamment comme op\u00e9rateur de pont portique, de grue sur pneus et de chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs pour conteneur. [R] et [A] sont tous deux des v\u00e9rificateurs qualifi\u00e9s aux quais Fraser Surrey. Ils connaissent d\u00e9j\u00e0 les proc\u00e9dures, mais pas le syst\u00e8me informatique. [D] m\u2019a dit que vous n\u2019avez pas \u00e9chou\u00e9, mais que vous serez inscrite dans le prochain groupe de candidats.\n[37] Mlle Siddoo a soutenu que sa connaissance de l\u2019installation portuaire en question faisait en sorte qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tout aussi exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e, sinon plus, que les autres candidats, mais je n\u2019en suis pas convaincu. En fin de compte, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a pas fourni une preuve suffisante \u00e0 r\u00e9futer l\u2019explication de M. Verbeek ou \u00e0 montrer qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e.\n[38] Pour ce qui est de la suspension de novembre 2010, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans les courriels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Mlle Siddoo indiquent qu\u2019elle a pu \u00eatre injuste sur le plan de la proc\u00e9dure, parce que la BCMEA n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9e. Cependant, m\u00eame si la suspension r\u00e9sultait de l\u2019acrimonie de M. Verbeek, rien ne laisse croire qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9tait en cause.\n[39] Le fait que Mlle Siddoo soit une femme, indienne d\u2019Asie ou ait une d\u00e9ficience ne suffit pas pour que le Tribunal conclue automatiquement \u00e0 la discrimination. Il ne suffit pas non plus d\u2019\u00e9tablir que Mlle Siddoo a subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable ou diff\u00e9rent. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, il incombe aux plaignants de montrer qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019ils ont subi. Malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses et vigoureuses all\u00e9gations de discrimination qu\u2019elle a soulev\u00e9es, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de le faire. Elle ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de la preuve et, m\u00eame dans mon examen approfondi des d\u00e9tails, je n\u2019ai pas senti la moindre odeur subtile de discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y a eu acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 aux articles 7, 9 ou 10 de la LCDP.\n[40] De toute fa\u00e7on, je suis convaincu que les motifs invoqu\u00e9s par le syndicat pour expliquer le retrait de Mlle Siddoo des deux formations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires. La preuve montre que le syndicat collaborait avec Mlle Siddoo afin de lui trouver du travail r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 ses besoins. Au d\u00e9but de 2010, Mlle Siddoo a demand\u00e9 une formation sp\u00e9ciale de mise \u00e0 jour afin de v\u00e9rifier si elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 nouveau capable de conduire un tracteur \u00e0 roues motrices multiples. Cette formation sp\u00e9ciale a eu lieu dans les cinq jours suivant sa demande. Quand il est devenu clair que Mlle Siddoo n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019op\u00e9rer ce type de tracteur pour de longues p\u00e9riodes en raison de ses blessures, M. Verbeek a pris des mesures pour que Mlle Siddoo soit plut\u00f4t inscrite \u00e0 une formation de v\u00e9rificateur. Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la formation de juillet 2010 \u00e0 cause de son niveau d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la formation de novembre 2010 en raison d\u2019inqui\u00e9tudes sur son absent\u00e9isme et son comportement. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces actes. La preuve ne suffit simplement pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que la discrimination a constitu\u00e9 un facteur.\n[41] Enfin, Mlle Siddoo pr\u00e9tend que le syndicat a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience parce que celui-ci ne l\u2019a pas r\u00e9inscrite \u00e0 une formation de v\u00e9rificateur apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut remis le formulaire m\u00e9dical suppl\u00e9mentaire qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u2019incombait pas au syndicat, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la BCMEA et \u00e0 TSI. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur cet argument. Bien que les mesures d\u2019adaptation prises par le syndicat, si mesures il y a eu, n\u2019apparaissent pas clairement, c\u2019est \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les actes ou omissions du syndicat \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ont \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre par un motif de distinction illicite. Encore une fois, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a pu prouver que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas.\n[42] Je remarque \u00e9galement que, apr\u00e8s son courriel du 2 f\u00e9vrier 2010 dans lequel elle d\u00e9clarait avoir l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser la plainte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude, Mlle Siddoo n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019aider le syndicat \u00e0 trouver un accommodement raisonnable. Les personnes qui demandent un accommodement ont l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures pour faciliter la recherche d\u2019un tel compromis (voir Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 RCS 970, \u00e0 la page 944 [Renaud]). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mlle Siddoo a fourni le rapport m\u00e9dical suppl\u00e9mentaire exig\u00e9 par le syndicat. Cependant, le lendemain, avant que le syndicat ne puisse r\u00e9agir, elle s\u2019est retir\u00e9e du processus de recherche d\u2019accommodement afin de d\u00e9poser la plainte pr\u00e9sentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude.\n[43] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal rejette la plainte de discrimination au titre des articles 7, 9 et 10 de la LCDP.\n(ii) Les all\u00e9gations touchant l\u2019article 14\n[44] L\u2019article 14 de la LCDP interdit le harc\u00e8lement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi. Mlle Siddoo a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement contre des membres du syndicat et a utilis\u00e9 le terme fr\u00e9quemment au cours de l\u2019audience. Cependant, le harc\u00e8lement n\u2019est pas facile \u00e0 d\u00e9finir.\n[45] Tout acte qui cause \u00e0 autrui une forme quelconque d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme du harc\u00e8lement. Ce qui offense une personne peut en laisser une autre indiff\u00e9rente. En outre, personne n\u2019est parfait, et il peut tous nous arriver \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019agir sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, de nous montrer insensible ou encore d\u2019\u00eatre tout bonnement stupide. Cela veut-il dire qu\u2019il ne peut jamais y avoir d\u2019interactions s\u00fbres entre personnes? La question n\u2019est pas tant de savoir si une personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9e ou s\u2019est sentie humili\u00e9e, mais de savoir par quelle mesure objective on peut d\u00e9finir le harc\u00e8lement de sorte que chacun saura toujours exactement comment se comporter pour l\u2019\u00e9viter.\n[46] Je ne crois pas que l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP ait pour but de viser chaque sottise ou geste insensible commis en milieu de travail. Le harc\u00e8lement est un mot s\u00e9rieux, qui ne doit pas \u00eatre employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re, mais auquel il faut avoir vigoureusement recours lorsque la situation le justifie. Agir autrement serait le banaliser. Il ne faut pas le d\u00e9valoriser ni en diminuer l\u2019importance en le lan\u00e7ant \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers pour des petites m\u00e9chancet\u00e9s ou des paroles \u00e9chapp\u00e9es lorsque le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9, selon toute norme objective, est \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re.\n[47] Le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir le harc\u00e8lement comme \u00e9tant des paroles ou un comportement non sollicit\u00e9s ou que l\u2019on devrait savoir tels, fond\u00e9s sur un motif de distinction illicite et \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction des faits propres \u00e0 l\u2019affaire selon la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances (voir Janzen c. Platy Enterprises ltd., [1989] 1 RCS 1252; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1999] 3 CF 653). Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, il faut examiner si le comportement a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re telle qu\u2019il cr\u00e9e un environnement de travail hostile ou malsain (voir Day c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 43, au paragraphe 184; Croteau c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2014 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 43).\n[48] En ce qui concerne son retrait des s\u00e9ances de formation en 2010, Mlle Siddoo soutient que le syndicat et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment M. Verbeek ont essay\u00e9 de l\u2019humilier en l\u2019inscrivant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 la session de formation de juillet 2010 avec des personnes ayant plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que le syndicat l\u2019a harcel\u00e9e en exigeant qu\u2019elle remplisse le formulaire m\u00e9dical avant de reprendre la formation. Cependant, elle n\u2019est pas parvenue \u00e0 prouver que M. Verbeek avait essay\u00e9 de l\u2019humilier et, ce qui est plus important encore, qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite avait constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[49] Mlle Siddoo affirme aussi avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e de [traduction] \u00ab vieille fille \u00bb par un autre membre du syndicat. En outre, elle pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019un formateur a formul\u00e9 un commentaire sur les personnes portant un turban. M\u00eame si ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient av\u00e9r\u00e9es, je ne conclurais pas qu\u2019elles sont r\u00e9p\u00e9titives ou suffisamment graves pour constituer le type le harc\u00e8lement interdit par la LCDP.\n[50] Mlle Siddoo a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 d\u2019une dispute avec M. Verbeek en 2005, lors de laquelle il lui avait dit : [traduction] \u00ab Va te faire foutre, Penny Siddo. \u00bb M. Verbeek a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire avoir dit cela, mais il a expliqu\u00e9 le contexte dans lequel la remarque avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. M. Verbeek n\u2019a prof\u00e9r\u00e9 ces paroles qu\u2019une seule fois, il ne s\u2019agit donc pas d\u2019une conduite persistante ou incessante. J\u2019estime de plus que cette remarque n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment grave en elle-m\u00eame pour avoir empoisonn\u00e9 le milieu de travail et ainsi entra\u00eener une conclusion de harc\u00e8lement au titre de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP. En outre, rien ne prouve que ce commentaire de M. Verbeek \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la LCDP.\n[51] Enfin, Mlle Siddoo pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 continuellement harcel\u00e9e par des membres du syndicat, notamment par des actes d\u2019intimidation collective, de harc\u00e8lement criminel collectif et de terrorisme psychologique ainsi que des menaces de mort. La preuve produite n\u2019a pas \u00e9tay\u00e9 ces all\u00e9gations, encore moins \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite aurait constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces pr\u00e9tendus incidents.\n[52] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal rejette \u00e9galement les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement soulev\u00e9es par Mlle Siddoo, car elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de prouver \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y avait eu violation de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP.\nV. Observations suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[53] Mlle Siddoo semble port\u00e9e \u00e0 tirer des conclusions improbables sur les faits se produisant autour d\u2019elle. Elle semble aussi convaincue que les parties se sont associ\u00e9es contre elle. Mlle Siddoo est convaincue que des gens \u00e0 son travail ont conspir\u00e9 pour qu\u2019elle rate sa formation et que ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 un examen \u00e9crit avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es pour qu\u2019elle \u00e9choue.\n[54] Bien qu\u2019il soit possible que la plaignante ait \u00e9t\u00e9 sinc\u00e8rement convaincue que des repr\u00e9sentants et des membres du syndicat voulaient [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019en prendre \u00e0 elle \u00bb, et qu\u2019elle en a ressenti de la d\u00e9tresse et de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, elle a r\u00e9agi aux faits de fa\u00e7on excessive \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Cela a men\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de ses relations avec certains des repr\u00e9sentants et des membres du syndicat, ce qui peut avoir donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une certaine acrimonie dans le milieu de travail. Cependant, je ne crois pas que la discrimination ait constitu\u00e9 un facteur.\n[55] Il est dommage que la Commission n\u2019ait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Si, dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate, elle avait trouv\u00e9 des preuves de la discrimination, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile qu\u2019elle les pr\u00e9sente devant le Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9 par\nDavid Thomas\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe 15 septembre 2015\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1952\/3213\nIntitul\u00e9 : Munglegeet Kaur Siddoo c.

Wheatcroft et non celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Cruden.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente la requ\u00eate sans l\u2019appui d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a choisi de se fonder sur la plainte et sur les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019instruction par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada T1466\/1210 (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00ab Cruden \u00bb), les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cruden dont les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences neutres sont 2010 TCDP 32 (requ\u00eate en jonction des causes Cruden et Wheatcroft) et 2011 TCDP 13 (d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9), le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale annulant la d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Cruden 2013 CF 520, et l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rejetant l\u2019appel, 2014 CAF 131.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019affaire Cruden et la pr\u00e9sente affaire ont des similitudes, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les deux ont trait au m\u00eame acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l\u2019ACDI, relativement auquel les deux personnes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature pour une affectation en Afghanistan dans le cadre de l\u2019examen d\u2019affectation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger de 2008 de l\u2019ACDI. Initialement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulait joindre la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 la plainte Cruden. La membre instructrice Marchildon a refus\u00e9 de joindre les plaintes (voir 2010 TCDP 32). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019affaire Cruden a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue devant le Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et finalement la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[4] Dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, le Tribunal a, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, conclu que le fait d\u2019exiger de l\u2019ACDI qu\u2019elle affecte Mme Cruden en Afghanistan causerait une contrainte excessive en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (elle souffre de diab\u00e8te de type 1) et il a d\u00e9crit longuement les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de Mme Cruden, les conditions de travail propos\u00e9es et les limites quant aux services de livraison de m\u00e9dicaments aux personnes en Afghanistan.\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 discut\u00e9 du fait que les personnes souffrant de diab\u00e8te de type 1 ne doivent pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9es dans une zone de guerre, et il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de [traduction]\u00ab v\u00e9ritable question litigieuse devant \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal que le plaignant puisse \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination ou non, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e de ne pas affecter des personnes souffrant de diab\u00e8te de type 1 en Afghanistan \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les risques inh\u00e9rents aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa position en faveur d\u2019un jugement sommaire, se fonde sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Hryniak c. Mauldin 2014 CSC 7, dans lequel la Cour affirme ce qui suit au paragraphe 5 :\n\u00ab \u2026 les r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant les jugements sommaires doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large et propice \u00e0 la proportionnalit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement abordable, exp\u00e9ditif et juste des demandes. \u00bb\n[7] Le plaignant conteste la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[8] Dans son m\u00e9moire, le plaignant a examin\u00e9 en profondeur son engagement envers l\u2019ACDI \u00e0 divers endroits dans le monde, dans diff\u00e9rents postes et les diff\u00e9rences entre lui et Mme Cruden quant aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Cruden et qu\u2019il a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d\u2019observer les principes fondamentaux des droits de la personne et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[9] Le plaignant a distingu\u00e9 longuement les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente plainte de celles de l\u2019affaire Cruden. Le plaignant a essentiellement soutenu que pour \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ) qui justifierait une norme discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue en milieu de travail, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00e9tablir ce qui suit :\nA. qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\nB. qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\nC. que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail de sorte qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\nCe sont l\u00e0 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re d\u2019EPJ que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a formul\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3 (\u00ab Meiorin \u00bb), au par. 54.\n[10] Au par. 62 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour a donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, concluant ce qui suit :\n\u00ab cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n\u2019impose aucune contrainte excessive. \u00bb [soulignement ajout\u00e9]\n[11] Au paragraphe 27 de ses observations \u00e9crites, le plaignant a fait valoir que la Cour supr\u00eame a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e que dans l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des cas suivants :\n[traduction]\u00ab 1. Aucune personne atteinte de la maladie ne pourrait jamais faire l\u2019objet de [mesures d\u2019accommodement relativement \u00e0 la t\u00e2che] sans cr\u00e9er un niveau de risque inacceptable;\n2. Par ailleurs, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire la preuve que les essais pour les personnes exceptionnelles qui peuvent faire l\u2019objet de [mesures d\u2019accommodement relativement \u00e0 la t\u00e2che] de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire malgr\u00e9 leur d\u00e9ficience sont impossibles sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une contrainte excessive. \u00bb\n[12] Les observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent insistent sur le fait qu\u2019il faut examiner les besoins d\u2019une personne, plut\u00f4t que les demandeurs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n[13] Lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire, la Commission soutient ce qui suit :\nl\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Wheatcroft n\u2019est pas le m\u00eame que celui de Mme Cruden, et la d\u00e9cision prise dans le cas de Mme Cruden repose sur un ensemble de circonstances uniques.\nla d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Cruden \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des conclusions de faits pour lesquelles il serait injustifi\u00e9 d\u2019extrapoler dans le cas de M. Wheatcroft.\nla requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 serait contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence du Tribunal.\nla pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire est unique et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas suivi ce qui serait une proc\u00e9dure normale incluant des preuves qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de v\u00e9ritable question litigieuse.\nI. Analyse\n[14] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (appel\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s la Loi) \u00e9nonce, au par. 50(1), que \u00ab le membre instructeur [\u2026] instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb, et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es pour s\u2019assurer \u00ab que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre. \u00bb (alin\u00e9a 1(1)a) des R\u00e8gles)\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019affaire en cause peut \u00eatre instruite sommairement et rapidement.\n[16] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une requ\u00eate inusit\u00e9e \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucune preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9, la partie qui pr\u00e9sente la requ\u00eate, n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve et se fonde essentiellement sur les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, aux diff\u00e9rents paliers. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les conclusions tir\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Cruden et les d\u00e9tails en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont \u00e0 ce point semblables que m\u00eame si le plaignant \u00e9tablissait une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il n\u2019y aurait pas de v\u00e9ritable question litigieuse.\n[17] L\u2019essentiel de l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 semble \u00eatre que m\u00eame s\u2019il est possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il n\u2019y a pas de v\u00e9ritable question litigieuse \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019on a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019interdiction d\u2019affectation en Afghanistan pour les personnes souffrant de diab\u00e8te de type 1 est une EPJ. Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 toutes les d\u00e9cisions dans l\u2019affaire Cruden susmentionn\u00e9es et signale ce qui suit :\n[18] Le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale contient les observations et conclusions suivantes aux paragraphes 80 \u00e0 82 :\n\u00ab [80] Il ne faut pas en conclure que l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan n\u2019emp\u00eachera jamais un employ\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 en Afghanistan m\u00eame si la d\u00e9ficience de ce dernier pouvait faire l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019accommodement sans contrainte excessive, mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, le Tribunal n\u2019a m\u00eame pas d\u00e9crit une seule situation potentielle o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 pourrait se voir refuser une affectation en Afghanistan du fait de l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan tout en pouvant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de mesures d\u2019accommodement sans contrainte excessive pour son employeur. Sauf si un exemple concret est cit\u00e9 ou si au moins une possibilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est \u00e9voqu\u00e9e, rien ne permet d\u2019affirmer, au sens le plus large, que les directives ont pour effet de \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9favoriser [un individu] en cours d\u2019emploi \u00bb, soit l\u2019exigence formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, ou qu\u2019elles sont \u00ab susceptible[s] d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus \u00bb, soit l\u2019exigence formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a). [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[81] SC a reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal que la formulation de la rubrique \u00ab Exigences m\u00e9dicales absolues \u00bb dans les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e9tait malheureuse parce qu\u2019elle ne rendait pas bien leur intention, soit qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait justement de \u00ab directives \u00bb, et la Cour a pu comprendre lors de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente demande qu\u2019une r\u00e9vision du texte \u00e9tait en cours afin de tenir compte de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Toute question relative \u00e0 la conformit\u00e9 des directives r\u00e9vis\u00e9es \u00e0 la LCDP sera abord\u00e9e dans le contexte des faits particuliers qui pourraient survenir, c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., lorsqu\u2019un employ\u00e9 all\u00e9guera que des mesures d\u2019accommodement auraient pu \u00eatre prises \u00e0 son \u00e9gard dans le cadre d\u2019une affectation en Afghanistan, mais que cette occasion lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par suite de l\u2019application de la version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de ces directives.\n[82] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, vu l\u2019absence de conclusions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, la plainte de Mme Cruden devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il est possible, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a conclu, que la formulation des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan doive \u00eatre revue; cependant, vu la conclusion d\u2019absence d\u2019acte discriminatoire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019application des Directives \u00e0 Mme Cruden ou \u00e0 tout autre individu ou groupe d\u2019individus qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre raisonnable de cibler, le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner les mesures de r\u00e9paration contenues dans sa d\u00e9cision. L\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan n\u2019a pas entra\u00een\u00e9 de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Cruden \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement ne pouvait \u00eatre prise \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sans contrainte excessive dans le cadre d\u2019une affectation en Afghanistan; par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019acte discriminatoire et la plainte aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[19] Pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, au paragraphe 65, la Cour d\u00e9clarait ce qui suit :\n\u00ab \u2026 Selon le Tribunal, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 son refus d\u2019affecter Mme Cruden en Afghanistan, l\u2019ACDI aurait subi une contrainte excessive parce que de nombreux \u00e9cueils auraient accompagn\u00e9 l\u2019affectation dans une zone de guerre d\u2019une personne souffrant de diab\u00e8te de type 1 ayant son profil et ses besoins m\u00e9dicaux. \u00bb\n[20] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 29 :\n\u00ab [29] Le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait observer au paragraphe 81 de sa d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il peut se trouver une autre situation o\u00f9 l\u2019application des Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan pourrait avoir pour cons\u00e9quence le refus d\u2019une affectation dans ce pays \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible pour l\u2019employeur de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins sans en subir de contrainte excessive. Cependant, cette question ne se pose pas dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, et le Tribunal n\u2019a relev\u00e9 aucune situation particuli\u00e8re de cette nature. Le juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement rappel\u00e9 que Sant\u00e9 Canada pr\u00e9voyait de r\u00e9viser les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. \u00bb\n[21] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les renseignements susmentionn\u00e9s, \u00e0 la fois la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale indiquent clairement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019autres plaintes fond\u00e9es sur les Directives sur l\u2019Afghanistan. Les Cours ne semblent pas contester la conclusion du Tribunal, dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, selon laquelle Mme Cruden a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination; la seule question que les Cours ont contest\u00e9e est plut\u00f4t la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle une obligation d\u2019accommodement proc\u00e9durale distincte pourrait subsister lorsqu\u2019un employeur a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il a satisfait aux trois parties du crit\u00e8re d\u2019EPJ de l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[22] Dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, on reconna\u00eet que chaque demande doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e sur une base individuelle, et l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire Cruden n\u2019emp\u00eache pas automatiquement un autre plaignant souffrant de diab\u00e8te de type 1 de d\u00e9poser une plainte au sujet de questions qui s\u2019apparentent \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Cruden.\n[23] Pour qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire soit accueillie, il faut que le Tribunal rejette la plainte \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire ou, dans le cas d\u2019une affaire de nature civile, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 une cause d\u2019action, ce qui serait semblable \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure civile. Toutefois, la pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019est pas une affaire de nature civile mais plut\u00f4t une affaire r\u00e9gie par la Loi.\n[24] Dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (sub nomine SSEFPN c. Canada), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale traite en d\u00e9tail (aux paragraphes 125 \u00e0 157) de la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour examiner les requ\u00eates en rejet avant la tenue d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond. La Cour a conclu que la comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter une plainte devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs (voir le paragraphe 140).\n[25] Dans l\u2019affaire SSEFPN c. Canada, la Cour a conclu que le Tribunal dispose d\u2019une certaine souplesse et peut choisir de statuer sur des plaintes avant la tenue d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond, et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[148] Les exemples cit\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus ne visent pas \u00e9tablir une liste exhaustive de toutes les circonstances o\u00f9 le Tribunal pourrait d\u00e9cider de statuer sur certaines questions sans instruire la plainte au fond. Dans chaque cas, le Tribunal doit examiner les faits et les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans le but de garantir un processus d\u2019audience aussi informel et rapide que le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure le permet.\n[149] Le processus retenu par le Tribunal doit cependant \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et il doit en toutes circonstances donner \u00e0 chacune des parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, [\u2026] de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb en ce qui concerne la question en litige.\n[soulignement ajout\u00e9]\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant, m\u00eame si elles sont tenues pour av\u00e9r\u00e9es, ne suffiraient pas pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. M. Wheatcroft devrait avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments dans le but de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination. C\u2019est \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait soutenir que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination et d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en non-lieu et en rejet de la plainte. La comp\u00e9tence et le droit r\u00e9gissant les requ\u00eates en non-lieu font l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen approfondi dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 CF 785. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la preuve, si M. Wheatcroft a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il incombe alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une EPJ. \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, au choix de l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais ce choix ne peut priver le plaignant de la possibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9valoir du par. 50(1) de la Loi.\n[26] Ce n\u2019est que dans les cas les plus \u00e9vidents qu\u2019une plainte serait rejet\u00e9e avant l\u2019instruction compl\u00e8te du fond de la plainte. La c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9, invoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, ne peut l\u2019emporter sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la justice naturelle et le par. 50(1). \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, le Tribunal ne dispose d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve et les arguments fond\u00e9s sur les d\u00e9cisions dans l\u2019affaire Cruden ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu que cette affaire ne devrait pas \u00eatre instruite.\n[27] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience on l\u2019autorise \u00e0 se fonder sur les transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages fournis par ses t\u00e9moins dans l\u2019affaire Cruden. L\u2019intim\u00e9 veut d\u00e9poser les transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les personnes suivantes :\nBob Johnston, ancien directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI;\nMichael Collins, ancien directeur des services minist\u00e9riels, Groupe de travail sur l\u2019Afghanistan, ACDI;\nMarion Parry, ancienne gestionnaire, mobilit\u00e9 organisationnelle \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI;\nColonel Jacques Ricard, ancien chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e de terre, conseiller m\u00e9dical, minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale;\nMajor Robin Thurlow, ancien membre de la Direction des Op\u00e9rations (Services de sant\u00e9), minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale;\nDre Eva Callary, ancienne m\u00e9decin-chef, Clinique de sant\u00e9 au travail, Sant\u00e9 Canada;\nDre Peggy Baxter, m\u00e9decin, Clinique de sant\u00e9 au travail, Sant\u00e9 Canada;\nDr John Dupr\u00e9, endocrinologue, expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nCette demande ne porte pas atteinte au droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de faire appel \u00e0 des t\u00e9moins pour aborder en d\u00e9tail la pr\u00e9sente affaire. De plus, dans la section Aper\u00e7u du dossier de requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce dernier demande au plaignant de mentionner les arguments pr\u00e9cis sur lesquels il entend se fonder et qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Cruden. Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de limiter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience de M. Wheatcroft de sorte que seules les nouvelles questions soulev\u00e9es par M. Wheatcroft soient abord\u00e9es, et non les questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Cruden.\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9 se fonde sur une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire CAW \u2013 Canada c. Presteve Foods Ltd., 2013 HRTO 20 (ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab CAW \u00bb), dans le cadre de laquelle l\u2019arbitre a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on accepte une transcription d\u2019une instance criminelle \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moignage sous serment et que toutes les parties puissent se fonder sur celle-ci \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal a reconnu le besoin d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moignages oraux relativement aux all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles il devait se prononcer quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a ensuite fait remarquer ce qui suit, au par. 104 :\n[traduction]\u00ab \u2026il y avait d\u2019autres questions abord\u00e9es dans la transcription provenant de l\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, \u00e0 la fois lors de l\u2019interrogatoire principal et en contre-interrogatoire, pour lesquelles il semblait y avoir peu d\u2019utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 donner des explications oralement \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal relativement \u00e0 ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail dans la transcription de l\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019instance criminelle. \u00bb\n[29] En principe, le plaignant ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages des t\u00e9moins dans l\u2019affaire Cruden en ce qui concerne la preuve principale. Le plaignant demande que les t\u00e9moins soient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s sans restrictions, et que l\u2019on obtienne tout autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pertinent.\n[30] La Commission n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019utilisation des transcriptions en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, pourvu que le plaignant et la Commission puissent contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, la Commission soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle voudra peut-\u00eatre utiliser une partie de ses contre-interrogatoires de l\u2019affaire Cruden mais, en plus, elle voudra peut-\u00eatre \u00e9galement contre-interroger plus en profondeur les t\u00e9moins relativement aux questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[31] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019affaire CAW en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation de transcriptions d\u2019audiences ant\u00e9rieures. On affirme ce qui suit au par. 105 de la d\u00e9cision CAW :\n[traduction]\u00ab [105] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, et sans limiter la capacit\u00e9 de toute partie d\u2019interroger des t\u00e9moins ou d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents, j\u2019ai propos\u00e9 que l\u2019on permette \u00e0 toutes les parties de se fonder sur les t\u00e9moignages apparaissant dans la transcription de l\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ces t\u00e9moignages devant moi de vive voix. \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[32] Toutefois, aux par. 106 et 107 de l\u2019affaire CAW, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\u00ab [106] J\u2019ai invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leurs observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ma proposition. Bien que n\u2019\u00e9tant pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9fractaires \u00e0 ce que j\u2019ai propos\u00e9, toutes les parties ont soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ne voulaient pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9es par la transcription relativement aux questions \u00e0 propos desquelles elles pourraient vouloir interroger ou contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins. CAW-Canada a fait valoir que les questions dans une instance relative aux droits de la personne sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de celles dans une instance criminelle, et qu\u2019il se peut que d\u2019autres t\u00e9moignages doivent \u00eatre obtenus des t\u00e9moins outre ce que l\u2019on trouve dans la transcription. Je suis d\u2019accord. Mon intention n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de limiter l\u2019obtention de t\u00e9moignages pertinents aupr\u00e8s des t\u00e9moins, mais plut\u00f4t de faire en sorte que le t\u00e9moignage sous serment que l\u2019on trouve dans la transcription de l\u2019instance criminelle soit admissible en tant que preuve testimoniale devant moi et puisse servir de fondement pour toutes les parties.\n[107] Les intim\u00e9s craignent que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 rev\u00eate une grande importance dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, et ils ne veulent pas qu\u2019on leur interdise de contre-interroger des t\u00e9moins simplement parce qu\u2019un genre particulier de contre-interrogatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 dans l\u2019instance criminelle et a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9 dans la transcription. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, je suis conscient qu\u2019il y aura de graves questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 que je devrai trancher et je veux accorder \u00e0 toutes les parties une possibilit\u00e9 ad\u00e9quate de v\u00e9rifier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins de la partie adverse. Parall\u00e8lement, j\u2019ai le pouvoir, en vertu des R\u00e8gles, d\u2019assurer le r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente affaire non seulement d\u2019une fa\u00e7on juste et \u00e9quitable mais \u00e9galement rapidement, et j\u2019ai le pouvoir explicite de limiter la preuve sur n\u2019importe quel sujet. Je vais exercer judicieusement ce pouvoir \u00e0 l\u2019audience et de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas priver une partie d\u2019un r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente affaire juste, \u00e9quitable et rapide. Toutefois, si une s\u00e9rie de questions ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin dans le cadre de l\u2019instance criminelle et si je suis d\u2019avis que le processus d\u2019audience ne profite pas d\u2019une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de cette s\u00e9rie de questions devant moi, je vais exercer les pouvoirs qui me sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par les R\u00e8gles. \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[33] Les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes de celles de l\u2019affaire CAW, puisque les transcriptions en question proviennent d\u2019une instance \u00e0 laquelle M. Wheatcroft n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9. Toutefois, il est utile d\u2019admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de l\u2019affaire Cruden qui ne sont pas propres \u00e0 Mme Cruden, d\u00e8s lors que les t\u00e9moins peuvent \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9s, sous r\u00e9serve de quelques restrictions.\n[34] Dans l\u2019affaire CAW, l\u2019arbitre \u00e9tait conscient de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s\u2019assurer que les parties adverses (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce M. Wheatcroft et la CCDP) ont l\u2019enti\u00e8re possibilit\u00e9 de contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins ou d\u2019obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, et qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas \u00eatre assujetties \u00e0 des restrictions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Je souscris \u00e0 ces principes.\n[35] Finalement, bien que le cadre l\u00e9gislatif et les r\u00e8gles du TCDP diff\u00e8rent de ceux r\u00e9gissant l\u2019affaire CAW, tout comme l\u2019arbitre dans l\u2019affaire CAW, je suis habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 fixer certaines limites relativement aux contre-interrogatoires (voir R\u00e9 : Sonne c. Conseil du secteur du conditionnement physique du Canada, 2014 CAF 48, par. 37; Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 26, par. 20; Kirchmeir c. Edmonton (City) Police Service, 2000 ABCA 324, par. 21). Je retiendrai donc l\u2019esprit des parties soulign\u00e9es du paragraphe 106 de la d\u00e9cision CAW pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e et c\u2019est l\u00e0 la r\u00e8gle dont je me servirai en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[36] Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le plaignant devrait identifier de nouveaux arguments qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s ou examin\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire Cruden. Le probl\u00e8me que pose la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie dans l\u2019affaire Cruden et n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change de documents et de rapports, et il n\u2019a pas non plus eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les transcriptions des instances dans l\u2019affaire Cruden. Il serait injuste d\u2019exiger du plaignant qu\u2019il identifie de nouveaux arguments ou de limiter la port\u00e9e de sa plainte \u00e0 ce moment-ci.\nII. Ordonnance\n[37] La requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est rejet\u00e9e.\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit sans d\u00e9lai, au plus tard le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2015, mettre \u00e0 la disposition du plaignant des copies des transcriptions des t\u00e9moignages tir\u00e9s de l\u2019audience dans l\u2019affaire Cruden tenue devant la membre instructrice Marchildon.\n[39] Les transcriptions susmentionn\u00e9es doivent \u00eatre accept\u00e9es comme des t\u00e9moignages faits sous serment devant le Tribunal, et toutes les parties pourront se fonder sur elles \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[40] Les parties doivent pouvoir pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour aborder les d\u00e9tails en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[41] Le plaignant, M. Wheatcroft, doit pouvoir pr\u00e9senter ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sous r\u00e9serve de leur pertinence, comme le pr\u00e9voit le par. 50(1) de la Loi. Si M. Wheatcroft invoque des arguments qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s devant le Tribunal dans le cadre de l\u2019instance dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, il doit fournir des pr\u00e9cisions, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les transcriptions et les pi\u00e8ces produites dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, et avant la fixation des dates d\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[42] \u00c0 ce stade-ci, le plaignant n\u2019est pas tenu de pr\u00e9ciser les arguments pr\u00e9cis qu\u2019il entend invoquer et qui n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Cruden, et la port\u00e9e de sa plainte ne sera pas limit\u00e9e. Cette question et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il entend pr\u00e9senter peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s plus tard, une fois que les transcriptions auront \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies et que la divulgation sera compl\u00e8te.\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit, par voie de sommation s\u2019il y a lieu, permettre au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission de contre-interroger tous les t\u00e9moins dont les transcriptions de t\u00e9moignages dans l\u2019affaire Cruden serviront de fondement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, sous r\u00e9serve des commentaires que l\u2019on trouve au paragraphe 31.\n[44] Lorsqu\u2019une partie se fonde sur le contre-interrogatoire d\u2019un t\u00e9moin tir\u00e9 des transcriptions de l\u2019affaire Cruden, elle a la possibilit\u00e9 de contre-interroger le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente audience.\nIII. Observations finales\n[45] Je crois que ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de a couvert toutes les questions non r\u00e9solues. S\u2019il y a des questions ou s\u2019il est difficile de respecter la date limite pour la divulgation des documents, une autre conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance devrait \u00eatre demand\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement. Je demande au plaignant, M. Wheatcroft, et \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019aviser le Tribunal une fois qu\u2019ils auront eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner les transcriptions et seront en mesure de fixer des dates d\u2019audience.\n[46] En terminant, je tiens \u00e0 remercier tous les avocats pour leurs m\u00e9moires et leurs observations orales d\u00e9taill\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Ulyatt\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI.Introduction 1\nII.Analyse 3\nIII.D\u00e9cision 5\nI. Introduction\n[1] La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de modifier sa plainte pour y inclure la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, soit la section locale 500 du International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e International). La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle est continuellement victime d\u2019intimidation et de harc\u00e8lement de la part d\u2019International et donne des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[2] Le Tribunal, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le membre Wallace, a rendu une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 stricte le 9 septembre 2011 en ce qui a trait au r\u00e8glement de Mme Palm avec son employeur et la British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (la BCMEA). Voici un extrait de cette d\u00e9cision :\n[20] J\u2019ordonne la divulgation du r\u00e8glement aux autres intim\u00e9s, divulgation qui doit \u00eatre faite de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\na) Dans les quatorze jours apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, Harris & Company, le cabinet d\u2019avocats des employeurs intim\u00e9s, fournira une copie du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 Caroline & Gislason, le cabinet d\u2019avocats des autres intim\u00e9s;\nb) Ni Caroline & Gislason ni les autres intim\u00e9s n\u2019utiliseront la copie du r\u00e8glement pour un tout autre objectif que la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019audience ou le r\u00e8glement des plaintes de Mme Palm contre les autres intim\u00e9s;\nc) Caroline & Gislason pourra communiquer les dispositions du r\u00e8glement de fa\u00e7on orale aux autres intim\u00e9s. Caroline & Gislason ne fera pas de copies du r\u00e8glement, et ni Caroline & Gislason, ni les autres intim\u00e9s ne communiqueront les dispositions du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 quiconque, sauf dans le cas d\u2019une audience ou du r\u00e8glement des plaintes de Mme Palm contre les autres intim\u00e9s;\nd) Caroline & Gislason retournera la copie du r\u00e8glement \u00e0 Harris & Company dans les sept jours suivant les r\u00e8glements des plaintes de Mme Palm contre les autres intim\u00e9s.\n[3] Dans sa requ\u00eate, Mme Palm soutient que les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 ses plaintes, dont est actuellement saisi le Tribunal, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 une tierce partie, et qu\u2019en raison de la divulgation de ces renseignements, les fiduciaires du r\u00e9gime de sant\u00e9 et d\u2019avantages sociaux de la Waterfront Employee Association (le fiduciaire) ont intent\u00e9 une poursuite civile contre elle pour des prestations qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ues en 2008, soit avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en 2009 et le r\u00e8glement avec la BCMEA en 2011. L\u2019argument de Mme Palm se fonde essentiellement sur le fait que les renseignements divulgu\u00e9s faisaient r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son r\u00e8glement et \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9; l\u2019avocat du fiduciaire a \u00e9crit, le 15 octobre 2015, une lettre comprenant le passage suivant :\n[traduction]\nLe r\u00e9gime a appris r\u00e9cemment que vous avez re\u00e7u, en plus des prestations du r\u00e9gime, un r\u00e8glement de votre employeur et de son repr\u00e9sentant, ainsi qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te de leur part. (Requ\u00eate de Mme Palm)\n[4] International, par l\u2019entremise de son avocat, a fait valoir que [traduction] \u00ab la requ\u00eate de Mme Palm ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme soutenable \u00bb et a demand\u00e9 le rejet de la requ\u00eate. Pour r\u00e9sumer sa position, International s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7, qui est formul\u00e9e en ces termes :\n[7] Il est d\u00e9sormais incontestable que ce Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier une plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on devrait autoriser une modification, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, le Tribunal ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une modification. Un tel examen devrait \u00eatre fait uniquement au regard de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, au terme d\u2019une audience en bonne et due forme. Par cons\u00e9quent, le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte de Mme Palm doivent r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la LCDP), qui est formul\u00e9 en ces termes :\n[14.1] Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019il y a deux crit\u00e8res \u00e0 respecter :\na) l\u2019acte doit \u00eatre punitif et causer des dommages \u00e0 la plaignante;\nb) l\u2019acte doit \u00eatre commis par un intim\u00e9 ou une personne agissant au nom d\u2019un intim\u00e9.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que la requ\u00eate de Mme Palm ne satisfait pas \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res, et soutient que le syndicat n\u2019exerce aucun contr\u00f4le sur la poursuite intent\u00e9e par le fiduciaire.\n[8] La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un m\u00e9moire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la position de la plaignante.\n[9] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal a un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e9tendu en ce qui a trait aux proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 la conduite, qu\u2019il a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaires pour modifier la plainte afin de tenir compte des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires et que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 ce principe. La Commission s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 R.C.F 3. Elle a \u00e9galement cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 61849 (TCDP), au paragraphe 19.\nII. Analyse\n[10] Les parties semblent toutes s\u2019entendre d\u2019apr\u00e8s leurs observations, dans lesquelles elles reconnaissent que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour modifier la plainte afin d\u2019y inclure les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles (Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9 (CanLII)).\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de prouver que sa cause est soutenable.\n[12] La capacit\u00e9 de modifier une plainte aux termes de la LCDP est claire. De plus, il ressort des questions et des affaires que la norme r\u00e9gissant la modification d\u2019une plainte n\u2019est pas \u00e9lev\u00e9e. La plaignante a \u00e9tabli une cause soutenable en ce qui a trait aux repr\u00e9sailles. Elle peut modifier sa plainte. Il reste \u00e0 prouver si la plainte modifi\u00e9e sera accueillie.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en jugement sommaire, ou, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019affaire de la plaignante, de demander un non\u2011lieu ou de pr\u00e9senter une preuve en vue de contester la plainte.\n[14] Le Tribunal applique la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canderel, qui comprend le passage suivant :\n[\u2026] la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est qu\u2019une modification devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties, pourvu, notamment, que cette autorisation ne cause pas d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie que des d\u00e9pens ne pourraient r\u00e9parer, et qu\u2019elle serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice [...] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nCanderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (C.A.), [1994] 1 R.C.F. 3 (CanLII), au paragraphe 2.\n[15] \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, la plaignante doit d\u00e9poser ses plaintes, qui seront trait\u00e9es comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9.\n[16] Le Tribunal sait qu\u2019il y a trois plaintes remontant \u00e0 2009 et qu\u2019actuellement, le membre du Tribunal est au moins le troisi\u00e8me \u00e0 entendre cette affaire.\n[17] Le moment est venu d\u2019aller au fond des choses et de clore cette affaire pour le bien de toutes les parties.\nIII. D\u00e9cision\n[18] Ordonnance\na) Mme Palm pourra d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 au plus tard le 14 janvier 2016;\nb) Mme Palm divulguera tous les documents se rapportant \u00e0 sa plainte modifi\u00e9e;\nc) les questions pratiques feront l\u2019objet de discussions \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance, qui se tiendra le 8 janvier 2016.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Contexte \u2013 la plainte\n[1] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Ken Kelsh (le plaignant) contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique (l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] Dans sa plainte modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime :\n\u00b7 de discrimination en cours d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019adaptation, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP);\n\u00b7 de repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP;\n\u00b7 de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans les pratiques et proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019administration de tests et de postulation, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP.\n[3] Le plaignant est membre d\u2019une section du syndicat des Teamsters (le syndicat). Son emploi est r\u00e9gi par une convention collective (la convention collective) conclue entre le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] La Commission ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle n\u2019a pas pris position au sujet de la requ\u00eate.\nII. Requ\u00eate du plaignant\n[5] La requ\u00eate modifi\u00e9e du plaignant vise \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019indemnisation des t\u00e9moins et la divulgation de documents et de renseignements soit rendue.\nIII. Objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision\n[6] L\u2019audition de la plainte devrait d\u00e9buter le 11 janvier 2016 et prendre fin le 22 janvier 2016. Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je traiterai des demandes de divulgation figurant aux paragraphes 2 \u00e0 6 de la requ\u00eate. Je rendrai une autre d\u00e9cision au chapitre de l\u2019indemnisation des t\u00e9moins. Je crois que le processus de divulgation n\u00e9cessite plus de temps de la part des parties, et il est dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat de conna\u00eetre leurs obligations en mati\u00e8re de divulgation relativement \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate. La d\u00e9cision traite de chaque demande de divulgation individuellement.\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s\n[7] Bien que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision cite tout d\u2019abord les demandes de divulgation sp\u00e9cifiques figurant dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les modifications qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es aux param\u00e8tres de la divulgation demand\u00e9e depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate. Ces modifications d\u00e9coulent de la plaidoirie prononc\u00e9e lors des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI) du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015 et du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2015, ainsi que de la correspondance que les parties ont transmise aux autres parties et au Tribunal.\nIV. Droit l\u00e9gislatif, R\u00e8gles du Tribunal et jurisprudence\n[8] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit notamment que le membre instructeur ou le Tribunal doit instruire la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et qu\u2019il donne \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb. Une divulgation appropri\u00e9e des documents permettra aux parties d\u2019avoir la pleine possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[9] La r\u00e8gle 6 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal) traite des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, de la divulgation et de la production de documents et de renseignements.\n[10] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) des R\u00e8gles s\u2019applique particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Il pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nChaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n[11] Le paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles rend l\u2019obligation de divulgation continue dans les circonstances d\u00e9crites.\n[12] Il est bien \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et au paragraphe (5) des R\u00e8gles, est que les documents doivent \u00eatre \u00ab potentiellement pertinents \u00bb. Il est \u00e9galement de jurisprudence constante que l\u2019expression \u00ab potentiellement pertinent \u00bb signifie que, pour qu\u2019un document soit potentiellement pertinent, il doit y avoir un lien rationnel entre le document dont on demande la divulgation et le fait, la question ou la forme de redressement demand\u00e9e ou ceux qui sont mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties (Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18 (Seeley), au paragraphe 6). Une demande de divulgation \u00ab ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u201cpartie de p\u00eache\u201d \u00bb (Johanne Guay c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2004 TCDP 34 (Guay), au paragraphe 43).\nV. Paragraphe 2 de la requ\u00eate\n[13] Ce paragraphe vise l\u2019obtention de [traduction] \u00ab tous les documents importants sur les politiques de gestion portant sur les POV (permis d\u2019occuper la voie), les exigences des sous\u2011contrema\u00eetres et les capacit\u00e9s des op\u00e9rateurs de machines du groupe 1 \u00bb.\n[14] La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate (la r\u00e9ponse) faisait \u00e9tat des documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s au chapitre des permis d\u2019occuper la voie, de la protection du sous\u2011contrema\u00eetre et des op\u00e9rateurs de machines du groupe 1.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que le plaignant mentionne tout document sp\u00e9cifique qui, selon lui, n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e; cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019emploierait ensuite \u00e0 trouver ledit document et \u00e0 le divulguer. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a ajout\u00e9 que, entre la date de la r\u00e9ponse et l\u2019audience, elle divulguerait tout autre document qu\u2019elle aurait pu omettre de divulguer, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles.\n[16] La r\u00e9plique du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2015 du plaignant (la r\u00e9plique) \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise que la demande de divulgation visait [traduction] \u00ab tout courriel ou note de service pertinent \u00bb de la direction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab qui traite \u00bb des politiques susmentionn\u00e9es, [traduction] \u00ab particuli\u00e8rement dans la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2005 au 24 ao\u00fbt 2011 (date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte) \u00bb, et que [traduction] \u00ab pour la p\u00e9riode subs\u00e9quente, la demande vise tout document ne portant pas sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00bb sur la plainte [traduction] \u00ab et qui ne ferait donc pas l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation \u00bb.\n[17] Je conclus que le plaignant a suffisamment pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 sa demande de divulgation dans sa r\u00e9plique en pr\u00e9cisant \u00e0 la fois le type de document demand\u00e9 et les p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es par la demande. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que, pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, la demande exclut les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9.\n[18] Je conclus que ces documents sont potentiellement pertinents, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre eux et les permis d\u2019occuper la voie, la protection du sous\u2011contrema\u00eetre et les op\u00e9rateurs de machines du groupe 1, qui sont tous pertinents \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 un fait soulev\u00e9 dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des parties.\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit divulguer, si elle ne l\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait, tout document sur les politiques de gestion potentiellement pertinent qui porte sur les permis d\u2019occuper la voie, les exigences des sous\u2011contrema\u00eetres et les capacit\u00e9s des op\u00e9rateurs de machines du groupe 1, y compris tout courriel ou toute note de service potentiellement pertinent de la direction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui traite des politiques susmentionn\u00e9es, particuli\u00e8rement au cours de la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2005 au 24 ao\u00fbt 2011, et, pour la p\u00e9riode subs\u00e9quente, tout document ne faisant pas l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation au chapitre de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVI. Paragraphe 3 de la requ\u00eate\n[20] Ce paragraphe vise l\u2019obtention de toutes les feuilles de postulation pour la division du Sud de l\u2019Ontario pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant de 2004 \u00e0 la fin de 2010 qui pr\u00e9sentent les exigences s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 divers postes d\u2019op\u00e9rateur de machine du groupe 1, en ordre chronologique.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaitait obtenir des \u00e9claircissements quant aux r\u00e9gions pour lesquelles les feuilles de postulation \u00e9taient requises.\n[22] Dans sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse, le plaignant a clarifi\u00e9 sa demande et l\u2019a remplac\u00e9e par celle\u2011ci :\na) avant 2014, la r\u00e9gion qui est actuellement appel\u00e9e le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est (Eastern Region District 1) s\u2019appelait la division du Sud de l\u2019Ontario (Southern Ontario Division);\nb) la demande de divulgation a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e comme suit : les bulletins de postes initiaux et les avis d\u2019attribution \u00e9mis en janvier et en f\u00e9vrier respectivement pour chaque ann\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode 2004\u20112015.\n[23] Le plaignant soutient que ces documents sont pertinents aux questions de discrimination et d\u2019adaptation, car ils font \u00e9tat des [traduction] \u00ab postes du groupe 1 disponibles, des exigences des postes (carte D ou carte E) [\u2026] \u00bb, et des personnes auxquelles ces postes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab parmi le plaignant et ses pairs \u00bb au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[24] Pendant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI) du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne fallait pas confondre les \u00ab feuilles de postulation \u00bb avec les \u00ab bulletins \u00bb.\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9e publie des bulletins de postes pr\u00e9sentant tous les postes pour lesquels les employ\u00e9s peuvent pr\u00e9senter leur candidature. Ensuite, chaque employ\u00e9 soumet sa candidature. Tout comme il existe un historique des bulletins, il existe un historique des candidatures pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par chaque employ\u00e9. Chaque employ\u00e9 postule pour un grand nombre de postes dans le bulletin applicable, les classant en ordre de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[26] Lors de la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le plaignant ne souhaitait obtenir que les principaux bulletins et avis d\u2019attribution et non l\u2019ensemble des feuilles de postulation de tous les employ\u00e9s. Il soutenait que cette demande n\u2019exigeait pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9e mette sur pied un produit de travail, mais qu\u2019elle fournisse simplement le dossier contenant ces documents qu\u2019elle produit chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[27] Au cours de la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a modifi\u00e9 la demande de divulgation dans cette cat\u00e9gorie et l\u2019a remplac\u00e9e par celle\u2011ci :\n[traduction] Les bulletins de postes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les mois de janvier et de novembre et les avis d\u2019attribution connexes pour le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est (appel\u00e9 la division du Sud de l\u2019Ontario avant 2014) et la division de Toronto, pour chacune des cinq ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode 2011\u20112015.\n[28] Au paragraphe 34 de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2015 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant l\u2019obtention d\u2019un ajournement (la requ\u00eate en ajournement), l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 des extraits d\u2019un courriel envoy\u00e9 le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2015 par l\u2019avocat du plaignant dans lequel ce dernier indiquait que la demande de divulgation et la r\u00e9plique du plaignant exigeaient les [traduction] \u00ab bulletins et les avis d\u2019attribution depuis 2004 \u00bb et r\u00e9it\u00e9rait la demande.\n[29] Lors de la CTGI du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, nonobstant son courriel du 14 d\u00e9cembre 2015, il confirmait que la divulgation de bulletins et d\u2019avis d\u2019attribution souhait\u00e9e par le plaignant visait les bulletins du mois de janvier et les avis connexes de m\u00eame que les bulletins du mois de novembre et les avis connexes, et ce, pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de 2011 \u00e0 2015.\n[30] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a confirm\u00e9 par courriel, avec copie conforme aux parties et au Tribunal, que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Ainslie, avait transmis tous les bulletins pour les mois de janvier et de novembre et les avis d\u2019attribution connexes pour le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est et la division de Toronto, et ce, pour la p\u00e9riode de 2011 \u00e0 2015.\n[31] Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ordonner leur divulgation dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nVII. Paragraphe 4 de la requ\u00eate\n[32] Ce paragraphe vise l\u2019obtention de tous les renseignements figurant sur les feuilles de temps quotidiennes, y compris le salaire, en ordre chronologique pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2003 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2015 pour :\n(i) l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e du Sud de l\u2019Ontario no 1 (Ontario South Rail Crew No. 1) (en date du 1er janvier 2015, cette \u00e9quipe s\u2019appelle l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e no 3 [Rail Crew No. 3]);\n(ii) la division de Toronto o\u00f9 le plaignant travaille de quatre \u00e0 cinq mois chaque hiver.\n[33] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa position, que voici :\nelle fournirait au plaignant ses feuilles de temps et les renseignements sur son salaire pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2003 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2015;\nle plaignant devait pr\u00e9ciser la port\u00e9e de sa demande, car s\u2019il exige ces renseignements pour tous les autres employ\u00e9s membres des \u00e9quipes d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e d\u00e9sign\u00e9s de 2003 \u00e0 2015, le dossier comptera des milliers de pages;\ncette information n\u2019est pas probante ni pertinente, car les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour les postes d\u2019employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e figurent dans l\u2019entente salariale, qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e;\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e contreviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.3 de l\u2019annexe 1 de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents \u00e9lectroniques (LPRPDE) si elle divulguait cette information.\n[34] Au paragraphe 8 de la r\u00e9plique, le plaignant :\na reconnu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait divulgu\u00e9 les renseignements figurant sur ses propres feuilles de temps, mais que ces derni\u00e8res ne faisaient \u00e9tat que des heures et non du salaire;\na r\u00e9vis\u00e9 et a limit\u00e9 sa demande de divulgation afin qu\u2019elle ne vise que les feuilles de temps quotidiennes des \u00e9quipes d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e (FQEVF) pour les p\u00e9riodes suivantes :\n(i) du 1er janvier 2011 au 1er d\u00e9cembre 2015 pour toutes les \u00e9quipes d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e du Sud de l\u2019Ontario;\n(ii) la p\u00e9riode hivernale s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er novembre au 30 avril, pour chaque ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de 2008 \u00e0 2015 pour la division de Toronto;\ncomme les FQEVF n\u2019indiquent que le nom et le poste du membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipe et le nombre d\u2019heures normales et d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es pendant la journ\u00e9e en question, la confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une pr\u00e9occupation importante;\nconjugu\u00e9es aux bulletins et aux avis d\u2019attribution, les FQEVF permettraient au plaignant de calculer les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires dont il n\u2019a pas pu profiter pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne l\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire le camion \u00e0 plate\u2011forme ou les camions chasse\u2011neige.\n[35] Lors de la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a dit avoir divulgu\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet du plaignant lui-m\u00eame :\n1. son historique de postulation et d\u2019attribution de poste de 2005 \u00e0 2011 \u2013 faisant \u00e9tat de chaque poste pour lequel il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature et qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode;\n2. son historique de postes de janvier 2003 \u00e0 novembre 2015;\n3. son historique de temps de travail faisant \u00e9tat des honoraires demand\u00e9s et des heures enregistr\u00e9es, qui indique \u00e9galement s\u2019il a fait des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires ou d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires sp\u00e9ciales, entre janvier 2003 et novembre 2015.\n[36] Les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas un titre officiel.

Chaque feuille est inscrite dans un diagramme, et le tout est bien organis\u00e9.

Toutefois, cet historique n\u2019indique que si le plaignant travaillait \u00e0 titre d\u2019op\u00e9rateur de machine du groupe 1 et rien de plus.

Les feuilles sont transmises aux chronom\u00e9treurs. Le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 que, [traduction] \u00ab cette ann\u00e9e \u00bb, les feuilles \u00e9taient informatis\u00e9es et qu\u2019il y en avait une par \u00e9quipe par jour.\n[41] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 que, cette ann\u00e9e, le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est est devenu \u00ab Algoma \u00bb et que les noms changent incessamment. Il a \u00e9galement fourni le nom des superviseurs concern\u00e9s pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 2011 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, \u00e0 la division de Toronto, ces feuilles de temps quotidiennes \u00e9taient conserv\u00e9es.\n[42] Au cours de la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, le plaignant a modifi\u00e9 sa demande de FQEVF et l\u2019a remplac\u00e9e par celle\u2011ci :\n[traduction]\nToutes les FQEVF pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2011 au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2015 (donc 365 par ann\u00e9e) pour le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est (peu importe le nom pass\u00e9 ou actuel de cette r\u00e9gion) et la division de Toronto, pour chaque \u00e9quipe d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e et pour chacune de ces ann\u00e9es, si possible; les feuilles doivent faire \u00e9tat des heures normales et des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es par chaque personne et du poste de chaque personne.\n[43] L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait savoir :\ni) qu\u2019elle demanderait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e si elle dispose des FQEVF pour les \u00e9quipes d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e pour les p\u00e9riodes et les r\u00e9gions d\u00e9sign\u00e9es qui feraient \u00e9tat du nom de chaque membre des \u00e9quipes, des heures normales et des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es et du poste de chaque personne, ou si l\u2019intim\u00e9e dispose d\u2019une partie de ces renseignements;\nii) que, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e dispose en tout ou en partie de ces feuilles, elle les transmettrait au plaignant;\niii) que, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne dispose que d\u2019une partie de ces feuilles, elle en aviserait les autres parties par \u00e9crit.\n[44] Mme Ainslie a demand\u00e9 que ces documents soient rendus anonymes. Cependant, cela ferait en sorte qu\u2019il serait impossible d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s dans les FQEVF.\n[45] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des FQEVF divulgu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Ainsi, aucun avocat, partie ou t\u00e9moin ne doit, de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, mentionner ou transmettre, sous quelque forme que ce soit, tout renseignement (y compris, sans s\u2019y limiter, le nom des personnes ou tout renseignement personnel, le salaire, les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et la date de naissance) sur quiconque est vis\u00e9 par toute FQEVF, ou en discuter, sauf aux fins de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[46] Par surcro\u00eet, dans toute d\u00e9cision ou d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019audience, l\u2019anonymat de ces personnes sera pr\u00e9serv\u00e9.\n[47] La question des FQEVF a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e de nouveau lors de la CTGI du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2015. Le plaignant a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il exigeait la divulgation des feuilles de 2011 \u00e0 2015 inclusivement, mais que, si elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles pour toutes ces ann\u00e9es, il requ\u00e9rait les FQEVF pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2015 puisque, selon lui, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait disposer des feuilles pour cette ann\u00e9e.\n[48] Mme Ainslie a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 l\u2019avocat du plaignant dat\u00e9 du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2015 \u00e0 10 h 55, avec copie conforme au Tribunal, dans lequel, entre autres, elle affirmait qu\u2019elle avait compris que la demande du plaignant en ce qui a trait aux FQEVF avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e. J\u2019estime que cette conclusion repose sur un malentendu concernant les d\u00e9veloppements qui sont survenus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question au cours de la CTGI du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2015. Cela dit, je comprends comment Mme Ainslie a pu parvenir \u00e0 cette conclusion erron\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la CTGI en question et que le principal objet de cette conf\u00e9rence \u00e9tait une requ\u00eate visant l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience.\n[49] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2015, \u00e0 12 h 34, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a r\u00e9pondu au courriel de Mme Ainslie, avec copie conforme au Tribunal, pour r\u00e9it\u00e9rer que la demande de divulgation du plaignant visait, au minimum, les FQEVF pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2015.\n[50] Ensuite, le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2015, \u00e0 3 h 07, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a envoy\u00e9 un courriel, avec copie conforme au Tribunal, dans lequel il avan\u00e7ait que les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires du plaignant au cours de 3,5 des 5 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es pourraient \u00eatre calcul\u00e9es si l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournissait le m\u00eame type d\u2019historique de temps (Time History) faisant \u00e9tat des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es par plusieurs employ\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques qu\u2019elle avait fourni fort rapidement pour le plaignant le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2015. Le plaignant a nomm\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, un certain contrema\u00eetre avec lequel il aurait travaill\u00e9 s\u2019il avait conduit le camion \u00e0 plate\u2011forme. Le plaignant soutenait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait acc\u00e9der \u00e0 cet historique et le faire imprimer tout simplement en entrant le nom de l\u2019employ\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me informatique de l\u2019entreprise. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que le nom du ou des employ\u00e9s serait caviard\u00e9 afin qu\u2019ils ne puissent \u00eatre identifi\u00e9s que par leur poste et le fait qu\u2019ils ont conduit le camion \u00e0 plate\u2011forme et il a fait valoir que cela ne causerait pas de difficult\u00e9s ni de pr\u00e9judices \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et n\u2019entra\u00eenerait pas un manquement au respect de la vie priv\u00e9e du ou des employ\u00e9s en question.\n[51] Le plaignant ne savait pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait produire ce type d\u2019historique avant de recevoir son propre historique de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu directement \u00e0 cette proposition du plaignant et s\u2019en est remise \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nAnalyse\n[53] Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu directement \u00e0 la suggestion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant dans son courriel du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2015 \u00e0 3 h 07 au sujet d\u2019une autre possibilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de divulgation, j\u2019estime ne pas d\u00e9tenir suffisamment de renseignements pour \u00e9tablir si la suggestion du plaignant serait r\u00e9alisable. En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle, je ne peux pas l\u2019ordonner.\n[54] \u00c0 l\u2019annexe C de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant dit demander, entre autres, une indemnisation pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires dont il n\u2019a pas pu profiter, selon ses all\u00e9gations. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour 2011, il all\u00e8gue que le montant en question est [traduction] \u00ab apparemment tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00bb. Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que [le fait que le montant \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9] [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] serait attest\u00e9 par les dossiers des personnes qui ont conduit le camion \u00e0 plate\u2011forme ou d\u2019autres op\u00e9rateurs du groupe 1 \u00bb.\n[55] Selon les renseignements qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis, les FQEVF contiennent les renseignements suivants sur chaque membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e : le nom (qui demeurera confidentiel), l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, le poste travaill\u00e9, le nombre d\u2019heures normales travaill\u00e9es et le nombre d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es. Ainsi, les FQEVF sont potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 une forme de redressement recherch\u00e9e par le plaignant et, si elles sont disponibles, en tout ou en partie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue de les divulguer.\n[56] Partant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit divulguer toutes les feuilles de temps quotidiennes des \u00e9quipes d\u2019entretien de la voie ferr\u00e9e (FQEVF) pour les cinq ann\u00e9es de la p\u00e9riode de 2011 \u00e0 2015, pour le district 1 de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Est (peu importe le nom pass\u00e9 ou actuel de cette r\u00e9gion) et la division de Toronto. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne dispose pas de toutes ces FQEVF, elle devra divulguer celles qui sont en sa possession.\n[57] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la LCDP, je suis convaincue que, vu la nature personnelle des renseignements figurant dans les FQEVF et le fait que l\u2019instruction est publique, il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique; ainsi, les renseignements que renferment les FQEVF, y compris le nom des employ\u00e9s y figurant, demeureront confidentiels, comme il sera pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 davantage ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\nVIII. Paragraphe 5 de la requ\u00eate\n[58] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 des photographies de toutes les machines du groupe 1 et du groupe sp\u00e9cial (environ de 15 \u00e0 20 machines) portant le nom appropri\u00e9, pour faciliter la t\u00e2che du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas disposer de telles photographies. \u00c0 son avis, lui exiger de fournir les photographies s\u2019apparenterait \u00e0 lui demander de fournir un produit de travail. Qui plus est, le plaignant est en mesure de d\u00e9terminer les machines qui sont pertinentes aux fins de sa plainte et devrait donc fournir lui\u2011m\u00eame les photographies.\n[60] \u00c0 la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement fait savoir que son site intranet, RailCity, ne contenait pas les images recherch\u00e9es. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait reconnu que les photographies demand\u00e9es seraient utiles tant pour les deux parties que pour le Tribunal, elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le plaignant serait mieux plac\u00e9 pour photographier les machines puisqu\u2019il sait lesquelles sont pertinentes pour sa plainte.\n[61] Le plaignant a ensuite offert de prendre les photos sur le chantier de Toronto de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourvu que son superviseur ait d\u2019abord autoris\u00e9 sa venue sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette pr\u00e9cision visait \u00e0 \u00e9viter toute faute potentielle pour intrusion.\n[62] Les parties ont convenu que le plaignant devrait prendre autant de photos que possible des machines pertinentes aux endroits appropri\u00e9s et les produire subs\u00e9quemment.\n[63] Les parties ont convenu que c\u2019est le plaignant qui serait charg\u00e9 de prendre les photos. En outre, ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 de question au sujet des photographies lors de la CTGI du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2015 ni dans les communications transmises au Tribunal apr\u00e8s cette date. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne comprendra aucune ordonnance relative aux photographies.\nIX. Paragraphe 6 de la requ\u00eate\n[64] Le plaignant cherchait \u00e0 obtenir l\u2019adresse domiciliaire de Vasile (Romeo) Cazecu et une aide au chapitre de la signification de l\u2019assignation du Tribunal \u00e0 ses t\u00e9moins au cours des heures de travail ainsi que les coordonn\u00e9es des t\u00e9moins, dans une mesure raisonnable, y compris leurs adresses domiciliaires.\n[65] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que la divulgation de l\u2019adresse domiciliaire de ses employ\u00e9s contreviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.3 de l\u2019annexe 1 de la LPRPDE, mais qu\u2019elle pourrait fournir l\u2019adresse professionnelle de ses employ\u00e9s.\n[66] \u00c0 la CTGI du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2015, les parties ont fait part des renseignements suivants :\nla Commission avait signifi\u00e9 une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 M. Cazecu et \u00e0 tous les autres t\u00e9moins du plaignant, sauf un certain M. Ian Wilson;\nl\u2019avocat du plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Cazecu avait un billet ouvert pr\u00e9voyant son d\u00e9part du Canada le 27 d\u00e9cembre 2015 et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait cens\u00e9 revenir qu\u2019en janvier 2016, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, et que M. Wilson ne savait pas s\u2019il serait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir plus t\u00f4t que pr\u00e9vu;\nM. Cazecu est un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s important et essentiel pour le plaignant et une personne qui sera mentionn\u00e9e dans les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins;\nl\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait savoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019adapterait afin que M. Cazecu t\u00e9moigne lorsqu\u2019il le pourra au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[67] J\u2019ai alors mentionn\u00e9 que, sous r\u00e9serve de la disponibilit\u00e9 des avocats, je pourrais \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Peterborough les 21, 22 et 23 d\u00e9cembre 2015 pour l\u2019interrogatoire et le contre\u2011interrogatoire de M. Cazecu. Les parties ont indiqu\u00e9 que cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible en raison d\u2019un conflit d\u2019horaires.\n[68] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019avocat du plaignant r\u00e9dige un affidavit que M. Cazecu signerait avant son d\u00e9part, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, si elle le souhaite, de poser des questions \u00e0 ses propres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du contenu de l\u2019affidavit. Cela pourrait \u00e9liminer la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019appeler M. Cazecu \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, sous r\u00e9serve du droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de le contre\u2011interroger au sujet de son affidavit.\n[69] J\u2019ai accept\u00e9 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Ainslie, en vue de disposer d\u2019un d\u00e9lai pour consulter un avocat externe sur cette question et examiner le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9 de M. Cazecu avant de fournir une r\u00e9ponse avant la fin des heures de travail le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2015.\n[70] Dans son courriel du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2015 aux parties et au Tribunal, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait savoir ce qui suit :\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le recours \u00e0 un t\u00e9moignage de vive voix pour tous les t\u00e9moins;\nsi M. Cazecu revient \u00e0 temps pour t\u00e9moigner pendant la premi\u00e8re ou la deuxi\u00e8me semaine de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e acceptera de scinder l\u2019affaire sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019entente selon laquelle le Tribunal permettra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de rappeler des t\u00e9moins dans le but pr\u00e9cis de r\u00e9pondre aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Cazecu;\nsi M. Cazecu ne peut pas t\u00e9moigner pendant l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e accepte que le Tribunal scinde et prolonge l\u2019audience, pourvu que le Tribunal permette \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de rappeler des t\u00e9moins dans le but pr\u00e9cis de r\u00e9pondre aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Cazecu;\nsi l\u2019audience doit \u00eatre prolong\u00e9e, les conclusions finales des parties ne doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de tous les t\u00e9moignages oraux.\n[71] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2015, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que le plaignant acceptait la proposition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2015. M. Wilson s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir le Tribunal et l\u2019intim\u00e9e au courant de la date de retour de M. Cazecu et de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que chaque t\u00e9moin du plaignant et bon nombre de t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e traiteront des qualifications de M. Cazecu et des postes que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a permis d\u2019occuper. Outre ces t\u00e9moignages et la preuve documentaire connexe, les parties pourraient \u00e9tablir une entente \u00e9crite concernant certains faits. Ainsi, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019avocat du plaignant, on pourrait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9liminer la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019appeler M. Cazecu \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ou de prolonger l\u2019audience. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a \u00e9galement dit qu\u2019il consulterait M. Cazecu pour savoir s\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine de l\u2019audience.\nAnalyse\n[72] La forme d\u2019aide demand\u00e9e dans cette cat\u00e9gorie est maintenant sans objet.\n[73] Le Tribunal prend connaissance des observations des parties \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus au chapitre de leur entente portant que M.

Introduction [1] Madame Siddoo a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9sente une all\u00e9gation de discrimination en milieu de travail. La plaignante a r\u00e9cemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux requ\u00eates au Tribunal visant chacune \u00e0 adjoindre une partie distincte \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502 (l\u2019ILWU). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, Mme Siddoo cherche \u00e0 adjoindre comme intim\u00e9es la British Columbia Maritime Employers\u2019 Association (la BCMEA) et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 TSI Terminal Systems Inc. (qui est maintenant appel\u00e9e Global Container Terminals, ci\u2011apr\u00e8s la GCT). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les deux requ\u00eates sont pratiquement identiques, sauf les noms des autres intim\u00e9es, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision s\u2019appliquera aux deux requ\u00eates.\n[2] Au moment o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte contre l\u2019ILWU, Mme Siddoo a \u00e9galement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes contre la BCMEA et la GCT aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission). La Commission a estim\u00e9 que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la BCMEA et la GCT ne justifiaient pas une instruction par le Tribunal. Mme Siddoo a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Elle a plus tard tent\u00e9 d\u2019interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui a aussi rejet\u00e9 sa demande.\n[3] La question dont le Tribunal est saisi est de savoir s\u2019il convient maintenant d\u2019adjoindre la BCMEA et la GCT \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9es. Je ne suis pas convaincu, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, qu\u2019il conviendrait d\u2019adjoindre la BCMEA et la GCT \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, les deux requ\u00eates sont rejet\u00e9es.\nII. Faits [4] Les faits suivants sont les plus pertinents aux requ\u00eates de la plaignante qui sont actuellement examin\u00e9es.\n[5] Mme Siddoo a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes suivantes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission :\na) Le 30 ao\u00fbt 2011, une plainte contre la GCT pour diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et pour omission de fournir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, en violation des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi);\nb) Le 7 novembre 2011, une plainte contre la BCMEA pour diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et pour omission de fournir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, en violation des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi;\nc) Le 7 novembre 2011, une plainte contre l\u2019ILWU pour diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et pour omission de fournir un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement, en violation des articles 9 et 14 de la Loi.\n[6] La Commission a men\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates pour les trois plaintes afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir si une instruction par le Tribunal \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e en application de l\u2019article 44 de la Loi.\n[7] Le 2 juillet 2013, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal pour instruction la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ILWU. Le m\u00eame jour, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la BCMEA et la GCT apr\u00e8s avoir men\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates relativement aux deux plaintes. La Commission a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pouvant justifier une instruction par le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es.\n[8] Le 7 ao\u00fbt 2013, Mme Siddoo a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission ayant rejet\u00e9 les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la BCMEA et la GCT, lesquelles plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard regroup\u00e9es en un seul dossier judiciaire.\n[9] Le 4 juin 2014, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 les demandes de Mme Siddoo, confirmant ainsi les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission (ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 4 juin 2014, dossier no T\u20111341\u201113).\n[10] Mme Siddoo a tent\u00e9 d\u2019interjeter appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais elle n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pour signifier et d\u00e9poser un avis d\u2019appel. Sa demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e (ordonnance dat\u00e9e du 30 septembre 2014, dossier no 14\u2011A\u201158).\n[11] Le 24 octobre 2014, lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire mettant en cause l\u2019ILWU, Mme Siddoo a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 pour elle d\u2019adjoindre d\u2019autres parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance.\n[12] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2014, Mme Siddoo a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal et la Commission qu\u2019elle chercherait \u00e0 adjoindre la BCMEA et la GCT \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9es.\n[13] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a avis\u00e9 Mme Siddoo au moyen d\u2019une lettre que, si elle avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019adjoindre un intim\u00e9, elle devait d\u00e9poser cette requ\u00eate au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2014 afin que l\u2019audience sur le fond dans l\u2019affaire mettant en cause l\u2019ILWU, qui devait se tenir du 23 au 27 f\u00e9vrier 2015, se poursuive sans retard.\n[14] Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2014, Mme Siddoo a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 adjoindre la BCMEA \u00e0 titre de partie et une autre requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 adjoindre la GCT \u00e0 titre de partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance intent\u00e9e contre l\u2019ILWU dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi.\nIII. Analyse [15] Le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir s\u2019il convient d\u2019adjoindre la BCMEA et\/ou la GCT \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019IWLU dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi.\n[16] La Commission soutient que la demande de la plaignante d\u2019adjoindre \u00e0 l\u2019instance les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de parties est sans fondement. La Commission soutient aussi que les requ\u00eates ne devraient pas \u00eatre accueillies sur le fondement de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[17] Les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir la BCMEA et la GCT, font valoir les arguments suivants dans une r\u00e9ponse conjointe aux requ\u00eates : le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjoindre les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es; les exigences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es; le fait d\u2019adjoindre les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure, et la plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable pour adjoindre un intim\u00e9. L\u2019ILWU n\u2019a formul\u00e9 aucune observation.\n[18] Pour rendre ma d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 toutes les observations formul\u00e9es par la Commission et par la BCMEA et la GCT. Toutefois, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur chacune d\u2019elles dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[19] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la question de comp\u00e9tence a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, je dois d\u2019abord me pencher sur cet argument.\nA. Comp\u00e9tence [20] Les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es soutiennent que le Tribunal ne peut examiner une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre un intim\u00e9 que si elle lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission. Les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es citent le paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur th\u00e8se selon laquelle le Tribunal ne peut instruire une plainte que si celle-ci lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission. Elles invoquent le paragraphe 10 de la d\u00e9cision Zhou c. le Conseil national de recherches Canada, 2009 TCDP 7, pour justifier l\u2019argument selon lequel on ne peut pas demander au Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte en l\u2019absence d\u2019un renvoi par la Commission.\n[21] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument selon lequel le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjoindre un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une plainte qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction. La pr\u00e9sente instruction est fond\u00e9e sur un renvoi effectu\u00e9 par la Commission. Les faits de l\u2019affaire Zhou sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux de l\u2019affaire dont le tribunal est saisi. Dans l\u2019affaire Zhou, un intim\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir l\u2019instruction de deux plaintes distinctes formul\u00e9es contre un autre intim\u00e9. Dans ces circonstances, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre la tentative de demander une nouvelle instruction de cette mani\u00e8re.\n[22] Plus important encore, en ce qui concerne la question de comp\u00e9tence, est le libell\u00e9 de la disposition de la loi habilitante du Tribunal. En vertu du paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment les r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant \u00ab l\u2019adjonction de parties ou d\u2019intervenants \u00e0 l\u2019affaire \u00bb. Le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles) indique aux parties la mani\u00e8re dont il faut demander l\u2019adjonction d\u2019une nouvelle partie.\n[23] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi est sans \u00e9quivoque quant \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de conf\u00e9rer la comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal.\nB. Pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e [24] Les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es ont soutenu que la doctrine de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre applicable aux pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission de refuser l\u2019adjonction de la BCMEA et de la GCT \u00e0 la plainte a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[25] En d\u00e9pit des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, la question dont le Tribunal est saisi est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente. Alors que le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de refuser le renvoi pour instruction des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es, la question dont le Tribunal est saisi est diff\u00e9rente. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 trancher la question de savoir s\u2019il convient ou non d\u2019adjoindre \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es.\n[26] Pour le motif expos\u00e9 ci-dessus, j\u2019estime que la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher de d\u00e9poser les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates.\nC. Crit\u00e8re juridique applicable pour l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un intim\u00e9 \/ Bien fond\u00e9 des demandes [27] Le crit\u00e8re applicable pour adjoindre un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, Section locale 5044 du SCFP c.

Brown, 2008 CF 734, au paragraphe 39).\n[29] Bien que le Tribunal n\u2019effectue pas d\u2019examen approfondi des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es au moment o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, il doit n\u00e9anmoins y avoir un certain nombre de pr\u00e9cisions fournies dans la requ\u00eate pour que le Tribunal puisse conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence de toute possibilit\u00e9 de lien valide avec une plainte pr\u00e9existante de telle sorte que l\u2019intim\u00e9 propos\u00e9 puisse \u00e0 bon droit \u00eatre adjoint \u00e0 la plainte.\n[30] \u00c0 tout le moins, cela comprendrait les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s li\u00e9s \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire pr\u00e9cis fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Il devrait y avoir suffisamment de pr\u00e9cisions pour que l\u2019on puisse bien comprendre les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es, la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ont eu lieu et le lien entre ces faits et l\u2019intim\u00e9 propos\u00e9. Malheureusement, les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Mme Siddoo ne comprennent pas un tel degr\u00e9 minimum de pr\u00e9cisions.\n[31] Dans ses requ\u00eates, Mme Siddoo formule les all\u00e9gations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales selon lesquelles l\u2019ILWU, la BCMEA et la GCT se sont ligu\u00e9es contre elle pour qu\u2019elle soit retir\u00e9e de deux s\u00e9ances de formation diff\u00e9rentes, pour lui refuser des mesures d\u2019accommodement et pour \u00e9viter de traiter efficacement avec la Work Safe British Columbia (WSBC) pour son compte. Concernant les all\u00e9gations communes formul\u00e9es dans ses requ\u00eates, Mme Siddoo fournit certaines pr\u00e9cisions relativement aux s\u00e9ances de formation, mais il n\u2019existe pas de lien clair avec les intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es et un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Elle a \u00e9galement formul\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement par le pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 TSI Systems Inc. (maintenant GCT), mais elle n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9tabli de lien avec un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n[32] La d\u00e9cision TELUS cit\u00e9e ci\u2011dessus est un exemple de circonstances semblables o\u00f9 le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 adjoindre un intim\u00e9 parce, entre autres, on n\u2019avait pas produit suffisamment de documents concernant la discrimination pour justifier que la partie propos\u00e9e soit incluse.\nIV. Conclusion [33] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates sont rejet\u00e9es. La plaignante n\u2019a pas suffisamment expliqu\u00e9 dans ses requ\u00eates pourquoi l\u2019adjonction de la BCMEA et de la GCT \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte. Malgr\u00e9 une lecture attentive des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui des requ\u00eates de la plaignante, je conclus qu\u2019aucun acte discriminatoire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des deux intim\u00e9es propos\u00e9es. Aucun lien avec un motif de distinction illicite n\u2019a non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid Thomas\nPr\u00e9sident du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 4 f\u00e9vrier 2015",

La question pr\u00e9liminaire\n[1] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demande au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions plus compl\u00e8tes et de divulguer des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant les objets pr\u00e9cis expos\u00e9s dans le dossier de requ\u00eate, au motif que la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9taye pas ses deux moyens de d\u00e9fense, soit la contrainte excessive et l\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Avant la requ\u00eate, les parties avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019entendre sur un certain nombre de demandes du plaignant.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate, par laquelle elle demandait \u00e0 ce que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert propos\u00e9 de M. David Jacobs ne soit pas re\u00e7u en preuve par le Tribunal, parce que l\u2019objet de son t\u00e9moignage rel\u00e8ve des connaissances et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du Tribunal.\n[3] Les parties demandent aussi un r\u00e8glement quant \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de la d\u00e9livrance par le Tribunal d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 M. Andrew Ross, de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Calian Ltd.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a aussi demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de donner son consentement \u00e0 ce que son t\u00e9moin, le Dr Boddam, donne son t\u00e9moignage au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, le 13 avril 2015, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas disponible lors des autres jours d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vus.\n[5] Le plaignant est psychiatre; il a re\u00e7u sa formation aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique. En 2007, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme sp\u00e9cialiste par l\u2019Ordre des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens de l\u2019Ontario (l\u2019OMCO). Cette reconnaissance est accept\u00e9e dans les autres provinces du Canada aux termes d\u2019accords de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9.\n[6] En 2008, le plaignant, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un recrutement effectu\u00e9 par Calian Ltd. pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste de psychiatre au sein des Forces canadiennes (les FC). L\u2019une des exigences du poste au sein des FC \u00e9tait l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation comme sp\u00e9cialiste en psychiatrie par le Coll\u00e8ge royal des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens du Canada (le CRMCC), et ce, malgr\u00e9 sa reconnaissance de sp\u00e9cialiste par l\u2019OMCO. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi ses examens du CRMCC; il n\u2019a donc pas obtenu son accr\u00e9ditation et, par cons\u00e9quent, son emploi au sein des FC.\n[7] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que cette politique d\u2019embauche emp\u00eache les sp\u00e9cialistes pleinement qualifi\u00e9s qui ne sont pas d\u2019origine canadienne d\u2019\u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour un poste et qu\u2019elle l\u2019assujettit \u00e0 une exclusion discriminatoire pour des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, de sorte que cette discrimination a un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que les FC, en adoptant la norme du CRMCC, s\u2019assurent que ses psychiatres r\u00e9pondent aux normes reconnues \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale en ce qui a trait aux comp\u00e9tences en psychiatrie et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). Elle affirme que cette exigence n\u2019est pas discriminatoire.\n[9] Avant que la requ\u00eate ne soit instruite, les parties ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 conclure une entente au sujet d\u2019un certain nombre des demandes du plaignant, pour la divulgation de documents et des pr\u00e9cisions, qui \u00e9taient expos\u00e9es dans son dossier de requ\u00eate, mais elles n\u2019ont pu s\u2019entendre au sujet des autres questions.\n[10] Je souscris \u00e0 la th\u00e8se selon laquelle, avant que je rende toute d\u00e9cision, il est fondamental que toutes les parties aient eu la pleine et enti\u00e8re possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendues et que l\u2019ensemble des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, des questions d\u2019ordre juridiques, des documents pertinents et un aper\u00e7u des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus soient divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audience. Bien que les r\u00e8gles du Tribunal soient plus flexibles que les r\u00e8gles strictes des tribunaux judiciaires, elles visent tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle.\n[11] Selon la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 8, \u00e0 laquelle je souscris, il est n\u00e9cessaire que les parties respectives donnent des pr\u00e9cisions, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 bien circonscrire les questions en litige et \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les surprises lors de l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire, et ce, en vue de permettre aux parties de se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience et de faciliter cette derni\u00e8re. Les parties, lors de leur d\u00e9marche en vue de se conformer au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles), devraient en faire plus plut\u00f4t que ne pas en faire assez. Les parties ont l\u2019obligation de se conformer au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s et pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 tirer ses conclusions de fait.\n[12] Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas r\u00e9gi par r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure civile et ne peut donc tirer profit des interrogatoires pr\u00e9alables. Le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la LCDP habilite le pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant les enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9alables, mais de telles r\u00e8gles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci. Cela motive d\u2019autant plus les parties respectives \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle elles devront se d\u00e9fendre. Cela n\u00e9cessite une divulgation des plus g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses des pr\u00e9cisions. C\u2019est le Tribunal qui tranchera quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle les pr\u00e9cisions r\u00e9clam\u00e9es ne sont pas importantes, ou que le document ou les documents r\u00e9clam\u00e9s sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour des motifs non fond\u00e9s.\n[13] Je ne crois pas qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 8, entre en conflit avec la d\u00e9cision Tiwari c. Air Canada et al., 2011 TCDP 16, surtout au vu du fait que les questions en litige dans la d\u00e9cision Tiwari \u00e9taient grandement diff\u00e9rentes. Je ne crois pas que ces deux d\u00e9cisions soient mutuellement incompatibles, ou qu\u2019elles justifient une att\u00e9nuation de l\u2019obligation de divulgation qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[14] Bien que je convienne avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que la divulgation de pr\u00e9cisions ne donne pas \u00e0 la partie adverse le droit qu\u2019on lui [traduction] \u00ab communique toute la preuve et tous les arguments sur lesquels l\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u2019intention de se fonder \u00bb, les pr\u00e9cisions doivent cependant permettre aux parties de conna\u00eetre la cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle elles doivent se d\u00e9fendre et, par cons\u00e9quent, la preuve qu\u2019elles doivent pr\u00e9senter ou sur laquelle elles doivent se fonder au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e cite la d\u00e9cision Bailie et al. c. L\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2011 TCDP 17, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa th\u00e8se selon laquelle elle a fourni suffisamment de pr\u00e9cisions pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles et satisfaire l\u2019objet de cet article, soit \u00ab [\u2026] permettre \u00e0 chacune des parties de pr\u00e9senter avec efficacit\u00e9 ses dossiers respectifs [\u2026] \u00bb. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019argument \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 12 de la d\u00e9cision Bailie selon lequel une demande visant \u00e0 ce que des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires soient fournies ne devrait pas \u00eatre, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, une contestation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des faits m\u00eames. Toutefois, avec \u00e9gards, je ne crois pas que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait r\u00e9pondu aux obligations expos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles, lequel doit, selon moi, \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re souple et lib\u00e9rale, conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 1(1) et (2) des R\u00e8gles.\n[16] Le plaignant demande, aux rubriques C et E de ses observations, qu\u2019on lui fournisse [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] des descriptions d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019autres renseignements\/documents concernant les exigences professionnelles \u00e0 la fois d\u2019un psychiatre civil et non civil des Forces canadiennes, y compris les psychiatres qui avaient, directement ou indirectement, un lien d\u2019emploi avec les FC en date d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2008; notamment, les psychiatres de Calian, de la FP ou de la Croix Bleue \u00bb. Je crois que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui fournisse d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions plus compl\u00e8tes quant \u00e0 ces deux questions se rapportant au recours, par les FC, \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cialistes, civils ou non, et j\u2019ordonne qu\u2019il en soit ainsi.\n[17] Le plaignant demande qu\u2019on lui fournisse aussi des pr\u00e9cisions sur l\u2019historique des FC en ce qui concerne le refus des demandes au motif de la reconnaissance de l\u2019OMC, sans toutefois r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de reconnaissance du CRMCC, par date et par sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9, ainsi que toute mesure d\u2019adaptation ou d\u2019exception prise pour les sp\u00e9cialistes civils des FC n\u2019ayant pas l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du CRMCC, et ce, avant et apr\u00e8s le rejet de la candidature du Dr Keith \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des postes pour lesquels il avait postul\u00e9. Tout renseignement qui se rapporte \u00e0 (i) la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne pas accepter la reconnaissance de l\u2019OMC pour les postes de sp\u00e9cialistes au sein des FC, ou \u00e0 (ii) la prise, par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, des mesures d\u2019adaptation ou d\u2019exception \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des sp\u00e9cialistes civils des FC, est pertinent. La divulgation de tout document en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui contient des renseignements \u00e0 ce sujet, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils se rapportent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode allant de la premi\u00e8re demande de candidature du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du poste jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur la LCDP, est appropri\u00e9e; j\u2019ordonne qu\u2019il en soit ainsi.\n[18] Le plaignant demande qu\u2019on lui fournisse les documents se rapportant \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation \u00e0 titre de sp\u00e9cialiste du CRMCC et de l\u2019OMCO au moment de la demande du Dr Keith. Je crois que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 de tels documents sont en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, leur production est n\u00e9cessaire pour le motif invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon laquelle la politique du CRMCC \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e ainsi qu\u2019une question fondamentale dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant quant \u00e0 la discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable; j\u2019ordonne qu\u2019il en soit ainsi.\n[19] Dans sa requ\u00eate, le plaignant demande aussi qu\u2019on lui fournisse les expos\u00e9s d\u00e9taill\u00e9s relatifs aux t\u00e9moins, plut\u00f4t que des expos\u00e9s qui consistaient en un court paragraphe sur les sujets qui seront abord\u00e9s par chacun des t\u00e9moins et, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande subs\u00e9quente, en une liste \u00e0 puce contenant cinq \u00e9l\u00e9ments, qui r\u00e9sumaient les cat\u00e9gories de t\u00e9moignage. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a, selon ses dires, fourni une description g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des points principaux que chaque t\u00e9moin abordera lors de son t\u00e9moignage, ce qui suffit pour permettre au plaignant de pr\u00e9parer sa cause, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les points principaux soient d\u00e9taill\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re exhaustive. Ceux-ci suffisent pour permettre au plaignant de pr\u00e9parer son contre\u2011interrogatoire et son argumentation principale.\n[20] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles exige que l\u2019expos\u00e9 relatif aux t\u00e9moins soit \u00ab un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux \u00bb. Je ne crois pas que les listes \u00e0 puces r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. Je crois que la d\u00e9cision C.D. c. Wal-Mart Canada Corp., 2010 HRTO 426, au paragraphe 7, d\u00e9crit bien ce en quoi doit consister un expos\u00e9 relatif aux t\u00e9moins : [traduction] \u00ab les expos\u00e9s relatifs aux t\u00e9moins doivent [\u2026] \u00eatre d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et \u00e9noncer le t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9cis que le t\u00e9moin donnera, plut\u00f4t que simplement les sujets g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00bb. Je ne crois pas que cela exige qu\u2019un expos\u00e9 complet et mot \u00e0 mot du t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 soit produit, mais le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles doit \u00eatre suffisant pour que la partie adverse puisse anticiper le t\u00e9moignage qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, et lui permettre de faire une pr\u00e9paration ad\u00e9quate de son contre\u2011interrogatoire et de sa cause en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (voir Bailie, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal ORDONNE \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire des expos\u00e9s relatifs aux t\u00e9moins plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, et ce, au plus tard 10 jours avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience.\n[21] Cette requ\u00eate, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, vise \u00e0 retirer \u00e0 David Jacobs la qualit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moin expert relativement au dossier du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la preuve d\u2019expert devrait uniquement \u00eatre admise si la question en cause n\u00e9cessite une expertise sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre les accises factuelles, en vue de lui permettre de tirer une conclusion appropri\u00e9e.\n[22] Selon le plaignant, le rapport de M. Jacobs (le rapport) est n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du Coll\u00e8ge royal est une EPJ pour le poste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature; de plus, le rapport porte sur un objet technique, qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de l\u2019expertise ou des connaissances du Tribunal.\n[23] Selon les documents contenus dans la requ\u00eate du plaignant, le rapport fournit des renseignements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9glementation des activit\u00e9s des m\u00e9decins par l\u2019OMCO, son r\u00f4le, ses pouvoirs, et son devoir envers le public. Il traite de la question de la reconnaissance des sp\u00e9cialistes par l\u2019OMCO et de la mani\u00e8re dont cette reconnaissance est li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019accr\u00e9ditation par le CRMCC.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend, \u00e0 la page 2 de son dossier de requ\u00eate, que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion [traduction] \u00ab consiste principalement en un expos\u00e9 du cadre l\u00e9gal et r\u00e9glementaire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation de la m\u00e9decine \u00bb et que le rapport est [traduction] \u00ab analogue \u00e0 une preuve d\u2019expert sur des questions de droit interne \u00bb, ce qui [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019est pas \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du TCDP \u00bb.\n[25] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, accorde au Tribunal davantage de latitude quant \u00e0 l\u2019admission d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que celle accord\u00e9e aux tribunaux judiciaires. N\u00e9anmoins, les deux parties ont renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe R. c. Mohan [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9, lequel \u00e9nonce, au paragraphe 17, que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert varie selon l\u2019application des facteurs suivants : a) la pertinence; b) la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019aider le juge des faits; c) l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion; d) la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert. L\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat ant\u00e9rieur R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24, \u00e0 titre d\u2019illustration du crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9.\n[26] Je crois que le Tribunal devrait suivre l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation retenue par le juge Dickson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Abbey, selon lequel le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre au juge des faits d\u2019appr\u00e9cier l\u2019objet du litige en raison de sa nature technique. Pour que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert soit admissible, le litige doit \u00eatre tel \u00ab qu\u2019il est peu probable que des personnes ordinaires puissent former un jugement juste \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sans l\u2019assistance de personnes poss\u00e9dant des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales \u00bb (voir Beven on Negligence (4e \u00e9d. 1928), cit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan et dans la d\u00e9cision Rosin c. Canadian Armed Forces, 1989 CanLII 149 (TCDP), conf. par [1991] 1 C.F. 391 (C.A.)). \u00ab [L]a \u201csimple utilit\u00e9\u201d est un seuil trop bas pour justifier l\u2019acceptation des dangers inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019admission de la preuve d\u2019expert \u00bb(voir R. c. D.D. 2000 CSC 43, au paragraphe 47, renvoyant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohanet \u00e0 la d\u00e9cisionMorin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 TCDP 46, au paragraphe 8).\n[27] Le plaignant a laiss\u00e9 entendre que le domaine d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de connaissance du Tribunal \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il visait sp\u00e9cifiquement l\u2019examen de la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu de la discrimination et l\u2019octroi du redressement appropri\u00e9. Il cite la d\u00e9cision Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2006 TCDP 40, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette affirmation. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le plaignant, le rapport du Dr Jacobs ne rel\u00e8ve pas de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et des connaissances techniques du Tribunal.\n[28] Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que le membre instructeur \u00ab tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie \u00bb. Je crois que le meilleur \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la conclusion du Tribunal en ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de recevoir en preuve le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert quant au droit se trouve dans la d\u00e9cision Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest (Ministre du Personnel), [2001] D.C.D.P. no 26, aux paragraphes 16 et 17. Le Tribunal a pour mandat de trancher des questions de fait et de droit, et il ne devrait pas d\u00e9l\u00e9guer cette responsabilit\u00e9 aux t\u00e9moins experts : \u00ab les questions de droit ressortissent \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence des avocats et du tribunal [...] elles devraient \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la pr\u00e9sentation des arguments plut\u00f4t que dans le cadre de la preuve d\u2019expert ou d\u2019opinion \u00bb.\n[29] Je souscris \u00e0 la qualification du rapport par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon laquelle celui\u2011ci consiste principalement en une r\u00e9citation des cadres l\u00e9gaux et r\u00e9glementaires. Je crois que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait. Le rapport du Dr Jacobs rel\u00e8ve de la connaissance et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du Tribunal, et les questions de droit qui y sont abord\u00e9es ne devraient pas \u00eatre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin expert, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[30] Pour les motifs ci\u2011dessus, j\u2019ordonne que le rapport du Dr Jacobs ne soit pas admis en preuve.\n[31] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9, avant l\u2019instruction des requ\u00eates, que le Tribunal d\u00e9livre une assignation, en vertu du paragraphe 50(3) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00e0 Andrew Ross de Calian Ltd., pour qu\u2019il produise des documents qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, des renseignements se rapportant \u00e0 la question de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour le poste en cause. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, seul Calian Ltd. d\u00e9tient ce renseignement.\n[32] Le plaignant \u00e9tait en faveur de la d\u00e9livrance de l\u2019assignation \u00e0 M. Andrew Ross, mais il voulait que les modalit\u00e9s de celui\u2011ci soient plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n[33] Sur consentement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et du plaignant, le Tribunal d\u00e9livrera une assignation contraignant M. Andrew Ross de Calian Ltd. \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, et on lui enjoindra de produire tous les documents pertinents en la possession de Calian Ltd., y compris, sans toutefois s\u2019y limiter, l\u2019\u00e9chelle salariale pour les postes \u00e0 Petawawa et \u00e0 Cold Lake pour lesquels le Dr Keith a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature, de la date \u00e0 laquelle il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour la premi\u00e8re fois jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, y compris les modalit\u00e9s de tous les avantages accord\u00e9s ainsi que tous les documents se rapportant aux t\u00e2ches r\u00e9ellement accomplies par les psychiatres de Calian \u00e0 Cold Lake et \u00e0 Petawawa au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, ces documents devant \u00eatre fournis \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans la semaine suivant laquelle M. Ross aura re\u00e7ue signification \u00e0 personne de l\u2019assignation, ou il sera contraint de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 une audience qui se tiendra au moment d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le Tribunal, et, en outre, de compara\u00eetre et de t\u00e9moigner au moment et \u00e0 l\u2019endroit pouvant \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[34] Comme les parties l\u2019ont demand\u00e9, le Tribunal accepte, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e que M. Ross n\u2019a pas fait une production compl\u00e8te de tous les documents pertinents faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019assignation susmentionn\u00e9e dans le d\u00e9lai imparti, d\u2019inscrire au r\u00f4le une audience par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, \u00e0 la date et \u00e0 l\u2019heure qu\u2019il d\u00e9terminera, et ce, \u00e0 la seule fin d\u2019exiger la pr\u00e9sence de M. Ross aux bureaux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; on lui ordonnera alors de produire tous les documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[35] Sur consentement des parties, le Tribunal ordonne que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournisse sans d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019avocat du plaignant tous les documents que M. Ross lui aura produits, d\u00e8s leur r\u00e9ception, et qu\u2019il fournisse de plus tous les documents pertinents n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits provenant de l\u2019OMCO et du CRMCC qu\u2019il en sa possession, et ce, d\u00e8s que possible.\n[36] Sur consentement des parties, il est convenu que le Dr Boddam ne t\u00e9moignera pas avant que le plaignant ait termin\u00e9 de livrer sa preuve.\n[37] Le Dr Boddam pr\u00e9sentera son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 une date suivant la semaine pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019audience, laquelle sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le Tribunal, apr\u00e8s consultation des avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et du plaignant.\nII.

Plainte\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision concernant une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 25 juillet 2013 par Michael Moffat, le plaignant, contre Davey Cartage Co. (1973) Ltd. (\u00ab Davey Cartage \u00bb), l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que ce dernier a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience physique. M. Moffat soutient que l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut subi une d\u00e9ficience temporaire et qu\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de s\u2019acquitter de son travail de \u00ab r\u00e9partiteur\/agent de vente interne \u00bb pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 par suite d\u2019un accident de la route survenu en dehors des heures de travail. L\u2019accident s\u2019est produit le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2013 ou aux environs de cette date. M. Moffat a alors subi une commotion c\u00e9r\u00e9brale qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler pendant pr\u00e8s de deux mois. Lorsqu\u2019il est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 8 avril 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le jour m\u00eame.\n[2] Le 29 avril 2014, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab tribunal \u00bb), en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), d\u2019instruire la plainte que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[3] M. Moffat a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, aid\u00e9 parfois de son amie, Mme Lynne Dunstan. Il a fourni par \u00e9crit la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, un document utile, et rendu un t\u00e9moignage clair et convaincant. Le pr\u00e9sident du d\u00e9fenseur, M. Michael (Mick) Thomas, et le directeur des op\u00e9rations, M. Keith Freeman, ont comparu au nom de Davey Cartage et ont aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage utile et d\u00e9taill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat, Me Joe Coutts, du cabinet Coutts Pulver LLP. La Commission n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nII. D\u00e9cision\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que la plainte n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e, et elle est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nIII. Faits\n[5] Davey Cartage est une entreprise de camionnage situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Surrey, en Colombie\u2011Britannique. Elle a prosp\u00e9r\u00e9 au fil des ans, mais poss\u00e8de et op\u00e8re actuellement 11 v\u00e9hicules tracteurs et environ 100 remorques. Elle se sp\u00e9cialise dans le transport lourd \u00e0 l\u2019aide de camions \u00e0 plate-forme. Selon M. Thomas, 90 % du travail de l\u2019entreprise est li\u00e9 \u00e0 la construction; elle se sp\u00e9cialise dans le d\u00e9placement de gros \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme des ponts \u00e0 poutre, de l\u2019acier de construction et des grues. Bien qu\u2019elle r\u00e9alise 85 \u00e0 90 % de son chiffre d\u2019affaires en Colombie-Britannique, elle exerce aussi ses activit\u00e9s en Alberta, \u00e0 Washington et en Oregon. Ses chauffeurs sont syndiqu\u00e9s. Au moment de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 employait 15 personnes, dont MM. Thomas et Freeman. L\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, l\u2019entreprise comptait 25 employ\u00e9s.\n[6] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019embauche de M. Moffat, Davey Cartage ne transportait pas de conteneurs \u00e0 destination et en provenance des diff\u00e9rents ports du Grand Vancouver. Auparavant, M. Moffat \u00e9tait r\u00e9partiteur dans une entreprise de camionnage qui transportait seulement des conteneurs. M. Thomas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Davey Cartage souhaitait embaucher M. Moffat parce que l\u2019entreprise voulait \u00e9tendre ses activit\u00e9s au transport de conteneurs et il croyait que le plaignant pourrait l\u2019aider \u00e0 atteindre son objectif. M. Moffat a admis avoir discut\u00e9 de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 attirer une nouvelle client\u00e8le, mais sans promettre qu\u2019il pourrait y parvenir.\n[7] N\u00e9anmoins, le contrat de travail entre M. Moffat et Davey Cartage mentionnait qu\u2019il occuperait le poste de \u00ab r\u00e9partiteur\/agent de vente interne \u00bb, la derni\u00e8re partie du titre indiquant que l\u2019entreprise s\u2019attendait dans une certaine mesure \u00e0 ce que le plaignant attire une nouvelle client\u00e8le. M. Moffat a admis son inexp\u00e9rience en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9partition de v\u00e9hicules de transport lourd, l\u2019activit\u00e9 principale de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les t\u00e9moins de ce dernier ont \u00e9galement reconnu les faits, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019ils croyaient que M. Moffat acquerrait les connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en exer\u00e7ant le m\u00e9tier.\n[8] Une clause du contrat de travail pr\u00e9cisait les conditions permettant \u00e0 Davey Cartage de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat. Selon la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019emploi, l\u2019entreprise devrait soit lui donner un pr\u00e9avis de licenciement, soit lui verser une indemnit\u00e9 en tenant lieu. Selon la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9, de tels montants correspondaient au minimum requis aux termes de l\u2019Employment Standards Act de la Colombie-Britannique, R.S.B.C. 1996, ch. 113, ou l\u2019exc\u00e9daient. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des copies de contrats de travail d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une clause type des contrats de travail.\n[9] M. Moffat est entr\u00e9 au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 1er mai 2012. Le 26 juillet 2012 ou aux environs de cette date, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a remis au plaignant la lettre de confirmation d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9e pour le financement de sa maison. Cette lettre, en plus de fournir les renseignements sur son emploi et son salaire, mentionnait notamment que M. Moffat \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab un employ\u00e9 comp\u00e9tent et digne de confiance \u00bb.\n[10] Le 1er ao\u00fbt 2012, apr\u00e8s avoir compl\u00e9t\u00e9 avec satisfaction une p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai de trois mois, M. Moffat a obtenu une augmentation de 400 $ par mois. M. Thomas a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019accorder une augmentation de salaire \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui demeurait \u00e0 son service apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode d\u2019essai initiale de trois mois.\n[11] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2013, M. Moffat a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans un tr\u00e8s grave accident de la route. Il se trouvait dans son propre v\u00e9hicule et l\u2019accident n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail. Plusieurs personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9es, dont M. Moffat. Il a notamment subi une commotion c\u00e9r\u00e9brale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de travailler pendant pr\u00e8s de deux mois.\n[12] Les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont droit \u00e0 une assurance-invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e de la Great West, compagnie d\u2019assurance-vie (la \u00ab Great West \u00bb). Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2013 et a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pendant sa convalescence et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler. Les prestations lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es r\u00e9troactivement \u00e0 la date de l\u2019accident.\n[13] M. Freeman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de devenir directeur des op\u00e9rations, il avait acquis une vaste exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9partiteur. Lorsque M. Moffat a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de travailler, M. Freeman s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches de r\u00e9partiteur en f\u00e9vrier 2013 et a continu\u00e9 de le faire pendant plusieurs mois. C\u2019est alors que M. Freeman a d\u00e9couvert des probl\u00e8mes op\u00e9rationnels attribuables, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e0 M. Moffat.\n[14] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, apr\u00e8s avoir assum\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches de r\u00e9partiteur, M. Freeman a d\u00e9couvert qu\u2019il manquait essentiellement cinq remorques parce qu\u2019aucun document ne faisait \u00e9tat de leur localisation. Selon lui, M. Moffat n\u2019avait pas bien assur\u00e9 le suivi des remorques et personne n\u2019en aurait jamais rien su s\u2019il ne l\u2019avait pas remplac\u00e9. Il a d\u00fb se rendre sur diff\u00e9rents chantiers des clients de l\u2019entreprise pour tenter de localiser les cinq remorques manquantes. Lorsqu\u2019il les a eu trouv\u00e9es, il a constat\u00e9 que l\u2019entreprise en avait perdu la trace pendant trois mois et, par cons\u00e9quent, Davey Cartage a d\u00fb facturer \u00e0 son client des droits de stationnement de trois mois. Bien que ces droits aient finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 recouvr\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du client, l\u2019incident a terni les relations entre Davey Cartage et son client.\n[15] D\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la perte d\u2019un client important de Davey Cartage et au fait que le travail de M. Moffat aurait pu y contribuer. Le client avait exprim\u00e9 un certain m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du service avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de M. Moffat dans l\u2019entreprise. Cependant, de l\u2019avis de M. Thomas, au lieu de calmer les appr\u00e9hensions du client, M. Moffat a exacerb\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes. Le client a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 sa relation d\u2019affaires avec Davey Cartage peu de temps avant l\u2019accident de M. Moffat. Celui-ci devait rencontrer son homologue chez le client pour tenter d\u2019arranger les choses, mais l\u2019accident est survenu quelques jours avant la date de la rencontre, qui n\u2019a jamais eu lieu. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que la perte de ce client a entra\u00een\u00e9 une importante perte de revenus mensuels pour Davey Cartage.\n[16] Les deux parties ont aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail sur l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de Davey Cartage d\u2019\u00e9largir ses activit\u00e9s au domaine du transport de conteneurs apr\u00e8s l\u2019embauche de M. Moffat. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, des efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits apr\u00e8s l\u2019embauche de M. Moffat, comme l\u2019immatriculation de v\u00e9hicules et la d\u00e9livrance de permis au personnel pour le transport de conteneurs dans les ports, mais aucun syst\u00e8me essentiel de r\u00e9servation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il appartenait \u00e0 M. Moffat d\u2019\u00e9tablir le syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9servation, mais la question semblait litigieuse. M. Moffat a avanc\u00e9 d\u2019autres raisons pour justifier cette incapacit\u00e9. Quelle qu\u2019en soit la cause, il \u00e9tait clair que Davey Cartage \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019exercer des activit\u00e9s de transport de conteneurs dans les ports avant le d\u00e9part de M. Moffat. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal se prononce sur la question. Il lui suffit de constater qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation l\u00e9gitime de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[17] M. Thomas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les \u00e9tats financiers mensuels internes \u00e9taient produits environ 7 \u00e0 10 jours apr\u00e8s la fin du mois. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, lorsque M. Freeman et lui ont examin\u00e9 les \u00e9tats financiers de f\u00e9vrier 2013, soit au cours de la premi\u00e8re ou de la deuxi\u00e8me semaine de mars 2013, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de licencier M. Moffat. Les revenus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 diminuaient, le salaire de M. Moffat \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 et l\u2019entreprise avait de s\u00e9rieuses r\u00e9serves quant au rendement de ce dernier. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Thomas, ce qui l\u2019a vraiment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 licencier M. Moffat a \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9couverte de la disparition des remorques. Cependant, la direction de Davey Cartage a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas communiquer sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 M. Moffat avant qu\u2019il soit en mesure de reprendre le travail.\n[18] L\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e9tait suivi par la Dre R. Demian, qui informait p\u00e9riodiquement la compagnie d\u2019assurance, la Great West. Elle tenait \u00e9galement M. Moffat au courant de son pronostic et du moment o\u00f9 il pourrait retourner au travail.\n[19] Le 7 mars 2013, M. Moffat a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Freeman, lui disant : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Keith, j\u2019ai vu la docteure aujourd\u2019hui et elle dit que je pourrais retourner au travail le lundi 18 mars, si je continue \u00e0 faire des progr\u00e8s. Je te tiens au courant. Mike. \u00bb\n[20] M. Freeman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Moffat au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception du courriel du 7 mars 2013. Il a dit lui avoir parl\u00e9 de sa sant\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et lui avoir conseill\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner de nouveau lorsqu\u2019il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre le travail.\n[21] Le 14 mars 2013, M. Moffat a envoy\u00e9 un autre courriel \u00e0 M. Freeman, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Keith, d\u00e9sol\u00e9, la docteure a dit encore 2 \u00e0 3 semaines de plus. Je te tiens au courant. Mike. \u00bb\n[22] M. Freeman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Moffat apr\u00e8s le courriel du 14 mars 2013 et lui avoir dit de prendre tout le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour se remettre, puisque la Great West avait alors accept\u00e9 la demande de M. Moffat et lui versait des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 court terme. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, il a dit \u00e0 M. Moffat de ne pas revenir au travail tant qu\u2019il ne serait pas enti\u00e8rement remis et en mesure d\u2019assumer l\u2019ensemble de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[23] La Dre Demian a remis un rapport \u00e0 jour \u00e0 la Great West le 4 avril 2013. Le point saillant du rapport est sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question 5, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Si le patient est en mesure de retourner au travail dans un proche avenir, est-ce que des mesures d\u2019adaptation sont n\u00e9cessaires en raison de restrictions ou de limitations? \u00bb La r\u00e9ponse manuscrite de la Dre Demian est la suivante : \u00ab Le 8 avril 2013 \u2013 retour progressif au travail \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 sur un mois. \u00bb\n[24] La Dre Demian n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Cependant, je crois comprendre qu\u2019elle indiquait que M. Moffat \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail le 8 avril 2013, mais qu\u2019il devait s\u2019agir d\u2019un retour progressif \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 sur un mois. Dans les observations qu\u2019elles ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les parties n\u2019ont pas propos\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite \u00e0 la question 5 du rapport.\n[25] Le 4 avril 2013, M. Moffat a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Freeman, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Bonjour Keith, je serai de retour le 8, lundi, pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler, je t\u2019appelle demain (vendredi) pour les d\u00e9tails. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que tout va bien. Mike. \u00bb\n[26] M. Freeman a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Moffat au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception du troisi\u00e8me courriel, le vendredi 5 avril 2013. Il s\u2019est rappel\u00e9 que M. Moffat \u00e9tait enthousiaste \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de retourner au travail et qu\u2019il lui avait r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 le faire lorsqu\u2019il lui avait pos\u00e9 la question. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Freeman, au cours de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, M. Moffat n\u2019a aucunement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 assumer toutes ses t\u00e2ches. M. Moffat a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas mentionn\u00e9 la recommandation relative \u00e0 son retour progressif lors de sa conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec M. Freeman.\n[27] \u00c0 son retour au travail le lundi 8 avril 2013, M. Moffat s\u2019est fait remettre une lettre de cong\u00e9diement et un ch\u00e8que. La lettre indiquait que son emploi prenait fin conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause de licenciement pr\u00e9vu au contrat de travail. Le montant du ch\u00e8que comprenait :\na) 2 semaines de salaire tenant lieu de pr\u00e9avis comme l\u2019exige le contrat de travail;\nb) 2 jours de salaires pour le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2013 et le 8 avril 2013;\nc) 3 jours de salaire pour 3 jours de vacances inutilis\u00e9s;\nd) un paiement \u00e0 titre gracieux repr\u00e9sentant 5 jours de salaire mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre de cong\u00e9diement, soit un [traduction] \u00ab paiement pour favoriser votre transition vers un nouvel emploi \u00bb.\n[28] M. Thomas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le versement des 5 jours de salaire ne d\u00e9coulait d\u2019aucune obligation, mais visait \u00e0 faciliter la transition de M. Moffat et \u00e0 \u00e9viter toute \u00ab animosit\u00e9 \u00bb entre les parties.\n[29] La question de savoir si, le 8 avril 2013, le plaignant \u00e9tait au courant de la recommandation de la Dre Demian relativement au retour progressif au travail \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 sur un mois ne fait pas consensus. Le rapport de la Dre Demian \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la Great West. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, M. Moffat avait le rapport en sa possession lors de son retour au travail le 8 avril 2013. Cependant, durant le contre-interrogatoire, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de se rappeler comment il avait obtenu ce rapport sign\u00e9 seulement quatre jours plus t\u00f4t. Il a aussi reconnu ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 le rapport, ni en avoir remis une copie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 son retour au travail le 8 avril 2013. Il a \u00e9galement admis n\u2019avoir jamais mentionn\u00e9 que des restrictions s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 son retour au travail.\n[30] M. Thomas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de l\u2019existence du rapport du 4 avril 2013 de la Dre Demian pour la premi\u00e8re fois en ao\u00fbt 2014, puisqu\u2019il accompagnait l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[31] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a avanc\u00e9 dans ses observations que M. Moffat ne se rappelait peut-\u00eatre pas les faits avec exactitude et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait peut-\u00eatre pas le rapport de la docteure en sa possession seulement quatre jours apr\u00e8s sa r\u00e9daction. J\u2019ai certains doutes quant \u00e0 savoir si M. Moffat avait le rapport de la Dre Demian lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le 8 avril 2013. Il ne pouvait pas expliquer comment le rapport s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 en sa possession si rapidement apr\u00e8s sa r\u00e9daction, ni pour quelles raisons il n\u2019avait jamais parl\u00e9 de son contenu avec son employeur. N\u00e9anmoins, je ne suis pas convaincu de l\u2019importance de la question. Compte tenu de la preuve qui m\u2019\u00e9tait soumise, je conclus qu\u2019\u00e0 la date du licenciement, l\u2019employeur ne connaissant pas l\u2019existence de restrictions \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de M. Moffat de reprendre son travail et, en fait, M. Moffat a laiss\u00e9 croire \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019absence de telles restrictions.\nIV. Droit applicable\n[32] Le plaignant cite l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne comme acte discriminatoire auquel l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait eu recours en raison de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Moffat. L\u2019article est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[33] Aux termes de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, la d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite.\nV. Jurisprudence\n[34] La preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire est \u00ab celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, p. 558). Lorsqu\u2019un plaignant a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il est, de prime abord, victime de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l\u2019absence de justification de la part de l\u2019employeur (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, p. 208; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, par. 18).\n[35] Afin de pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, le plaignant doit prouver que :\n(i) l\u2019intim\u00e9 refuse d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\n(ii) qu\u2019il existe un lien entre, d\u2019une part, le refus d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer cet individu et, d\u2019autre part, un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi (voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, par. 52).\n[36] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient l\u2019unique raison de l\u2019acte reproch\u00e9 pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019acte ou de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur (Ibid.; Holden c. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.)).\n[37] La plainte initiale d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission faisait \u00e9tat de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, mais M. Moffat n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ni all\u00e9gation ni de preuve laissant croire \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) (d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi). Par cons\u00e9quent, seules les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi sont examin\u00e9es.\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9 peut pr\u00e9senter soit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9futant l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie, soit une d\u00e9fense justifiant la discrimination, ou les deux (Bombardier, supra, par. 64). Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9fute l\u2019all\u00e9gation, il doit fournir une explication raisonnable, qui ne peut constituer un pr\u00e9texte pour dissimuler l\u2019acte discriminatoire (Khiamal c. Canada, 2009 CF 495, par. 58).\n[39] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver une all\u00e9gation de discrimination par preuve directe. Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, \u00ab [l]a discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement \u00bb. Il faut plut\u00f4t examiner l\u2019ensemble des circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe ce qu\u2019on a appel\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Basi, de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb (Khiamal, supra, par. 59). Cela dit, \u00ab m\u00eame circonstancielle, une preuve de discrimination doit n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9senter un rapport tangible avec la d\u00e9cision ou la conduite contest\u00e9e \u00bb (Bombardier, supra, par. 88).\nVI. Questions\n[40] Il s\u2019agit de trancher les deux questions suivantes :\nDans quelle mesure la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant permet\u2011elle d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi?\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il r\u00e9fut\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie en fournissant une explication raisonnable pour son acte, qui ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9texte?\nVII. Analyse\nA. Question 1 \u2013 Dans quelle mesure la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant permet-elle d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\n[41] Je conclus que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Moffat \u00e9taye jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point la preuve prima facie. Sans tenir compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la preuve semble \u00e9tayer les all\u00e9gations du plaignant : en effet, M. Moffat \u00e9tait incapable de travailler en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au moment o\u00f9 son employeur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le licencier. Quand la lettre de cong\u00e9diement a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 M. Moffat, la Dre Demian avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 recommand\u00e9 un retour progressif au travail \u00e9chelonn\u00e9 sur un mois. Cependant, je dois \u00e9galement me demander si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie.\nB. Question 2 \u2013 Le demandeur a-t-il r\u00e9fut\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie?\n[42] Il s\u2019agit ici de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni une explication raisonnable, ne constituant pas un pr\u00e9texte, pour sa conduite. Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat, est-ce que sa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par la d\u00e9ficience de son employ\u00e9? \u00c0 mon avis, ce n\u2019est pas le cas. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a non seulement donn\u00e9 des raisons vraisemblables au cong\u00e9diement, qui ne pr\u00e9sentent pas les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un pr\u00e9texte visant \u00e0 justifier la conduite discriminatoire, mais, de plus, l\u2019ensemble de la preuve a \u00e9tabli que la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement influenc\u00e9e par la d\u00e9ficience de celui-ci.\n[43] Les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont admis en toute franchise qu\u2019ils avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat quelques semaines avant son retour au travail. Ils ont donn\u00e9 plusieurs raisons pr\u00e9cises, non li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de M. Moffat, pour justifier leur d\u00e9cision.\n[44] Tout au long de l\u2019audience, M. Moffat a d\u00e9fendu son rendement au travail et a mal pris les reproches qui lui \u00e9taient faits. Lors du contre-interrogatoire, il a mis en doute les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de finance et de gestion de MM. Thomas et Freeman. Essentiellement, il tentait de d\u00e9montrer les lacunes des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019affaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[45] S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuves qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9es directement ou indirectement par un motif de distinction, il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer apr\u00e8s coup les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019affaires d\u2019une entreprise, qu\u2019il est sans doute facile de critiquer avec le recul. Il appartient au Tribunal d\u2019examiner tous les facteurs ayant men\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision reproch\u00e9e. Ce faisant, le Tribunal se demandera si l\u2019explication fournie \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnable dans les circonstances, mais seulement dans la mesure n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer si cette explication ne constituait pas simplement un pr\u00e9texte (voir Morin c. Canada, 2005 TCDP 41, par. 219; Durrer c. CIBC, 2007 TCDP 6, par. 63, conf. pour d\u2019autres motifs par 2008 CAF 384).\n[46] Dans la d\u00e9fense de sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve indiquant que ses revenus bruts avaient chut\u00e9 au cours des premiers mois de 2013. Les \u00e9tats financiers ont servi \u00e0 montrer les cons\u00e9quences de la perte d\u2019un client important, que Davey Cartage attribue en partie \u00e0 M. Moffat, et \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019il devenait trop co\u00fbteux de continuer de l\u2019employer. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves d\u00e9montrant que M. Moffat \u00e9tait le r\u00e9partiteur le mieux r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019entreprise n\u2019avait jamais eu.\n[47] Lorsque le Tribunal examine les motifs du cong\u00e9diement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 et les circonstances qui l\u2019entourent, il lui appartient de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe ce qu\u2019on appelle dans la d\u00e9cision Basi de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne conclus pas \u00e0 de telles odeurs. Qu\u2019avec le recul les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019affaires soient bonnes ou mauvaises, je suis convaincu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pris la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat sans tenir aucun compte de la d\u00e9ficience qu\u2019il l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler pendant les deux mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait qu\u2019il croyait que le plaignant \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement remis et apte \u00e0 assumer l\u2019ensemble de ses t\u00e2ches. Les probl\u00e8mes de rendement d\u00e9couverts et examin\u00e9s en son absence n\u2019avaient aucun lien avec sa d\u00e9ficience. Je conclus donc que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier M. Moffat n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[48] Il est certes possible de comprendre le choc que M. Moffat a d\u00fb ressentir lorsqu\u2019il est finalement retourn\u00e9 au travail apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident pour apprendre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Cependant, vu toutes les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 ne peut \u00e9tayer une conclusion de discrimination.\n[49] Dans ses observations finales, M. Moffat a avanc\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019employeur de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 au moment de son retour au travail. Il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que son employeur aurait d\u00fb demander un rapport m\u00e9dical au m\u00e9decin ou \u00e0 la Great West. Je suis convaincu, au vu de la preuve, que Davey Cartage a fait de telles d\u00e9marches directement aupr\u00e8s de M. Moffat et que celui-ci n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune indication selon laquelle des restrictions s\u2019appliquaient en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et compte tenu du fait que M. Moffat a donn\u00e9 l\u2019assurance qu\u2019il \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement remis et apte \u00e0 assumer l\u2019ensemble de ses t\u00e2ches, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il n\u2019incombait pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019entreprendre par la suite des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de tiers.\n[50] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli que l\u2019employeur n\u2019a aucune autre obligation de s\u2019informer lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019a en toute bonne foi aucune connaissance de la d\u00e9ficience :\n[42] Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant, de son propre aveu, a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment induit en erreur les directeurs dont il relevait en les amenant \u00e0 croire sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un alcoolique. S\u2019il est du devoir d\u2019un employeur de s\u2019informer au sujet d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience d\u2019un employ\u00e9 et de la fa\u00e7on dont il peut composer avec cet employ\u00e9, il ne semble que logique et \u00e9quitable de ne pas \u00e9tendre cette obligation aux situations o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur n\u2019a en toute bonne foi aucune connaissance de la d\u00e9ficience de l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n(Benoit c. Bell Canada (Qu\u00e9bec, 2004 TCDP 32, conf. par 2005 CF 926)\n[51] Certes, l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne peut pr\u00e9tendre ne pas avoir eu connaissance de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Moffat. Davey Cartage savait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bless\u00e9; cependant, l\u2019entreprise a cru que la d\u00e9ficience de M. Moffat \u00e9tait temporaire et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus de cons\u00e9quences sur son travail. Soit M. Moffat ne connaissait pas la recommandation de son propre m\u00e9decin relativement \u00e0 son retour au travail au moment de son cong\u00e9diement, soit il a simplement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas en informer son employeur. De toute fa\u00e7on, je suis convaincu, au vu de la preuve, que M. Moffat a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre le travail sans restriction et que Davey Cartage n\u2019a pris connaissance de la recommandation de retour progressif au travail que plus d\u2019un an plus tard, lorsque le rapport de la Dre Demian a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 au cours du processus de communication de la preuve en vue de l\u2019audience.\nVIII. Conclusion\n[52] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, il faut examiner toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb. Selon la preuve, il est clair que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant pour des raisons qui n\u2019avaient absolument rien \u00e0 voir avec sa d\u00e9ficience. Bien qu\u2019une partie de la preuve semble indiquer qu\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination dans la mesure o\u00f9 le cong\u00e9diement s\u2019est produit peu de temps apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident de la route de M. Moffat, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 r\u00e9futer l\u2019all\u00e9gation en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il a pris sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte de cette d\u00e9ficience.\n[53] Je suis convaincu au vu de la preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulait attendre que le plaignant soit compl\u00e8tement remis de ses blessures avant de le cong\u00e9dier. Les raisons de ce cong\u00e9diement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9es ad\u00e9quatement par Davey Cartage et n\u2019\u00e9taient absolument pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 mon avis, elles fournissent une explication raisonnable au cong\u00e9diement et ne constituent pas un pr\u00e9texte. Je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires ult\u00e9rieures.\n[54] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que le fardeau de la preuve dans un contexte des droits de la personne est le m\u00eame que dans un contexte de droit civil : le fardeau de prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s incombe \u00e0 celui ou celle qui r\u00e9clame l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation (D\u00e9veloppement social Canada c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2011 CAF 202, par. 16; Bombardier, supra, par. 65). Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne cherche pas \u00e0 s\u2019appuyer sur un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi, le fardeau de la preuve incombe au plaignant qui doit d\u00e9montrer que la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est fausse ou n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte (Wilson c. ASFC, 2015 TCDP 11, par. 22). Le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce du fardeau qui lui incombait.\n[55] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e, elle est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

La plainte et la requ\u00eate [1] Mme Tabor soutient que la Premi\u00e8re Nation Millbrook (Millbrook) a refus\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer sa candidature comme capitaine pour son exploitation de p\u00eache parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. Selon elle, cette d\u00e9cision s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre d\u2019une pratique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la part de la Premi\u00e8re Nation qui vise \u00e0 exclure les femmes de son exploitation de p\u00eache. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que son exclusion \u00e0 titre de capitaine de bateau est fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial parce que Millbrook a eu auparavant des d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s avec son \u00e9poux, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 celui-ci \u00e9tait capitaine. Elle all\u00e8gue que les agissements de Millbrook sont des actes discriminatoires au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] Mme Tabor soutient par ailleurs qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 contre elle des repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Entre autres all\u00e9gations, elle pr\u00e9tend que Millbrook a tard\u00e9 \u00e0 lui d\u00e9livrer un certificat de possession et a pris par la suite des mesures irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res contre sa famille et elle, relativement \u00e0 la maison de son d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re dans la r\u00e9serve.\n[3] Avant l\u2019instruction des plaintes de Mme Tabor, Millbrook a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate contestant la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces plaintes.\n[4] Millbrook soutient que l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP s\u2019applique dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n67. La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\nElle fait valoir que le paragraphe 61(1) et les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens prot\u00e8gent sa d\u00e9cision concernant l\u2019exploitation de p\u00eache contre la tenue d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la LCDP. Elle soutient en outre que le paragraphe 20(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de Mme Tabor au sujet des repr\u00e9sailles li\u00e9es au certificat de possession concernant la maison de son d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re.\n[5] De plus, Millbrook fait valoir dans sa requ\u00eate que le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens confirme l\u2019existence de droits issus de trait\u00e9s des Autochtones, comme la p\u00eache commerciale, et que, pour ce qui est de ces droits, le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirme l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Cela \u00e9tant, soutient Millbrook, les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la gestion de ses ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel, sont \u00e9galement exclues de l\u2019application de la LCDP.\n[6] Mme Tabor s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Millbrook. \u00c0 son avis, l\u2019article 67 est une exception restreinte \u00e0 l\u2019application de la LCDP et, de ce fait, pour qu\u2019il s\u2019applique, il est n\u00e9cessaire que la Loi sur les Indiens l\u2019autorise express\u00e9ment. Elle ajoute que rien dans la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019autorise de cette fa\u00e7on les agissements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ses plaintes.\n[7] M\u00eame si elle n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 au d\u00e9bat entourant le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes de Mme Tabor, la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations sur la requ\u00eate de Millbrook en vue de repr\u00e9senter l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans le cadre de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et de l\u2019application appropri\u00e9es de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP. La Commission convient avec Mme Tabor que l\u2019article 67 est une exception restreinte \u00e0 l\u2019application de la LCDP et que rien dans la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019autorise les agissements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ses plaintes. Par ailleurs, en ce qui concerne le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, la Commission est d\u2019avis que Millbrook n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que les agissements ou la d\u00e9cision en litige constituent un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s, et encore moins que l\u2019on a port\u00e9 atteinte de quelque mani\u00e8re \u00e0 un tel droit.\n[8] Avant l\u2019audition, j\u2019ai statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas assez d\u2019informations pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate. J\u2019ai jug\u00e9 que, pour pouvoir me prononcer comme il faut sur la requ\u00eate, il \u00e9tait important d\u2019entendre des preuves sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate ainsi que sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte dans son ensemble. J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que je rendrais une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la pr\u00e9sente affaire (voir Tabor c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook, 2014 TCDP 21).\n[9] Ayant maintenant entendu la preuve et les arguments relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Millbrook, je rejette la requ\u00eate pour les raisons qui suivent.\nII. L\u2019analyse A. L\u2019article 67 de la LCDP (i) L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation [10] \u00c0 titre d\u2019exception \u00e0 la LCDP, l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re restrictive (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la Bande de Gordon, 2000 CanLII 17153 (CAF), au paragraphe 22 (Laslo); Zurich Insurance Co. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 RCS 321 (QL), au paragraphe 18). Cet article ne met pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri toutes les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation qui peuvent avoir un rapport quelconque avec la Loi sur les Indiens (Bande indienne de Shubenacadie c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1998] 2 CF 198 (QL), au paragraphe 31). Il prot\u00e8ge plut\u00f4t contre un examen fond\u00e9 sur la LCDP les d\u00e9cisions qui rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un pouvoir express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens (voir la d\u00e9cision Laslo, au paragraphe 26).\n(ii) La nature des plaintes [11] Avant d\u2019examiner les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens que Millbrook a invoqu\u00e9es, je signale que la nature des all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte d\u00e9borde nettement le cadre de la d\u00e9cision de choisir un candidat autre que Mme Tabor \u00e0 titre de capitaine. Bien que Millbrook ait tent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience de limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision prise en 2008 de choisir un candidat autre que Mme Tabor pour un poste de capitaine, je ne vois aucune raison de le faire.\n[12] La plainte tout enti\u00e8re, y compris la d\u00e9cision prise en 2008 au sujet du poste de capitaine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission. Millbrook n\u2019a pas fait soumettre la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP, Mme Tabor fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat dans sa plainte d\u2019une pratique syst\u00e9mique qui consiste \u00e0 refuser aux femmes des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans l\u2019exploitation de p\u00eache de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook (voir le formulaire de plainte, aux paragraphes 9-12, 14-17 et 19\u201120). Aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contexte plus large de la plainte, uniquement la d\u00e9cision prise en 2008 au sujet du poste de capitaine.\n[13] De plus, Millbrook fait valoir que la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019a le Tribunal pour trancher la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor est \u00e9cart\u00e9e par une conclusion selon laquelle il n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence sur la plainte principale. De l\u2019avis de la Commission, que la plainte en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi de Mme Tabor soit prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ou non contre un examen par l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles ont un statut ind\u00e9pendant.\n[14] Aux termes de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, les repr\u00e9sailles constituent un acte discriminatoire ind\u00e9pendant, distinct de la plainte qui donne lieu aux pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles (voir Nkwazi c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 2001 CanLII 6296 (TCDP), au paragraphe 233; Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), 2001 CanLII 8492 (TCDP), au paragraphe 292; et Gainer c. Exportation et D\u00e9veloppement Canada, 2006 CF 814, au paragraphe 36).\n[15] Le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 14.1 indique explicitement que des repr\u00e9sailles sont un acte discriminatoire (\u00ab Constitue un acte discriminatoire [\u2026] \u00bb) et l\u2019article 4 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que les actes discriminatoires, \u00ab [\u2026] pr\u00e9vus aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 [\u2026] \u00bb, peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte (voir aussi le paragraphe 40(1) de la LCDP) et des ordonnances pr\u00e9vues (voir aussi le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP). Par ailleurs, l\u2019article 39 de la LCDP d\u00e9finit un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb comme suit : \u00ab [\u2026] s\u2019entend d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 \u00bb.\n[16] Rien dans la LCDP ne lie une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence ou \u00e0 la justification de la plainte donnant lieu aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. C\u2019est donc dire que m\u00eame si les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens que Millbrook invoque devaient avoir une incidence sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte principale, cela n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles.\n(iii) Le moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes [17] L\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 le 18 juin 2008 par l\u2019article premier de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.C. 2008, c. 30. Millbrook soutient qu\u2019au cours du d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019une exception \u00e9gale, sinon sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 celle que cr\u00e9ait l\u2019article 67 :\n3. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019article 1, les actes ou omissions du gouvernement d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation \u2013 y compris un conseil de bande, un conseil tribal ou une autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale qui offre ou administre des programmes ou des services sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens \u2013 qui sont accomplis dans l\u2019exercice des attributions pr\u00e9vues par cette loi ou sous son r\u00e9gime ne peuvent servir de fondement \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne s\u2019ils sont accomplis dans les trente-six mois suivant la date de sanction de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[18] De l\u2019avis de Millbrook, l\u2019article 3 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne exemptait potentiellement la totalit\u00e9 des actes ou des d\u00e9cisions d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation exploitant un programme ou un service quelconque sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens de toute responsabilit\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP.\n[19] Mme Tabor a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 21 mai 2008 et elle fait \u00e9tat d\u2019actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP qui sont survenus avant cette date. Comme ces faits ont eu lieu avant l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 le 18 juin 2008, l\u2019article 3 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en vigueur et ne s\u2019applique pas aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es au titre des articles 7 et 10 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ainsi qu\u2019il y est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, l\u2019article 3 s\u2019applique aux 36 mois suivant la date de sanction de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[20] Cela dit, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles li\u00e9es au certificat de possession concernant la maison du d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re de Mme Tabor se situent \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du d\u00e9lai de gr\u00e2ce de 36 mois. Toutefois, selon moi, l\u2019article 3 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne cr\u00e9e pas une exception d\u2019une port\u00e9e plus large que celle que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 67. M\u00eame s\u2019il est plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 que l\u2019article 67, l\u2019article 3 exige encore que les actes ou les omissions du gouvernement d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation soient accomplis \u00ab [\u2026] dans l\u2019exercice des attributions pr\u00e9vues par [la Loi sur les Indiens] ou sous son r\u00e9gime \u00bb. Cela demeure compatible avec la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure du Tribunal dans le cadre de laquelle l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 et appliqu\u00e9. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il faut toujours que l\u2019on exerce un pouvoir express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens pour \u00e9viter tout examen fond\u00e9 sur la LCDP.\n(iv) Le paragraphe 61(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens [21] Voyons maintenant les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens que Millbrook a invoqu\u00e9es. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, Millbrook soutient qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le paragraphe 61(1) et les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens dans le cadre de sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, selon moi, la d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche de Millbrook n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir que pr\u00e9voyaient ces dispositions.\n[22] Commen\u00e7ons par le paragraphe 61(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n61.(1) L\u2019argent des Indiens ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pens\u00e9 qu\u2019au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des Indiens ou des bandes \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit communs desquels il est re\u00e7u ou d\u00e9tenu, et, sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi et des clauses de tout trait\u00e9 ou cession, le gouverneur en conseil peut d\u00e9cider si les fins auxquelles l\u2019argent des Indiens est employ\u00e9, ou doit l\u2019\u00eatre, est \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit de la bande.\n[23] Je ne vois pas en quoi ce paragraphe est pertinent pour l\u2019embauche d\u2019un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache. Cette disposition porte sur les d\u00e9penses de fonds. Elle n\u2019autorise pas, express\u00e9ment ou implicitement, \u00e0 embaucher un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache ou \u00e0 embaucher une personne prenant part \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de p\u00eache de Millbrook en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Toute d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de dotation comporte le contr\u00f4le, la gestion ou la d\u00e9pense de fonds, mais ce fait \u00e0 lui seul ne met pas une telle d\u00e9cision hors de port\u00e9e de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Il en r\u00e9sulterait que n\u2019importe quelle d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de dotation d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation exc\u00e9derait la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, ce qui va nettement plus loin qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de l\u2019article 67 (voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2003 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 30 (Bressette)).\n[24] Dans l\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 61(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens qu\u2019elle invoque, Millbrook signale aussi que cette disposition est assujettie \u00e0 des droits issus de trait\u00e9s (\u00ab [\u2026] et, sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi et des clauses de tout trait\u00e9 ou cession [\u2026] \u00bb). Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, elle pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens confirme l\u2019existence de droits issus de trait\u00e9s des Autochtones, comme la p\u00eache commerciale, et que le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirme, pour ce qui est de ces droits, l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Elle fait donc valoir que la mention qui est faite des droits issus de trait\u00e9s au paragraphe 61(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens prot\u00e8ge aussi les d\u00e9cisions portant sur les d\u00e9penses en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche dans son exploitation de p\u00eache.\n[25] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019argument de Millbrook vise \u00e0 faire reconna\u00eetre l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit issu de trait\u00e9s relativement au paragraphe 61(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et, en cons\u00e9quence, que sa d\u00e9cision concernant Mme Tabor \u00e9tait l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi sur les Indiens pour les besoins de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP, je le rejette pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles qui sont donn\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s, au paragraphe 66 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, on n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli devant moi l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit issu de trait\u00e9s de g\u00e9rer les ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel.\n(v) Les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens [26] Les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens disposent :\n73. (1) Le gouverneur en conseil peut prendre des r\u00e8glements concernant :\na) la protection et la conservation des animaux \u00e0 fourrure, du poisson et du gibier de toute sorte dans les r\u00e9serves;\n[\u2026]\n81. (1) Le conseil d\u2019une bande peut prendre des r\u00e8glements administratifs, non incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9sente loi ou avec un r\u00e8glement pris par le gouverneur en conseil ou par le ministre, pour l\u2019une ou l\u2019ensemble des fins suivantes :\no) la conservation, la protection et la r\u00e9gie des animaux \u00e0 fourrure, du poisson et du gibier de toute sorte dans la r\u00e9serve;\n[27] Millbrook conc\u00e8de que la LCDP s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher un capitaine de bateau pour ce qui est de la conduite et de la navigation d\u2019un bateau, car la Loi sur les Indiens ne comporte aucun pouvoir concernant la navigation sur les cours d\u2019eau. Cependant, le capitaine ne s\u2019occupe pas seulement de man\u0153uvrer le bateau; il g\u00e8re les prises et est l\u2019agent de conservation sur l\u2019eau, exer\u00e7ant le pouvoir explicite et le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire correspondant que pr\u00e9voient les paragraphes 73(1) et 81(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Millbrook fait donc valoir que le Tribunal devrait prendre en consid\u00e9ration les fonctions du poste de capitaine en question et d\u00e9cider si ces fonctions d\u00e9coulent, en tout ou en partie, de pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[28] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, M. Allan Tobey, consultant en formation des p\u00eacheurs et conseiller technique en mati\u00e8re de formation et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 maritime aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019industrie canadienne de la p\u00eache, a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert en vue de t\u00e9moigner sur une liste de points pr\u00e9cis dont les parties avaient convenu et concernant le r\u00f4le que joue le capitaine d\u2019un homardier sur le plan, notamment, de la gestion et de la conservation des stocks. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il a parl\u00e9 de l\u2019utilisation de casiers \u00e0 homard d\u2019une taille appropri\u00e9e afin d\u2019\u00e9viter toute \u00ab p\u00eache fant\u00f4me \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de casiers dot\u00e9s de m\u00e9canismes de sortie d\u2019une taille et d\u2019une quantit\u00e9 minimales qui permettent aux homards de petite taille d\u2019en sortir et aux autres homards de se lib\u00e9rer si jamais ces casiers sont perdus en mer. Il a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, au d\u00e9but de la saison du homard, d\u2019\u00e9viter de p\u00eacher des femelles, surtout celles qui portent des \u0153ufs. Ces femelles, si elles sont captur\u00e9es, doivent \u00eatre remises en mer avec soin, pour \u00e9viter de les stresser ou de les tuer. M. Tobey a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un capitaine doit conna\u00eetre le quota de poisson ou de homard qu\u2019il peut p\u00eacher par permis, de m\u00eame que les tailles et les types d\u2019esp\u00e8ces de faune marine qu\u2019il est interdit de p\u00eacher \u2013 ce que l\u2019on appelle les prises accessoires \u2013 et qu\u2019il faut rejeter au moment de leur capture. Selon M. Tobey, le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans r\u00e9glemente ces exigences en mati\u00e8re de conservation.\n[29] Je souscris au t\u00e9moignage de M. Tobey sur le r\u00f4le que joue le capitaine d\u2019un bateau de p\u00eache en mati\u00e8re de conservation, mais je n\u2019admets pas que la conservation, ou les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens, \u00e9taient l\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant qui sous-tendait la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook d\u2019embaucher un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de Mme Tabor ou d\u2019une autre personne. Il est ressorti du t\u00e9moignage de M. et Mme Tabor, de M. Alex Cope et de M. Adrian Gloade que les capitaines de bateau de p\u00eache assument diverses responsabilit\u00e9s autres que celle de la conservation, dont le fait de piloter le bateau, de maintenir ce dernier et son \u00e9quipement de p\u00eache en bon \u00e9tat et de g\u00e9rer l\u2019\u00e9quipage. Pour ce qui est du choix d\u2019un candidat plut\u00f4t que d\u2019un autre pour le r\u00f4le de capitaine, la preuve ne m\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression que l\u2019une quelconque de ces exigences avait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur une autre, ou que la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook \u00e9tait principalement fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9servation, la protection et la gestion du poisson.\n[30] Dans la d\u00e9cision Bressette, le Tribunal a d\u00fb tirer une conclusion semblable au sujet de l\u2019\u00ab objet pr\u00e9dominant \u00bb de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation de pourvoir un poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial :\n[27] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9 comporte \u00e0 la fois un aspect dotation et un aspect financier. Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision du Conseil de bande avait surtout pour but de pourvoir le poste de travailleur\/travailleuse en service social familial. Le fait qu'il en ait d\u00e9coul\u00e9 un avantage financier minime n'alt\u00e8re pas cette conclusion.\n[31] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache comporte un aspect de conservation, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un aspect de navigation, d\u2019entretien et de gestion. L\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant de la d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche de Millbrook \u00e9tait de trouver un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache poss\u00e9dant toutes ces comp\u00e9tences. La conservation \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre bien l\u2019un des aspects qui entraient en ligne de compte dans la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook, mais il ne s\u2019agissait pas du seul aspect, pas plus que la preuve n\u2019indique qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019objet pr\u00e9dominant. En cons\u00e9quence, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, je ne vois pas en quoi les alin\u00e9as 73(1)a) et 81(1)o) de la Loi sur les Indiens auraient autoris\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook d\u2019embaucher un capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[32] C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019autorise express\u00e9ment ou implicitement les d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche que Millbrook a prises en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cette conclusion est semblable \u00e0 celles que le Tribunal a tir\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019autres affaires d\u2019embauche ou de dotation o\u00f9 l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 (voir, p. ex., Bressette; Deschambeault c. Cumberland House Cree Nation, 2008 TCDP 48; Bernard c. Conseil scolaire de Waycobah, 1999 CanLII 1914 (TCDP); et Desjarlais c. Piapot Band No. 75, [1989] 3 CF 605 (C.A.) (QL)).\n(vi) Le paragraphe 20(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens [33] Millbrook soutient de plus que le paragraphe 20(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du certificat de possession concernant la r\u00e9sidence de son d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re.\n[34] Le paragraphe 20(1) dispose :\n20.(1) Un Indien n\u2019est l\u00e9galement en possession d\u2019une terre dans une r\u00e9serve que si, avec l\u2019approbation du ministre, possession de la terre lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le conseil de la bande.\n[35] Selon Mme Tabor, son p\u00e8re, avant de mourir, avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Millbrook que Mme Tabor conserve sa maison en fiducie pour son petit-fils a\u00een\u00e9, le fils de Mme Tabor, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit majeur. Millbrook a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande et a conclu avec Mme Tabor une entente selon laquelle on lui d\u00e9livrerait un certificat de possession en vertu duquel elle d\u00e9tiendrait la maison en fiducie pour son fils. En attendant que ce dernier atteigne la majorit\u00e9, Mme Tabor devait louer la maison et d\u00e9poser l\u2019argent dans un fonds en fiducie au profit de son fils. Un aspect implicite de cette entente \u00e9tait que Mme Tabor ne louerait la maison qu\u2019\u00e0 des membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook qui paieraient un loyer; sans cela, elle ne recevrait aucun loyer \u00e0 d\u00e9poser en fiducie.\n[36] Millbrook a attendu environ deux ans avant de d\u00e9livrer un certificat de possession pour la maison. Dans l\u2019intervalle, Mme Tabor a toutefois permis \u00e0 quelques membres de Millbrook, qui touchaient des prestations d\u2019aide sociale, de vivre dans la maison. Ces occupants n\u2019avaient pas de loyer fixe et ne payaient que ce qu\u2019ils pouvaient. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de l\u2019aide sociale re\u00e7oivent une allocation de logement, Millbrook a exig\u00e9 que Mme Tabor rembourse une partie des prestations d\u2019aide sociale de ces locataires. De plus, avant de d\u00e9livrer le certificat de possession, Millbrook a exig\u00e9 que Mme Tabor entretienne le terrain de la maison.\n[37] Mme Tabor soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable de la location de la maison ou de l\u2019entretien des lieux avant que le certificat de possession soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9. En l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 rembourser des prestations d\u2019aide sociale et \u00e0 entretenir le terrain et, dans l\u2019intervalle, en retardant la d\u00e9livrance du certificat de possession, Millbrook, soutient Mme Tabor, a exerc\u00e9 contre elle des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[38] Le paragraphe 20(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens conf\u00e8re \u00e0 une Premi\u00e8re Nation des pouvoirs sur les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019attribution de logements (Laslo, au paragraphe 27). Cependant, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor au sujet de la maison de son d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re ne mettent pas en doute le pouvoir qu\u2019a Millbrook d\u2019accorder ou de refuser un logement. Nul ne semble contester que Mme Tabor avait obtenu \u2013 ou devait obtenir \u2013 la possession de la maison. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle s\u2019est servie de cette maison m\u00eame sans certificat de possession officiel. Millbrook n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le fait que Mme Tabor s\u2019\u00e9tait servie de la maison, sauf que, \u00e0 son avis, cela contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019entente convenue.\n[39] M\u00eame si l\u2019on pouvait dire que la d\u00e9livrance tardive du certificat de possession rel\u00e8ve du paragraphe 20(1), il ne s\u2019agit pas \u00e0 mon avis du fondement de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles que formule ici Mme Tabor. Ce sont plut\u00f4t les probl\u00e8mes de location et d\u2019entretien qui sont survenus avant la d\u00e9livrance du certificat qui pr\u00e9occupent Mme Tabor. Ces actes ne mettent pas en cause l\u2019attribution ou le refus d\u2019un logement aux termes du paragraphe 20(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le tribunal a donc comp\u00e9tence pour traiter de ces all\u00e9gations.\nB. Le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 [40] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, Millbrook soutient \u00e9galement dans sa requ\u00eate qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur la gestion de ses ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel, est un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s qui est constitutionnellement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 aux termes du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982. Elle all\u00e8gue que le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens confirme l\u2019existence de droits issus de trait\u00e9s des Autochtones, comme la p\u00eache commerciale, et que le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirme, pour ce qui est de ces droits, l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Par cons\u00e9quent, aux dires de Millbrook, les d\u00e9cisions concernant ces droits sont exclues de l\u2019application de la LCDP.\n[41] L\u2019article 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens indique [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] :\n18.(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, Sa Majest\u00e9 d\u00e9tient des r\u00e9serves \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit des bandes respectives pour lesquelles elles furent mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9; sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi et des stipulations de tout trait\u00e9 ou cession, le gouverneur en conseil peut d\u00e9cider si tout objet, pour lequel des terres dans une r\u00e9serve sont ou doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es, se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit de la bande.\n[42] Le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 dispose :\n35.(1) Les droits existants \u2013 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2013 des peuples autochtones du Canada sont reconnus et confirm\u00e9s.\n[43] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument selon lequel la gestion de ses ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel, d\u00e9coule d\u2019un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s qui est constitutionnellement prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Millbrook invoque la d\u00e9cision que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rendue dans l\u2019affaire R. c. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 665 (CSC) (Marshall 1). Ironiquement, cette d\u00e9cision concerne l\u2019oncle de Mme Tabor. Dans cette affaire, M. Marshall \u00e9tait inculp\u00e9 de trois infractions \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur la p\u00eache : la vente d\u2019anguilles sans permis, la p\u00eache sans permis et la p\u00eache en p\u00e9riode de fermeture au moyen de filets ill\u00e9gaux. M. Marshall faisait valoir qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait pour la p\u00eache et la vente de poisson des droits issus de trait\u00e9s qui l\u2019exemptaient d\u2019avoir \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation.\n[44] Les trait\u00e9s en litige dans cette affaire avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9s entre les Britanniques et les Mi\u2019kmaq \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une importante tourmente militaire et politique qui les opposait. En 1760-1761, \u00e9poque o\u00f9 les trait\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9s, il existait une motivation de r\u00e9conciliation entre les parties ainsi qu\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat mutuel \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une paix durable (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 1, aux paragraphes 3 et 17). Des trait\u00e9s furent conclus, par lesquels les Mi\u2019kmaq pouvaient amener les produits de leurs activit\u00e9s de chasse, de p\u00eache et de cueillette \u00e0 un poste de traite pour en faire le commerce.\n[45] La Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 que ces droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par trait\u00e9s aux Mi\u2019kmaq \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 1, aux paragraphes 7 et 48). En interpr\u00e9tant l\u2019arrangement dans le contexte commercial moderne, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui donnait un sens et une substance aux promesses faites par la Couronne, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les droits issus de trait\u00e9s pr\u00e9voyaient la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un moyen de subsistance convenable gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la chasse et \u00e0 la p\u00eache en faisant le commerce des produits de ces activit\u00e9s traditionnelles (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 1, aux paragraphes 52, 56 et 59). Selon la Cour supr\u00eame, une \u00ab subsistance convenable \u00bb s\u2019entend de choses essentielles telles que la nourriture, le v\u00eatement et le logement ainsi que quelques commodit\u00e9s de la vie, mais non de l\u2019accumulation de richesses incompatible avec une \u00e9conomie de subsistance (Marshall 1, aux paragraphes 59 et 60).\n[46] La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que M. Marshall avait droit \u00e0 l\u2019acquittement parce que \u00ab rien de moins ne saurait prot\u00e9ger l\u2019honneur et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la Couronne dans ses rapports avec les Mi\u2019kmaq [\u2026] \u00bb (Marshall 1, au paragraphe 4). Elle a conclu que l\u2019imposition d\u2019un r\u00e9gime discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9livrance de permis porterait atteinte au droit de M. Marshall de p\u00eacher \u00e0 des fins commerciales et que l\u2019interdiction de vendre le produit de sa p\u00eache porterait atteinte \u00e0 son droit de commercer \u00e0 des fins de subsistance. Comme ces droits ne pouvaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion absolue de la Couronne, on portait \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue atteinte aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par trait\u00e9s et la r\u00e9glementation \u00e9tait inop\u00e9rante \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sauf si elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir p\u00each\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode de fermeture, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu \u00e0 une autre atteinte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par trait\u00e9s parce qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir aucune limite \u00e0 l\u2019ampleur des activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache exerc\u00e9es en vertu d\u2019un trait\u00e9, ni aux m\u00e9thodes utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 cette fin ou aux p\u00e9riodes durant lesquelles on s\u2019y adonne, sauf si le trait\u00e9 comporte une restriction de cette nature (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 1, aux paragraphes 64 \u00e0 66).\n[47] Millbrook invoque \u00e9galement l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Simon, 1985 CanLII 11 (CSC) (Simon). Dans cette affaire, M. Simon, un Mi\u2019kmaq, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable, aux termes du paragraphe 150(1) du Lands and Forests Act de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, de possession d\u2019une carabine et de cartouches de fusil. M. Simon faisait valoir que, conform\u00e9ment aux clauses d\u2019un trait\u00e9 conclu en 1752, il avait le droit de chasser et que, de pair avec l\u2019article 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens, ce droit emp\u00eachait qu\u2019on le poursuive en vertu de la loi provinciale. Aux termes de l\u2019article 4 du trait\u00e9 de 1752, \u00ab la Tribu des Sauvages Mick Mack habitant les C\u00f4tes de l\u2019Est de la dite province \u00bb ont l\u2019\u00ab enti\u00e8re libert\u00e9 de chasser et de p\u00eacher comme de coutume \u00bb, et l\u2019article 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens indique que les lois provinciales d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sont applicables aux Indiens, sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions de quelque trait\u00e9 (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Simon, aux paragraphes 2 \u00e0 6).\n[48] La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le trait\u00e9 de 1752 \u00e9tait toujours en vigueur et qu\u2019il constituait une source positive de protection contre les violations des droits de chasse (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Simon, aux paragraphes 26 et 36). M. Simon tombait sous le coup de ce trait\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un Mi\u2019kmaq r\u00e9sidant dans la m\u00eame r\u00e9gion que la tribu originaire d\u2019Indiens Mi\u2019kmaq qui \u00e9tait partie au trait\u00e9 (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Simon, aux paragraphes 42 \u00e0 45). La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le fait que M. Simon poss\u00e8de une carabine et des munitions \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de chasse issu d\u2019un trait\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019article 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens avait pour effet de l\u2019exempter de l\u2019application d\u2019une loi provinciale restreignant ou violant les clauses du trait\u00e9 de 1752, et sa d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Simon, au paragraphe 62). Comme l\u2019article 88 de la Loi sur les Indiens englobait la situation de M. Simon, la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Simon, au paragraphe 66).\n[49] Je suis consciente de l\u2019importance de la protection des droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi que de la valeur de ces doits pour les peuples autochtones. Le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 confirme l\u2019importance et la protection de ces droits. Les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s sont des droits collectifs importants qui m\u00e9ritent qu\u2019on les interpr\u00e8te d\u2019une mani\u00e8re large et lib\u00e9rale. Toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre dissip\u00e9e en faveur du groupe autochtone qui revendique le droit. Cependant, dans la plupart des cas, il est n\u00e9cessaire de produire des arguments et des preuves, selon la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie, pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s. Il ne suffit pas de soutenir, en invoquant les arr\u00eats Marshall 1 ou Simon, qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la gestion des ressources halieutiques, ce qui inclut les choix de personnel, est un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s qui est constitutionnellement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[50] Tout d\u2019abord, il incombait \u00e0 Millbrook d\u2019\u00e9tablir concr\u00e8tement que les droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s qu\u2019elle revendique s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019existence d\u2019un droit issu de trait\u00e9s de g\u00e9rer les ressources halieutiques n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie devant moi. Les arguments invoqu\u00e9s et les preuves produites n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisants pour \u00e9tablir que le droit de g\u00e9rer les ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel, \u00e9tait envisag\u00e9 par les trait\u00e9s dont il \u00e9tait question dans les arr\u00eats Marshall 1 ou Simon, ou qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une \u00e9volution logique de l\u2019un de ces droits issus de trait\u00e9s. En fait, aucune condition de trait\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en preuve devant moi. Ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 666 (CSC) [Marshall 2], au paragraphe 20 [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] :\nL\u2019opinion majoritaire du 17 septembre 1999 n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit issu de trait\u00e9 permettant de \u00ab cueillir \u00bb toute chose qui peut physiquement l\u2019\u00eatre. Les questions en litige \u00e9taient beaucoup plus restreintes et la d\u00e9cision beaucoup plus limit\u00e9e. Dans le cours du pr\u00e9sent appel, il ne nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou argument tendant \u00e0 indiquer que le commerce des ressources foresti\u00e8res ou min\u00e9rales ou l\u2019exploitation des gisements de gaz naturel extrac\u00f4tiers \u00e9taient envisag\u00e9s par l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties au trait\u00e9 de 1760, ou par les deux; il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 que l\u2019exploitation de telles ressources pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une \u00e9volution logique des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le trait\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ressources halieutiques et fauniques ou des autres choses traditionnellement \u00abcueillies\u00bb par les Mi\u2019kmaq dans le cadre du mode de vie autochtone en 1760. Il est \u00e9videmment loisible aux communaut\u00e9s autochtones de revendiquer l\u2019existence de droits issus de trait\u00e9 plus larges \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais, dans un tel cas, le fondement d\u2019une telle revendication devra \u00eatre \u00e9tablie dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures o\u00f9 cette question est nettement soulev\u00e9e, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve de nature historique pertinente, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour ce qui est des ressources halieutiques et fauniques.\n[51] Millbrook d\u00e9clare aussi qu\u2019elle jouit d\u2019un droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale. Je suis consciente que cette autonomie est d\u2019une importance cruciale pour les peuples autochtones. En fait, l\u2019autod\u00e9termination est un aspect reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe et \u00e0 l\u2019article 4 de la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, R\u00e9s. GA 61\/295, Doc. off, 61e session, Suppl. no 49, vol. III, Doc. NU A\/61\/49 (2007) (D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies) (que le Canada a ent\u00e9rin\u00e9e le 12 novembre 2010). Cela dit, la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battue devant moi.\n[52] Par ailleurs, je note que les pratiques, les coutumes et les traditions qui constituent des droits autochtones sont celles qui marquent la continuit\u00e9 des pratiques, des coutumes et des traditions qui existaient avant le contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 RCS 507). Pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence du droit autochtone, il doit y avoir une preuve quelconque de l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique, d\u2019une tradition ou d\u2019une coutume datant d\u2019avant le contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens, et qu\u2019elle faisait partie int\u00e9grante de la culture distinctive des peuples autochtones avant leur contact avec les Europ\u00e9ens (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Bande indienne des Lax Kw'alaams c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 56, au paragraphe 46). En ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement un droit revendiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Pamajewon, [1996] 2 RCS 821, au paragraphe 27 :\nLes droits ancestraux, y compris toute revendication du droit \u00e0 l'autonomie gouvernementale, doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances propres \u00e0 chaque affaire et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'histoire et de la culture particuli\u00e8res du groupe autochtone qui revendique le droit.\n[53] Cela illustre qu\u2019un principe aussi important qu\u2019un droit \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale ne doit pas \u00eatre analys\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re sommaire, en se fondant uniquement sur une d\u00e9claration de son existence. Il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une analyse plus approfondie, assortie de preuves et d\u2019arguments \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Millbrook n\u2019a pas non plus fourni ce genre de preuves et d\u2019arguments.\n[54] Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame si Millbrook d\u00e9tient un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s pour la gestion de ses ressources halieutiques, y compris ses choix de personnel, cela ne met pas n\u00e9cessairement toutes les mesures li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de p\u00eache de Millbrook \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un r\u00e8glement pris en vertu de la loi, y compris la LCDP. Il faut tout d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 ce droit. Le crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 une violation du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Sparrow, [1990] 1 RCS 1075, \u00e0 la page 1112 (Sparrow) :\nPour d\u00e9terminer si les droits de p\u00eache ont subi une atteinte constituant une violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue du par. 35(1) , on doit poser certaines questions. Premi\u00e8rement, la restriction est\u2011elle d\u00e9raisonnable? Deuxi\u00e8mement, le r\u00e8glement est\u2011il ind\u00fbment rigoureux? Troisi\u00e8mement, le r\u00e8glement refuse\u2011t\u2011il aux titulaires du droit le recours \u00e0 leur moyen pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de l'exercer? C'est au particulier ou au groupe qui conteste la mesure l\u00e9gislative qu'il incombe de prouver qu'il y a eu violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue.\n[55] C\u2019est le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s. Le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 appuie l\u2019application d\u2019une analyse commune aux atteintes \u00e0 des droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 RCS 771, au paragraphe 79 (Badger)).\n[56] En \u00e9voquant l\u2019application du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Millbrook avait le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y avait atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019un de ses droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sparrow. La preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite pour \u00e9tablir une telle atteinte \u00e9tait insuffisante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je signale \u00e9galement le paragraphe 35(4) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 qui dispose que \u00ab les droits \u2013 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s [\u2026] sont garantis \u00e9galement aux personnes des deux sexes \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[57] Troisi\u00e8mement, s\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019il y a eu atteinte \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019analyse s\u2019oriente ensuite vers la question de la justification. Le crit\u00e8re de la justification demande s\u2019il existe pour cette atteinte un objectif l\u00e9gislatif valide, il examine la relation de confiance sp\u00e9ciale et la responsabilit\u00e9 du gouvernement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des peuples autochtones, et il pose les autres questions que peuvent susciter les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire. Comme la reconnaissance et la confirmation exigent que l\u2019on fasse preuve de sensibilit\u00e9 et de respect envers les droits des peuples autochtones, ces autres questions peuvent inclure le fait de savoir s\u2019il y a eu le moins possible atteinte \u00e0 des droits, si une juste compensation est pr\u00e9vue et si l\u2019on a consult\u00e9 les Autochtones en question (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Sparrow, aux pages 1113 \u00e0 1119, ainsi que l\u2019arr\u00eat Badger, au paragraphe 97).\n[58] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 2, la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 le pouvoir de r\u00e9glementation g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019exerce le gouvernement sur les droits issus de trait\u00e9s, sous r\u00e9serve de la justification d\u2019objectifs valides. Dans le contexte des trait\u00e9s conclus en 1760-1761, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les objectifs r\u00e9glementaires valides pouvaient inclure la conservation, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 sur les plans \u00e9conomique et r\u00e9gional, de m\u00eame que la reconnaissance du fait que, historiquement, des groupes non autochtones comptent sur les ressources halieutiques et participent \u00e0 leur exploitation.\n[59] M\u00eame si Millbrook \u00e9tait parvenue \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s et d\u2019une atteinte \u00e0 ce droit, la Couronne n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 \u00e9tait en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ou qu\u2019il lui faudrait peut-\u00eatre justifier l\u2019application de la LCDP aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Un avis relatif \u00e0 une question constitutionnelle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 au titre du paragraphe 9(7) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04).\n[60] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la justification du gouvernement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e atteinte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 importante vu que la mani\u00e8re dont Millbrook caract\u00e9rise les droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s semble \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente de celle dont les droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 1. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Marshall 2, au paragraphe 22 : \u00ab [\u2026] le contexte factuel rev\u00eat une grande importance, et la valeur de la justification du gouvernement peut varier selon la ressource, l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la communaut\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00bb. Millbrook n\u2019a pas envisag\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce la justification potentielle du gouvernement.\n[61] En cons\u00e9quence, selon moi, Millbrook n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement l\u2019application de droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s, ni celle du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Si elle avait fait un tel examen, elle aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves suffisantes pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; elle aurait fait valoir qu\u2019il y avait eu atteinte \u00e0 ces droits et elle aurait signifi\u00e9 un avis relatif \u00e0 une question constitutionnelle afin que la Couronne puisse pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la question. Comme cela n\u2019a pas eu lieu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je rejette l\u2019argument que fonde Millbrook sur le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[62] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019argument de Millbrook tente \u00e9galement de faire valoir un droit issu de trait\u00e9s au sujet du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et, de ce fait, que sa d\u00e9cision concernant Mme Tabor \u00e9tait un exercice de pouvoir express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi sur les Indiens pour les besoins de l\u2019article 67 de la LCDP, je rejette cet argument lui aussi.\n[63] Le paragraphe 18(1) figure dans une partie de la Loi sur les Indiens qui est intitul\u00e9e \u00ab R\u00c9SERVES \u00bb. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu\u2019il constitue un fondement juridique de l\u2019obligation fiduciaire de la Couronne envers les groupes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, relativement aux usages que l\u2019on peut faire des terres de r\u00e9serve (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Guerin c. La Reine, [1984] 2 RCS 335, aux pages 348 \u00e0 350, les juges Ritchie, McIntyre et Wilson, et, aux pages 383 et 384, les juges Dickson, Beetz, Chouinard et Lamer). La note marginale qui accompagne le paragraphe 18(1) concorde avec la mani\u00e8re dont la Cour supr\u00eame interpr\u00e8te cette disposition : \u00ab Les r\u00e9serves sont d\u00e9tenues \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit des Indiens \u00bb.\n[64] J\u2019ajouterais que l\u2019obligation fiduciaire de la Couronne est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne et, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CSC 14, au paragraphe 66, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9crit ce principe en ces termes :\nL\u2019objectif fondamental du principe de l\u2019honneur de la Couronne est la r\u00e9conciliation des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s autochtones pr\u00e9existantes avec l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne. Comme il est dit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Premi\u00e8re nation Tlingit de Taku River c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Directeur d\u2019\u00e9valuation de projet), 2004 CSC 74, [2004] 3 R.C.S. 550, par. 24 :\nL\u2019obligation d\u2019agir honorablement d\u00e9coule de l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 de la Couronne face \u00e0 l\u2019occupation ant\u00e9rieure des terres par les peuples autochtones. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 au par. 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, qui reconna\u00eet et confirme les droits et titres ancestraux existants des peuples autochtones. Un des objectifs vis\u00e9s par le par. 35(1) est la n\u00e9gociation de r\u00e8glements \u00e9quitables des revendications autochtones. Dans toutes ses n\u00e9gociations avec les Autochtones, la Couronne doit agir honorablement, dans le respect de ses relations pass\u00e9es et futures avec le peuple autochtone concern\u00e9.\n[65] Vu l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je ne vois pas en quoi une d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche est un exercice de pouvoir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de terres de r\u00e9serve. Les arguments que Millbrook a invoqu\u00e9s et les preuves qu\u2019elle a produites ne sont pas suffisants pour \u00e9tablir un lien quelconque entre le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[66] Par ailleurs, Millbrook se fonde sur un petit passage du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens (\u00ab [\u2026] sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi et des stipulations de tout trait\u00e9 ou cession [\u2026] \u00bb) pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se selon laquelle cette disposition confirme l\u2019existence de droits issus de trait\u00e9s des Autochtones, comme la p\u00eache commerciale. Il ressort d\u2019une simple lecture de cette disposition que l\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab trait\u00e9 \u00bb concerne les clauses d\u2019un trait\u00e9 qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur l\u2019usage et le profit de terres de r\u00e9serve pour les groupes des Premi\u00e8res Nations, et pas n\u00e9cessairement la confirmation de droits issus de trait\u00e9s en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019argument qu\u2019invoque Millbrook en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un droit issu de trait\u00e9s, et que l\u2019existence du droit issu de trait\u00e9s de g\u00e9rer les ressources halieutiques, y compris les choix de personnel, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, l\u2019argument qu\u2019invoque Millbrook en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) est lui aussi rejet\u00e9.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [67] Je conclus que le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour examiner les plaintes de Mme Tabor. L\u2019article 67 de la LCDP ne s\u2019applique pas aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il n\u2019existe pas non plus de preuves d\u2019une atteinte \u00e0 un droit ancestral ou issu de trait\u00e9s, au titre du paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[68] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe 27 mars 2015\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1658\/1311 et T1659\/1411\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Stacey Lee Tabor c.

Richard Carpenter (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre la Ligue navale du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e), le 25 janvier 2011, une plainte (la premi\u00e8re plainte) dans laquelle il affirme que, en violation de l\u2019article 7 et du paragraphe 14(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, et modifications (la Loi), l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis \u00e0 son encontre un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur son orientation sexuelle, l\u2019a trait\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re singuli\u00e8re et pr\u00e9judiciable et ne lui a pas offert un milieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement. Le m\u00eame jour, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une modification \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re plainte, dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait, comme autre motif de distinction illicite, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. La Commission a accept\u00e9 la modification.\nII. Les requ\u00eates\n[2] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux requ\u00eates :\nque l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9 du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2014 (le premier EDP) soit substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 son EDP modifi\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 7 avril 2014 (l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9); ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que les deux EDP fassent partie int\u00e9grante du dossier de la pr\u00e9sente instruction (la requ\u00eate EDP);\net\nque le Tribunal autorise le plaignant \u00e0 modifier la plainte pour y ajouter une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi (la requ\u00eate en modification).\nA. La requ\u00eate EDP\n(i) Contexte\n[3] Le 17 janvier 2013, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour l\u2019instruction de la premi\u00e8re plainte. Le dossier montre que, \u00e0 la date du renvoi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat et que, le 13 janvier 2014, l\u2019avocat a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Le 28 janvier 2014, le directeur ex\u00e9cutif national de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait savoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait plus repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat et que M. Gordon King, pr\u00e9sident de la Division de l\u2019Ontario de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, repr\u00e9senterait l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9cisait aussi que M. King \u00e9tait alors en train de passer en revue l\u2019EDP du plaignant.\n(ii) Le premier EDP de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[5] Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a signifi\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le premier EDP, comprenant deux pages, en annexe \u00e0 une lettre sign\u00e9e par M. King. Il y a d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations et observations dans le premier EDP, mais celles qui int\u00e9ressent la requ\u00eate EDP sont les suivantes :\n\u00ab Un membre avait admis avoir lanc\u00e9 des \u201cinjures et propos homophobes\u201d et avait quitt\u00e9 l\u2019organisation d\u00e8s qu\u2019on lui avait demand\u00e9 de s\u2019en expliquer \u00bb (l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes, ou les injures homophobes);\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention d\u2019appeler des t\u00e9moins ou de produire des documents.\n[6] Le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait savoir au Tribunal qu\u2019elle avait engag\u00e9 un nouveau repr\u00e9sentant, un parajuriste.\n[7] Le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le repr\u00e9sentant a demand\u00e9 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une \u00ab modification et nouvelle pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00bb, parce qu\u2019il venait de recevoir le dossier et qu\u2019il devait le passer en revue.\n[8] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 les conclusions du plaignant et celles de la Commission sur la requ\u00eate. Le plaignant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate parce que, \u00e0 son avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab pleinement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat \u00bb depuis septembre 2010, qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son EDP et qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre tenue de se soumettre rigoureusement aux d\u00e9lais du Tribunal \u00bb. Le plaignant affirmait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e recourait [traduction] \u00ab encore une fois \u00e0 une nouvelle tactique dilatoire \u00bb.\n[9] La Commission a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s examen des conclusions ci-dessus, j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le 7 avril 2014, l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9.\nB. L\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9\n[11] L\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 comprend :\nle texte des articles 1, 2, 3, 4 et 5 de la Loi;\nles d\u00e9clarations suivantes :\n\u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9e en tout temps et pleinement. Des lignes directrices existent, et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies en tout temps pour emp\u00eacher cette f\u00e2cheuse situation et permettre une enqu\u00eate. Nous croyons que cette plainte est infond\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e \u00bb;\nles noms de neuf t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s;\nune liste d\u2019une page \u00e9num\u00e9rant 20 documents aux fins de communication.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni le 23 avril 2014 des sommaires des d\u00e9positions de ses t\u00e9moins.\n[13] L\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 ne comprenait aucune des d\u00e9clarations et observations figurant dans le premier EDP.\n(i) R\u00e9ponse et position du plaignant concernant l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9\n[14] Le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il avait envisag\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes.\n[15] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9, le plaignant \u00e9crivait que l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 ne comprenait aucune des d\u00e9clarations figurant dans le premier EDP, dont l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes. Il relevait que, contrairement au premier EDP, l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 offrait neuf t\u00e9moins, ainsi qu\u2019une communication de documents.\n(ii) Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[16] Au cours d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ult\u00e9rieure de gestion du cas, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a confirm\u00e9 sa position selon laquelle l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 devait \u00eatre substitu\u00e9 au premier EDP, et elle a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 soit l\u2019unique EDP vers\u00e9 dans le dossier.\n[17] Le plaignant s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9 et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate EDP.\n(iii) Conclusions du plaignant\n[18] Les conclusions du plaignant sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nUne modification n\u2019est qu\u2019un \u00e9claircissement, non une [traduction] \u00ab permission de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux points, de soumettre de nouveaux d\u00e9tails ou de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une repr\u00e9sentation inepte \u00bb.\nLe Tribunal a-t-il le pouvoir de retirer du dossier le premier EDP?\nLa requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en modification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9tait un moyen pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e de [traduction] \u00ab se soustraire aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (les R\u00e8gles) dans une tentative voil\u00e9e de rectifier ses positions ant\u00e9rieures sur divers aspects qui constituent le fond m\u00eame de la cause du plaignant.\nLe premier EDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et il porte une date; l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 ne porte ni signature, ni date.\nL\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 r\u00e9tracte des aveux essentiels, dont l\u2019un int\u00e9resse directement le fond m\u00eame de la plainte.\nDans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e produit de nouveaux t\u00e9moins et de nouvelles preuves documentaires, elle devrait obtenir l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal en vertu du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles, au lieu de pr\u00e9senter un EDP nouveau ou modifi\u00e9.\n(iv) Conclusions de la Commission\n[19] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse pour aider le Tribunal et les parties en indiquant ce qui, affirme-t-elle, constitue le crit\u00e8re que doit appliquer le Tribunal, et les facteurs dont il doit tenir compte pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision. La Commission ne se prononce pas sur le redressement que demande le plaignant.\n[20] Les conclusions de la Commission sont expos\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nLes R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9voient rien de pr\u00e9cis sur la modification des plaintes et des EDP, ni sur la r\u00e9tractation d\u2019aveux.\nLa situation dont il s\u2019agit ici est inusit\u00e9e parce que [traduction] \u00ab la plupart des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents parlent de la r\u00e9tractation d\u2019un aveu dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en modification d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure (par opposition \u00e0 la r\u00e9tractation apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure modifi\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif) \u00bb, la s\u00e9quence que l\u2019on observe ici.\nIl est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de consentir \u00e0 des modifications, y compris \u00e0 la modification des \u00ab actes de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb d\u2019une partie, par exemple un EDP.\nLe Black\u2019s Law Dictionary d\u00e9finit ainsi un \u00ab aveu \u00bb :\n[traduction] \u00ab [C]onfession, concession ou reconnaissance volontaire faites par une partie \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de certains faits. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9clarations d\u2019une partie, ou du repr\u00e9sentant juridique de celle-ci, quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d\u2019un fait qui int\u00e9resse la cause de son adversaire \u00bb.\nLe Tribunal devrait consid\u00e9rer ce qui suit pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision sur cette requ\u00eate :\nl\u2019aveu constitue-t-il un aveu \u00ab important \u00bb, dont la r\u00e9tractation aurait pour cons\u00e9quence \u00ab un changement radical de la nature des questions en litige \u00bb, comme on peut le lire dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Merck & Co. Inc. c. Apotex Inc., 2003 CAF 488 (l\u2019arr\u00eat Merck), au paragraphe 32; et\nla r\u00e9tractation de l\u2019aveu causerait-elle un pr\u00e9judice au plaignant en lui faisant porter la charge d\u2019\u00e9tablir la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019aveu, et cette charge aurait-elle pour effet de prolonger l\u2019audience et de nuire p\u00e9cuniairement au plaignant? et\nqu\u2019est-ce qui sert le mieux les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice?\n(v) Conclusions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[21] Les conclusions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont expos\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a validement sollicit\u00e9 la modification du premier EDP, et le Tribunal lui a accord\u00e9 le droit de d\u00e9poser un EDP modifi\u00e9.\nPour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, si le Tribunal a \u00ab approuv\u00e9 \u00bb la modification, cela signifie que [traduction] \u00ab le nouvel EDP devait \u00e9liminer et remplacer l\u2019ancien EDP \u00bb et il constituerait l\u2019unique EDP de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et le seul appelant une r\u00e9ponse.\nIl est pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le premier EDP demeure dans le dossier parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas de repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9, et parce qu\u2019aucun examen juridique n\u2019en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nUne modification peut aussi apporter des ajouts et des suppressions \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle modifie, autant que des \u00e9claircissements.\nUne fois que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait un repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal et que celui-ci avait pass\u00e9 en revue le dossier, alors [traduction] \u00ab une modification \u00e9tait requise \u00bb.\nC. Points litigieux\n[22] Le premier EDP peut-il \u00eatre radi\u00e9 du dossier?\n[23] L\u2019intim\u00e9e peut-elle se d\u00e9dire du premier EDP dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et lui substituer l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9?\nD. Analyse\n(i) Le premier EDP peut-il \u00eatre radi\u00e9 du dossier?\n[24] Il est n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9server un dossier complet de l\u2019instruction entreprise par le Tribunal concernant la plainte. Un dossier complet s\u2019entend de tous les documents produits, y compris de ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s.\n[25] Un dossier complet est \u00e9galement requis si l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties souhaite d\u00e9poser une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, ou de toute autre d\u00e9cision cons\u00e9cutive \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, DORS\/98-106 (les R\u00e8gles des CF), en particulier leurs articles 317 et 318, obligent l\u2019organisme administratif qui a rendu la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 transmettre une copie certifi\u00e9e conforme des documents demand\u00e9s par la partie qui d\u00e9pose une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, sous r\u00e9serve de toute opposition formul\u00e9e par l\u2019organisme administratif ou par une partie. La non-pr\u00e9servation d\u2019un dossier complet pourrait \u00eatre vue comme une entrave \u00e0 l\u2019exercice, par la Cour, de son pouvoir de contr\u00f4le aux termes de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7.\n[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, le dossier du Tribunal se rapportant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re plainte comprendra \u00e0 la fois le premier EDP de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n(ii) L\u2019intim\u00e9e peut-elle se d\u00e9dire du premier EDP dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et lui substituer l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9?\n[27] Il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner bri\u00e8vement le cadre l\u00e9gislatif du Tribunal et sa nature juridique intrins\u00e8que, pour mettre en contexte cette question, et la trancher.\nE. Droit l\u00e9gislatif\n[28] Les dispositions applicables de la Loi sont les suivantes :\n[29] Paragraphe 48.1(1) :\n\u00ab Est constitu\u00e9 le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne\u2026 \u00bb\n[30] Paragraphe 48.9(1) :\n\u00ab L\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb.\n[31] Paragraphe 50(1) :\n\u00ab Le membre instructeur, apr\u00e8s avis conforme \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties et, \u00e0 son appr\u00e9ciation, \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9, instruit la plainte pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9; il donne \u00e0 ceux-ci la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations. \u00bb\n[32] Alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) :\n\u00ab Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\nc) de recevoir, sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (4) et (5), des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. [1]\n[33] Le paragraphe 48.1(1) de la Loi (voir ci-dessus) \u00e9tablit le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est ce que l\u2019on appelle une \u00ab cr\u00e9ation du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb. Il n\u2019a que les pouvoirs que la Loi lui conf\u00e8re, soit explicitement, soit par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire reconnue dans la jurisprudence. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une autorit\u00e9 judiciaire. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t un organisme quasi judiciaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un organisme administratif qui fonctionne plus ou moins comme une cour de justice.\n[34] Il y a d\u2019autres diff\u00e9rences notables entre une cour de justice et le Tribunal, en raison du fait que le Tribunal est une cr\u00e9ation du l\u00e9gislateur, qui conduit une instruction impos\u00e9e par la loi. Les diff\u00e9rences \u00e0 noter sont les suivantes :\nLa Loi ne fait pas d\u2019une plainte une cause d\u2019action fond\u00e9e sur la common law (arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada, 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 36).\nUne instruction aux termes de la Loi n\u2019est pas une action r\u00e9gie par les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, en particulier par l\u2019article 169 des R\u00e8gles des CF, et il ne s\u2019agit pas non plus d\u2019une \u00ab instance \u00bb selon l\u2019article 1.1 des R\u00e8gles des CF. En bref, une plainte n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose qu\u2019une action en justice.\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) dispose que, au cours d\u2019une audience du Tribunal, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir \u00ab de recevoir \u00bb des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par tout moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, \u00ab ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire [c\u2019est moi qui souligne], sous r\u00e9serve uniquement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont confidentiels et de l\u2019interdiction pour un conciliateur de t\u00e9moigner.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, les r\u00e8gles de preuve qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une audience du Tribunal offrent une latitude beaucoup plus grande quant \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 de la preuve que ne le font les r\u00e8gles de preuve applicables dans une cour de justice.\n[36] L\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur en faisant du Tribunal un organisme administratif quasi judiciaire constitu\u00e9 par la Loi \u00e9tait d\u2019offrir au public, pour l\u2019instruction des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, des proc\u00e9dures moins formelles et plus souples que celles des cours de justice (voir le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.)\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, on doit \u00e0 la fois faire preuve de prudence et proc\u00e9der aux ajustements n\u00e9cessaires quand l\u2019on compare la terminologie et les proc\u00e9dures des cours de justice et celles des tribunaux des droits de la personne et que l\u2019on tente de les transposer d\u2019un type de juridiction \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nF. Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (EDP)\n[38] Le fait que le Tribunal ne soit pas une cour de justice influe sur la nature intrins\u00e8que des documents qu\u2019utilisent les parties pour pr\u00e9senter leurs positions et r\u00e9pondre aux parties adverses.\n[39] Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal), dont le libell\u00e9 contient en partie ce qui suit :\n\u00ab 6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\nles faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause;\nsa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause;\nle redressement recherch\u00e9;\nles divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\nles divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 ...\nles noms des divers t\u00e9moins \u2013 autres que les t\u00e9moins experts \u2013 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer... \u00bb\n[40] On pourrait assimiler un EDP plus ou moins \u00e0 un \u00ab acte de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb dans une action port\u00e9e devant une juridiction civile, mais il ne s\u2019agit pas de la m\u00eame chose. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour les plaintes, les r\u00e9ponses et autres documents que les parties d\u00e9posent dans une cause en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Ces documents ne sont pas la m\u00eame chose que des actes de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans un proc\u00e8s civil. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de la m\u00eame chose non seulement parce que l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s n\u2019est pas une cour de justice, mais \u00e9galement parce qu\u2019ils ne sont pas soumis aux r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9cifiques qui r\u00e9gissent les actes de proc\u00e9dure.\n[41] Un aspect important de cette requ\u00eate est le fait que les r\u00e8gles d\u2019une cour de justice susceptibles de r\u00e9gir les observations et aveux figurant dans des actes de proc\u00e9dure ne s\u2019appliquent tout simplement pas aux EDP \u2013 ni aux autres documents \u2013 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans des instructions confi\u00e9es au Tribunal. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, s\u2019agissant de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019article 183 des R\u00e8gles des CF dispose qu\u2019une partie est tenue, dans sa d\u00e9fense ou tout acte de proc\u00e9dure ult\u00e9rieur, d\u2019admettre, parmi les faits substantiels all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure d\u2019une partie adverse, ce qu\u2019elle ne conteste pas.\n[42] L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00e9nonce ce que doit contenir un EDP. Entre autres choses, l\u2019EDP d\u2019une partie doit indiquer \u00ab les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause \u00bb.\n[43] Il n\u2019y a rien dans la Loi ou dans les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00e0 propos des aveux ou de la r\u00e9tractation d\u2019un aveu, qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans une plainte, dans un EDP ou dans tout autre document.\n[44] S\u2019agissant des documents, le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit \u00e0 propos de l\u2019instruction :\n\u00ab \u00c0 d\u00e9faut du consentement des parties, un document figurant dans un cahier de preuve documentaire ne peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admis en preuve par le membre instructeur. \u00bb\n[45] Le fait que, dans son EDP, une partie fasse une d\u00e9claration, \u00e9num\u00e8re un document aux fins de communication ou nomme un t\u00e9moin propos\u00e9 et r\u00e9sume le t\u00e9moignage que celui-ci pr\u00e9voit de faire n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas par le fait m\u00eame, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la recevabilit\u00e9 du document ou celle du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu. La v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du document ou du t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas non plus automatiquement \u00e9tablie. Une preuve recevable cr\u00e9dible portant sur une observation, une d\u00e9claration ou une confession dans un EDP, qu\u2019elle soit offerte ou sollicit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, est ce sur quoi le d\u00e9cideur doit en derni\u00e8re analyse se fonder pour savoir si un fait contest\u00e9 est ou non \u00e9tabli.\n[46] Les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et les paragraphes 6(1) et 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal appuient et favorisent la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 1(1) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, ainsi formul\u00e9 :\n1(1) Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ont pour objet de permettre\nque toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nque l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace;\nque toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n[47] Ce libell\u00e9 refl\u00e8te en partie le paragraphe 48.9(1) et l\u2019article 50 de la Loi. Toutefois, comme le pr\u00e9cise le paragraphe 48.9(1), l\u2019absence de formalisme et la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 sont toujours subordonn\u00e9es aux principes de justice naturelle.\n(i) Fonction d\u2019un EDP\n[48] La fonction de l\u2019EDP d\u2019une partie est de signifier \u00e0 la partie adverse la position qu\u2019adoptera la partie, le genre de preuve qu\u2019elle envisage de produire \u00e0 l\u2019audience et les arguments que la partie adverse devra apporter. Cette communication ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019audience joue un r\u00f4le critique parce qu\u2019elle donne aux parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations [\u2026] \u00bb, comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi.\n[49] On pourrait pr\u00e9tendre que, au 5 f\u00e9vrier 2014, certains des faits en cause dans la premi\u00e8re plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contest\u00e9s, mais, au 7 avril 2014, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait plus le cas.\n(ii) Comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal concernant les modifications apport\u00e9es aux EDP\n[50] Il est constant en droit que le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de permettre que des modifications soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 des plaintes : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 (la d\u00e9cision Parent).\n[51] Je suis d\u2019avis que le pouvoir du Tribunal de permettre que des modifications soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 une plainte l\u2019autorise n\u00e9cessairement aussi \u00e0 permettre la modification d\u2019un EDP. Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas, alors la partie qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son EDP et fait d\u00e8s lors face \u00e0 une plainte modifi\u00e9e ne pourra pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la modification en d\u00e9posant un EDP modifi\u00e9. Ce serait l\u00e0 lui nier la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments, et cela serait contraire aux principes de justice naturelle. Ce n\u2019est pas non plus la pratique du Tribunal \u2013 voir la d\u00e9cision Itty c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 TCDP 33, au paragraphe 61.\n(iii) EDP non sign\u00e9\n[52] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas trouv\u00e9 acceptable que l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 ne soit ni sign\u00e9 ni dat\u00e9. Les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal ne requi\u00e8rent pas qu\u2019un EDP soit sign\u00e9 ou dat\u00e9.\n(iv) Le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal est-il en l\u2019occurrence le moyen l\u00e9gitime de modifier un EDP?\n[53] Le paragraphe 9(3) dispose ainsi :\n\u00ab \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation du membre instructeur, laquelle doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 des conditions conformes au fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1), et sous r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019une partie de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en r\u00e9plique,\nune partie ne peut soulever \u00e0 l\u2019audience d\u2019autres questions que celles qu\u2019elle a soulev\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6;\nune partie ne peut faire t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience un t\u00e9moin qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas identifi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6 et pour lequel elle n\u2019a pas fourni de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu;\nune partie ne peut produire en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience un document qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 et produit conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6;\nune partie ne peut pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience d\u2019observations au sujet d\u2019une forme de redressement recherch\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas identifi\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6;\nune partie ne peut ni produire en preuve un rapport d\u2019expert, ni faire t\u00e9moigner un t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 l\u2019audience si elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e au paragraphe 6(3). \u00bb\n[54] Essentiellement donc, le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal dispose que, si l\u2019autorisation du membre instructeur n\u2019est pas obtenue, le fait pour une partie de ne pas observer la r\u00e8gle 6 parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une nouvelle question, d\u2019un nouveau t\u00e9moin, d\u2019un nouveau t\u00e9moignage, d\u2019un nouveau document, d\u2019une nouvelle demande de redressement ou d\u2019un nouveau rapport d\u2019expert avant l\u2019audience signifie que la partie ne peut pas pr\u00e9senter cette nouvelle question, ce nouveau t\u00e9moin, ce nouveau t\u00e9moignage, ce nouveau document, cette nouvelle demande de redressement ou ce nouveau rapport d\u2019expert durant l\u2019audience.\n[55] La partie qui pr\u00e9sente une demande en vertu du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal s\u2019expose au refus d\u2019une telle autorisation de la part du membre instructeur.\n[56] Si le membre instructeur accorde son autorisation, alors il l\u2019accorde aux conditions qu\u2019il fixe. Par exemple, le membre instructeur peut ordonner un ajournement afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie de pr\u00e9parer sa r\u00e9ponse. L\u2019autorisation est \u00e9galement subordonn\u00e9e au droit de l\u2019autre partie de pr\u00e9senter une contre-preuve.\n[57] C\u2019est faire fi de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal que de donner \u00e0 entendre que l\u2019audience reste le bon endroit pour \u00e9voquer une modification ou autre affaire nouvelle quand la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la modification ou l\u2019existence de l\u2019affaire nouvelle est connue de la partie requ\u00e9rante bien avant l\u2019audience, comme c\u2019est le cas ici. Le paragraphe 9(3) a pour objet d\u2019emp\u00eacher ce que l\u2019on appelle un \u00ab proc\u00e8s-embuscade \u00bb et ce qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte comme temps perdu, ressources perdues et frais accrus pour tous ceux qui participent \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u2013 les parties, les avocats, les t\u00e9moins \u2013 et le Tribunal.\n[58] Je suis d\u2019avis que le paragraphe 9(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal n\u2019est pas en l\u2019occurrence le moyen l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 employer.\n(v) Nature d\u2019une modification\n[59] Une modification peut apporter des ajouts et des suppressions \u00e0 la version originale d\u2019un document, autant que des \u00e9claircissements.\n[60] En temps normal, on comprendra que le document modifi\u00e9 remplacera vraisemblablement le document original, aux fins de la gestion du cas, des documents \u00e0 communiquer et de la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience.\n[61] Cependant, la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la normalit\u00e9. Les modifications apport\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e au premier EDP ont pour effet de supprimer l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un aspect important pour ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re plainte. L\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes peut int\u00e9resser directement l\u2019un des motifs de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte : l\u2019orientation sexuelle.\n[62] Dans une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en Colombie-Britannique, McLean c. B.C. (Min. of Public Safety and Sol. Gen.) No. 2, 2006 BCHRT 83 (la d\u00e9cision McLean), l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait avou\u00e9 que le plaignant souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience au sens du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique. Deux ans plus tard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a voulu r\u00e9tracter cet aveu. Le tribunal a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab la question primordiale est de savoir si l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice autorise la r\u00e9tractation de l\u2019aveu \u00bb (d\u00e9cision McLean, au paragraphe 23).\n[63] Je fais miens les propos du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique dans la d\u00e9cision McLean, o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut lire aussi que :\n[traduction] \u00ab dans un contexte de droits de la personne, il faut garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que la plainte et la r\u00e9ponse ne sont pas les \u00e9quivalents d\u2019actes de proc\u00e9dure dans un contexte de proc\u00e8s civil et que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le permettent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ainsi que la nature des points soulev\u00e9s, les proc\u00e9dures suivies par le Tribunal devraient \u00eatre informelles et flexibles \u00bb. (ibid).\n[64] La suppression de l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes requiert donc d\u2019examiner si l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice autorise la suppression de cet aveu, et d\u2019ajuster le contexte administratif des droits de la personne dans lequel la pr\u00e9sente instruction se d\u00e9roule.\nG. Facteurs pertinents \u00e0 prendre en compte pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice\n[65] Je suis d\u2019avis que les facteurs suivants doivent \u00eatre pris en compte pour savoir ce qu\u2019est l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice dans la requ\u00eate EDP : l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle tard\u00e9 \u00e0 demander l\u2019autorisation de modifier l\u2019EDP et de r\u00e9tracter l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes? Y a-t-il perte de date d\u2019audience et perte d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale? Y a-t-il un pr\u00e9judice? L\u2019aveu a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par inadvertance ou par erreur? D\u2019autres facteurs d\u00e9coulent-ils du contexte des droits de la personne (ibid)?\n(i) L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle tard\u00e9 \u00e0 demander l\u2019autorisation de modifier l\u2019EDP et de r\u00e9tracter l\u2019aveu?\n[66] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 avis qu\u2019elle avait le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2014 engag\u00e9 un nouveau repr\u00e9sentant et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 24 f\u00e9vrier sa requ\u00eate en modification de son EDP. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas tard\u00e9 \u00e0 demander l\u2019autorisation de modifier son EDP.\n[67] Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 les parties ni le Tribunal que l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 aurait pour effet de r\u00e9tracter l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes. La teneur de l\u2019avis donn\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait que, parce qu\u2019elle avait obtenu une repr\u00e9sentation l\u00e9gale apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le premier EDP, elle souhaitait une prorogation de d\u00e9lai afin de d\u00e9poser un EDP modifi\u00e9.\n[68] Ainsi, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de retard, il n\u2019y a pas eu non plus avis de r\u00e9tractation de l\u2019aveu.\n(ii) Perte de date d\u2019audience et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\n[69] Aucune date d\u2019audience n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e. La r\u00e9tractation de l\u2019aveu \u00e0 ce stade de la premi\u00e8re plainte ne fait pas obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n(iii) L\u2019aveu a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par inadvertance ou par erreur?\n[70] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal ni obtenu d\u2019avis juridique quand elle avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le premier EDP. Le repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9 par la suite a confirm\u00e9 ce fait.\n[71] Je ne sais pas si l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par inadvertance ou h\u00e2tivement ou sans une pleine connaissance des faits\u2026 \u00bb (d\u00e9cision McLean, au paragraphe 23), vu qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve sur ce point.\n[72] La seule conclusion que je tire quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019aveu s\u2019est manifest\u00e9 est que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas de repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal quand elle a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le premier EDP. En cons\u00e9quence, par l\u2019entremise de son repr\u00e9sentant l\u00e9gal engag\u00e9 plus tard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a voulu modifier le premier EDP, lequel, entre autres choses, n\u2019offrait pas de t\u00e9moins, ni aucune preuve documentaire.\n[73] L\u2019avis juridique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a obtenu a vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine des changements ins\u00e9r\u00e9s dans son EDP modifi\u00e9.\n[74] Sous r\u00e9serve de mes propos et de ma d\u00e9cision concernant la suppression, sans avis, de l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes, je ne vois rien de fautif \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e modifie son EDP apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu un avis juridique.\n(iv) Autres facteurs d\u00e9coulant du contexte des droits de la personne\n[75] Il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est une [traduction] \u00ab plaideuse inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9e \u00bb (d\u00e9cision McLean, au paragraphe 31). Je ne me prononce donc pas sur cet aspect.\n(v) Pr\u00e9judice\n[76] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a ajout\u00e9 une liste de t\u00e9moins et de documents dans son EDP modifi\u00e9. L\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 rend compte de la position la plus actuelle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il permet aussi au plaignant de savoir quels arguments il devra apporter.\n[77] Ne pas autoriser l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 se fonder sur son EDP modifi\u00e9 serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e car cela aurait notamment pour effet de soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019instruction ses t\u00e9moins et documents propos\u00e9s. Cela reviendrait \u00e0 nier \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que [ses] observations \u00bb, selon ce que pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e sera donc autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 utiliser l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9, aux fins de la gestion du cas, des documents \u00e0 communiquer et de la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience.\n[78] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes int\u00e9resse l\u2019une des principales all\u00e9gations de la plainte : la distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019orientation sexuelle.\n[79] Le plaignant voudrait invoquer cet aveu comme preuve concluante de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu. Ce point de vue repose en grande partie sur la mani\u00e8re dont les juridictions civiles ont trait\u00e9 dans divers pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents les aveux faits dans des actes de proc\u00e9dure. La Commission se sert du m\u00eame cadre pour appeler l\u2019attention sur les crit\u00e8res que le Tribunal devrait appliquer pour arriver \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[80] Comme indiqu\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres parties, ci-dessus, de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le plaignant ne saurait voir dans l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes une preuve concluante de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu, en raison de la mani\u00e8re dont la Loi et les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal sont cens\u00e9es fonctionner.\n[81] D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 ne fait plus mention des injures homophobes, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019entend pas prouver cet incident au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[82] Cependant, le premier EDP demeure dans le dossier. La mention qu\u2019il fait des injures homophobes a eu pour effet de notifier aux autres parties qu\u2019un membre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pu faire des observations douteuses concernant une orientation sexuelle et que cet incident a pu entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences.\n[83] Je suis d\u2019avis que, si l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes \u00e9tait totalement supprim\u00e9e de cette instruction, il en r\u00e9sulterait un pr\u00e9judice pour le plaignant dans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice ne serait pas servi.\n[84] Le plaignant sera donc autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, s\u2019il d\u00e9cide de le faire, en ajoutant le contenu des injures homophobes. Cela deviendrait alors une all\u00e9gation.\n[85] Si le plaignant d\u00e9cide de modifier son EDP pour y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019en subira pas de pr\u00e9judice. Par la modification, l\u2019intim\u00e9e sera inform\u00e9e que le plaignant produira, durant l\u2019audience, une preuve concernant l\u2019incident, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourra pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense en cons\u00e9quence. Le Tribunal donnera aussi \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser un EDP modifi\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la modification apport\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n[86] Le fait de donner au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der de cette mani\u00e8re ne lui cause pas de pr\u00e9judice. Il revient tout simplement \u00e0 effacer l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019il aurait pu se fonder sur l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes comme preuve concluante que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cause sont survenus. Il n\u2019aurait pas pu le faire de toute fa\u00e7on, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s. Toutefois, lui donner cette possibilit\u00e9 lui permet de tenter d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019incident des injures homophobes a bien eu lieu.\n[87] Si le plaignant modifie son EDP pour y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes, il pourra alors demander \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la communication de documents s\u2019y rapportant, contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au cours de l\u2019audience \u00e0 propos de l\u2019all\u00e9gation et, avec le consentement du Tribunal, assigner des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience s\u2019il estime que leurs d\u00e9positions permettront de faire la lumi\u00e8re sur le pr\u00e9tendu incident.\n[88] Cela dit, je voudrais \u00e0 nouveau souligner que, du seul fait qu\u2019une observation ou all\u00e9gation figure dans l\u2019EDP d\u2019une partie, cela ne signifie pas que la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de cette observation ou all\u00e9gation est \u00e9tablie, \u00e0 moins que les parties ne reconnaissent sa v\u00e9racit\u00e9, ou tant et aussi longtemps que le Tribunal n\u2019aura pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que leur v\u00e9racit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, compte tenu de la preuve recevable et cr\u00e9dible produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nH. La requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte par ajout de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles aux termes de l\u2019article 14.1\n(i) Contexte \u2013 La deuxi\u00e8me plainte\n[89] Le 28 janvier 2013, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une autre plainte dans laquelle il affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui \u00e0 cause du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte, en violation de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi (la deuxi\u00e8me plainte). \u00c0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la Commission n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n(ii) Droit l\u00e9gislatif et jurisprudence\n[90] L\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi est ainsi formul\u00e9 :\n\u00ab Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[91] Comme indiqu\u00e9 dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision qui concernait la requ\u00eate EDP, le Tribunal a le pouvoir de consentir \u00e0 ce que des modifications soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 une plainte (d\u00e9cision Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\n[92] La modification ne peut donner lieu \u00e0 une plainte fondamentalement nouvelle (d\u00e9cision Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 45929 (TCDP), au paragraphe 11) (la d\u00e9cision Cook), et elle ne saurait entra\u00eener un pr\u00e9judice pour la partie adverse (d\u00e9cision Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 40).\n[93] Dans la d\u00e9cision Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10 (la d\u00e9cision Virk), le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 appliquer pour autoriser une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles selon l\u2019article 14.1 en tant que modification apport\u00e9e \u00e0 une plainte consistait \u00ab \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables \u00bb (d\u00e9cision Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 7 et 8.)\n(iii) Observations du plaignant\n[94] Selon le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 contre lui des repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, \u00e0 cause du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte, et cela :\n\u00b7 en refusant d\u2019autoriser le plaignant \u00e0 assister \u00e0 deux de trois \u00e9v\u00e9nements c\u00e9r\u00e9moniaux organis\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mai 2012, et \u00e0 un autre \u00e9v\u00e9nement du m\u00eame genre organis\u00e9 en janvier 2013; et\n\u00b7 en le priant de ne pas prendre et d\u00e9poser des cadets sur le terrain de stationnement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de ne pas se trouver \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[95] Le plaignant affirme que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements se sont produits apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019eut suspendu.\n[96] Il affirme que, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de participation aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements de 2012, le directeur national de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s consultation du bureau de Brantford de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 participer \u00e0 deux de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, et [traduction] \u00ab m\u2019a fait savoir que je devrais \u00eatre en mesure de comprendre que l\u2019on s\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle \u00e0 ma plainte de violation des droits de la personne\u2026 les membres d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans ma plainte craignaient que ma pr\u00e9sence aux activit\u00e9s de la Ligne navale n\u2019ait pour r\u00e9sultat de compliquer davantage la situation \u00bb.\n[97] Le plaignant affirme que la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 sa demande de participation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement de 2013 [traduction] \u00ab montrait que ma pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement favoriserait presque certainement l\u2019instauration d\u2019un climat d\u00e9l\u00e9t\u00e8re parmi le personnel b\u00e9n\u00e9vole sur place \u00bb.

Canada, [1994] 1 C.F. 3, 1993 CanLII 2990 (CAF), \u00e0 la page 10.\n(v) Position et conclusions de la Commission\n[101] La Commission est favorable \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en modification. Selon elle, la modification demand\u00e9e r\u00e9pond au crit\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision Virk, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, parce que la question des repr\u00e9sailles est \u00ab clairement \u00bb rattach\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte initiale, elle lui est rattach\u00e9e par le plaignant et elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le une all\u00e9gation d\u00e9fendable de repr\u00e9sailles.\nI. Analyse\n(i) Moment des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles\n[102] Selon le plaignant, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a interdit de participer \u00e0 certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements et de se trouver sur son domaine, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re plainte. L\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la modification est que les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles ont eu lieu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[103] Les repr\u00e9sailles sont une r\u00e9action \u00e0 une action. Il est donc de la nature de repr\u00e9sailles qu\u2019elles se produisent apr\u00e8s une action.\n[104] Le texte de l\u2019article 14.1 reconna\u00eet cette nature des repr\u00e9sailles lorsqu\u2019il dispose que\n\u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00bb [c\u2019est moi qui souligne] commet un acte discriminatoire en exer\u00e7ant ou en mena\u00e7ant d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles \u00ab contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00bb [c\u2019est moi qui souligne].\n[105] Je suis d\u2019avis que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 14.1, une plainte doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e avant qu\u2019un acte ult\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du plaignant ou de la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme des repr\u00e9sailles.\n[106] Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait que les repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par le plaignant aient eu lieu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le Tribunal d\u2019autoriser la modification.\n(ii) L\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est-elle ind\u00e9fendable?\n[107] Vu les termes que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a employ\u00e9s pour refuser au plaignant ses demandes de participation aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements c\u00e9r\u00e9moniaux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et vu en particulier les termes employ\u00e9s \u00e0 propos des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de 2012, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles qui est faite par le plaignant n\u2019est pas ind\u00e9fendable.\n(iii) Principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e\n[108] Les conclusions du plaignant et celles de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont contradictoires sur la question de savoir si la deuxi\u00e8me plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e ou rejet\u00e9e.\n[109] L\u2019avocat de la Commission ne dit pas que le plaignant a retir\u00e9 sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte ou que la Commission l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e. Je pr\u00e9sume que l\u2019avocat de la Commission sait o\u00f9 en est la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au sein de la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant auraient aussi probablement re\u00e7u une correspondance officielle si la Commission avait rejet\u00e9 la plainte. Aucune des parties n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette correspondance ni ne s\u2019y est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[110] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur le fond des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles. Par cons\u00e9quent, le principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ne vaut pas ici.\n(iv) La modification propos\u00e9e constitue-t-elle fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte?\n[111] Le plaignant rattache les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte. Le Tribunal a conclu que, dans des cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 le crit\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision Virk a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9, le fait d\u2019autoriser une modification ajoutant l\u2019argument des repr\u00e9sailles selon l\u2019article 14.1 comme motif de distinction illicite ne fait pas de la modification une nouvelle plainte.\n(v) La question du pr\u00e9judice\n[112] L\u2019intim\u00e9e sait depuis le 28 janvier 2013, date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, que le plaignant voyait les repr\u00e9sailles comme un point litigieux.\n[113] Aucune date d\u2019audience n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e.\n[114] Le Tribunal donnera aux deux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des EDP modifi\u00e9s concernant l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. L\u2019intim\u00e9e disposera par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019un d\u00e9lai suffisant pour pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la modification ajoutant l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[115] Pour tous les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je suis d\u2019avis que la modification ne causera aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[116] Par ailleurs, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Cook, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 19, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il serait injuste d\u2019obliger le plaignant \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte distincte pour pousser plus loin son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[117] Je prends aussi en compte le fait que la Commission appuie la modification, m\u00eame si elle n\u2019a pas officiellement renvoy\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au Tribunal.\n[118] Je fais observer que, si le Tribunal a autoris\u00e9 cette modification, cela ne signifie pas que le plaignant a \u00e9tay\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles. Comme pour les autres all\u00e9gations figurant dans la premi\u00e8re plainte, le Tribunal ne pourra dire si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est ou non \u00e9tay\u00e9e qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 toute la preuve produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nIII. D\u00e9cision\n[119] Le premier EDP de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9 du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2014 et l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9 du 7 avril 2014 resteront partie int\u00e9grante du dossier du Tribunal se rapportant \u00e0 cette plainte.\n[120] Aux fins de la gestion du cas et des obligations de communication auxquelles sont soumises les parties, ainsi qu\u2019aux fins des pr\u00e9paratifs de l\u2019audience, et sous r\u00e9serve des d\u00e9cisions ci-apr\u00e8s, l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e remplace le premier EDP de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[121] Le Tribunal accorde ici au plaignant l\u2019autorisation de modifier son EDP, s\u2019il en d\u00e9cide ainsi, pour y inclure l\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes. S\u2019il d\u00e9cide de modifier son EDP :\nl\u2019aveu d\u2019injures homophobes deviendra l\u2019\u00ab all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes \u00bb et sera appel\u00e9 ainsi;\nle plaignant pourra demander \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de lui communiquer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes; et\nle Tribunal fera droit \u00e0 une demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e portant sur une modification correspondante de l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[122] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, et si le plaignant a modifi\u00e9 son EDP pour y inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes, et \u00e0 condition que les parties se soient conform\u00e9es aux R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, en particulier \u00e0 celles qui concernent la divulgation continue, les deux parties pourront produire des preuves, notamment des preuves documentaires et des preuves orales, se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019injures homophobes, sous r\u00e9serve de la recevabilit\u00e9 de telles preuves.\n[123] La requ\u00eate en modification est accueillie. La premi\u00e8re plainte est ici modifi\u00e9e par ajout de l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire contre le plaignant en exer\u00e7ant \u00e0 son encontre des repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[124] Le plaignant et la Commission pourront signifier et d\u00e9poser des EDP modifi\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6, pour ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles selon l\u2019article 14.1.\n[125] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pourra signifier et d\u00e9poser un EDP modifi\u00e9, portant sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles selon l\u2019article 14.1, en r\u00e9ponse aux EDP modifi\u00e9s du plaignant et de la Commission, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6.\n[126] Le plaignant pourra signifier et d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 l\u2019EDP modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[127] Les dates auxquelles les parties devront signifier et d\u00e9poser les documents susmentionn\u00e9s seront fix\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion du cas, qui aura lieu aussit\u00f4t que possible.\nSign\u00e9e par\nOlga Luftig\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 20 avril 2015\n[1] Le paragraphe (4) interdit l\u2019admission de preuves qui, selon le droit de la preuve, sont confidentielles.

La plainte et le contexte\n[1] Avant toute chose, je tiens \u00e0 rendre hommage aux membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Mi\u2019kmaq (micmaque) et de la collectivit\u00e9 de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook. L\u2019audition de cette affaire s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur le territoire ancestral des Micmacs, pr\u00e8s de la collectivit\u00e9 de Millbrook, \u00e0 Truro, Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 impressionn\u00e9 par le fait, digne de mention \u00e0 mon avis, que les parties et les t\u00e9moins qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dont la plupart vivent ensemble dans la collectivit\u00e9 de Millbrook, se sont montr\u00e9s respectueux et cordiaux les uns envers les autres, m\u00eame au c\u0153ur d\u2019un conflit et d\u2019un litige. Leur conduite m\u2019appara\u00eet exemplaire et je les en f\u00e9licite. Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, lorsque je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook, je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation en tant qu\u2019employeur et non \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 dans son ensemble ni \u00e0 des membres particuliers de celle-ci.\n[2] La plaignante, Mme Stacey Lee Marshall Tabor, de la Premi\u00e8re Nation micmaque, est membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook. Elle vient d\u2019une famille de p\u00eacheurs et elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pratiquer la p\u00eache \u00e0 16 ans. Elle vient aussi d\u2019une famille qui a lutt\u00e9 pour faire valoir ses droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s. Donald Marshall, son oncle, a lutt\u00e9 pour faire valoir son droit issu de trait\u00e9s de pratiquer la p\u00eache. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 665 (CSC), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu que M. Marshall jouissait du droit de p\u00eacher des Micmacs \u00e0 des fins alimentaires et commerciales.\n[3] Comme son oncle, Mme Tabor d\u00e9fend ce en quoi elle croit. Elle a, elle aussi, exerc\u00e9 son droit issu de trait\u00e9s de p\u00eacher en se livrant parfois \u00e0 la pratique de la p\u00eache sans permis. Il ressort \u00e9galement de son t\u00e9moignage que la p\u00eache est sa passion. Elle tient \u00e0 pratiquer cette passion et elle souhaite un jour r\u00e9aliser son r\u00eave d\u2019\u00eatre capitaine d\u2019un bateau de p\u00eache. De fait, \u00e0 sa connaissance, elle est la premi\u00e8re femme membre d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation \u00e0 obtenir les qualifications requises pour \u00eatre capitaine de bateau de p\u00eache en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Cependant, comme bien des gens qui ont tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre les premiers \u00e0 faire quelque chose s\u2019en sont aper\u00e7us, il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de faire figure de pionnier. En d\u00e9pit de ses aspirations et de ses qualifications, Mme Tabor n\u2019a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 travailler qu\u2019\u00e0 quelques occasions comme matelot de pont et comme second pour la p\u00eacherie de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook.\n[4] Mme Tabor all\u00e8gue que depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook refuse de l\u2019embaucher dans sa p\u00eacherie parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. En particulier, elle affirme que Millbrook a refus\u00e9 de prendre en compte sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de capitaine dans sa p\u00eacherie en 2008. Elle soutient que sa situation illustre une pratique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la part de la Premi\u00e8re Nation consistant \u00e0 exclure les femmes de sa p\u00eacherie. Mme Tabor all\u00e8gue aussi que son exclusion de la capitainerie d\u2019un bateau de p\u00eache en 2008 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son \u00e9tat matrimonial parce que la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook a eu des probl\u00e8mes avec son mari quand ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 capitaine en 2007 et Millbrook aurait retenu ces probl\u00e8mes contre elle \u00e9galement. Mme Tabor all\u00e8gue que les actions de Millbrook constituent des pratiques discriminatoires au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[5] Pour sa part, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook nie les all\u00e9gations faites \u00e0 son encontre. Elle pr\u00e9tend que la candidature de Mme Tabor \u00e0 un poste de capitaine n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue en 2008 parce qu\u2019un autre candidat \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9. Elle nie aussi avoir pour pratique d\u2019exclure les femmes de sa p\u00eacherie.\n[6] Mme Tabor soutient qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle en violation de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles seront analys\u00e9es dans une d\u00e9cision distincte.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu toutes les parties et examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, les observations et les affidavits qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, je conclus au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte de Mme Tabor aux termes des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, pour les motifs qui suivent.\nII. Analyse de la plainte\nA. Cadre juridique\n[8] Dans une affaire de droits de la personne, il incombe au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. La preuve prima facie est \u00ab [\u2026] celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC), au paragraphe 28 (O\u2019Malley)).\n[9] Dans ses observations, Millbrook se concentre essentiellement sur sa d\u00e9cision de retenir un autre candidat que Mme Tabor lorsqu\u2019elle a postul\u00e9 en vue d\u2019obtenir un permis de capitaine en 2008. \u00c0 ce titre, Millbrook soutient que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Shakes c. Rex Pak Ltd., (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (Shakes) devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer si Mme Tabor a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie. Ces crit\u00e8res sont les suivants : (1) elle poss\u00e9dait les qualifications n\u00e9cessaires pour le poste; (2) elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e; et (3) l\u2019employeur a embauch\u00e9 une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui ne poss\u00e9dait pas la caract\u00e9ristique distinctive, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre une femme (voir Shakes, au paragraphe 8918).\n[10] Toutefois, dans la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, 2002 CanLII 23561 (TCDP), le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a dit :\n[77] Bien que les crit\u00e8res des affaires Shakes et Israeli soient des guides utiles, aucun des deux ne devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 automatiquement d'une mani\u00e8re rigide et arbitraire dans chaque affaire qui porte sur l'embauchage : il faut plut\u00f4t tenir compte des circonstances de chaque affaire pour \u00e9tablir si l'application de l'un ou l'autre des crit\u00e8res, en tout ou en partie, est pertinente. En bout de ligne, la question sera de savoir si M. Premakumar a r\u00e9pondu au crit\u00e8re O'Malley, c'est-\u00e0-dire : si on y ajoute foi, la preuve devant moi est-elle compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de M. Premakumar en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9e?\n(voir aussi Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, aux paragraphes 17 et 18; et Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), 2005 CAF 154, aux paragraphes 24 \u00e0 30)\n[11] Je souscris \u00e0 cette position et j\u2019estime qu\u2019il serait mal avis\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Shakes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par leur nature, les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte ont une port\u00e9e plus \u00e9tendue et ne se limitent pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision particuli\u00e8re prise en 2008 de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer un autre candidat \u00e0 Mme Tabor pour le r\u00f4le de capitaine. Mme Tabor all\u00e8gue qu\u2019avant 2008 et de fa\u00e7on continue, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook avait pour pratique syst\u00e9mique de refuser aux femmes, y compris elle-m\u00eame, des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans sa p\u00eacherie. En outre, c\u2019est Millbrook qui pr\u00e9cise que la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 l\u2019embauche d\u2019un capitaine en 2008 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une comparaison des qualifications que poss\u00e9daient Mme Tabor et le candidat retenu. Dans sa plainte et dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Tabor affirme ne pas avoir re\u00e7u en 2008 une telle explication de la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook relative \u00e0 l\u2019embauche d\u2019un capitaine.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, en appliquant les crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans O\u2019Malley au contexte qui nous occupe, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, Mme Tabor devait montrer qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination (article 3 de la LCDP); qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu refuser un emploi ou d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi (article 7 ou alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP); et que la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ont constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le refus de l\u2019employeur (alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP) ou dans la pratique qui l\u2019a priv\u00e9e de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi (alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP) (voir Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33 (Moore)).\n[13] Lorsqu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, un intim\u00e9 peut s\u2019\u00e9viter une conclusion d\u00e9favorable en soumettant une preuve pour montrer que ses actions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires ou en se pr\u00e9valant d\u2019un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui justifie la discrimination. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Millbrook a soumis une preuve pour tenter de montrer que ses actions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires. Par cons\u00e9quent, il lui incombait de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une conclusion d\u00e9favorable (Peel Law Association c. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, au paragraphe 68 (Pieters)). Cependant, le fardeau ultime de la preuve continuait d\u2019incomber \u00e0 Mme Tabor d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la preuve produite par Millbrook \u00e9tait fausse ou constituait un pr\u00e9texte (voir Pieters, au paragraphe 74).\n[14] En outre, il convient de ne pas oublier que la discrimination n\u2019est habituellement pas exerc\u00e9e ouvertement et, cela \u00e9tant, qu\u2019il est souvent difficile de la prouver en se fondant sur une preuve directe. La t\u00e2che du Tribunal consiste donc \u00e0 tenir compte de toutes les circonstances et de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est possible de d\u00e9tecter \u00ab de subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb (voir Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP)). Comme la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, [traduction] \u00ab [o]n peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se \u00bb (B\u00e9atrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1987), p. 142).\n[15] Enfin, il n'est pas essentiel que des consid\u00e9rations d'ordre discriminatoire soient les seuls motifs des actes en cause pour que la plainte soit accueillie. Il est suffisant qu\u2019une consid\u00e9ration d\u2019ordre discriminatoire soit l\u2019un des facteurs dans les actes en cause (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.), au paragraphe 7).\nB. La preuve de Mme Tabor\n[16] Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements donnant lieu \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Tabor s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, essentiellement de 1996 \u00e0 2008. La preuve soumise \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa plainte peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9e dans les cat\u00e9gories suivantes : (i) remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes sur les femmes; (ii) difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du financement pour suivre la formation de capitaine; (iii) exp\u00e9rience de travail avec Millbrook et sa p\u00eacherie de 2000 \u00e0 2006; (iv) la saison de la p\u00eache au homard 2007; (v) le permis de capitaine en 2008; et (vi) l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019autres femmes au sein de l\u2019administration et de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. En ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie, voici mes conclusions de fait relatives \u00e0 chacune de ces cat\u00e9gories de preuve, sauf indication contraire.\n[17] Au vu de la preuve, je conclus que Mme Tabor a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, pour les motifs combin\u00e9s du sexe et de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial.\n(i) Remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes sur les femmes\n[18] Mme Tabor a commenc\u00e9 son exp\u00e9rience de travail pour Millbrook en 1996. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle \u00e9tait une \u00e9tudiante travaillant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 comme garde-p\u00eache. Sur les quatre gardes-p\u00eache qui travaillaient pour Millbrook cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, Mme Tabor \u00e9tait la seule femme. Elle d\u00e9crit le milieu de travail comme \u00e9tant sexiste et chauvin.\n[19] C\u2019est alors que M. Alex Cope, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et toujours administrateur de la bande pour la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook et conseiller \u00e9lu de la bande, a fait pour la premi\u00e8re fois des remarques sur le r\u00f4le des femmes dans la p\u00eacherie. M. Cope a dit que le seul endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019on devrait trouver des seins de femme sur un bateau \u00e9tait sur la proue, comme figure de proue. M. Cope a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 la remarque lors d\u2019un d\u00eener chez Mme Tabor, devant ses invit\u00e9s, en 2005. \u00c0 cette occasion, la remarque s\u2019adressait explicitement \u00e0 Mme Tabor.\n[20] Craig Tabor, le mari de la plaignante, a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor lorsqu\u2019il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors de la soir\u00e9e chez les Tabor en 2005 et qu\u2019il y a entendu M. Cope faire la m\u00eame remarque.\n(ii) Difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du financement pour suivre la formation de capitaine\n[21] En 1998, Mme Tabor voulait suivre une formation pour devenir capitaine. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de suivre un cours en vue d\u2019obtenir le brevet de capitaine avec restrictions, une forme de formation et d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation comme capitaine, \u00e0 la School of Fisheries du Nova Scotia Community College \u00e0 Pictou, en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Elle a appris que des hommes de Millbrook suivaient le cours et que la Premi\u00e8re Nation finan\u00e7ait leur formation. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Millbrook pour obtenir du financement en vue de suivre la formation, elle a essuy\u00e9 un refus et s\u2019est fait dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus de place \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.\n[22] Malgr\u00e9 ce refus, Mme Tabor a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole et a appris qu\u2019il restait une place. Elle s\u2019est inscrite au cours pour l\u2019obtention du brevet de capitaine avec restrictions un vendredi et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter l\u2019\u00e9cole le lundi suivant.\n[23] Mme Tabor a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Cope \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9 contre elle parce qu\u2019elle allait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole et il lui a dit, au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre l\u00e0 car elle prenait la place d\u2019une autre personne. Elle a tent\u00e9 plusieurs fois de savoir qui \u00e9tait cette personne dont elle aurait pris la place, sans succ\u00e8s. En outre, elle ne se souvient pas d\u2019avoir vu beaucoup de membres de la collectivit\u00e9 de Millbrook parmi les participants au cours. Dans ses souvenirs, seulement deux autres membres de la collectivit\u00e9 de Millbrook suivaient le cours.\n[24] Vers la fin du cours, Mme Tabor a communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Clara Gloade, une ancienne conseill\u00e8re de bande de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook et membre de la Native Women\u2019s Association of Nova Scotia (l\u2019Association), afin de se renseigner sur d\u2019autres possibilit\u00e9s de financement pour sa formation sur les p\u00eaches. Mme Gloade a soutenu Mme Tabor dans son d\u00e9sir de suivre une formation sur les p\u00eaches et lui a offert un emploi \u00e0 l\u2019Association pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 payer ses frais de scolarit\u00e9.\n[25] Mme Gloade a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Elle a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir du financement pour le cours de Mme Tabor en soulevant la question aupr\u00e8s du chef et du conseil de Millbrook, sans succ\u00e8s. Mme Gloade est d\u2019avis que Millbrook \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 financer le cours de Mme Tabor parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. En cons\u00e9quence, et comme elle tenait \u00e0 aider Mme Tabor \u00e0 suivre une formation pour r\u00e9aliser son ambition de devenir capitaine, Mme Gloade a aid\u00e9 Mme Tabor \u00e0 obtenir un emploi \u00e0 l\u2019Association afin de l\u2019aider \u00e0 payer ses frais de scolarit\u00e9.\n[26] Le dernier jour de sa formation, Mme Tabor a appris que Millbrook financerait son cours au bout du compte. Mme Tabor a termin\u00e9 le cours pour l\u2019obtention du brevet de capitaine avec restrictions avec succ\u00e8s, notamment en satisfaisant \u00e0 une exigence minimale relative au temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 p\u00eacher en mer.\n(iii) Exp\u00e9rience de travail avec Millbrook et sa p\u00eacherie de 2000 \u00e0 2006\n[27] La p\u00eacherie de Millbrook p\u00eache diff\u00e9rentes esp\u00e8ces marines. En grande partie, ses prises sont constitu\u00e9es de homards, de crabes nordiques et de crabes des neiges. La saison de la p\u00eache au homard s\u2019\u00e9tend habituellement du d\u00e9but de mai \u00e0 la fin de juillet, suivie de la saison du crabe des neiges qui s\u2019\u00e9tend habituellement de la fin de juin au mois de septembre.\n[28] Apr\u00e8s sa formation \u00e0 la School of Fisheries, Mme Tabor a obtenu diff\u00e9rents postes de marin en dehors de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Millbrook en 2000. Dans son premier poste, elle devait \u00ab faire du cordage \u00bb, une forme de pr\u00e9paration du mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache qui se fait \u00e0 terre.\n[29] En 2001 et en 2002, Mme Tabor a travaill\u00e9 comme matelot de pont pour la p\u00eache au homard au large de Pictou Landing. Ses t\u00e2ches comprenaient les travaux de pont ordinaires, comme p\u00eacher et trier le homard, app\u00e2ter les casiers et peindre des bou\u00e9es.\n[30] Apr\u00e8s la saison du homard de 2002, Mme Tabor a fait part \u00e0 Adrian Gloade, le gestionnaire de la p\u00eacherie de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook, de son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 participer \u00e9galement \u00e0 la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges. Cette p\u00eache est plus exigeante que la p\u00eache au homard puisque le bateau sort plus loin en mer et pendant de plus longues p\u00e9riodes, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral deux \u00e0 trois jours, mais elle est aussi plus lucrative. Mme Tabor s\u2019est fait dire qu\u2019elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas assez d\u2019exp\u00e9rience pour p\u00eacher le crabe des neiges. Cependant, vers la fin de juin 2002, M. Tabor a re\u00e7u un appel d\u2019Adrian Gloade qui lui offrait un poste de matelot de pont sur un bateau de p\u00eache au crabe des neiges. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Tabor n\u2019avait aucune exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache pour la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Sa seule exp\u00e9rience de travail pour la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook \u00e0 ce stade, une exp\u00e9rience acquise plus t\u00f4t en 2002, consistait \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache et \u00e0 peindre des bou\u00e9es.\n[31] Plus tard en septembre 2002, tandis que Mme et M. Tabor passaient en voiture devant le bureau de la bande, M. Cope a fait signe au couple de s\u2019arr\u00eater et il leur a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait besoin de leur aide pour sortir p\u00eacher le crabe des neiges. Selon les Tabor, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il y avait une p\u00e9nurie de p\u00eacheurs parce que plusieurs p\u00eacheurs faisaient la gr\u00e8ve et refusaient de p\u00eacher. Les Tabor ont accept\u00e9 de p\u00eacher le reste de la saison du crabe des neiges de 2002 et Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e comme second sur un bateau qui p\u00eachait au large de Port Bickerton. Un second assume plus de responsabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019un matelot de pont, notamment superviser l\u2019\u00e9quipage et diriger le bateau lorsque le capitaine n\u2019est pas disponible. Le poste n\u00e9cessite plus de formation et d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mer que celui de matelot de pont.\n[32] Trois semaines apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de son affectation comme second, Mme Tabor a inform\u00e9 Adrian Gloade qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte de cinq semaines. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 p\u00eacher pendant la saison du crabe des neiges 2002 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle ressente des douleurs \u00e0 l\u2019estomac apr\u00e8s un \u00e9pisode au cours duquel la mer \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement agit\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019arr\u00eater de p\u00eacher pour la saison pour prot\u00e9ger sa grossesse.\n[33] Le 14 mars 2003, Mme Tabor a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 un gar\u00e7on.\n[34] Vers juillet ou ao\u00fbt 2003, Mme Tabor a appel\u00e9 Adrian Gloade en vue d\u2019obtenir un autre poste \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. Comme un bateau de p\u00eache au crabe des neiges \u00e9tait \u00e0 court de membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage, Mme Tabor a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 une \u00ab sortie \u00bb. Une \u00ab sortie \u00bb est la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend du moment o\u00f9 le navire quitte le quai pour aller en mer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son retour \u00e0 terre. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, dans le cas de la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges, une sortie pouvait durer quelques jours. Malheureusement, durant la sortie en 2003, Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e et, par la suite, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait plus disponible pour p\u00eacher pour le reste de la saison 2003.\n[35] D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de Mme Tabor, pour poser sa candidature comme p\u00eacheur pour la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, on doit appeler le bureau de la bande ou s\u2019y pr\u00e9senter, ou parler \u00e0 Adrian Gloade. Le d\u00e9partement des p\u00eaches d\u00e9cide ensuite d\u2019offrir ou non un poste au candidat. Il n\u2019y a pas de processus formel de demande ni de formulaire \u00e0 remplir. C\u2019\u00e9tait aussi l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Tabor. Comme il l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, c\u2019est la proc\u00e9dure informelle, mais habituelle \u00e0 suivre pour quiconque souhaite obtenir un travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie.\n[36] De 2004 \u00e0 2006, Mme Tabor a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises d\u2019obtenir du travail pour p\u00eacher pour Millbrook en appelant le bureau de la bande ou en s\u2019y pr\u00e9sentant en personne. Malgr\u00e9 son brevet de capitaine avec restrictions et son exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache, elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir du travail. Lorsqu\u2019elle demandait du travail, on la traitait avec m\u00e9pris.\n[37] Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, et comme elle ne pouvait obtenir de travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, elle a fini par abandonner ses tentatives en vue de travailler \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. Elle s\u2019est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation de son enfant et a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres m\u00e9tiers que la p\u00eache, notamment la fabrication de casiers \u00e0 homard pour Millbrook en 2004.\n[38] Mme Loretta Bernard, une ancienne conseill\u00e8re de bande et ancienne r\u00e9ceptionniste pour Millbrook, a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal et corrobor\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit que fait Mme Tabor de ses tentatives pour obtenir un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Tabor avait appel\u00e9 le bureau de la bande et s\u2019y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour demander du travail sur les bateaux de p\u00eache. Les repr\u00e9sentants de Millbrook n\u2019ont pas pris Mme Tabor au s\u00e9rieux. Mme Bernard a d\u00e9crit leur comportement : ils auraient roul\u00e9 des yeux, fait des blagues sur Mme Tabor et fait des remarques sur la place des femmes dans la collectivit\u00e9, notamment qu\u2019elles devraient rester \u00e0 la maison avec leurs enfants.\n(iv) Saison de la p\u00eache au homard de 2007\n[39] M. Tabor a aussi travaill\u00e9 pour la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Son premier travail, en avril 2002, consistait \u00e0 peindre des bou\u00e9es et \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel avant la saison de la p\u00eache. De fait, c\u2019est en avril 2002 qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Tabor et travaill\u00e9 avec elle. Elle lui a alors montr\u00e9 \u00e0 fabriquer les casiers \u00e0 homard et \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel pour la p\u00eache au homard. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, M. Tabor s\u2019est ensuite fait offrir un poste de matelot de pont pour la saison de la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges de 2002, sa seule exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9alable de la p\u00eache se r\u00e9sumant \u00e0 avoir peint des bou\u00e9es et pr\u00e9par\u00e9 du mat\u00e9riel plus t\u00f4t la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. M. Tabor a encore travaill\u00e9 comme matelot de pont durant les saisons de la p\u00eache au homard et au crabe des neiges de 2003. En 2004, Adrian Gloade lui a propos\u00e9 de suivre son cours de capitaine m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas accumul\u00e9 le temps requis en mer pour ce faire. Il a suivi sa formation de capitaine en 2004, mais il ne d\u00e9tenait pas de certificat de secourisme ni le temps en mer minimum exig\u00e9 pour obtenir son brevet de capitaine, quatri\u00e8me classe. Malgr\u00e9 tout, il a agi comme second avec encadrement durant les saisons 2004 et 2005 et p\u00each\u00e9 le homard et le crabe des neiges. Pour les saisons de la p\u00eache au homard 2006 et 2007, M. Tabor s\u2019est vu octroyer un permis de capitaine sur le Chief Rachael Marshall, qui p\u00eachait au large de Lismore. Il s\u2019est vu offrir le poste de capitaine sans avoir postul\u00e9. Il a fini par obtenir son certificat de secourisme et il a re\u00e7u son brevet de capitaine, quatri\u00e8me classe, en 2009.\n[40] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, M. Tabor a corrobor\u00e9 l\u2019affirmation de Mme Tabor selon laquelle pour obtenir un travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie, il suffisait d\u2019exprimer son int\u00e9r\u00eat en t\u00e9l\u00e9phonant \u00e0 Adrian Gloade ou de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil et exprimer son int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogues effectu\u00e9s par Millbrook pour ceux qui voulaient p\u00eacher. Les tests sont habituellement offerts vers mars ou avril et tous les p\u00eacheurs doivent s\u2019y soumettre avant le d\u00e9but de la saison de la p\u00eache. Une deuxi\u00e8me possibilit\u00e9 de subir le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogue est offerte \u00e0 ceux qui \u00e9chouent au premier test. Selon M. Tabor, il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogue qu\u2019il en a r\u00e9ussis, mais il a quand m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 p\u00eacher. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Tabor a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tabor sur ce point.\n[41] Le capitaine choisit habituellement son \u00e9quipage et M. Tabor voulait embaucher Mme Tabor comme matelot de pont sur le Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007. Il s\u2019est toutefois heurt\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sistance de Millbrook sur ce point. Apr\u00e8s avoir beaucoup insist\u00e9, M. Tabor a pu int\u00e9grer Mme Tabor \u00e0 son \u00e9quipage. C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que Mme Tabor travaillait pour la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, sur un bateau de p\u00eache, depuis 2003. Au bout du compte, elle a dirig\u00e9 le bateau pour la plus grande partie de la saison de la p\u00eache au homard de 2007.\n[42] \u00c0 la fin de la saison de p\u00eache au homard de 2007, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tabor de sortir p\u00eacher le crabe des neiges pour Millbrook sur un autre bateau. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique habituelle, il a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u00e9cher le mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache du Chief Rachael Marshall sur le quai pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019il moisisse lors de son entreposage ult\u00e9rieur. Le mat\u00e9riel est rest\u00e9 sur le quai quelques semaines. Le s\u00e9chage du mat\u00e9riel a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus long qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019habitude puisqu\u2019il avait plu la premi\u00e8re semaine. M. Tabor a aussi conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que le mat\u00e9riel est rest\u00e9 sur le quai plus longtemps que d\u2019habitude parce qu\u2019il p\u00eachait le crabe des neiges. Pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en mer pour p\u00eacher le crabe des neiges, Millbrook a embauch\u00e9 du personnel pour enlever le mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache du quai et en a d\u00e9duit les co\u00fbts des gains que M. Tabor avait accumul\u00e9s en p\u00eachant pour Millbrook en 2007.\n[43] Dans le pass\u00e9, Millbrook avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019aide de M. Tabor pour enlever du mat\u00e9riel du quai pour d\u2019autres p\u00eacheurs et il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 pour cette t\u00e2che. Selon M. Tabor, il est de pratique courante \u00e0 Millbrook pour les p\u00eacheurs de s\u2019entraider et il ne comprend pas pourquoi Millbrook a d\u00fb payer des gens pour enlever son mat\u00e9riel en 2007.\n[44] Il y a aussi eu un d\u00e9saccord entre Millbrook et M. Tabor concernant les ventes de homard provenant du Chief Rachael Marshall. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, il y avait un manque \u00e0 gagner entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Tabor et les ventes de homard de son bateau. M. Tabor affirme qu\u2019il y a des \u00e9carts dans la comptabilit\u00e9 de Millbrook et que certaines ventes de homard n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es comme il se devait \u00e0 son bateau.\n[45] En 2007, M. Tabor a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause dans une poursuite aux petites cr\u00e9ances intent\u00e9e par Frank Gloade, son ancien matelot de pont dans la saison 2006. En 2006, Millbrook avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Frank Gloade de laisser l\u2019\u00e9quipage de M. Tabor avant la fin de la saison pour aller p\u00eacher le crabe des neiges pour Millbrook sur un autre bateau. En cons\u00e9quence, M. Tabor avait refus\u00e9 de payer Frank Gloade pour la partie de la saison de p\u00eache au cours de laquelle ce dernier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autre bateau. Frank Gloade a poursuivi M. Tabor \u00e0 la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances pour rupture de contrat. Millbrook a appuy\u00e9 Frank Gloade dans la poursuite.\n[46] Apr\u00e8s la poursuite aux petites cr\u00e9ances, vers ao\u00fbt 2007, M. Cope a dit \u00e0 M. Tabor qu\u2019il ne p\u00eacherait ou ne travaillerait jamais plus pour Millbrook \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit. M. Tabor n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 pour Millbrook depuis. Malgr\u00e9 le litige avec Millbrook sur l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et les ventes en 2007, M. Tabor croit que c\u2019est la poursuite aux petites cr\u00e9ances qui a pouss\u00e9 M. Cope \u00e0 lui dire qu\u2019il ne travaillerait jamais plus pour Millbrook.\n(v) Permis de capitaine en 2008\n[47] Par suite de son exp\u00e9rience comme matelot de pont en 2007, et voyant que M. Tabor ne retournait pas travailler \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie, Mme Tabor souhaitait reprendre le permis pour le Chief Rachael Marshall pour la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2008. Au d\u00e9but de janvier 2008 ou autour de cette date, elle et M. Tabor ont pris contact avec M. Cope pour discuter du probl\u00e8me relatif aux ventes de homard de la saison 2007. Au cours de cette conversation, Mme Tabor a exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Cope son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le permis de capitaine du Chief Rachael Marshall en vue de la prochaine saison de p\u00eache au homard.\n[48] Le 8 janvier 2008, Mme Tabor s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil de bande, \u00e0 laquelle assistaient M. Cope et Adrian Gloade. Elle y a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le permis de capitaine du Chief Rachael Marshall.\n[49] En janvier ou en f\u00e9vrier 2008, au cours d\u2019une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, Mme Tabor a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Adrian Gloade en utilisant la fonction mains libres en pr\u00e9sence de M. Tabor. M. Gloade l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que malgr\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat, Millbrook avait attribu\u00e9 le permis de capitaine du Chief Rachael Marshall \u00e0 Frank Gloade. Durant cette conversation, alors qu\u2019elle insistait pour conna\u00eetre les raisons pour lesquelles elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 choisie pour le permis de capitaine, Mme Tabor dit qu\u2019Adrian Gloade s\u2019est montr\u00e9 \u00e9vasif, disant que le comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches avait pris en compte sa candidature pour un permis, mais qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab d\u00e9marqu\u00e9e \u00bb. Quand Mme Tabor lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait imminente, Adrian Gloade lui aurait dit que le comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches avait d\u00fb se presser pour attribuer les permis en raison d\u2019une r\u00e9union prochaine avec le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans. M. Tabor a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor concernant la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Adrian Gloade et le fait qu\u2019elle a appris \u00e0 cette occasion qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas obtenu le permis, puisque celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Frank Gloade.\n[50] En cons\u00e9quence, Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas obtenu de permis de capitaine pour la saison de la p\u00eache au homard 2008.\n(vi) Exp\u00e9rience d\u2019autres femmes \u00e0 l\u2019administration et \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook\n[51] Mme Tabor a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019au meilleur de ses connaissances, aucune femme n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 capitaine \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. En outre, tr\u00e8s peu de femmes travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie et celles qui le font occupent des postes subalternes, habituellement \u00e0 terre, ou ex\u00e9cutent des t\u00e2ches administratives. Mme Tabor se sent f\u00e2ch\u00e9e, bless\u00e9e, frustr\u00e9e, humili\u00e9e, bris\u00e9e, g\u00ean\u00e9e et parfois d\u00e9prim\u00e9e que sa propre Premi\u00e8re Nation l\u2019exclut de sa p\u00eacherie. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que tout ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu et qui donne lieu \u00e0 sa plainte l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9e \u00ab d\u00e9motiv\u00e9e \u00bb et qu\u2019elle est \u00e9puis\u00e9e de devoir sans cesse se prouver \u00e0 des gens qui ne veulent pas la consid\u00e9rer.\n[52] Mme Gloade a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de son exp\u00e9rience comme conseill\u00e8re de bande pour la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook pendant pr\u00e8s de 20 ans. \u00c0 de nombreuses reprises, elle a soulev\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes que vivent les femmes de l\u2019endroit aupr\u00e8s du conseil de bande. Elle a dit avoir toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en minorit\u00e9 lors de votes sur des questions relatives \u00e0 la condition f\u00e9minine au conseil de bande. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ses observations et son exp\u00e9rience au sein du conseil de bande, elle croit que les femmes, Mme Tabor y compris, re\u00e7oivent un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui des hommes \u00e0 Millbrook.\n[53] S\u2019appuyant sur son exp\u00e9rience comme conseill\u00e8re de bande pendant plus de 14 ans et comme r\u00e9ceptionniste pour Millbrook pendant environ 9 ans, Mme Bernard a aussi corrobor\u00e9 les affirmations de Mme Gloade concernant les femmes dans la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook. Mme Bernard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les femmes sont trait\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment des hommes et que de nombreux dirigeants et conseillers de la collectivit\u00e9 croient que les femmes ne devraient pas travailler et qu\u2019elles devraient rester chez elles avec leurs enfants. Selon elle, cette attitude est courante \u00e0 Millbrook. Mme Bernard ajoute qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance, tr\u00e8s peu de femmes travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook et celles qui le font travaillent essentiellement dans des postes subalternes au bureau ou \u00e0 l\u2019app\u00e2tage des casiers sur le quai.\nC. La preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie\n[54] Mme et M. Tabor ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pendant plusieurs heures, mais ils ont r\u00e9pondu aux questions de fa\u00e7on succincte et sans h\u00e9sitation. Plus important encore, leur t\u00e9moignage concordait avec les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte et dans leurs affidavits, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 lors du contre-interrogatoire. M. Tabor a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avec un degr\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de d\u00e9tail qui a corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor. Bien qu\u2019il soit le mari de Mme Tabor, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de croire que M. Tabor t\u00e9moignait de fa\u00e7on int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa femme. Dans l\u2019ensemble, j\u2019estime que les t\u00e9moignages de Mme et de M. Tabor sont cr\u00e9dibles et fiables.\n[55] Mme Gloade et Mme Bernard ont aussi corrobor\u00e9 le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor concernant le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux femmes \u00e0 Millbrook et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie.\n[56] Lorsqu\u2019elle est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un tout, la preuve soumise \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la plainte de Mme Tabor r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue une tendance selon laquelle elle s\u2019est vu refuser des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Cela commence par les remarques formul\u00e9es par M. Cope, une autorit\u00e9 et un d\u00e9cideur en vue dans la communaut\u00e9. Les remarques de M. Cope peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices de l\u2019attitude de Millbrook envers l\u2019embauche de femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. Conjugu\u00e9e \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9 que Mme Tabor a \u00e9prouv\u00e9e \u00e0 obtenir du financement pour suivre sa formation de capitaine, l\u2019odeur subtile de la discrimination commence \u00e0 se faire sentir.\n[57] Malgr\u00e9 sa formation et son exp\u00e9rience, notamment l\u2019obtention d\u2019un brevet de capitaine en remplissant toutes les exigences connexes relatives \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mer et \u00e0 d\u2019autres certifications, Mme Tabor n\u2019atteint que le rang de second \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Sa seule saison comme second survient en 2002 lors d\u2019une p\u00e9nurie de p\u00eacheurs. Sinon, de 2000 \u00e0 2003, Mme Tabor travaille essentiellement comme matelot de pont \u00e0 quelques occasions.\n[58] De 2004 \u00e0 2006, m\u00eame si Mme Tabor prend contact avec le bureau de la bande et Adrian Gloade \u00e0 plusieurs reprises par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et en personne afin d\u2019obtenir un travail pour participer \u00e0 la p\u00eache, elle ne peut obtenir de travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Mme Bernard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les repr\u00e9sentants de Millbrook n\u2019ont pas pris les demandes d\u2019emploi de Mme Tabor \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie au s\u00e9rieux parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. Cela corrobore de nouveau la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire de l\u2019attitude de Millbrook envers l\u2019embauche de femmes pour p\u00eacher \u00e0 sa p\u00eacherie.\n[59] Par contraste avec Mme Tabor, M. Tabor commence \u00e0 p\u00eacher pour Millbrook \u00e0 la demande d\u2019Adrian Gloade et obtient un travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie sans probl\u00e8me, notamment un travail r\u00e9gulier dans les saisons de la p\u00eache au homard et de la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges chaque ann\u00e9e. Adrian Gloade lui propose m\u00eame de suivre sa formation de capitaine. Une fois que M. Tabor termine sa formation de capitaine, et m\u00eame s\u2019il ne satisfait pas \u00e0 toutes les exigences pour obtenir son brevet de capitaine, il prend rapidement du galon, devenant capitaine en 2006, et ce, m\u00eame sans en avoir fait la demande et m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 des tests de d\u00e9pistage de drogues.\n[60] En 2007, \u00e0 sa deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e comme capitaine, M. Tabor tente d\u2019embaucher Mme Tabor au sein de son \u00e9quipage. Il faut un grand travail de persuasion de sa part pour que Millbrook y consente. \u00c0 la fin de la saison du homard 2007, des d\u00e9saccords surgissent entre M. Tabor et Millbrook sur l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et les ventes, de m\u00eame qu\u2019une poursuite \u00e0 la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances. Il r\u00e9sulte de cette poursuite que M. Tabor se fait dire qu\u2019il ne travaillerait jamais plus pour Millbrook. De fait, il n\u2019est plus retourn\u00e9 travailler pour Millbrook depuis.\n[61] Tous ces faits se terminent par la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook de ne pas accorder de permis de capitaine \u00e0 Mme Tabor en 2008. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, m\u00eame si elle a fait conna\u00eetre ses intentions, Millbrook n\u2019a m\u00eame jamais pris en compte sa candidature pour le r\u00f4le de capitaine. Cela concorde avec le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor concernant la fa\u00e7on dont Millbrook avait trait\u00e9 ses autres demandes de travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de 2004 \u00e0 2006. Cela concorde aussi avec d\u2019autres t\u00e9moignages de Mme Tabor concernant l\u2019attitude de Millbrook envers le travail des femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie.\n[62] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les faits prima facie aboutissant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de 2008, je suis convaincu, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, que le sexe \u00e9tait au moins un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de refuser \u00e0 Mme Tabor le permis de capitaine. Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve prima facie aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[63] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, je suis aussi convaincu que le fait que Mme Tabor est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook de ne pas lui accorder un permis de capitaine en 2008. Le motif de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial englobe la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re du conjoint ou d\u2019un membre de la famille (voir B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66). \u00c0 mon avis, il y a un lien prima facie entre les probl\u00e8mes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de rendement que Millbrook a eus lorsque M. Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 capitaine en 2007; la poursuite aux petites cr\u00e9ances en 2007; l\u2019affirmation de M. Tabor selon laquelle il s\u2019est fait dire qu\u2019il ne travaillerait jamais plus pour Millbrook; et le fait que la candidature de Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte pour un r\u00f4le de capitaine en 2008. Vu la s\u00e9quence et la proximit\u00e9 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements entre 2006 et 2008 et la r\u00e9ticence de Millbrook \u00e0 autoriser M. Tabor \u00e0 embaucher Mme Tabor en 2007, j\u2019estime qu\u2019une preuve suffisante m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise pour justifier une explication de Millbrook \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. Je suis donc convaincu qu\u2019une preuve prima facie aux termes de l\u2019article 7, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[64] Enfin, le t\u00e9moignage conjugu\u00e9 de Mmes Tabor, Gloade et Bernard sur ce qu\u2019elles ont v\u00e9cu au sein de l\u2019administration et de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook me porte \u00e0 croire, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, que ce que Mme Tabor a v\u00e9cu peut \u00eatre r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019une pratique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les femmes sont priv\u00e9es de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor sur les remarques formul\u00e9es envers les femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie et sa difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, de pair avec les t\u00e9moignages de Mmes Gloade et Bernard concernant le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor; comment la condition f\u00e9minine n\u2019est pas prise au s\u00e9rieux par Millbrook; le fait que tr\u00e8s peu de femmes travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie; et que celles qui le font n\u2019obtiennent que des postes subalternes, me convainc qu\u2019une preuve prima facie, aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie sur le motif du sexe.\nD. R\u00e9ponse de la Premi\u00e8re Nation Millbrook \u00e0 la plainte\n[65] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, Millbrook a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves pour tenter de montrer que ses gestes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires. Elle s\u2019est attaqu\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la preuve de Mme Tabor : (i) les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes envers les femmes; (ii) la difficult\u00e9 de Mme Tabor \u00e0 obtenir du financement pour sa formation de capitaine; (iii) l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de Mme Tabor avec Millbrook et sa p\u00eacherie de 2003 \u00e0 2006; (iv) la saison du homard 2007; (v) le permis de capitaine en 2008; et (vi) l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019autres femmes au sein de l\u2019administration et de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook.\n[66] De la r\u00e9ponse initiale de Millbrook \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte soumise \u00e0 la Commission en 2008; au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ses affidavits aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal; et enfin \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sentation de t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l\u2019audition de cette affaire, les explications de Millbrook relatives aux actes donnant lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte n\u2019ont cess\u00e9 de changer et d\u2019\u00e9voluer. Je soulignerai diff\u00e9rentes incoh\u00e9rences dans la position et la preuve de Millbrook dans les pages ci-apr\u00e8s. Dans l\u2019ensemble, j\u2019estime que la preuve de Millbrook n\u2019est ni convaincante ni fiable et n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte. Apr\u00e8s avoir soigneusement examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve de Millbrook et l\u2019avoir mesur\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Tabor, sur la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que Millbrook a exerc\u00e9 une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Tabor.\n(i) Remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes envers les femmes\n[67] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation voulant qu\u2019il avait fait des remarques selon lesquelles la seule place pour les seins d\u2019une femme sur un bateau \u00e9tait \u00e0 la proue, comme figure de proue, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cope ne concordait pas avec le contenu de son affidavit.\n[68] Dans son affidavit, il a jur\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais fait cette remarque en 1996. En ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation voulant que la remarque ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e en 2005, M. Cope a jur\u00e9 dans son affidavit qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Tabor qui avait fait cette remarque \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Il a ajout\u00e9 que cela l\u2019attristait que M. Tabor lui attribue maintenant la remarque pour servir la plainte de Mme Tabor.\n[69] Lors de son interrogatoire principal, M. Cope a confirm\u00e9 les affirmations faites dans son affidavit. Cependant, lors du contre-interrogatoire, on lui a fait part de la r\u00e9ponse initiale de Millbrook \u00e0 la plainte soumise \u00e0 la Commission, r\u00e9ponse produite par le conseil de Millbrook et dat\u00e9e du 2 septembre 2008 qui se lit en partie comme suit :\n[traduction]\nAlex Cope reconna\u00eet avoir fait la remarque concernant la proue du bateau, mais il l\u2019avait fait en plaisantant avec le mari de Mme Tabor, Craig Tabor, son neveu.\n[70] M. Cope a alors expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait avoir fait la remarque \u00e0 la blague, avec d\u2019autres personnes qui tenaient des propos similaires. Selon lui, c\u2019\u00e9tait une vieille blague qui ne visait pas directement Mme Tabor.\n[71] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cope sur ce point n\u2019\u00e9tait ni convaincant ni fiable. Il est clair que les remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que M. Cope en dit, c\u2019\u00e9tait une \u00ab vieille blague \u00bb et d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve prima facie de Mme et de M. Tabor, je conclus que les remarques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es \u00e0 plus d\u2019une occasion. Le fait que la d\u00e9claration de septembre 2008 mentionne que les remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 M. Tabor me porte aussi \u00e0 accepter le t\u00e9moignage de Mme et de M. Tabor selon lequel les remarques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Tabor en 2005.\n(ii) La difficult\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir du financement pour la formation de capitaine\n[72] Dans son affidavit, M. Cope a dit que Millbrook \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 payer la formation de capitaine de Mme Tabor parce qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 inscrite au cours en 1997, sans le terminer. Toutefois, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a expliqu\u00e9 que Millbrook avait au d\u00e9part offert le cours \u00e0 dix personnes. Mme Tabor n\u2019avait eu vent de la formation qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que les places avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies; et Millbrook n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9e au d\u00e9part \u00e0 financer sa place parce qu\u2019elle avait contourn\u00e9 la bande en s\u2019adressant directement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole pour faire ouvrir une autre place. Cela a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une place de plus que ce que Millbrook \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 financer. Adrian Gloade a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Tabor n\u2019avait manifest\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la formation qu\u2019une fois que les places \u00e9taient remplies et qu\u2019elle avait communiqu\u00e9 directement avec l\u2019\u00e9cole et obtenu l\u2019ouverture d\u2019une place pour elle.\n[73] Sur ce point, Millbrook a aussi contest\u00e9 la fiabilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Clara Gloade concernant la difficult\u00e9 de Mme Tabor \u00e0 obtenir du financement pour sa formation de capitaine. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le souvenir que Mme Gloade a des gens et des \u00e9v\u00e9nements n\u2019est pas fid\u00e8le. Millbrook a aussi fait remarquer que Mme Gloade avait consacr\u00e9 sa vie \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre la condition des femmes des Premi\u00e8res Nations en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse; par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant d\u2019entendre comment elle d\u00e9crit la situation des femmes des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 Millbrook. Selon Millbrook, il serait contradictoire qu\u2019une personne dont l\u2019essence m\u00eame et toute la carri\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 concentr\u00e9es sur le sort des femmes autochtones en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse laisse entendre une situation moindre que ce qu\u2019elle avait laiss\u00e9 entendre au sujet de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook.\n[74] Je conviens que les souvenirs de Mme Gloade se sont estomp\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle ne se souvient pas de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements et de certaines personnes, mais selon moi, cela n\u2019entache pas la fiabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble de son t\u00e9moignage. Sur le point pr\u00e9cis de sa tentative de d\u00e9fendre la cause de Mme Tabor devant le conseil de Millbrook en vue d\u2019obtenir du financement pour sa formation \u00e0 la School of Fisheries et sur ce qu\u2019elle croyait comprendre d\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Tabor que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce que Millbrook \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticente \u00e0 financer sa participation au cours, j\u2019estime que son t\u00e9moignage est fiable. J\u2019accepte aussi son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel les femmes et les hommes sont trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 Millbrook, comme il en sera question plus tard dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[75] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Gloade n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminant en ce qui concerne les raisons pour lesquelles Mme Tabor s\u2019est vu refuser au d\u00e9part le financement de sa formation de capitaine, mais il corrobore l\u2019affirmation de Mme Tabor selon laquelle elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 obtenir du financement.\n[76] Par contre, il m\u2019appara\u00eet pr\u00e9occupant que Millbrook soutienne qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Gloade a d\u00e9fendu les droits des femmes des Premi\u00e8res Nations toute sa vie, cela mine forc\u00e9ment sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. J\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une attaque injustifi\u00e9e contre son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 puisque rien dans son t\u00e9moignage ne m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 douter de ses motifs pour t\u00e9moigner ni de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[77] Dans l\u2019ensemble, j\u2019estime que l\u2019explication que donne Millbrook des difficult\u00e9s que Mme Tabor a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es pour obtenir le financement de sa formation de capitaine n\u2019est ni fiable ni convaincante.\n[78] Mme Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas termin\u00e9 le cours en 1997 : elle a d\u00fb prendre soin de son p\u00e8re malade, une raison l\u00e9gitime pour abandonner le cours que Millbrook n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9e.\n[79] Sous ce rapport, je souligne que la r\u00e9ponse que M. Cope a fournie concernant la volont\u00e9 de Millbrook de ne financer qu\u2019un certain nombre de places n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans son affidavit. Nous pouvons y lire simplement ceci :\n[traduction]\n37. au d\u00e9part, Millbrook \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 payer l\u2019inscription de Stacy \u00e0 ce programme puisque Millbrook avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 financ\u00e9 la participation de Stacy \u00e0 un cours en 1997 et elle avait abandonn\u00e9 le programme avant la fin. Millbrook n\u2019a pas pour pratique de financer d\u2019autres programmes de formation lorsqu\u2019un membre de la bande n\u2019a pas termin\u00e9 un programme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent (ce d\u00e9tail est aussi important pour une plainte ult\u00e9rieure).\n[80] En passant, je souligne aussi que M. Cope a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor, auquel il a assist\u00e9, au cours duquel elle a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait abandonn\u00e9 le cours en 1997 et rapport\u00e9 ce que M. Cope lui avait dit en 1998. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence entre l\u2019affidavit de M. Cope et son t\u00e9moignage met en doute la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9ponse de M. Cope sur ce point. Je crois que M. Cope a rajust\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor.\n[81] L\u2019explication que M. Cope donne du refus initial de Millbrook de financer la formation se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement peu convaincante lorsque nous tenons compte de la preuve prima facie de Mme Tabor. M. Cope a dit qu\u2019il y avait dix places financ\u00e9es par Millbrook \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Toutefois, Mme Tabor a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait reconnu que deux membres de la collectivit\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation. Si seulement deux des dix places de formation \u00e9taient prises, cela peut expliquer pourquoi Millbrook a fini par accepter de payer la formation de Mme Tabor, mais Millbrook n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 ainsi sa d\u00e9cision. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Cope a plut\u00f4t expliqu\u00e9 la situation comme suit : [traduction] \u00ab Nous l\u2019avons contest\u00e9e, mais nous avons fini par payer pour la place parce que nous avons la r\u00e9putation de payer nos comptes \u00bb.\n[82] Abstraction faite du t\u00e9moignage de M. Cope, Millbrook n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve attestant du financement de dix places \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ni du fait que la participation de Mme Tabor \u00e0 la formation avait oblig\u00e9 Millbrook \u00e0 financer une place suppl\u00e9mentaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve sur ce point dans son ensemble, et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de mes conclusions selon lesquelles l\u2019explication fournie par Millbrook n\u2019est ni cr\u00e9dible ni convaincante, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que Millbrook ne voulait simplement pas que Mme Tabor participe \u00e0 la formation de capitaine.\n(iii) Exp\u00e9rience avec Millbrook et sa p\u00eacherie de 2003 \u00e0 2006\n[83] Millbrook explique les difficult\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de Mme Tabor \u00e0 obtenir un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de 2003 \u00e0 2006 par le fait qu\u2019elle aurait choisi de rester \u00e0 la maison avec son fils. Adrian Gloade croyait comprendre que les Tabor avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Tabor resterait \u00e0 la maison et prendrait soin de leur fils pendant que M. Tabor irait p\u00eacher.\n[84] Mme Tabor est effectivement rest\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison un certain temps en 2003 apr\u00e8s la naissance de son fils, mais d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve prima facie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9tablie, de 2004 \u00e0 2006, elle a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises d\u2019obtenir un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, sans succ\u00e8s. Exception faite d\u2019autres emplois que la p\u00eache, elle est rest\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison avec ses enfants pendant cette p\u00e9riode, non volontairement, mais plut\u00f4t parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9e, ridiculis\u00e9e et, au bout du compte, incapable d\u2019obtenir un travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie.\n[85] Mme Bernard a corrobor\u00e9 l\u2019affirmation de Mme Tabor concernant ses tentatives d\u2019obtenir un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Millbrook a contest\u00e9 \u00e9galement la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bernard sur ce point. Comme elle \u00e9tait conseill\u00e8re de bande et qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de discrimination, Millbrook se demande pourquoi elle n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 la question au conseil de bande ni aupr\u00e8s du comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches. Millbrook s\u2019interroge aussi sur ce qui la motive \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a quitt\u00e9 le conseil de bande en mauvais termes.\n[86] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Bernard ne m\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune raison de douter qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin du fait que Mme Tabor est all\u00e9e demander du travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et que sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise au s\u00e9rieux. Exception faite d\u2019avoir mis en doute les motifs qui sous-tendent le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bernard, Millbrook n\u2019a produit aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour r\u00e9futer le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Bernard ni l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat manifest\u00e9 par Mme Tabor pour obtenir du travail \u00e0 sa p\u00eacherie de 2004 \u00e0 2006.\n[87] Si Millbrook a mis en doute l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de Mme Tabor pour la p\u00eache, vu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 poursuivre sa formation ni \u00e0 obtenir d\u2019autres brevets, sa r\u00e9ponse non contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ces options parce que la Premi\u00e8re Nation ne l\u2019avait pas soutenue en lui offrant du financement ou des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi connexes. La r\u00e9ponse r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e et coh\u00e9rente de Mme Tabor est cr\u00e9dible et raisonnable \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la p\u00eache en 2007 lorsqu\u2019on lui en a offert l\u2019occasion et qu\u2019elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 rechercher cette possibilit\u00e9 en 2008. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Adrian Gloade concernant les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales de Mme Tabor ne constitue pas une explication raisonnable de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du travail \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook de 2004 \u00e0 2006.\n(iv) Saison de la p\u00eache au homard 2007\n[88] La preuve de Millbrook sur ce point se concentre sur des probl\u00e8mes de rendement all\u00e9gu\u00e9s lorsque M. et Mme Tabor ont eu la responsabilit\u00e9 du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007.\n[89] Sur la question de l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel, Millbrook soutient que les Tabor ont laiss\u00e9 leur mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache sur le quai pendant des semaines et qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u des plaintes \u00e0 ce sujet de la part de travailleurs sur le quai. Millbrook soutient qu\u2019au bout du compte, elle a d\u00fb payer pour charger un tiers d\u2019enlever le mat\u00e9riel et l\u2019entreposer. M. Tabor n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 que le mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache du Chief Rachael Marshall soit rest\u00e9 sur le quai plus longtemps que d\u2019habitude, mais il a mis en doute la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019embaucher un tiers pour l\u2019enlever.\n[90] Millbrook soutient aussi que les Tabor n\u2019ont pas rapport\u00e9 le bateau en bon \u00e9tat. Elle a soumis des photos du bateau avant et apr\u00e8s la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 afin d\u2019illustrer les dommages que les Tabor auraient caus\u00e9s au bateau.\n[91] Les photos du bateau soumises par Millbrook ne sont pas dat\u00e9es. Adrian Gloade, qui les a soumises, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne les avait pas prises et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr de la date \u00e0 laquelle elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Il est \u00e9galement difficile de voir des diff\u00e9rences entre les photos avant et apr\u00e8s, si ce n\u2019est sur le plan de la propret\u00e9. Quatre des neuf photos montrent de la corde enroul\u00e9e autour de l\u2019h\u00e9lice. Aucun dommage au bateau n\u2019est \u00e9vident sur les photos.\n[92] En r\u00e9plique \u00e0 Millbrook, M. Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 que n\u2019importe quel bateau de p\u00eache pr\u00e9sente des signes d\u2019usure normale \u00e0 la fin de la saison. Il a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes avec le Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007, mais il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 ces probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 Millbrook apr\u00e8s la saison 2006 et ceux-ci n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s avant la saison 2007. Sinon, le seul probl\u00e8me que le bateau pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 sa connaissance \u00e0 la fin de la saison 2007 se r\u00e9sumait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une corde enroul\u00e9e autour de l\u2019h\u00e9lice, un probl\u00e8me survenu le dernier jour de la saison. M. Tabor n\u2019a eu connaissance d\u2019aucun probl\u00e8me relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entretien du bateau jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le conseil de Millbrook d\u00e9pose sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) en 2008. M. Tabor a ajout\u00e9 que bien qu\u2019il incombe au capitaine de voir au maintien de l\u2019\u00e9tat du bateau, par exemple en changeant l\u2019huile du moteur, un capitaine n\u2019est pas un m\u00e9canicien de bateaux \u00e0 moteur. Un m\u00e9canicien qualifi\u00e9 qui fait partie de l\u2019effectif de Millbrook s\u2019occupe des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9caniques du bateau ou de son moteur. M. Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 avoir chang\u00e9 l\u2019huile du moteur durant la saison 2007 et install\u00e9 un dispositif de protection sur l\u2019h\u00e9lice de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter que les pales de l\u2019h\u00e9lice coupent les lignes des casiers \u00e0 homard.\n[93] J\u2019estime que les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019entretien du bateau \u00e9voqu\u00e9s par Millbrook par rapport au Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007 sont d\u00e9raisonnables et ne constituent qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte. Exception faite des d\u00e9clarations d\u2019Adrian Gloade et de M. Cope et des photos avant et apr\u00e8s qui posent un probl\u00e8me, Millbrook n\u2019a pas soumis d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que M. Tabor avait caus\u00e9 des dommages au Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007 ni que des r\u00e9parations avaient d\u00fb \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es sur le bateau en cons\u00e9quence. Il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que M. Tabor n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de ces probl\u00e8mes d\u2019entretien all\u00e9gu\u00e9s que lorsque Millbrook, par l\u2019entremise de son conseil, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte devant la Commission en 2008. Par contraste, en ce qui concerne les probl\u00e8mes relatifs au mat\u00e9riel et aux ventes, Millbrook a confront\u00e9 M. Tabor peu apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils aient surgi, lui a demand\u00e9 compensation et lui a fourni des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 l\u2019appui des all\u00e9gations, notamment une facture pour la question de l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel. En ce qui concerne les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019entretien, aucune compensation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tabor et aucun d\u00e9tail n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni sur les dommages que M. Tabor aurait caus\u00e9s au bateau en 2007. Sous ce rapport, le paragraphe 1(15) de l\u2019Employment Agreement (Convention d\u2019emploi) entre Millbrook et M. Tabor en 2007 pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit (nous soulignons) :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 la r\u00e9siliation ou \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de la pr\u00e9sente convention, le capitaine doit rendre le bateau \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation au plus tard \u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9siliation ou au dernier jour de la dur\u00e9e de la convention, et ce, essentiellement dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il en a pris possession, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019usure normale, et le capitaine peut rendre le bateau en l\u2019amarrant convenablement au quai d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par la Premi\u00e8re Nation et en informant imm\u00e9diatement la Premi\u00e8re Nation de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 le bateau se trouve. Le capitaine et un repr\u00e9sentant de la Premi\u00e8re Nation proc\u00e9deront \u00e0 une inspection du bateau afin d\u2019en \u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e9tat et v\u00e9rifier qu\u2019il est essentiellement dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 le capitaine en a pris possession.\nAucun rapport d\u2019inspection du Ch\\ief Rachael Marshall au terme de la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve. \u00c0 mon avis, toutes les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es montrent que les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019entretien du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Millbrook ne sont qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[94] Adrian Gloade et Mme Dawn Ellis, commis principale aux finances pour la p\u00eacherie de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook, ont aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail sur la fa\u00e7on dont les capitaines sont r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s et la p\u00eache rapporte de l\u2019argent \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation. Ces t\u00e9moignages concernaient le d\u00e9saccord survenu entre Millbrook et M. Tabor au sujet des ventes de homard du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007.\n[95] En bref, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du capitaine et de l\u2019\u00e9quipage est fix\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de la saison, avec l\u2019approbation de Millbrook. La Premi\u00e8re Nation fournit le bateau et les fournitures et recouvre ces d\u00e9penses de la vente des homards. Elle prend aussi un pourcentage des ventes pour son profit, le reste \u00e9tant remis au capitaine. Lorsqu\u2019un bateau revient au quai, les prises de homard sont pes\u00e9es et un bordereau de d\u00e9barquement comptabilisant la quantit\u00e9 de homards pris est remis au capitaine. Le capitaine vend ensuite les homards \u00e0 un acheteur approuv\u00e9 par Millbrook. L\u2019acheteur paie directement Millbrook et le montant est cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 au bateau du capitaine.\n[96] Sur ce point, Millbrook soutient ce qui suit dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Tabor en septembre 2008 : [traduction] \u00ab M. et Mme Tabor ont vendu le homard \u00e0 un autre acheteur que celui de la bande apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on leur ait express\u00e9ment dit de ne pas le faire \u00bb. Adrian Gloade a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Premi\u00e8re Nation n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de paiement pour les derni\u00e8res semaines de la saison de p\u00eache au homard de 2007 de M. Tabor. Il a appel\u00e9 l\u2019acheteur approuv\u00e9 de Millbrook, qui lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec M. Tabor. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Adrian Gloade, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli \u00e0 qui M. Tabor avait vendu les homards qu\u2019il avait p\u00each\u00e9s, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur s\u2019il savait qu\u2019il devait envoyer le paiement \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Nation et non \u00e0 M. Tabor. L\u2019acheteur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant et il allait payer M. Tabor. En cons\u00e9quence, le paiement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 plut\u00f4t \u00e0 Millbrook.\n[97] En r\u00e9plique, M. Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait toujours vendu les homards qu\u2019il avait p\u00each\u00e9s \u00e0 J & K Fisheries ou \u00e0 North Nova en 2007, les deux acheteurs approuv\u00e9s de Millbrook.\n[98] En contre-interrogatoire, Adrian Gloade a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait probablement autoris\u00e9 M. Tabor \u00e0 vendre \u00e0 un autre acheteur, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait simplement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du changement et que l\u2019acheteur n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u la consigne de payer la Premi\u00e8re Nation. Cela contredit la r\u00e9ponse que Millbrook a fournie en 2008. Adrian Gloade a ensuite soumis des documents comptables montrant des paiements faits par l\u2019acheteur approuv\u00e9 \u00e0 Millbrook, notamment une copie d\u2019un ch\u00e8que dat\u00e9, qui co\u00efncide avec les derni\u00e8res semaines de la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 de M. Tabor. Il a r\u00e9pondu que les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s tard et que l\u2019acheteur approuv\u00e9 lui avait dit ne pas avoir n\u00e9goci\u00e9 avec M. Tabor. Au bout du compte, Adrian Gloade a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait connaissance d\u2019aucun \u00e9cart intentionnel par rapport aux ventes de M. Tabor durant la saison 2007. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Adrian Gloade sur ce point n\u2019est pas fiable.\n[99] En ce qui concerne le manque \u00e0 gagner au chapitre des ventes entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Tabor et les d\u00e9barquements de son bateau, Mme Ellis a dit que le manque \u00e0 gagner \u00e9tait d\u00fb au fait que les d\u00e9penses de M. Tabor et ses versements de paie hebdomadaires d\u00e9passaient les prises hebdomadaires. De l\u2019avis de Mme Ellis, le manque \u00e0 gagner est d\u00fb au fait que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de M. Tabor semblait \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que depuis 2008, Millbrook a \u00e9tabli une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration standard pour les capitaines et les membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage en r\u00e9action aux manques \u00e0 gagner de cet ordre.\n[100] J\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ellis est fiable. Je conclus de son t\u00e9moignage sur la question du manque \u00e0 gagner au chapitre des ventes de homard que Millbrook et M. Tabor \u00e9taient en conflit sur ce point. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, M. Tabor croit qu\u2019il y a des \u00e9carts dans la comptabilit\u00e9 de Millbrook par rapport aux ventes du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007 et que certaines ventes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es comme il se devait \u00e0 son bateau.\n[101] Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9vident que Millbrook et M. Tabor \u00e9taient en conflit sur la question de l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel. M. Tabor a aussi fourni une preuve prima facie de son conflit avec Millbrook par rapport \u00e0 la poursuite intent\u00e9e par Frank Gloade \u00e0 la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances. Malgr\u00e9 ces conflits, Millbrook nie avoir dit \u00e0 M. Tabor qu\u2019il ne travaillerait jamais plus pour eux ou l\u2019avoir emp\u00each\u00e9 de p\u00eacher pour eux depuis. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, M. Tabor n\u2019avait plus d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la p\u00eache apr\u00e8s 2007, et elle soutient que cela est confirm\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019il a poursuivi ses \u00e9tudes dans d\u2019autres domaines.\n[102] S\u2019il est vrai que M. Tabor a entrepris des \u00e9tudes dans d\u2019autres domaines, j\u2019accepte aussi son explication qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait comme solution de rechange, vu le refus de Millbrook de l\u2019embaucher. Cette conclusion est corrobor\u00e9e par la r\u00e9ponse que Millbrook a fournie \u00e0 la plainte en septembre 2008 :\n[traduction]\nNi M. ni Mme Tabor ne se sont vu adjuger un contrat permanent par l\u2019entremise de la bande pour la saison de p\u00eache 2008 \u00e0 cause des probl\u00e8mes que la bande a eus par rapport au bateau exploit\u00e9 par M. et Mme Tabor pendant la saison de p\u00eache 2007.\nEn outre, la candidature de M. Tabor \u00e0 un contrat d\u2019emploi n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte parce qu\u2019il avait inform\u00e9 la bande qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen d\u2019entr\u00e9e de la GRC et qu\u2019il attendait des nouvelles de la GRC par rapport \u00e0 son admission au programme d\u2019instruction et qu\u2019il avait aussi l\u2019intention de suivre le cours de conducteur d\u2019\u00e9quipement lourd offert par la bande de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir travailler dans l\u2019Ouest canadien.\n[103] J\u2019estime que le conflit entre Millbrook et M. Tabor portant sur l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et les ventes ainsi que la poursuite \u00e0 la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des facteurs dans le refus de Millbrook d\u2019embaucher M. Tabor en 2008. J\u2019estime aussi que le refus de Millbrook d\u2019embaucher M. Tabor entre ensuite en compte dans la d\u00e9cision de Millbrook de ne pas embaucher Mme Tabor en 2008.\n[104] En d\u2019autres mots, mise \u00e0 part la pr\u00e9tention de Millbrook selon laquelle il y avait un candidat plus qualifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019attribution du permis de capitaine en 2008, Millbrook soutient que le rendement de Mme Tabor en 2007 constitue une justification suppl\u00e9mentaire de sa d\u00e9cision concernant l\u2019attribution du permis. \u00c0 son avis, comme il s\u2019agissait essentiellement d\u2019un \u00e9quipage de deux personnes en 2007, il \u00e9tait raisonnable qu\u2019elle discute des probl\u00e8mes de rendement concernant les Tabor au moment de d\u00e9cider de la personne la plus qualifi\u00e9e pour commander le bateau l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. En outre, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, sa convention d\u2019emploi avec M. et Mme Tabor en 2007 pr\u00e9voyait que le capitaine et l\u2019\u00e9quipage \u00e9taient responsables de nombreuses t\u00e2ches. Millbrook soutient que les probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Tabor en 2007 comprenaient, au regard de sa convention d\u2019emploi, le fait d\u2019\u00eatre tenue solidairement responsable avec M. Tabor de tout manquement au chapitre de l\u2019entretien, de l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et des ventes. Millbrook renvoie explicitement aux clauses 1, 1(1), 1(3), 1(10) et 2 de la convention d\u2019emploi, o\u00f9 le capitaine et l\u2019\u00e9quipage sont tenus comptables des probl\u00e8mes relatifs au bateau.\n[105] Rien dans la convention d\u2019emploi ne me convainc que Mme Tabor pourrait \u00eatre tenue responsable de probl\u00e8mes relatifs aux ventes, \u00e0 l\u2019entretien et \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel. La plupart des t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s expos\u00e9es dans la convention d\u2019emploi commencent par l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Le capitaine doit\u2026 \u00bb, notamment garder le bateau et l\u2019\u00e9quipement en bon \u00e9tat (paragraphes 1(1) et 1(5)) et voir aux ventes (paragraphes 1(6) et 1(7)). La convention d\u2019emploi tient aussi le capitaine enti\u00e8rement responsable de tout dommage caus\u00e9 au bateau :\n[traduction]\nLe capitaine reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est responsable du co\u00fbt de tous dommages, pertes ou r\u00e9parations relatifs au bateau de p\u00eache, \u00e0 son \u00e9quipement (m\u00e9canique, \u00e9lectronique, etc.) et au mat\u00e9riel de p\u00eache qui sont attribuables, directement ou indirectement, \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence du capitaine ou des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipage sous son commandement.\n[106] Les autres dispositions cit\u00e9es par Millbrook se lisent comme suit :\n[traduction]\nArticle 1 : Le capitaine et les membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage (le second et le matelot de pont) doivent \u00eatre disponibles pour travailler \u00e0 des heures raisonnables et pour des p\u00e9riodes raisonnables afin de s\u2019acquitter des fonctions que leur confie la Premi\u00e8re Nation.\nParagraphe 1(3) : Le capitaine et les membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage doivent exploiter le bateau de p\u00eache de la Premi\u00e8re Nation durant la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 dans la zone de p\u00eache LFA-26-A jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 [\u2026] et s\u2019acquitter des fonctions relatives \u00e0 la p\u00eache avec diligence, efficacit\u00e9 et efficience.\nParagraphe 1(10) : Il incombe au capitaine de voir \u00e0 la formation et au commandement des membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage du bateau durant la saison de p\u00eache 2007 dans la zone de p\u00eache LFA-26-A et durant le temps requis avant et apr\u00e8s la saison pour entretenir le bateau et l\u2019\u00e9quipement.\nArticle 2 : La dur\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente convention commence le 1er jour de mai 2007 et prend fin deux (2) semaines apr\u00e8s la fin de la saison de p\u00eache au homard (15 juillet 2007). Un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019une des modalit\u00e9s ou conditions de la pr\u00e9sente convention par le capitaine ou un membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipage sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00ab motif valable \u00bb de cong\u00e9diement de cette personne et la Premi\u00e8re Nation peut mettre fin aux services de la ou des personnes en cause pour manquement \u00e0 l\u2019une quelconque des modalit\u00e9s ou conditions de la pr\u00e9sente convention [\u2026].\nJe m\u2019explique mal le lien entre ces dispositions et les ventes, l\u2019entretien ou l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel, et encore moins comment elles peuvent soutenir l\u2019argument de Millbrook concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipage \u00e0 ces \u00e9gards.\n[107] Mis \u00e0 part le fait que Mme Tabor \u00e9tait membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipage du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007, Millbrook ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que le probl\u00e8me relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et le probl\u00e8me all\u00e9gu\u00e9 relatif aux ventes, ainsi que les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019entretien qui n\u2019\u00e9taient qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte, prouvaient d\u2019une quelconque fa\u00e7on le mauvais rendement de Mme Tabor. Il n\u2019existe pas de preuve suffisante que Millbrook a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le rendement du capitaine et de l\u2019\u00e9quipage du Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007, encore moins qu\u2019une \u00e9valuation individuelle du rendement de Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[108] M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont parl\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat du moteur du Chief Rachael Marshall apr\u00e8s la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 et dit que cela illustrait l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de Mme Tabor \u00e0 changer l\u2019huile d\u2019un bateau. Toutefois, exception faite de ce commentaire, Millbrook n\u2019a pas \u00e9tay\u00e9 cette affirmation. En outre, Mme Tabor a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle sait changer l\u2019huile d\u2019un bateau, mais elle ne l\u2019a pas fait sur le Chief Rachael Marshall en 2007. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019all\u00e9gation non fond\u00e9e de M. Cope et d\u2019Adrian Gloade concernant l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de Mme Tabor de changer l\u2019huile d\u2019un bateau me conforte dans ma conclusion que les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019entretien all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Millbrook par rapport \u00e0 la saison de p\u00eache au homard 2007 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9s.\n[109] Je crois aussi que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un lien entre le probl\u00e8me relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel, le probl\u00e8me all\u00e9gu\u00e9 relatif aux ventes et Mme Tabor n\u2019est encore qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte. Comme je l\u2019ai constat\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, Millbrook \u00e9tait en conflit avec M. Tabor au sujet de l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et des ventes de m\u00eame que de la poursuite \u00e0 la Cour des petites cr\u00e9ances. Il s\u2019en est suivi que M. Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu de tout travail futur pour Millbrook. Vu l\u2019insuffisance des explications et des preuves fournies par Millbrook \u00e0 l\u2019appui du lien qu\u2019elle \u00e9tablit entre, d\u2019une part, le probl\u00e8me relatif \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage du mat\u00e9riel et les probl\u00e8mes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s relatifs aux ventes et, d\u2019autre part, Mme Tabor, je crois qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que Millbrook a group\u00e9 Mme Tabor dans le conflit qu\u2019elle avait avec M. Tabor parce qu\u2019elle est sa femme. De fait, Mme Tabor a aid\u00e9 M. Tabor \u00e0 contester les probl\u00e8mes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s relatifs aux ventes en prenant sa d\u00e9fense devant le conseil de bande sur ces points.\n[110] Si M. Tabor \u00e9tait exclu de tout travail futur en raison de son conflit avec Millbrook, et si Mme Tabor est aussi associ\u00e9e \u00e0 ce conflit, il est probable que Millbrook l\u2019a exclue de tout travail futur sur cette base \u00e9galement. Pour cette raison, je crois que l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial de Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas prendre en consid\u00e9ration sa candidature pour un permis de capitaine en 2008.\n[111] Comme je l\u2019expliquerai dans les pages suivantes, je crois aussi que le sexe de Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de ne pas prendre en consid\u00e9ration sa candidature pour un permis de capitaine en 2008.\n(v) Permis de capitaine en 2008\n[112] Millbrook soutient que Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 sa candidature en bonne et due forme pour le permis de capitaine en 2008. Malgr\u00e9 tout, Millbrook affirme avoir bien pris en compte sa candidature pour le permis et compar\u00e9 ses qualifications avec celles des deux autres candidats ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de permis avant de faire son choix. Selon Millbrook, apr\u00e8s avoir compar\u00e9 les qualifications de Mme Tabor avec celles de Frank Gloade, le candidat qui a obtenu le permis, Millbrook a conclu que les qualifications de ce dernier \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieures.\n[113] \u00c0 mon avis, la position de Millbrook selon laquelle Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 sa candidature, mais a quand m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e pour le permis de capitaine en 2008 est contradictoire et n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte. J\u2019estime que Millbrook n\u2019a pas pris en compte Mme Tabor pour un permis de capitaine en 2008 parce qu\u2019elle est une femme et parce que Millbrook a eu un conflit avec M. Tabor en 2007.\n[114] Sur le premier point concernant l\u2019absence de demande formelle, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien que Mme Tabor ait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil de bande en janvier 2008 et exprim\u00e9 son intention de demander le permis de capitaine, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande formelle et ils n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019autres nouvelles d\u2019elle apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9union. Deux autres candidats ont communiqu\u00e9 avec le bureau de la bande et demand\u00e9 un permis.\n[115] Lorsque M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont d\u00fb expliquer comment une personne demande un permis en bonne et due forme, ils ont convenu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de processus de demande formel. Un candidat doit plut\u00f4t prendre contact avec Adrian Gloade et, par la suite, r\u00e9ussir un test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. Cela concorde avec le t\u00e9moignage de M. et Mme Tabor concernant l\u2019absence d\u2019un processus formel pour demander un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Autrement dit, il vous suffit de manifester votre intention et un travail vous est habituellement offert. Cependant, le renversement de position de M. Cope et d\u2019Adrian Gloade, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019existence d\u2019un processus de demande formel par opposition \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019un processus de demande formel, met en lumi\u00e8re une autre raison qui me pousse \u00e0 douter de la fiabilit\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[116] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019une demande formelle, d\u2019apr\u00e8s M. Cope et Adrian Gloade, au d\u00e9but de 2008, le comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches a tenu une r\u00e9union au cours de laquelle il a discut\u00e9 des candidats pour le permis de capitaine, dont Mme Tabor. \u00c0 cette r\u00e9union, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade disent que le comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Frank Gloade poss\u00e9dait des qualifications sup\u00e9rieures et plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience que Mme Tabor. En cons\u00e9quence, Frank Gloade s\u2019est vu promettre le permis de capitaine, sous r\u00e9serve des r\u00e9sultats du d\u00e9pistage de drogues.\n[117] Sur ce point, Adrian Gloade avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au d\u00e9part qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019une conversation qu\u2019il aurait eue avec Mme Tabor apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de promettre \u00e0 Frank Gloade le permis de capitaine. Cependant, en contre-interrogatoire, il a dit qu\u2019il se pouvait qu\u2019il ait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor, mais que celle-ci s\u2019\u00e9tait simplement renseign\u00e9e sur le processus de soumission pour le permis de p\u00eache. Il soutient ne pas l\u2019avoir inform\u00e9e \u00e0 cette occasion qu\u2019elle n\u2019obtiendrait pas le permis.\n[118] J\u2019estime que la d\u00e9claration d\u2019Adrian Gloade n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible puisqu\u2019elle ne concorde pas avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il est logique qu\u2019Adrian Gloade et Mme Tabor discutent du processus d\u2019attribution des permis de p\u00eache (appel de soumission ouvert ou contrat d\u2019emploi), vu que Mme Tabor avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil et manifest\u00e9 son intention de demander un permis de capitaine. Cependant, il semble peu probable qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient parl\u00e9 que du processus d\u2019attribution des permis de p\u00eache vu que le permis du Chief Rachael Marshall qui int\u00e9ressait Mme Tabor avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 promis \u00e0 Frank Gloade.\n[119] Le moment de cette conversation co\u00efncide avec le moment o\u00f9 M. Cope et Adrian Gloade disent que le comit\u00e9 des p\u00eaches s\u2019est r\u00e9uni et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que Frank Gloade se verrait accorder le permis. Il co\u00efncide en outre avec la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie par Mme et M. Tabor concernant le moment o\u00f9 ils ont parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Adrian Gloade. En r\u00e9plique aux observations de Millbrook, Mme Tabor a ajout\u00e9 que comme la d\u00e9cision d\u2019accorder le permis de capitaine \u00e0 Frank Gloade avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise avant que le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues soit effectu\u00e9 le 9 avril 2008, elle n\u2019avait vu aucune raison de subir le test de d\u00e9pistage de drogues. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019explication et le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Tabor sur ce point sont logiques et cr\u00e9dibles. Je conclus qu\u2019Adrian Gloade l\u2019a inform\u00e9e en janvier ou en f\u00e9vrier 2008 qu\u2019elle n\u2019obtiendrait pas le permis de capitaine. Sa d\u00e9claration contraire n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible.\n[120] Pour renforcer sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019embaucher Frank Gloade plut\u00f4t que Mme Tabor, Millbrook a appel\u00e9 M. Allan Tobey \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme un expert relativement \u00e0 la Loi sur les p\u00eaches et \u00e0 ses r\u00e8glements, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 leur application \u00e0 Frank Gloade et \u00e0 Mme Tabor aux fins de l\u2019examen de leurs candidatures \u00e0 un poste de capitaine. Il a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un rapport dans lequel il se prononce sur la personne la plus qualifi\u00e9e, entre les deux candidats, pour assumer le r\u00f4le de capitaine d\u2019un bateau de p\u00eache en 2008.\n[121] Dans son rapport, M. Tobey conclut que Frank Gloade \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 en 2008, du fait de sa formation sup\u00e9rieure (un brevet de capitaine de p\u00eache, quatri\u00e8me classe) et de sa plus grande exp\u00e9rience (avoir p\u00each\u00e9 le homard au large de Lismore en 2003, 2004, 2005 et 2006). Pour former son opinion, M. Tobey a re\u00e7u l\u2019\u00ab affidavit \u00bb de Frank Gloade, une d\u00e9claration non sign\u00e9e, pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le conseil de Millbrook, attestant des qualifications de M. Gloade et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sur consentement des parties en ce qui concerne la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu. L\u2019\u00e9valuation que M. Tobey a faite des qualifications de Mme Tabor \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur \u00ab une copie de l\u2019affidavit de quelqu\u2019un \u00bb et on lui a dit qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 matelot de pont stagiaire pendant quelques ann\u00e9es, sans qu\u2019une zone de p\u00eache soit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e. L\u2019affidavit de M. Cope fournit des renseignements sur les qualifications de Mme Tabor, telles que d\u00e9crites par M. Tobey :\na) 2001 \u2013 matelot de pont stagiaire avec la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook;\nb) 2002 \u2013 matelot de pont stagiaire avec la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook;\nc) 2002-2003 \u2013 matelot de pont stagiaire avec la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook;\nd) 2007 \u2013 second sur le Chief Rachel Marshall.\nL\u2019affidavit de M. Cope pr\u00e9cise aussi que Mme Tabor a obtenu son brevet de capitaine avec restrictions en 1998.\n[122] En contre-interrogatoire, il est apparu que M. Tobey n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u un portrait complet de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en mer que Mme Tabor avait acquise avant de travailler pour Millbrook ni les autres attestations de formation qu\u2019elle avait obtenues en mati\u00e8re de navigation \u00e9lectronique simul\u00e9e, de fonctions d\u2019urgence en mer et de comp\u00e9tences en radiocommunication. En r\u00e9plique, M. Tobey s\u2019est mis sur la d\u00e9fensive et n\u2019a pas fait de cas de la suggestion de l\u2019avocat de la plaignante selon laquelle une partie des attestations de formation suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e9taient sup\u00e9rieures aux attestations d\u00e9tenues par Frank Gloade. De l\u2019avis de M. Tobey, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et les attestations suppl\u00e9mentaires de Mme Tabor se rapportaient au secteur du transport maritime. Comme son opinion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sollicit\u00e9e et donn\u00e9e sur une comparaison de \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la p\u00eache \u00bb et de \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience concr\u00e8te au large de Lismore \u00bb, ces renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires ne modifiaient pas son opinion selon laquelle Frank Gloade \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9. Mme Tabor d\u00e9tenait un brevet de capitaine inf\u00e9rieur (brevet de capitaine avec restrictions) et n\u2019avait \u00e0 son actif qu\u2019une saison de p\u00eache au large de Lismore, ses deux autres saisons de p\u00eache ayant eu lieu au large de Pictou Landing (2001-2002) et elle n\u2019avait pas termin\u00e9 la saison de p\u00eache en 2003.\n[123] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tobey ne m\u2019appara\u00eet ni fiable ni utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. On a fourni \u00e0 M. Tobey des renseignements incomplets pour qu\u2019il compare les qualifications de Mme Tabor et de Frank Gloade et ces renseignements ne provenaient que de Millbrook. Sous ce rapport, je constate que dans son affidavit, M. Cope nuance l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache que Mme Tabor a acquise de 2001 \u00e0 2003 en disant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00ab stagiaire \u00bb. M. Cope a expliqu\u00e9 cette mention en disant que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce que Mme Tabor faisait partie d\u2019un programme de mentorat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Si des p\u00eacheurs moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre encadr\u00e9s par des p\u00eacheurs plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, et je signale qu\u2019une partie de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Tabor et de Frank Gloade a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme du \u00ab mentorat \u00bb, cela dit, ni M. Tabor ni Frank Gloade n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9s de \u00ab stagiaires \u00bb alors qu\u2019ils participaient \u00e0 un programme de mentorat. \u00c0 mon avis, en qualifiant Mme Tabor de \u00ab stagiaire \u00bb de 2001 \u00e0 2003, M. Cope s\u2019emploie de fa\u00e7on \u00e9vidente \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter son exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache.\n[124] En plus des renseignements unilat\u00e9raux sur lesquels il s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour produire son rapport d\u2019expert, le fait que M. Tobey \u00e9tait si retranch\u00e9 sur sa position et peu ouvert aux contestations de celle-ci me fait douter de l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 de son opinion. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, m\u00eame si je devais reconna\u00eetre que Frank Gloade \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 que Mme Tabor en 2008, l\u2019opinion de M. Tobey n\u2019aide pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si Millbrook a effectivement compar\u00e9 les qualifications des candidats ou si la candidature de Mme Tabor a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte pour le permis de capitaine en 2008.\n[125] Sous ce rapport, Millbrook a aussi soulign\u00e9 que le brevet de capitaine avec restrictions de Mme Tabor \u00e9tait expir\u00e9 en 2008. Millbrook ajoute qu\u2019il est improbable qu\u2019elle aurait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un nouveau brevet avant la saison du homard 2008. Je ne vois pas en quoi le fait que son brevet de capitaine avec restrictions \u00e9tait expir\u00e9 en 2008 est pertinent pour \u00e9tayer la position de Millbrook dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Si ce fait peut renforcer son argument selon lequel Frank Gloade \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 que Mme Tabor, il ne jette aucun \u00e9clairage sur la position de Millbrook selon laquelle une comparaison des qualifications des candidats a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, je ne crois pas que la candidature de Mme Tabor a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e pour un permis et encore moins que ses qualifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9es avec celles de Frank Gloade.\n[126] Sur ce point, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont dit dans leur affidavit et t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal que Millbrook devait faire parvenir le brevet de chaque capitaine \u00e0 sa compagnie d\u2019assurance. Selon eux, les primes d\u2019assurance d\u00e9pendent des qualifications du capitaine. Ils doivent s\u00e9lectionner le capitaine le plus qualifi\u00e9 parmi les candidats parce que l\u2019assurance co\u00fbte tr\u00e8s cher pour les capitaines nouveaux ou inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9s et qu\u2019en cas d\u2019accident, Millbrook serait tenue d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas embauch\u00e9 un capitaine plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9.\n[127] Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, ni M. Cope ni Adrian Gloade n\u2019ont pu dire s\u2019il y avait effectivement un co\u00fbt diff\u00e9rent pour des capitaines diff\u00e9rents en fonction de leur exp\u00e9rience et de leurs qualifications. Ils n\u2019ont pu non plus produire de document d\u2019assurance sous ce rapport. Comme ni M. Cope ni Adrian Gloade n\u2019ont pu \u00e9tayer leur pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle les primes d\u2019assurance diff\u00e8rent en fonction des qualifications et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience des capitaines, que ce soit par leur t\u00e9moignage ou par des documents, je conclus que l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par Millbrook concernant l\u2019assurance n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[128] Par ailleurs, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, le facteur de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la p\u00eache au large de Lismore a pes\u00e9 lourd dans l\u2019attribution du permis de capitaine. Frank Gloade avait p\u00each\u00e9 le homard au large de Lismore de 2003 \u00e0 2006, tandis que Mme Tabor n\u2019avait p\u00each\u00e9 qu\u2019une saison au large de Lismore en 2007. Fait int\u00e9ressant, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache que Frank Gloade a acquise \u00e0 Lismore correspond \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle Mme Tabor n\u2019a pu obtenir un poste \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Si Frank Gloade \u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 que Mme Tabor en 2008, c\u2019est en partie d\u00fb au fait qu\u2019on lui a offert des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00eatre form\u00e9 et de pratiquer la p\u00eache que Mme Tabor ne s\u2019est pas vu offrir. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, Frank Gloade et M. Tabor ont rapidement acquis une formation et une exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache pour Millbrook. Dans certains cas, M. Tabor n\u2019a m\u00eame pas demand\u00e9 un emploi ou une formation avant de se voir offrir ces possibilit\u00e9s par Millbrook, notamment un poste de capitaine. Toutefois, comme Mme Tabor l\u2019a \u00e9tabli dans sa preuve prima facie, de 2004 \u00e0 2006, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle ait pris contact \u00e0 plusieurs reprises avec la Premi\u00e8re Nation en vue d\u2019obtenir du travail, elle n\u2019a pu obtenir un emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Ce manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu contre elle dans le concours de 2008.\n[129] \u00c0 mon avis, la situation en 2008 \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que celle qui pr\u00e9valait de 2004 \u00e0 2007. Mme Tabor a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et Mme Bernard a corrobor\u00e9, que les repr\u00e9sentants de Millbrook n\u2019ont pas pris au s\u00e9rieux ses demandes d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de 2004 \u00e0 2006 parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. M. Tabor s\u2019est aussi heurt\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ticence de Millbrook pour embaucher Mme Tabor au sein de son \u00e9quipage en 2007. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire que l\u2019attitude de Millbrook envers Mme Tabor avait chang\u00e9 en 2008.\n[130] J\u2019estime que l\u2019explication que Millbrook a fournie pour ne pas avoir accord\u00e9 le permis de capitaine \u00e0 Mme Tabor en 2008, sur la base de ses qualifications, n\u2019est ni fiable, ni convaincante, ni raisonnable. Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de Millbrook \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, je reste avec l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle a forg\u00e9 une explication aux all\u00e9gations de Mme Tabor, apr\u00e8s coup, et adapt\u00e9 son argument et ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour tenter de restreindre les questions en litige \u00e0 une simple comparaison des qualifications de Mme Tabor et de Frank Gloade pour l\u2019attribution du permis de capitaine en 2008. L\u2019accent mis sur les qualifications, notamment en appelant un expert \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur la question dans une tentative de valider une comparaison dite \u00ab formelle \u00bb des candidats; et le fait de soulever une question d\u2019assurance en lien avec les qualifications, un point qui n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9tay\u00e9 par aucune documentation ni d\u2019autres fa\u00e7ons, en sont tous des signes. Dans mon esprit, il est \u00e9galement contradictoire et r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019un pr\u00e9texte que Millbrook soutienne, d\u2019une part, que Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour l\u2019attribution du permis de capitaine en 2008 et, d\u2019autre part, que sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte en bonne et due forme dans une comparaison de ses qualifications avec celles des autres candidats qui ont postul\u00e9. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, les questions en litige sont beaucoup plus vastes que la d\u00e9cision relative au permis de capitaine en 2008, et le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor au fil des ans qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e du tout pour ce permis et que la r\u00e9ponse de Millbrook \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[131] Par ailleurs, j\u2019estime que les principaux t\u00e9moins de Millbrook, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on peu fiable. Ils se sont largement fond\u00e9s sur leur affidavit en t\u00e9moignant et ils prenaient souvent le temps de le relire avant de r\u00e9pondre aux questions. Confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des omissions flagrantes dans son affidavit, M. Cope r\u00e9pondait par des phrases comme \u00ab on ne m\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 la question \u00bb, ce qui met en doute la fiabilit\u00e9 de son affidavit. Plus important encore, et comme nous l\u2019avons vu, dans leur t\u00e9moignage oral, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont affirm\u00e9 des choses qui contredisent leur affidavit et la position \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par Millbrook \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte et ne concordent pas avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 ces contradictions tout au long de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Je crois que les t\u00e9moignages de M. Cope et d\u2019Adrian Gloade changeaient et \u00e9voluaient \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la cause de Mme Tabor et dans une tentative de justifier les actes de Millbrook. Sous ce rapport, je souligne que Millbrook est leur employeur et que bon nombre des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte mettent en cause des actes ou des d\u00e9cisions qui \u00e9taient de leur ressort dans leurs r\u00f4les au sein de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook.\n[132] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la preuve montre que la candidature de Mme Tabor n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en compte pour l\u2019attribution d\u2019un permis de capitaine en 2008 et que son sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur. Cette conclusion concorde avec le traitement que Millbrook a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor lorsqu\u2019elle a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de 2004 \u00e0 2006. Mme Bernard a corrobor\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation et Millbrook n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explication raisonnable pour la contester. Le fait que son manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience ait ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu contre elle en 2008 perp\u00e9tue la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[133] En cons\u00e9quence, et aux termes de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, je conclus que Millbrook n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la candidature de Mme Tabor pour l\u2019attribution d\u2019un permis de capitaine en 2008 parce qu\u2019elle est une femme.\n(vi) Exp\u00e9rience d\u2019autres femmes au sein de l\u2019administration et de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook\n[134] En majorit\u00e9, les t\u00e9moins provenant de Millbrook, ceux qui vivent dans la collectivit\u00e9, ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019en tant que membres d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination du fait de leur appartenance \u00e0 une Premi\u00e8re Nation et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, ils ne feraient pas vivre de discrimination \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes. Mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces r\u00e9ponses qui semblaient r\u00e9cit\u00e9es, parce que chaque t\u00e9moin s\u2019est fait poser la m\u00eame question et a r\u00e9pondu essentiellement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, je n\u2019accepte pas cette logique. Le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination ne garantit pas qu\u2019une personne n\u2019exerce pas de discrimination envers une autre personne. Ce n\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement pas convaincant lorsque les t\u00e9moins affirment avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination du fait de leur appartenance \u00e0 une Premi\u00e8re Nation, ce qui est compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rent des principaux motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit le sexe et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. En ce qui concerne la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, j\u2019ajouterais que les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes entourant les diff\u00e9rences entre les hommes et les femmes transcendent la race, la culture et l\u2019origine ethnique.\n[135] En r\u00e9plique \u00e0 la preuve selon laquelle peu de femmes travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, sans parler de pratiquer la p\u00eache, M. Cope et Adrian Gloade ont dit dans leur affidavit que sept femmes travaillaient \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook en 2007 et cinq en 2008. Adrian Gloade estime que ces chiffres sont consid\u00e9rables, vu la petite taille de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Adrian Gloade, Millbrook embauche en moyenne 40 \u00e0 65 membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage annuellement pour travailler sur ses bateaux de p\u00eache. Il a aussi dit que Millbrook encourage les femmes \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la p\u00eache et paie pour leur formation si elles le d\u00e9sirent, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour Mme Tabor \u00e9galement.\n[136] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Millbrook, les cinq femmes qui travaillaient \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook en 2008 \u00e9taient Michelle Gloade, Margaret Gloade, Jean Abram, Carla Asprey et Karen Asprey. Michelle Gloade et Karen Asprey ont fourni un affidavit et t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. Margaret Gloade et Carla Asprey n\u2019ont fourni qu\u2019un affidavit.\n[137] Michelle Gloade travaille comme adjointe administrative au bureau de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. En 2005-2006, Carla Asprey \u00e9tait gestionnaire du quai de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook et selon ses dires, elle est maintenant affect\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00ab la surveillance au quai \u00bb pour la p\u00eacherie. Des preuves insuffisantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies pour \u00e9tablir le travail de Jean Abram \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. Dans l\u2019ensemble, sur les cinq femmes identifi\u00e9es par Millbrook, deux seulement ont pratiqu\u00e9 la p\u00eache pour Millbrook : Margaret Gloade et Karen Asprey.\n[138] Il est indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affidavit de Margaret Gloade qu\u2019elle travaille comme matelot de pont \u00e0 la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges. Elle dit qu\u2019elle travaille \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook par intermittence depuis environ 20 ans. Sur cette p\u00e9riode, elle dit avoir travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la fabrication de casiers, \u00e0 l\u2019entretien, au nettoyage de bateaux et comme matelot de pont.\n[139] Mme Asprey p\u00eache la myxine avec son mari. Elle est la titulaire du permis de p\u00eache pour leur bateau, mais son mari en est le capitaine. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne pas passer beaucoup de temps sur le bateau. Essentiellement, elle fabrique des casiers, pr\u00e9pare les app\u00e2ts et se procure les fournitures pour le bateau. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que bien qu\u2019elle ne soit pas capitaine, elle pourrait l\u2019\u00eatre si elle le voulait. Elle est aussi convaincue que Millbrook paierait pour sa formation et ses brevets de capitaine comme elle l\u2019a fait pour d\u2019autres. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Asprey, Millbrook encourage les femmes \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 sa p\u00eacherie. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son sexe de la part du d\u00e9partement des p\u00eaches de Millbrook, de M. Cope ou d\u2019Adrian Gloade.\n[140] J\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Asprey n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement convaincant ni utile en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Ses affirmations concernant sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre capitaine et de faire payer sa formation par la Premi\u00e8re Nation sont anecdotiques; par ailleurs, aucune pr\u00e9cision n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie sur la fa\u00e7on dont Millbrook encourage les femmes \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie. En outre, son r\u00f4le \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie correspond \u00e0 celui d\u2019autres femmes \u00e0 Millbrook, autrement dit, elle travaille essentiellement \u00e0 terre. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne crois pas que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Asprey appuie la position de Millbrook selon laquelle elle encourage les femmes \u00e0 p\u00eacher ou les appuie dans leur poursuite d\u2019une formation plus pouss\u00e9e en p\u00eache.\n[141] Le fait demeure que, comme Millbrook en a fait \u00e9tat, sur les 45 \u00e0 60 personnes qui travaillaient comme membres d\u2019\u00e9quipage \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook en 2008, deux \u00e9taient des femmes. En outre, il semble que les femmes qui travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, en particulier celles qui travaillaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, occupent essentiellement des postes qui ne se rapportent pas \u00e0 la p\u00eache comme telle. J\u2019estime trompeur que Millbrook dise que cinq femmes travaillent \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie, et que ce nombre est appr\u00e9ciable, vu que deux seulement pratiquent effectivement la p\u00eache et les autres travaillent \u00e0 des postes ne se rapportant pas \u00e0 la p\u00eache. Voil\u00e0 un autre exemple qui me pousse \u00e0 croire que la r\u00e9ponse de Millbrook \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[142] Quelques femmes travaillent encore \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. M. Cope a reconnu que le nombre de femmes travaillant \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie a graduellement diminu\u00e9. Il a aussi dit qu\u2019en 2014, quatre femmes seulement travaillaient \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage et les affidavits, ces quatre femmes comprennent Michelle Gloade, Margaret Gloade et Karen Asprey. La quatri\u00e8me femme n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e, bien que d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019affidavit de M. Cope, elle pourrait travailler \u00e0 la p\u00eache au crabe des neiges. Sinon, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, seules Margaret Gloade et Karen Asprey pratiquent la p\u00eache pour Millbrook, cette derni\u00e8re ne le faisant que dans une mesure limit\u00e9e, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage.\n[143] En soi, la preuve statistique du statut minoritaire des femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook ne corrobore pas l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle Mme Tabor, ou les femmes de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, se voient refuser des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Walden, 2010 CF 490, aux paragraphes 109 et110). Toutefois, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle dont il est possible d\u2019inf\u00e9rer des actes discriminatoires (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c Canada (minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), 1998 CanLII 7740 (CF), au paragraphe 22).\n[144] \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve statistique renforce la preuve de Mme Tabor concernant les remarques formul\u00e9es envers les femmes dans la p\u00eacherie et sa difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du travail et du financement pour sa formation \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook. De pair avec la preuve soumise par M. Tabor sur son cheminement professionnel \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, un contraste frappant entre le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux hommes et aux femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook \u00e9merge. Enfin, il y avait le t\u00e9moignage de Mmes Gloade et Bernard concernant le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Tabor et ce qu\u2019elles-m\u00eames ont v\u00e9cu au sein de l\u2019administration de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook, des t\u00e9moignages que j\u2019ai jug\u00e9s cr\u00e9dibles malgr\u00e9 les contestations de Millbrook dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. En ce qui concerne particuli\u00e8rement Mme Gloade, je soulignerais que bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pu se souvenir de certaines conversations et de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements, l\u2019impression syst\u00e9matique et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e que lui ont laiss\u00e9 ses deux d\u00e9cennies pass\u00e9es au sein du conseil de bande, impression r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par son affidavit, \u00e9tait que les hommes et les femmes sont trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 Millbrook. Cette impression de longue date est fiable et se distingue du souvenir de conversations ou d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements particuliers. Pour toutes ces raisons, je suis convaincu que l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de Mme Tabor et la repr\u00e9sentation statistique des femmes \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices de la pratique de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook de refuser aux femmes des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans la pratique de la p\u00eache.\n[145] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que Millbrook a fait preuve de discrimination aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP.\nE. Plainte fond\u00e9e\n[146] Apr\u00e8s avoir soupes\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et en vertu de l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la plainte de Mme Tabor aux termes des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP est fond\u00e9e. Mme Tabor a soumis une preuve suffisante pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle s\u2019est vu refuser des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans la pratique de la p\u00eache \u00e0 la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. Le point culminant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en 2008 de ne pas consid\u00e9rer sa candidature pour le r\u00f4le de capitaine, alors que son \u00e9tat matrimonial a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de lui refuser cette possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi. Je conclus \u00e9galement que la situation de Mme Tabor est r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice d\u2019une pratique plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au sein de la p\u00eacherie de Millbrook qui consiste \u00e0 priver les femmes de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi dans la pratique de la p\u00eache. J\u2019estime que la r\u00e9plique que Millbrook a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve de Mme Tabor n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible et n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[147] Les circonstances qui ont abouti \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont malheureuses, vu que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont survenus non seulement au sein d\u2019une petite collectivit\u00e9, mais parmi les membres d\u2019une m\u00eame famille. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que les parties sauront mettre cette situation derri\u00e8re elles et r\u00e9ussiront \u00e0 se r\u00e9concilier. J\u2019esp\u00e8re \u00e9galement que Mme Tabor pourra un jour r\u00e9aliser son r\u00eave de devenir capitaine d\u2019un bateau de p\u00eache.\nIII. Ordonnance\n[148] La plainte \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e, il m\u2019est loisible de rendre une ordonnance contre la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Millbrook aux termes du paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP. Toutefois, les parties ont convenu de tenter d\u2019abord de r\u00e9gler entre elles la question du redressement. J\u2019invite donc les parties \u00e0 amorcer des discussions de r\u00e8glement en r\u00e9ponse aux conclusions formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Je demanderai aux parties de faire le point sur ces discussions apr\u00e8s la publication des motifs de ma d\u00e9cision sur la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Tabor.\n[149] Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la question du redressement soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence en la mati\u00e8re.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n29 avril 2015\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1658\/1311 et T1659\/1411\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nStacey Lee Tabor c.
