The Complaint [1] This is a decision respecting a Complaint signed by Joyce Beattie (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cComplainant\u201d) on January 18, 2011 and received by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCommission\u201d) on January 19, 2011. The Complaint was amended on December 8, 2011.\n[2] The Complainant alleges in her Complaint that Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (now known as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada and hereinafter referred to as the \u201cRespondent\u201d) discriminated against her \u201c\u2026in the provision of a service customarily available to the general public and which s. 5(3) and s. 9(3) of the Indian Act require the Respondent to provide to \u201cany person\u201d. In particular, the Respondent summarily refused, based entirely on the prohibited ground of family status discrimination, to give proper and adequate consideration to the facts and law presented to him to establish the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to Indian registration and band membership pursuant to ss. 6(1)(c) and 11(1)(c) of the Indian Act. The purpose of the complaint is to prevent a continuing contravention of the Canadian Human Rights Act by the Respondent in the conduct of his statutory duties pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s request of June 2, 2010 for corrective amendment to her Indian registration and band membership.\u201d The Complainant further alleges in the Complaint that \u201c\u2026documents and a request for amendment to her registration category to 6(1)(c), which would entitle her to reinstatement in her former and proper Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band, were delivered to the Indian Registrar on June 7, 2010. By letter dated December 7, 2010, the Indian Registrar summarily rejected the Complainant\u2019s request...\u201d\n[3] The Complaint cites section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCHRA\u201d) as the discriminatory practice(s) alleged to have occurred on the prohibited grounds of marital status and family status under section 3 of the CHRA. The two above mentioned sections of the CHRA read as follows;\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n(2) Where the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed on the ground of sex.\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[4] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cTribunal\u201d) was requested by the Commission pursuant to section 49 of the CHRA to institute an inquiry into the Complaint by letter dated January 9, 2012.\n[5] A hearing into the Complaint was held by me in this matter during the week of September 30, 2013.\nII. Facts [6] In December of 1949, the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98, included the following provisions:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires...\n(b) \u201cband\u201d means any tribe, band or body of Indians who own or are interested in a reserve or in Indian lands in common, of which the legal status is vested in the Crown, or who share alike in the distribution of any annuities or interest moneys for which the Government of Canada is responsible; and, when action is being take by the band as such, means the band in council; ...\n(d) \u201cIndian\u201d means\n(i) any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band;\n(ii) any child of such person; or\n(iii) any woman who is or was lawfully married to such person;...\n(g) irregular band means any tribe, band or body of persons of Indian blood who own no interest in any reserve or lands of which the legal title is vested in the Crown, who possess no common fund managed by the Government of Canada, and who have not had any treaty relations with the Crown, ...\n(h) \u201cnon-treaty Indian\u201d mans any person of Indian blood who is reputed to belong to an irregular band or who follows the Indian mode of life, each of such person is only a temporary resident in Canada;...\n[7] The Complainant was born on December 4, 1949, in the community known as Tsiigehtchic, Northwest Territories (formerly known as Arctic Red River). Her biological parents were James Delap Harris and Roselia (or Roaslie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke).\n[8] James Delap Harris and Roselia (or Rosalie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke) married in or around 1938.\n[9] On or about December 8, 1949, Norbert Otto Natsie and Bernadette Natsie (nee Coyen) adopted Joyce Beattie at the age of four days old in accordance with Aboriginal custom, as her natural mother could not care for her on account of illness.\n[10] At the time they custom adopted the Complainant, Norbert Otto Natsie and Bernadette Natsie (nee Coyen) were Indians pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act then in force and their names appeared on the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for what was then known as the Loucheaux No. 6 Band. The Respondent now recognizes the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in band as the contemporary name of the Loucheaux No. 6 Band.\n[11] The Complainant\u2019s name was not added to the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for what was then known as the Loucheaux No. 6 Band at the time of the custom adoption.\n[12] The Indian Act was substantially amended effective September 4, 1951. The Indian Act, S.C. 1951, c. 29, included the following provisions:\n2. (1) In this Act, ...\n(b) \u201cchild\u201d includes a legally adopted Indian child;...\n(g) \u201cIndian\u201d means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian;...\n(j) \u201cmember of a band\u201d means a person whose name appears on a Band List or who is entitled to have his name appear on a Band List;...\n11. Subject to section twelve, a person is entitled to be registered if that person...\n(b) is a member of a band\n(i) for whose use and benefit, in common, lands have been set apart or since the twenty-sixth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy four have been agreed by treaty to be set apart, or\n(ii) that has been declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act,\n...\n(d) is the legitimate child of\n(i) a male person described in paragraph (a) or (b).\n...\n14. A woman who is a member of a band ceases to be a member of that band if she marries a person who is not a member of that ban, but if she marries a member of another band, she thereupon becomes a member of the band of which her husband is a member.\n[13] Section 5 of the 1951 Indian Act created an Indian Register \u201c...in which shall be recorded the name of every person who is entitled to be registered as an Indian.\u201d Before this time, there was no central Indian Register, and the Respondent instead maintained a separate treaty annuity pay list or band list for each band. As of the coming into force of the 1951 amendments, the band lists then in existence were to constitute the Indian Register, and a General List was created for persons who were entitled to registration but had no band membership.\n[14] On April 6, 1974, the Complainant married Bruce Beattie, who was not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act. As a result of this marriage, Ms. Beattie lost any entitlements she may have had to registration and band membership, under the \u201cmarrying out\u201d provisions of the Indian Act in force at the time. Those provisions applied only to Indian women, and not to Indian men.\n[15] On March 17, 1975, the Complainant and Bruce Beattie had a son, T\u2019Seluq Beattie.\n[16] On June 1, 1976, the Complainant and Bruce Beattie had a daughter, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie).\n[17] Effective April 17, 1985, the Indian Act was substantially amended by Bill C-31: An Act to Amend the Indian Act. As amended, the Indian Act included the following provisions:\n2. (1) In this Act,...\n\u201cchild\u201d includes a legally adopted child and a child adopted in accordance with Indian custom;...\n\u201cIndian\u201d means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered or is entitled to be registered as an India;...\n\u201cmember of a band\u201d means a person whose name appears on a Band List or who is entitled to have his name appear on a Band List; ...\n5. (5) The name of a person who is entitled to be registered is not required to be recorded in the Indian Register unless an application for registration is made to the Registrar.\n11. (1) Commencing on April 17, 1985, a person is entitled to have his name entered in a Band List maintained in the Department for a band if...\n(c) that person is entitled to be registered under paragraph 6(1)(c) and ceased to be a member of that band by reason of the circumstances set out in that paragraph;...\n[18] Since the Bill C-31 amendments, it has been ss. 6(1) and 6(2) of the Indian Act that describe the various persons who are entitled to be registered in the Indian Register. As they stood immediately after the Bill C-31 amendments:\n1. s. 6(1) set out categories of eligible persons that include the following:\nall persons who were registered or entitled immediately prior to the effective date of the 1985 amendments (s. 6(1)(c)); and\nwomen whose names were deleted or omitted from band lists (before September 4, 1951), or from the Indian Register (September 4, 1951 and after) because they married non-Indian men (s. 6(1)(c)); and\npersons who have two Indian parents (s. 6(1)(f); and\n2. s. 6(2) created eligibility for persons who have one Indian parent.\n[19] Persons who are registered or eligible for registration under s. 6(1) of the Indian Act are able to pass entitlement to registration to the children they have with persons who are not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act. Persons who are registered or eligible for registration under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act are not able to pass entitlement to registration to the children they have with persons who are not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act.\n[20] The Bill C-31 amendments allowed a band to assume control of its own membership, and maintain its own Band List, subject to certain requirements (Indian Act, s. 10). Until such time as a band assumes control of its Band List, the Band List continues to be maintained in the Department by the Indian Registrar, who can add or delete the names of persons who are entitled or not entitled, in accordance with the Act (Indian Act, s. 9). The Indian Registrar is not required to add a name to a band list unless an application for entry therein is made to the Indian Registrar (Indian Act, s 9(5)).\n[21] The Bill C-31 amendments to the Indian Act changed the registration entitlements of the Complainant\u2019s biological parents. As a result of the amendments, (i) James Delap Harris became eligible for registration under s. 6(2) and (ii) Roselia (or Rosalie) Harris (nee Arruka or Aruke) became eligible for registration under s. 6(1)(c).\n[22] On or around September 1, 1985, the Complainant sent an application to the Office of the Indian Registrar, asking that she and her children be registered under the Indian Act.\n[23] In 1986, the Respondent registered the Complainant under s. 6(1)(f), based on her descent from her biological parents. It also registered her children under s. 6(2), based on the fact they had one registered parent (the Complainant) and one parent who was not registered or entitled (Mr. Beattie). The Respondent later added the names of the Complainant and her children to the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band (i.e., the band of the Complainant\u2019s biological mother), after the Fort Good Hope band decided not to enact its own membership rules.\n[24] By letter dated March 10, 1986, the Indian Registrar wrote to the Complainant to advise that she and her children were registered under the Indian Act. The letter also explained that (i) if the Fort Good Hope Band decided before June 28, 1987, to assume control of its own Band List, she would have to apply to the Fort Good Hope Band for membership and her children\u2019s membership, and (ii) if the Fort Good Hope Band did not assume control of its Band List by June 28, 1987, the Complainant and her children would be eligible for membership in the Fort Good Hope Band, pursuant to s. 11(2)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[25] The Fort Good Hope Band did not assume control of its own Band List by June 28, 1987. As a result, the Indian Registrar added the Complainant, T\u2019Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) to the Band List for the Fort Good Hope Band effective June 28, 1987.\n[26] On March 3, 2010, the Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act (\u201cGEIRA\u201d) was introduced to Parliament and given first reading. Among other things, GEIRA added a new s. 6(1)(c.1) to the Indian Act, which grants registration entitlement to the child of a marriage between a man who is not registered or eligible for registration, and a woman described in s. 6(1)(c) whose name was, because of the marriage, removed from a band list (before September 4, 1951) or the Indian Register (September 4, 1951, and after), where (i) the child was born after the date of the marriage, and (ii) the child has himself or herself had or adopted a child with a person who is not registered or eligible for registration on or after September 4, 1951. GEIRA passed third reading in the House of Commons on November 22, 2010, and third reading in the Senate on December 9, 2010. Royal assent was given December 15, 2010, and GEIRA came into force on January 31, 2011.\n[27] By letter dated April 22, 1993, the Respondent\u2019s then Deputy Minister formally acknowledged the following, in accordance with a settlement reached with the Crown concerning treaty annuities:\n\u201cJoyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie and T\u2019Seluq Beattie\u2019s Treaty 11 entitlements are not linked to status but may be linked to other factors, one of which is ancestry. In the case of Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie and T\u2019Seluq Beattie, the annuity entitlements pursuant to Treaty Eleven accrued at birth and thereafter have continued to exist, and are treaty entitlements that have been recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\u201d\n[28] In a letter to the Office of the Indian Registrar dated June 2, 2010, the Complainant for the first time advised the Respondent of her custom adoption for which she had obtained a certificate of custom adoption from the Northwest Territories Supreme Court recognizing that she was custom adopted legally effective on December 8, 1949. She asked that (i) her category of registration be amended from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, based on her custom adoption, and (ii) her band membership to be changed from the band with which her biological mother was affiliated (752 Good Hope), to that with which her adoptive parents were affiliated (753 Gwichya Gwich\u2019in).\n[29] In a letter to the complainant dated December 7, 2010, the Indian Registrar stated that, among other things, (i) the Complainant\u2019s custom adoption would not entitle her to be registered under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, (ii)\u201d...for your information, the registration categories of an adoptee, adopted by two Indian parents is under the provisions of subsection 6(1)(f) of the Indian Act and the registration category a adoptee (sic) adopted by one Indian parent is under the provisions of subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act\u201d, and (iii) if the Complainant wished to transfer to the band of her custom adoptive parents, she would have to contact INAC\u2019s regional office in the Northwest Territories to request an official band transfer.\n[30] By letter to the Complainant dated December 16, 2010, the Indian Registrar advised that (i) he was satisfied the Complainant was Northwest Territories custom adopted, (ii) the names of her custom adoptive parents had been noted in the Indian Register, (iii) her current registration category remained s. 6(1)(f) of the Indian Act, and (iv) she retained her band membership in the Fort Good Hope Band under s. 11(2)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[31] T\u2019Seluq Beattie had had one child with Stephanie Beattie (who is not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act): Theron Beattie, born October 16, 2003.\n[32] T\u2019Seluq Beattie submitted an application for registration dated February 7, 2011, on behalf of his child, Theron Beattie. By letter dated February 7, 2012, the Indian Registrar advised that because T\u2019Seluq Beattie was registered under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and Stephanie Beattie could not be identified as someone registered or eligible to be registered, he could not determine that Theron Beattie was entitled to be registered.\n[33] Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) has had two children with Reynold Bangloy (who is not registered or eligible for registration under the Indian Act): Jreyden Bangloy, born December 18, 2003; and Brodin Bangloy, born March 26, 2005.\n[34] Nikota Bangloy submitted applications for registration dated March 11, 2011, on behalf of her children, Jreyden and Brodin Bangloy. By letter dated February 7, 2012, the Indian Registrar advised that because Nikota Bangloy was registered under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and Reynold Bangloy could not be identified as someone registered or eligible to be registered, he could not determine that Brodin Bangloy was entitled to registration. On February 23, 2012, the Indian Registrar sent a letter to the same effect concerning Jreyden Bangloy.\n[35] By letter dated December 9, 2012 counsel for the Respondent wrote to advise that the Respondent had changed its approach and was now prepared to recognize that the Complainant had an entitlement to register under s. 6(1)(c). This reversal was made possible because the Respondent had changed its interpretation of the term \u201cchild\u201d as used in the 1927 Indian Act. Up to this point, the Respondent had interpreted that term as including only biological children of a male Indian. As Ms. McLenachan the witness for the Respondent testified, the Respondent now decided to look at the term \u201cwith a different lens\u201d, expanding its definition of the term to include custom adopted children. The consequences were as follows:\n\u2022 The Complainant became an \u201cIndian\u201d on December 8, 1949, as the child of a male Indian (her custom adoptive father);\n\u2022 The Complainant was entitled to register as an Indian under the 1951 Indian Act;\n\u2022 The Complainant lost her entitlement to register when she married Bruce Beattie in 1974;\n\u2022 The Complainant was thus a woman who had lost an entitlement before April 17, 1985, due to marrying-out, and therefore met the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) as of that date;\n\u2022 her children, T\u2019Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), were entitled to registration under s. 6(1)(c.1) rather than s. 6(2).\n\u2022 her grandchildren, Jreyden and Brodin Bangloy, and Theron Beattie, were entitled to registration for the first time under s. 6(2) because their parents became entitled to registration under s. 6(1) (c.1);\n\u2022 The Complainant and her children retained their existing memberships in the Fort Good Hope Band; and\n\u2022 The Complainant and her children could apply to transfer their memberships to another band of their choosing, pursuant to s. 12 of the Indian Act.\n[36] On January 3, 2013, the Complainant received a letter from the Indian Registrar advising that, among other things, (i) upon further review her entitlement to registration has been amended from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, and (ii) she retained her membership in the Fort Good Hope Band, now under s. 11(1)(c) of the Indian Act.\n[37] On or around January 3 or 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar amended the registration categories of T\u2019Seluq Beattie and Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie) so that they are now registered under s. 6(1)(c.1) of the Indian Act, rather than s. 6(2).\n[38] On January 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar (i) registered Theron Beattie, and Brodin and Jreyden Bangloy, under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act, and (ii) and added the names of Theron Beattie, and Brodin and Jreyden Bangloy, to the Band List of the Fort Good Hope Band under s. 11(2)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[39] In a letter to the Indian Registration Administrator of the Fort Good Hope Band dated January 4, 2013, the Indian Registrar provided the following rationale for registering Theron Beattie under s. 6(2) of the Indian Act:\nRationale:\nParent category (T\u2019Seluq Beattie) amended from 6(2) to 6(1)(c.1) pursuant to the 2011 amendments to the Indian Act - Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act. His mother, JOYCE WILMA BEATTIE nee HARRIS, born on 1949\/12\/04, registered under section 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act under Register No.7520073601. Amended from 6(1)(f) to paragraph 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act on 2013\/01\/03. Original entitlement based on paragraph 2(d)(ii) of the Indian Act , R.S.C. 1927, c. 98 which reads that \u201cany child\u201d of a male person is entitled to registration. Therefore, as a child who was custom adopted on 1949\/12\/08, by a registered Indian she would have been entitled to registration at the time of the adoption. She married BRUCE ALLAN BEATTIE, a non-Indian, on 1974\/04\/06.\n[40] Although the Complainant\u2019s registration request had now been addressed, the Respondent continued to refuse to change her statutory band membership. The parties exchanged further particulars dealing with that issue. In its Amended Statement of Particulars the Respondent acknowledged that the Complainant was entitled to have her name added to the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band List, but said it could not implement that change because her name was already on the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band, and the only way she could move her name to Gwichya Gwich\u2019in would be \u201c...by transferring her membership pursuant to paragraph 12(b) of the Indian Act\u201d.\n[41] In letters to the Respondent\u2019s counsel dated March 27 and April 18, 2013, the Complainant\u2019s representative requested that the Respondent delete the names of the Complainant, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), T\u2019Seluq Beattie, Jreyden Bangloy, Brodin Bangloy and Theron Beattie from the Fort Good Hope Band List.\n[42] By letter to the Complainant\u2019s representative dated April 29, 2013, the Acting Indian Registrar advised that, among other things, (i) the names of the Complainant, Nikota Bangloy (nee Beattie), T\u2019Seluq Beattie, Jreyden Bangloy and Brodin Bangloy had been removed from the Fort Good Hope Band list on April 29, 2013, and (ii) the name of Theron Beattie would be removed from the Fort Good Hope Band List on April 30, 2013. In doing so the Respondent changed its previous position about not deleting the Complainant and her descendants from the Band List for Fort Good Hope without a \u201ctransfer\u201d under s. 12(d) of the Indian Act.\n[43] It is open to the Complainant and her descendants to apply to have their names added to the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band List, if they wish. The Complainant has confirmed that she no longer wants this to happen.\nIII. Issues [44] The Complaint gives rise to the following issues:\na) Has the matter been rendered moot by the amendment of the Complainant\u2019s category of registration in January of 2013, and by the removal of her name from the Band List for Fort Good Hope in April of 2013?\nb) Have the Complainant and the Commission met their burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status and\/or sex, contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA?\nc) If there was prima facie discrimination, has the Respondent met its burden of proving that it had a bona fide justification for its initial refusals to make the requested amendments to the Complainant\u2019s category of registration and band membership in June, 2010?\nd) If there was prima facie discrimination that did not have a bona fide justification, what remedies would be appropriate?\nIV. Summary of the Commission\u2019s Submissions [45] In her letter dated June 2, 2010, the Complainant asked the Respondent to amend her category of registration from s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c), based on her custom adoption, and to remove her name from the Band List for Fort Good Hope Band and add it to the Band List for the band of her adoptive parents the Arctic Red River Band (753 Gwichya Gwich\u2019in NT). At issue is whether, in responding to those requests the Respondent was engaged in the provision of \u201cservices customarily available to the general public\u201d, within meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[46] \u201cServices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 contemplates something of benefit being held out as a service and offered to the public, in the context of a public relationship. Because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the \u201ccustomarily available to the general public\u201d requirement in s. 5 will usually be present in cases relating to government conduct.\n[47] Granting the Complainant\u2019s requests would have led to the conferral of benefits that were not otherwise available.\n[48] The Respondent was engaged in the provision of services within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA when it processed the Complainant\u2019s request and made its determinations about her entitlements to the registration and band membership being sought as it involved an exercise of discretion by the Respondent, in the course of processing an application to determine whether an applicant does or does not meet the registration criteria in the Indian Act.\n[49] Unlike Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7 (\u201cMurphy\u201d); Matson et al. v. Indian & Northern Affairs Canada (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada), 2013 CHRT 13 (\u201cMatson\u201d); and Andrews et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21 (\u201cAndrews\u201d), this is a case where the Respondent had discretion in its processing of the Complainant\u2019s request in interpreting the definition of \u201cchild\u201d in the 1927 Indian Act. In initially choosing a narrower definition of the 1927 Indian Act that excluded custom adopted children, the Respondent was exercising discretion in the course of processing the application rather than applying mandatory legislative wording. Its choices in that regard are properly reviewable under s. 5 of the CHRA, as matters relating to the provision of services customarily available to the general public.\n[50] During the period between the initial request (June 2, 2010) and the eventual amendment of registration category (confirmed January 3, 2013), the Respondent denied the service sought by the Complainant - namely, a proper non-discriminatory assessment of her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act. This was a denial of a service within the meaning of s. 5(a) of the CHRA. In the alternative, during that same period, the Respondent adversely differentiated against the Complainant in the provision of a service. Specifically, in assessing her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) during this time, the Respondent chose to draw distinctions between biological children and custom adopted children. This was adverse differentiation within the meaning of s. 5(b) of the CHRA.\n[51] The Respondent maintained its refusal of the Complainant\u2019s request with respect to registration for at least two years after GEIRA came into force on January 31, 2011. The refusal to amend her registration category had negative impacts on the Complainant\u2019s ability to transmit status entitlements to her descendants throughout this time period and ensuring government records properly reflected her custom adoption recognizing the correct parent-child relationship.\n[52] In this case, the Respondent has acknowledged that the initial barrier to granting the request to amend registration category was that the Complainant was a custom adoptee, and as such was not treated as the \u201cchild\u201d of her adoptive father under the 1927 Indian Act, and could only be registered under s. 6(1)(f) or 6(2). In this sense, the Respondent\u2019s denial or adverse differentiation was based on the Complainant\u2019s status as a custom adoptee - a matter that is captured under the prohibited ground of \u201cfamily status\u201d under the CHRA.\n[53] In refusing to give legal effect to the custom adoption within the context of the registration scheme, the Respondent effectively excluded the Complainant for nearly two and a half years from accessing the category of 6 (1)(c) registration, which had been introduced in 1985 to partially remedy the historic sex discrimination in the marrying-out provisions of the Indian Act. In this sense, the discriminatory practice identified by the Commission, while rooted in issues of family status, also had an intersecting adverse impact based on the Complainant\u2019s identity as an aboriginal woman.\n[54] The Respondent\u2019s changes in its position on registration and band membership of the Complainant is effectively an admission that the previous exclusionary approach was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the applicable jurisprudence, and that the previous approach therefore did not have a bona fide justification within the meaning of the CHRA and applicable case law.\n[55] The Complaint should not be dismissed for mootness as there are still live remedial claims since the revisions by the Respondent to its position vis a vis registration and band membership. In order to adjudicate its merits, the Tribunal must, among other things, determine whether the Respondent has or has not engaged in discriminatory practice.\n[56] The Tribunal should order under s. 53(2)(a) that the Respondent take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to prevent the same or similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future.\nV. Summary of the Complainant\u2019s Submissions [57] The Complainant agrees with and adopts the Commission\u2019s submissions.\n[58] The Complainant argues that she and her descendants have been denied the administrative services mandated by Treaty 11, in particular, proper treaty band membership, annuity payment and education funding and record keeping.\n[59] By amendment of the Indian Act entitlement rules in 1985 (Bill C-31), registration is no longer linked to statutory band membership and can have no effect on any existing treaty band membership. As a result, Indian Act registration has had no relevance or effect on treaty entitlement since 1982 as a result of the enactment of the Constitution Act, and at least since 1985, treaty annuity paylists are not the same as statutory Band Lists and do not determine statutory band membership. Legal entitlement to band membership is based on different personal qualifications. Treaty band membership is constitutional and based exclusively on natural descent from an original treaty adherent and current family status. Statutory band membership is not constitutional and is based exclusively on either s. 11 rules or s. 10 delegated band determined rules under the Indian Act, neither of which necessarily require natural descent or any particular family status.\n[60] With the repeal of s. 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2008, extended in 2011 to \u201c...complaints against a First Nations government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs and services under the Indian Act, .\u201d all of the Indian Registry administrative services, including both regular statutory registration as well as verification of the relevant facts of individual treaty entitlement and treaty band affiliation, are now subject to both human rights principles and constitutional protection of all existing aboriginal, treaty or land claim rights. The constitutional obligation to give primacy to existing aboriginal and treaty rights when applying human rights principles to the Indian Act is confirmed as follows:\n1.1 For greater certainty, the repeal of section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act shall not be construed so as to abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for existing aboriginal or treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada by the recognition and affirmation of those rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n[61] In accordance with the terms of Treaty 11, the Complainant, her two children and her three grandchildren are all Treaty 11 Indians and have been since the time of each of their respective births, because they have all been officially recognized by Canada to be natural descendants of original treaty adherents and have been officially recognized by Canada to be either Treaty 11 adherents or are children of adherents. They are also all members of the Loucheaux Indians No. 6 Treaty 11 Band of Arctic Red River, because that is the treaty band that Canada has recognized the Complainant to have been a member of as a result of her aboriginal custom adoption and her natural descendants are entitled to be members of that same treaty band which still exists on treaty annuity paylists. All of which has been guaranteed to each of them by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 since April 17, 1982.\n[62] Treaty 11 Indian adherents are also constitutionally entitled to be correctly identified in all of Canada\u2019s administrative records including treaty annuity paylists and the Indian Register.\n[63] After the first annuity payment to any Treaty 11 adherent, records of all subsequent annual payments are maintained as perpetual service provided by the Respondent with no adhesion re-qualification ever required and all family status or band affiliation changes are simply noted on the paylists at the time of each annual payment.\n[64] Up to and including the year 2011, the Respondent has provided necessary Treaty 11 administrative services and paid treaty annuity to the Complainant and each of her children for every year of their lives from their respective births. The Complainant and her children have been thereby officially recognized as Treaty 11 adherents and paid treaty annuities based on nothing more than their birth records showing that they are natural descendants of original 1921 Treaty 11 adherents. Official birth records, where they even exist, are all that any descendent Treaty 11 adherent since 1921 has ever been required to provide proof of their treaty entitlement and to be included on the Treaty 11 annuity pay list for the treaty band of their family ancestors.\n[65] In 2011, the Complainant\u2019s children provided the Respondent with copies of the birth certificates for their natural children and, as heads of their families, requested payment of Treaty 11 annuity for themselves and their children. The Respondent refused to pay any annuity for any of the Complainant\u2019s grandchildren on the grounds that they were not registered under the Indian Act.\n[66] The Complainant argues that the decisions made in 2011 by the Respondent\u2019s regional treaty administration official effectively denied goods (treaty annuity) and services (inclusion on annuity pay list), which are the only services offered by the Respondent to facilitate Treaty 11 adhesion, and the denial was based on the irrelevant fact of the grandchildren\u2019s Indian Act status as \u201cnon-registered\u201d children and were thereby arbitrarily deemed not to be descendants of original Treaty 11 adherents. The Complainant argues those administrative decisions have no justification under either the terms of Treaty 11 or any provision of the Indian Act, and are therefore infringement of constitutionally guaranteed Treaty 11 rights.\n[67] Pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, the Complainant seeks a declaration that the Complainant, her two children and her three grandchildren have all been Treaty 11 Indians from their respective births and are therefore personally entitled to the existing rights, benefits and privileges constitutionally guaranteed to Treaty 11 Indians, including membership in the Complainant\u2019s originally named Loucheaux Indians No.6 Treaty 11 Band of Arctic Red River, and to be officially recorded as such on the treaty annuity paylists for that Treaty 11 band.\n[68] Pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) and (d) of the CHRA, the Complainant claims, for the benefit of her three grandchildren, immediate payment by the Respondent of Treaty 11 annuity arrears for each year of each of their respective lives and reimbursement of all tuition expenses incurred to date to obtain the educational instruction of those grandchildren which the Respondent promised to pay under the terms of Treaty 11 but have withheld pending the outcome of this Complaint.\n[69] As the victims of willful and reckless conduct, the Complainant claims that she, her two children and three grandchildren are each entitled to claim additional compensation from the Respondent under s. (3) of the CHRA.\nVI. Summary of the Respondent\u2019s Submissions [70] There is no longer a live controversy between the parties relating to the Complainant\u2019s registration entitlement as a result of the Respondent\u2019s reversal of its position on December 9, 2013 and, as such, this issue is moot.\n[71] There is no longer a live controversy between the parties in relation to statutory band membership as a result of the Respondent\u2019s reversal of its position on deletion of her and her descendants\u2019 names from the Fort Good Hope Band List on April 29, 2013 and because the Complainant has withdrawn her request to have her name added to the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band List and, as such, this issue is also moot.\n[72] The Complaint is a challenge to legislation, and nothing else, just as in Matson. The Complaint addresses interpreting s. 6 of the Indian Act, and interpreting the term \u201cchild\u201d in the 1927 Indian Act.\n[73] The Registrar interpreted the word \u201cchild\u201d in order to apply s. 6 to determine correctly the Complainant\u2019s registration category as an Indian and in so doing, exercised no discretion. When the Registrar subsequently reviewed and changed its interpretation, it also did not exercise discretion (s. 6 affords no discretion regarding the treatment of custom adoptees), but rather corrected an erroneous interpretation of the statute.\n[74] The Complainant takes issue, not with the manner in which her application for registration was processed, but rather with the Registrar\u2019s statutory interpretation of the word \u201cchild\u201d and the eligibility rules prescribed in s. 6 of the Indian Act. These criteria, prescribed by Parliament, which has jurisdiction to so under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, cannot reasonably be termed a \u201cservice\u201d. Parliamentary law making is not a service.\n[75] The term \u201cservice\u201d does not contemplate Parliament\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian\u201d under the Indian Act. A number of specific features militate against such a construal of \u201cservice\u201d: the reasonable accommodation requirement, the concept of undue hardship, and the factors of \u201chealth, safety and cost\u201d which inform the bona fide justification analysis. Consideration of these elements demonstrates that a challenge to legislation, as in this Complaint, cannot be appropriately assessed by these mechanisms.\n[76] If the Complaint is found to be a challenge to legislation and nothing else then, following Murphy, Matson, and Andrews the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and therefore the Complaint should be dismissed. In the event that the Complaint is not found to be moot, and is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Respondent argues that its actions were not discriminatory.\n[77] While the Respondent acknowledges that the tests for discrimination by Charter cases and human rights cases may differ, the definition of discrimination used by the Supreme Court of Canada in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 SCR 143, has been applied by the Federal Court in relation to the CHRA. In Andrews, Justice McIntyre wrote:\nI would say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.\n[78] The denial of the Complainant\u2019s request to have her registration entitlement changed from being pursuant to s. 6(1)(f) to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act did not impose \u201cburdens, obligations or disadvantages...not imposed upon others\u201d nor did it \u201climit access to opportunities, benefits and advantages available to other members of society\u201d at the time of her demand nor at the time of the Respondent\u2019s response.\n[79] The only objective difference between the registration entitlement and band membership that Complainant had and the registration entitlement and band membership that she sought, is that with the remedial revisions to the Indian Act made through GEIRA, which took effect January 31, 2011, registration pursuant to s. 6(1)(c), would enable the Complainant to transmit registration entitlement to her grandsons. Prior to that there was no difference vis a vis transmission of status between ss. 6(1)(f) and 6(1)(c). Regardless of her registration status, the grandsons could not have been registered as Indians, pursuant to the Indian Act, prior to January 31, 2011. Furthermore, by virtue of s. 11 of the Indian Act they could not have their names added to the Band List of the Fort Good Hope Band or the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band.\n[80] The Respondent argues that issues relating to the Complainant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed aboriginal and treaty rights are not within the scope of this Complaint, which relates to registration and band membership pursuant to the Indian Act, and have not been proven in any event.\n[81] The scope of the Complaint relates to the Complainant\u2019s June 2, 2010 request for changes to her registration status and band membership pursuant to the Indian Act to reflect her custom adoption. For this reason, compensation or allegations of infringement pre-dating the request are beyond the scope of the Complaint.\n[82] Treaty entitlement is tied to band membership in a band that signed or adhered to a treaty. Until the Complainant\u2019s grandsons became entitled to band membership in the Fort Good Hope Band or the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band, after GEIRA came into effect, they had no treaty entitlement under Treaty 11.\n[83] If the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this Complaint, and the Complaint is not moot, and the Tribunal finds that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant, the Respondent argues in the further alternative that its actions were justified as bona fide pursuant to s. 15(1)(g) and 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[84] The Complainant\u2019s request for a declaration is beyond the scope of the Complaint and beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make as it does not fall within the scope of s. 53(2)(c) and (d) of the CHRA. Furthermore, the evidence heard does not establish that the Complainant\u2019s grandchildren had treaty entitlement since birth. The evidence shows that the Loucheaux No. 6 Band is the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in Band and that the Respondent has not kept treaty annuity paylists for the Loucheaux No. 6 Band since 1955.\n[85] The Respondent\u2019s actions cannot be characterized as intentionally discriminatory or devoid of caution as is required to sustain an Order under section 53(3) of the CHRA. There is no evidence to support the finding that the Respondent \u201cintended and perhaps wanted to discriminate\u201d against the Complainant.\n[86] In the event that the alleged discrimination is substantiated and a public interest remedy is ordered, the Respondent requests that the Respondent be given 6 months to create and implement the Directive.\nVII. Analysis A. Has the matter been rendered moot? [87] The fact that after initially refusing to do so the Respondent changed its positions with respect to the Complainant\u2019s requests of June 2, 2010 to register her under s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act and to remove her name from the Band List for the Fort Good Hope band and add it to the Band List of the Gwichya Gwich\u2019in band, based on her custom adoption, does not, in my opinion, render moot the issue of whether the Respondent\u2019s initial refusal, prior to its change of positions, constituted discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA and, if so, whether and what remedies flow from such discrimination.\n[88] While remedies under s. 53 of the CHRA cannot be imposed unless there is a finding by the Tribunal that a Complaint has been substantiated, the contrary is not true. The Tribunal can find that a Complaint is substantiated without imposing a remedy. If a person voluntarily ceases the conduct that is alleged by a Complainant to be discriminatory prior to a hearing being held into the Complaint, the Complaint can still be found to be substantiated by the Tribunal for the period of time prior to the cessation that the conduct took place, notwithstanding that a remedy may not be imposed. Hence a matter does not become moot simply because the person allegedly carrying on the impugned conduct decides to stop the conduct or because no remedial order might be imposed if the Tribunal makes a finding that the conduct was discriminatory while it was carried on and finds that the Complaint is substantiated.\n[89] In this case, not only is liability still a live issue respecting conduct by the Respondent before it chose to change its positions but the issue of remedies both personal and public interest also remain live despite the change in positions.\n[90] Moreover, as the hearing has been held and the issues fully argued in an adversarial context involving important quasi-constitutional rights, there is no valid argument here in support of saving scarce judicial resources, etc., as per the tests set out for mootness by the case law. (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 SCR 342.)\nB. Has discrimination been established? [91] To determine whether the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the roughly two and a half year period from the date of the requests to the dates of the change in positions, constituted discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA, on the basis of family status and sex, as alleged by the Complainant in her Complaint, requires the Complainant initially to establish a prima facie case on the balance of probabilities.\n[92] In order to establish such a case, under s. 5 of the CHRA, it must be proved that:\na) The Respondent was engaged in the provision of \u201cservices customarily available to the general public\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA;\nb) the Respondent either denied the service to the complainant, or adversely differentiated against the complainant in the provision of the services; and\nc) the denial or adverse differentiation was based in whole or in part on a prohibited ground of discrimination, and\/or had a disproportionate adverse impact on persons identified by a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[93] The threshold for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is low. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. Once a Complainant establishes a prima facie case, the Complainant is entitled to relief in the absence of some alternate explanation from the Respondent. (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Canada (Attorney General) 2012 FC 445 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d.))\n[94] The Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that human rights legislation has a quasi-constitutional status and is to be given a large, purposive and liberal interpretation to ensure the remedial goals of the legislation are best achieved. A strict grammatical analysis may thus be subordinated to the remedial purposes of the human rights law so as to enhance rather than enfeeble it. (F.N.C.F.S., supra; C.N.R. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), (1987) S.C.J. No. 42.)\n[95] The term \u201cservices customarily available to the general public\u201d is not defined in the CHRA, however, the case law indicates that \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 contemplates something of benefit being held out as a service and offered to the public, in the context of a public relationship. However, a service does not have to be available to all members of the general public\u201d within the meaning of s. 5. It is sufficient if a segment of the public can avail themselves of the service. (Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, (2008) F.C.J. No. 710; Canada (Attorney General) v. Rosin, (1991) 1. F.C. 391.)\n[96] Services performed by the government are generally deemed to be necessary for and of benefit to the public otherwise they would not need to be performed. Benefits and services are not necessarily synonymous. A service, such as the processing of an application for registration under the Indian Act to determine whether it complies with the legislative requirements for registration represents necessary work performed by government employees, on behalf of and for the benefit of the public (i.e. an applicant). Ultimately, if the work results in the application being approved and registration takes place, certain benefits will be available to the applicant upon registration, such as non-insured health benefits, eligibility to seek funding for post-secondary education, and certain tax exemptions. For a complaint to be substantiated under the CHRA, the failure to provide the service in a non-discriminatory manner, either through denial thereof or through adverse differentiation, on the basis of a prohibited ground, must be found to have an adverse or negative impact on a person.\n[97] The Complainant was already registered under s. 6(1)(f) of the Indian Act when she made her request for a change in registration to s. 6(1)(c) and a change in band membership, after advising the Respondent of her custom adoption for the first time in June of 2010. GEIRA had already been introduced and given first reading by the time she made the request, with provisions referred to previously herein, that would allow for her grandchildren to be registered for the first time under s. 6(2) provided that the Respondent recognized her custom adoption for the purposes of her registration under s. 6(1)(c). As such, although she was already receiving benefits available from registration under s. 6(1)(f), by initially denying her requests for the changes in registration and to her band membership, the Respondent, as a result of its incorrect interpretations in processing her request, caused her and her descendants to suffer the following negative or adverse impacts:\ni) She did not receive the benefit of being properly recognized as a custom adoptee of the parents who actually reared her from the time she was four days old. While the Registrar was prepared to note the custom adoption in the Complainant\u2019s records in December 2010, what the Registrar refused to do at that time was give any legal effect to the custom adoption as part of the Respondent\u2019s record keeping regime under s. 6. Failing to give legal effect to her life-long connection to her custom adoptive parents had a negative impact on her as an adoptee by deprecating her dignity. The significance of giving proper recognition to the parent-child connection of adoption has been held to be a service reviewable under human rights law as it marks a \u201clife-affirming process.\u201d (A.A. v. New Brunswick (Department of Family and Community Services), (2004) N.B.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4.)\nii) She did not receive the benefit of being able to have her name removed from a Band List that she was no longer interested in being on by simply requesting the removal of her name, thereby also deprecating her dignity. Neither s. 9 or s. 12 of the Indian Act uses the word \u201ctransfer\u201d such that someone who is on a Band List and wants to be placed on another Band List (or simply doesn\u2019t want to be on any Band List) cannot obtain the removal of her name from the Band List she no longer wants to be on by simply requesting removal of her name, thereby avoiding the unnecessary, demeaning and wasteful exercise of obtaining consents from bands, as initially required by the Respondent in this case.\niii) She did not receive the benefit of being able to transmit s. 6(1)(c.1) status to her children (as opposed to s. 6(2)) and thereby to transmit s. (6)(2) status to their children (who were otherwise not eligible to be registered) when GEIRA came into effect on January 31, 2011 thereby denying her children the opportunity to access tangible benefits available to a person registered as an Indian.\n[98] GEIRA was passed in direct response to the decision of the B.C. Court of Appeal in McIvor holding s. 6 inoperative as a consequence of it being contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and recognizing that the ability to transmit status to one\u2019s child was a benefit provided by the Indian Act, and indicating that it would be inclined to make the same finding about the ability to transmit status to one\u2019s grandchildren as well. GEIRA had already been introduced in Parliament by the time the requests were made in June 2010 and no doubt the new provisions were known to all of the parties at that time. In my opinion, it is perfectly understandable that the Complainant did not make the requests for changes to her status until June of 2010 since without GEIRA there would have been no tangible benefits available through registration to her grandchildren. As such, her delay in making the requests until June of 2010 and the period between the requests and the effective date of GEIRA is of no relevance or significance to this case. (McIvor v. Canada (Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153.)\n[99] The Murphy, Matson and Andrews cases are fundamentally distinguishable from this case on the basis that those cases did not involve complaints about anyone\u2019s conduct in exercising discretion in applying the relevant legislation. Instead, the Complaints in those cases all were directed at legislation and nothing else. In all of those cases changes by Parliament to the relevant legislation itself was what was really being sought through CHRA complaints rather than changes in the way that employees of the government were exercising any discretion in applying the legislation. The Respondent\u2019s excellent witness Ms. Linda McLenachan in fact testified that when the Respondent\u2019s employees eventually changed their positions on the registration request, they did so by viewing the wording of the same legislation with a \u201cdifferent lens\u201d in their interpretation rather than by changing the wording of the legislation through an act of Parliament. The Respondent has admitted its earlier interpretation was incorrect not that any new legislation was required.\n[100] As such, in this case there was clearly a discretion to either interpret the legislation one way or the other with respect to both the change of registration request and the removal of the name from band membership request. Initially, the Respondent refused the requests based on its incorrect legal interpretations but ultimately the Respondent changed its positions without Parliament changing the legislation. In doing so the Respondent obviously knew it had the discretion to change its positions rather than having the legislation amended or it wouldn\u2019t have done so. Presumably these changes were based on what may be described as more \u201cflexible, liberal and purposeful\u201d interpretations. The fact that legal interpretations were obtained in this case from the Respondent\u2019s legal staff does not change the nature of the work performed by employees of the Respondent, as part of processing an application or request, to anything other than a service to the public, notwithstanding that the initial legal opinions were later found by the Respondent to be incorrect and changed.\n[101] In both initially choosing a narrower interpretation of the term \u201cchild\u201d in the 1927 Indian Act that excluded custom adopted children, and in initially choosing a narrower interpretation of s. 12 of the Indian Act that precluded the removal on request of a person\u2019s name from a s. 11 Band List, the Respondent was exercising its discretion in the course of providing the service of processing an application or request.\n[102] Section 5 of the CHRA requires that services customarily available to the general public must be provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Where a statute has ambiguous language that can be interpreted in more than one way, the CHRA requires that the administering department choose the interpretation that is most consistent with human rights law principles. (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4.)\n[103] The Respondent\u2019s initial position with respect to the request for registration under s. 6(1)(c) and removal of the Complainant\u2019s name from the Band List of her biological parents, were both based upon incorrect interpretations of the Indian Act that resulted in negative impacts for the Complainant and her descendants for a period of about two and a half years as described in paragraph 97 herein. In so doing, the Respondent used a restrictive legalistic approach that: (i) did not recognize custom adopted children as falling within the meaning of the word \u201cchild\u201d in the 1927 Indian Act, (ii) limited persons who were custom adopted before April 17, 1985, but who applied for first-time registration after that date, to registration under ss. 6(1)(f) or 6(2) of the Indian Act, and, (iii) did not permit a request for removal of a name from a Band List without obtaining third party consent.\n[104] In making these incorrect initial interpretations the Respondent failed to choose the broad, liberal and purposive interpretations referred to in paragraph 94 herein and failed to choose interpretations that were most consistent with human rights principles referred to in paragraph 102 herein. Rather than using a \u201cdifferent lens\u201d in later changing its interpretations, the Respondent instead should have opened its eyes to the correct interpretations in the first place. It would have saved us all considerable time and effort.\n[105] The Respondent\u2019s initial refusal for two and a half years to amend the Complainant\u2019s registration category and allow her to remove her name from the Fort Good Hope Band List, based upon its incorrect legal interpretations, constituted a denial of a service within the meaning of s. 5(a) of the CHRA as the Respondent\u2019s actions involved an improper discriminatory assessment of her entitlement to registration under s. 6(1)(c) and to her right on request to have her name removed from a Band List she did not want to be on any longer. As well, the Respondent\u2019s actions also constituted adverse differentiation in the provision of a service within the meaning of s. 5(b) as it involved drawing an adverse distinction in its legal interpretations for custom adopted children compared to biological children.\n[106] The denial or adverse differentiation in this case was based upon the Complainant\u2019s status as a custom adoptee and, as such, falls within the prohibited ground of \u201cfamily status\u201d under s. 3 of the CHRA. The Tribunal and the Courts have held that family status includes the relationship between adoptive parents and children and that adverse distinctions drawn between adopted and biological children are discriminatory on the basis of family status under the CHRA. I believe an aboriginal certified custom adoptee is entitled to the same treatment under the law as a legal adoptee. (Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2010 CHRT 23; Canada (Attorney General) v. McKenna, (1998) 1 F.C.J. No. 1501; Grismer v. Squamish Indian Band, 2006 FC 1088; Worthington v. Canada, 2008 FC 409.)\nC. Does the defence of bona fide justification apply in this case? [107] Where a Complainant proves a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA, the burden shifts to the respondent to rebut the prima facie case, either by showing that events did not occur as alleged, or that it had a bona fide justification for its conduct, under s. 15(1)(g) of 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[108] The defence of bona fide justification under the CHRA is to be interpreted and applied in light of Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, which establishes that it will only be made out where, among other things, the approach taken by the respondent was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d, in the sense that departing from the approach would have caused undue hardship. (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), (1999) 3 S.C.R. 868.)\n[109] In this case, the Respondent has already changed its approach, at least insofar as the Complainant is concerned, by (i) amending her category of registration to s. 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act, (ii) recognizing her entitlement to be added to the Band List for the band of her custom adoptive parents and, (iii) removing her name from the Band List of the Fort Good Hope band. This is effectively an admission that the previous exclusionary approach was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the applicable jurisprudence, and that the previous approach therefore did not have a bona fide justification within the meaning of the CHRA and applicable case law.\nVIII. Decision [110] On the basis of the foregoing reasons, I find that the Complaint in this matter has been substantiated.\nIX. Remedies [111] Section 53 of the CHRA includes the following provisions relative to remedies:\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensations not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member of the panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[112] As noted in paragraphs 67 and 68 herein, the Complainant seeks remedies of a declaration and an order for payment for breach of individual treaty rights that she alleges arise out of the breach by the Respondent of Treaty 11 rights on behalf of herself and her descendants. In this respect, the Complainant has tried to expand the Complaint beyond what it really was as referred to in paragraph 2 herein, arising out of the refusal of the Respondent of her requests of June of 2010 to change her registration status and to remove her name from her former Band List. I have no jurisdiction to make such a declaration or award such payments both because there was no evidentiary basis presented in support of this position at the hearing and because these allegations and remedies are beyond the scope of the matters at issue at the hearing and the above legislation governing remedies.\n[113] The Complainant did not claim compensation under s. 53 (2) (e) under the Act for pain and suffering in spite of my specifically asking her representative about this at the hearing. As such, it would be unfair to the Respondent for me to now make an order under that provision despite my findings of the impacts of its discriminatory conduct. I do feel, however, on the evidence before me, that the conduct of the Respondent in refusing the Complainant\u2019s requests was done with full knowledge of the consequences to the Complainant and her descendants of its actions over the two and a half years before it changed its positions. In my opinion, the later interpretations that it chose to make with respect to these requests should have been clear to the Respondent from the outset in keeping with the purposeful and liberal attitude that should be adopted in making interpretations of this nature in these circumstances. As such, I find that its conduct in this respect was intentional and willful and falls within s. 53 (3) above.\n[114] As well, I believe that the public interest remedies requested by the Commission are in order, subject to a six months period to create and implement the directives as requested by the Respondent. In this regard I am pleased to know that the Respondent had, at the time of the hearing, already begun the drafting of the necessary directives.\nX. Order [115] Therefore, the Tribunal orders and directs as follows:\nA. That the Respondent cease the discriminatory practices of:\ni) refusing to recognize the adopted child of a male Indian as a \u201cchild\u201d of the male Indian, as that term was used in the 1927 Indian Act; and\nii) refusing to consider first-time registrations for adoptees who were adopted before April 17, 1985, under any provisions other than ss. 6(1)(f) or 6(2) of the Indian Act;\nB. The Respondent, within six months of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision,\ni) issue a bulletin, directive or comparable document to all staff involved in the processing of applications for registration under the Indian Act, advising that (i) the term \u201cchild\u201d as used in the 1927 Indian Act to be interpreted to include both biological and adopted children, and (ii) persons who were adopted before 1985 may be entitled to be registered as Indians under sections other than ss. 6(1)(f) or 6(2) of the Indian Act, depending on their particular individual circumstances; and\nii) send a copy of the bulletin, directive or comparable document to the Commission, together with confirmation that the bulletin has been issued to all staff involved in the processing of applications for registration under the Indian Act.\nC. That the Respondent, within one month of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, pay the Complainant the amount of $5,000.00 as special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the CHRA.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Introduction [1] In a complaint dated February 8, 2005, filed under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), Levan Turner alleged that the Respondent, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), then known as the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), engaged in a discriminatory practice on the grounds of age, race, national or ethnic origin, and colour, in a matter related to employment. In his Statement of Particulars, the Complainant raised the further issue of perceived disability: obesity.\n[2] Mr. Turner\u2019s claim arises out of the manner in which he was excluded from two staffing processes for employment as Customs Inspector with the CCRA and its Canada Customs and Immigration successor, the CBSA. After being interviewed Mr. Turner was declared not qualified in a Victoria job opportunity posted October 11, 2003 (Victoria Competition 7003), and was declared to be ineligible following a first interview in the other process, a Vancouver job opportunity posted June 9, 2003 (Vancouver Competition 1002).\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) conducted an inquiry in Victoria B.C. on November 17 - 21, 2008, January 19 - 22, 2009, and concluded the inquiry by teleconference on March 17, 2009.\n[4] On June 10, 2010, the Tribunal dismissed Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint:\n[183] I have concluded that CBSA has provided a reasonable explanation as to why Mr. Turner did not qualify for a CI position in either the Vancouver 1002 competition or the Victoria 7003 competition. I have also concluded that there is nothing in the evidence or in CBSA\u2019s explanation that can be considered pretextual.\n[184] For these reasons, I have concluded that Mr. Turner has not substantiated his complaint. Accordingly, it is dismissed.\n[5] The Tribunal\u2019s decision made no mention of perceived disability, which had been raised in evidence and argument by the Complainant along with the grounds of age, race, and national and ethnic origin.\nII. Judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal [6] In a unanimous judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Mainville on May 30, 2012, the Federal Court of Appeal set aside the judicial review judgment of the Federal Court and referred Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint back to the Tribunal for re-determination by a different member.\n[7] Paragraphs 3 to 11 of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal summarize the background circumstances which are relevant to a re-determination by the Tribunal.\n[3] The appellant describes himself as a large black male. He is currently employed with Service Canada. The appellant\u2019s complaint arises out of two competitions for full-time regular customs inspector positions with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (\u201cCCRA\u201d), to which the Canada Border Services Agency was a successor. At the time he applied for each competition, he was working as a seasonal customs inspector in Victoria, British Columbia, and had done so from 1998 to 2003. As a seasonal customs inspector, the appellant had always received positive written performance reviews from his supervisors.\n[4] The first competition, posted by the CCRA on June 9, 2003, was for a customs inspector position in Vancouver. The second competition, posted on October 11, 2003, was for a similar position in Victoria (\u201cVictoria 7003\u201d).\n[5] In addition to the usual criteria to be satisfied, an eligibility restriction was added for the Vancouver competition, which provided that \u201c[a]pplicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be eligible for this process\u201d (Appeal Book (\u201cAB\u201d) at page 822). Because the appellant had not been interviewed for a customs inspector position in Vancouver, he considered himself eligible for the competition and thus applied. He passed the Customs Inspector Test required of all candidates. The next phase in the competition process involved two interviews. The appellant was invited to the first interview, which was held on April 26, 2004 and which he passed. However, one of the members of the interview panel recognized the appellant as having previously been unsuccessfully interviewed for customs inspector positions in Victoria. Although the appellant was successful in the first interview for the Vancouver position, he was subsequently disqualified from the competition because he was deemed to fall within the ambit of the above-described eligibility restriction.\n[6] The appellant was the only candidate disqualified from the Vancouver competition on the basis of the eligibility restriction. At least one other candidate had also unsuccessfully applied for customs inspector positions in Victoria. In one case, the candidate had failed the paper review of her portfolio of competencies for a position in Victoria and had thus not proceeded to an interview for the Victoria position. This candidate was not disqualified from the Vancouver competition. Another candidate bearing the same name as someone who had failed an interview for a Victoria competition was also not disqualified from the Vancouver competition; however, there was some confusion as to his identity.\n[7] In the light of this, the appellant questioned the reasons for his disqualification, and requested further information from the CCRA. He received no reply to his inquiry.\n[8] The appellant qualified for the Victoria 7003 competition, but he failed to pass the interview for this competition. That interview was held on December 13, 2003. The selection board for the competition failed him on two competencies: (a) effective interactive communication and (b) teamwork and cooperation.\n[9] Prior to these interviews, his supervisor had sent a long email to a number of members of the CCRA management group setting out the perceived failings of the appellant. The email was dated October 4, 2003, and was thus sent out approximately two months before the appellant\u2019s interview for the Victoria 7003 competition and a little less than seven months prior to his interview for the Vancouver competition. The email noted that the appellant was perceived as someone who \u201csometimes shies away from the harder tasks, or knows the right procedure (a difficult task) to take but ask to supt [sic] hoping the supt [sic] will use their discretion and go the easier way. It was also pointed out how other inspectors had complained that he had left cash outs for others to do instead of doing them on his shift.\u201d The email also noted that \u201cthere is a portion of [the appellant] that does look for the easy way out \u2026\u201d AB at pp. 321-22.\n[10] The appellant strongly denied the allegations made in that email, which contradicted the positive formal written evaluations that all his supervisors had given him, including the supervisor who had drafted the email. The appellant was the only seasonal employee who was the subject of such an email.\n[11] In light of his years of service as a seasonal customs inspector in Victoria, his positive employment evaluations, and his past experience in law enforcement-related activities, the appellant formed the belief that his disqualification from the Vancouver competition and his failure to pass the interview for the Victoria 7003 competition were the result of his being unfairly stereotyped within the CCRA as a \u201cbig lazy black man.\u201d\n[8] While the appellant raised a number of arguments before the Court of Appeal, the Court found that it need only consider the \u201cprinciple ground of appeal\u201d \u2013 the argument that the Tribunal failed to consider perceived disability as a ground of discrimination. The Court found this argument to be well-founded (para. 2).\n[9] The Court observed that the Tribunal made no mention of \u201cperceived disability on the basis of weight\u201d (para. 21), despite the fact that this ground was raised in Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint form and statement of particulars, was discussed many times during the course of the proceedings, and was \u201cargued as an important point in the appellant\u2019s written submissions to the Tribunal\u201d (para. 46). The Court found that \u201cthe Tribunal member indicated that he understood that perceived disability was being raised by the appellant\u201d (para. 26). In light of this, the Court found the silence of the Tribunal on this issue to be troubling:\n[33] In this context, the complete silence of the Tribunal on the issue of perceived disability is troubling. Did the Tribunal refuse to consider this ground of discrimination on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to do so? Or was the Tribunal of the view that perceived disability involving weight does not constitute a ground of discrimination contemplated by the Canadian Human Rights Act? Or did the Tribunal find that the appellant had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on this ground? And if so, why did the Tribunal disregard the arguments of the appellant concerning the importance of intersecting or compound grounds of discrimination, and the principles set out in Radek? (cited infra) Or did the Tribunal simply forget to address these issues? In the absence of any discussion in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons, we simply do not know the answers to these questions.\n[10] Considering these various possibilities, the Court observed that a finding by the Tribunal that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the ground of perceived disability in this case would raise \u201cserious questions... as to the propriety of such a finding in light of the Tribunal\u2019s own past jurisprudence\u201d, and would also raise fairness concerns \u201cin light of the explicit request of the appellant to be allowed an opportunity to submit an amendment in the event of such a finding\u201d (para. 34). Further, in the absence of a finding on whether the ground of perceived disability was properly before the Tribunal, \u201cthe [Tribunal\u2019s] conclusion that a non-discriminatory explanation existed may be questioned, since this conclusion may have been reached in circumstances where not all of the alleged grounds of discrimination were properly addressed\u201d (para. 47).\n[11] If, in the alternative, the Tribunal made an unstated finding that the appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of perceived disability, the Court found that \u201cit failed to state the reasons for reaching such a conclusion\u201d (para. 36). The Tribunal\u2019s failure to deal adequately with this ground was the basis upon which the Court overturned the Tribunal\u2019s decision:\n[50] In my view, the appellant\u2019s complaint that he was also discriminated against on the grounds of disability was before the Tribunal and was sufficiently significant that the Tribunal was under a duty to deal with it or to explain why it did not. In the absence of any reasons in the Tribunal\u2019s decision or of a clear answer in the record, it is not the role of a reviewing court to speculate as to why the Tribunal did not deal with the issue of perceived disability or what conclusion the Tribunal would have reached if it had addressed the issue. Insofar as the reviewing court has reasonable concerns as to the potential outcome of the proceeding had the issue been addressed by the Tribunal, the judicial review application should be allowed.\n[12] The Court found that it was not in a position to review the legal question of whether perceived disability on the basis of weight is a prohibited ground of discrimination contemplated by the CHRA, as this would be a speculative exercise in the absence of a finding and reasons by the Tribunal on this point (para. 35).\n[13] In addition to the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the ground of perceived disability, the Court of Appeal devoted considerable attention to the Complainant\u2019s argument regarding intersecting or compound grounds of discrimination, which it found had been disregarded by the Tribunal (para. 33, quoted above). The Court observed:\n[48] In his written submissions to the Tribunal, the appellant also referred to the concept of intersecting grounds of discrimination, which, at a basic level, holds that when multiple grounds of discrimination are present, their combined effect may be more than the sum of their individual effects. The concept of intersecting grounds also holds that analytically separating these multiple grounds minimizes what is, in fact, compound discrimination. When analyzed separately, each ground may not justify individually a finding of discrimination, but when the grounds are considered together, another picture may emerge.\n[14] The Court referred to a multi-dimensional approach to defining disability, outlined by the Supreme Court in Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Montr\u00e9al (City); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Boisbriand (City), 2000 SCC 27 (\u201cBoisbriand\u201d):\n\u2026 Instead a multi-dimensional approach to defining disability that includes a socio-political dimension and which places emphasis on human dignity, respect and the right to equality rather than on simple biomedical conditions. As noted by L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. at para. 77 of the reasons in that case, \u201cthis approach recognizes that the attitudes of society and its members often contribute to the idea or perception of a \u2018handicap\u2019. In fact, a person may have no limitation in everyday activities other than those created by prejudice and stereotypes.\u201d\n(para. 30)\n[15] The Court noted that s. 3.1 of the CHRA \u201cspecifically provides that a discriminatory practice includes a practice based on the effect of a combination of prohibited grounds\u201d, and observed that the analysis of the primary ground of a complaint must not ignore the other grounds and \u201cthe possibility that compound discrimination may have occurred as a result of the intersection of these grounds\u201d (para. 49). It quoted with approval at para. 31 the analysis of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal in Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and Securiguard Services Ltd. (No. 3), 2005 BCHRT 302 (\u201cRadek\u201d) at paras. 464 \u2013 465:\n[464] The interrelationship between a number of intersecting grounds of discrimination is sometimes described as \"intersectionality\". The concept of intersectionality has been discussed in a number of recent decisions, including: Morrison v. Motsewetsho (2003), 48 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (Ont. H.R.T.), Comeau v. Cote, [2003] BCHRT 32, and Baylis-Flannery v. DeWilde (No. 2) (2003), 48 C.H.R.R. D\/197 (Ont. H.R.T.). As described in Baylis-Flannery, \"[a]n intersectional analysis of discrimination is a fact-driven exercise that assesses the disparate relevancy and impact of the possibility of compound discrimination\": at para. 143. Speaking there in a case of sexual harassment against [sic] a Black woman, the Tribunal stated that an awareness of the effect of compound discrimination is necessary in order to avoid:\nreliance on a single axis analysis where multiple grounds of discrimination are found, [which] tends to minimize or even obliterate the impact of racial discrimination on women of colour who have been discriminated against on other grounds, rather than recognize the possibility of the compound discrimination that may have occurred. (at para. 144)\n[465] The same could be said in the present case with respect to race, colour, ancestry and disability. While the primary focus of Ms. Radek\u2019s individual complaint is her race, colour and ancestry, the analysis of those grounds must not ignore her disability, and the possibility of the compound discrimination which may have occurred.\n[16] The Court also found other aspects of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to be problematic, including: the Tribunal\u2019s choice not to make a finding on whether a prima facie case of discrimination had been established in relation to the grounds of race or of national and ethnic origin, but instead to assume such a case was established and examine whether the employer had provided a reasonable explanation (paras. 14-15); and, the failure to make findings of fact regarding \u201cthe truthfulness of the alleged failings of the appellant set out in his supervisor\u2019s email\u201d, and \u201chow and to what extent that email may have influenced the selection processes\u201d (para. 15).\n[17] This appellate-directed Tribunal decision by Member Wallace Gilby Craig is based on consideration of all viva voce testimony, pertinent exhibits, opening statements and argument of Counsel (written and oral), and, particularly, oral argument of Counsel in Victoria on\nNovember 20 and 21, 2013.\nIII. Legal Framework A. Prima facie case [18] The initial evidentiary burden in a case of discrimination under the CHRA requires a complainant to adduce credible evidence which establishes facts, directly or by inference, that he\/she was the victim of a discriminatory practice as defined in the CHRA. The prima-facie-standard was established by the Supreme Court in OHRC and O\u2019Malley v Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536, (O\u2019Malley):\n[28] \u2026 I agree then with the Board of Inquiry that each case will come down to a question of proof, and therefore there must be a clearly-recognized and clearly-assigned burden of proof in these cases as in all civil proceedings. To whom should it be assigned? Following the well-settled rule in civil cases, the plaintiff bears the burden. He who alleges must prove. Therefore, under the Etobicoke rule as to burden of proof, the showing of a prima facie case of discrimination, I see no reason why it should not apply in cases of adverse discrimination. The complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2011employer. \u2026\n[19] In Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2005] F.C.J. No. 731 [F.C.A] (Morris), at paragraphs 27and 28, the Court concluded that:\n[27] \u2026 [T]he legal definition of a prima facie case does not require the Commission to adduce any particular type of evidence to prove the facts necessary to establish that the complainant was the victim of a discriminatory practice as defined in the Act. Paragraph 7(b) requires only that a person was differentiated adversely on a prohibited ground in the course of employment. It is a question of mixed fact and law whether the evidence adduced in any given case is sufficient to prove adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground, if believed and not satisfactorily explained by the respondent.\n[28] A flexible legal test of a prima facie case is better able than more precise tests to advance the broad purpose underlying the Canadian Human Rights Act, namely the elimination in the federal legislative sphere of discrimination from employment and from the provision of goods, services, facilities and accommodation. Discrimination takes new and subtle forms. Moreover, as counsel for the Commission pointed out, it is now recognized that comparative evidence of discrimination comes in many more forms than the particular one identified in Shakes.\n[20] Once a prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory: Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 41 at para. 189; Canada (Attorney General) v. Lambie, (1996) 124 F.T.R. 303 at para. 16.\n[21] If a reasonable explanation is provided, the Complainant must then demonstrate that it is pretextual: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, [1988] C.H.R.D. No. 2 at para. 38474 (Basi).\nB. The \u201cSubtle Scent\u201d of Discrimination [22] The fact that discrimination is often subtly practiced within an otherwise appropriate process was dealt with in Basi:\nDiscrimination on the grounds of race or colour is frequently practised in a very subtle manner. Overt discrimination on these grounds is not present in every discriminatory situation or occurrence. In a case where direct evidence is absent, it becomes necessary for the Board to infer discrimination from the conduct of the individual or individuals whose conduct is at issue. This is not always an easy task to carry out. The conduct alleged to be discriminatory must be carefully analyzed and scrutinized in the context of the situation in which it arises.\n[23] In Basi it was determined that \u201cthe subtle scent of discrimination\u201d permeated the manner in which the Respondent dealt with the Complainant. The Tribunal concluded that the only inference to draw in those circumstances was that the rationale for not hiring Mr. Basi was pretextual.\nFrankly, the subtle scent of discrimination permeates the entire manner in which CNR dealt with the Human Rights Commission in attempting to justify their actions regarding Basi. I am left with the conclusion that the rationale for not hiring Mr. Basi, as described by Mr. Symenuk, was not as innocent, direct nor reasonable, as first proposed. It appeared to me, from the explanations provided to the Commission and from information contained in the files of the CNR that the Respondent was attempting to justify the actions taken by Mr. Symenuk. The effect of the conflicting explanations and inconsistencies is to leave an inference, not only more probable but irresistible, that either the explanations of Mr. Symenuk with respect to the method of selection, or the subsequent explanations with regard to qualifications etc. (or perhaps both), are pretextual.\n[24] Basi was considered and followed by the Tribunal in Maillet v. Canada (AG), 2005 CHRT 48 at paragraph 6:\n[6] Discrimination is not a practice that one should expect to see displayed overtly. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances in determining if there exists what has been described as the subtle scent of discrimination. In cases involving circumstantial evidence, an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses.\n[25] Discrimination may, for example, occur in conjunction with an otherwise appropriate employment staffing practice. In such cases, the formal explanation for a decision not to hire an individual will amount to a pretext that masks the discriminatory nature of the hiring decision. The Tribunal has applied a three-step test to determine whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been made out in the hiring context. As set out in Florence Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited, (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 [\u201cShakes\u201d] and Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission, (1983) 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 [\u201cIsraeli\u201d] the complainant must show that:\n(1) the complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\n(2) the complainant was not hired; and\n(3) someone obtained the position who was no better qualified than the complainant, but lacked the attribute on which the complainant based their human rights complaint.\n[26] While this test does not automatically apply to every hiring case (see for example Premakumar v. Air Canada, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 3 at para. 77), I am satisfied that it provides, in this instance, a useful guide to assess whether or not the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination.\nC. Perceived Disability [27] In oral argument Counsel asserted that although Mr. Turner was self-evidently obese, nevertheless, he was able to carry out all the duties of a Customs Inspector. Yet despite this, the Victoria superintendents stereotypically perceived Mr. Turner as lazy and untruthful.\n[28] As noted above, the Court questioned whether perceived disability on the basis of weight was properly before the Tribunal. It raises the legal question whether perceived disability on the basis of weight is a prohibited ground of discrimination contemplated by the CHRA.\n[29] Disability is a prohibited ground of discrimination under s. 3 of the CHRA. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in Boisbriand, cited above, it is clear that discrimination on the basis of disability can occur even in the absence of an actual physical or mental limitation on activities, based solely on societal perceptions of one\u2019s limitations. Applying this reasoning, I find that the ground of disability under s. 3 of the Act encompasses perceived disability as well as actual disability. It is also well established that a person\u2019s weight is a characteristic that can ground a claim of discrimination on the basis of disability: Bouchard v. Canadian Armed Forces, [1990] D.T. 12\/90 (CHRT); Hamlyn v. Cominco Ltd., [1989] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 29. The combined effect of these principles, in my view, is that perceived disability on the basis of weight is a prohibited ground of discrimination contemplated by the CHRA.\n[30] I also find that this ground of discrimination is properly before the Tribunal in this case, it was raised in Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint to the Commission and statement of particulars before the Tribunal, and was argued in the Appellant\u2019s written submissions to the Tribunal and discussed repeatedly in oral argument.\nD. Intersectionality [31] As noted above, s. 3.1 of the Act specifically provides that \u201ca discriminatory practice includes a practice based on one or more prohibited grounds of discrimination or on the effect of a combination of prohibited grounds\u201d. In my view, this provision reflects a similar concern to that addressed in Radek, cited above, regarding intersectionality: tribunals should be alive to the \u201cinterrelationship between a number of intersecting grounds of discrimination\u201d (Radek at para. 464). As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in relation to the present case, the analysis of the primary ground of a complaint must not ignore other grounds raised in the complaint, and \u201cthe possibility that compound discrimination may have occurred as a result of the intersection of these grounds\u201d (para. 49).\nE. Racism and Stereotyping in Canada [32] Counsel for the Complainant argued that racism and stereotyping are relevant factors in assessing the propriety of the hiring processes at issue in this case. Counsel for the Complainant cited, in this regard, Sinclair v. London (City), 2008 HRTO 48 (Sinclair) and the adjudicator\u2019s acceptance at paragraph 18 that \u201c\u2026anti-Black racism and its subtle manifestations are well-recognized in Canadian law, and expert evidence of the kind presented in this case, while helpful, is not necessary for its effects to be considered by the Tribunal\u2026\u201d\n[33] In Sinclair the adjudicator relied on R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71 at paragraphs 31-33, and the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s approval of conclusions of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Parks, (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353:\n[31] Parks was a case of second degree murder in which the accused was black and the victim was white. As in this appeal, there was no suggestion that the crime was racially motivated or that race would play any part in the defence (p.361). Nevertheless, Doherty J.A. concluded on the first step that \u201cracism, and in particular anti-black racism, is part of our community\u2019s psyche\u201d (p. 369). He continued:\nA significant segment of our community holds overtly racist views. A much larger segment subconsciously operates on the basis of negative racial stereotypes. Furthermore, our institutions, including the criminal justice system, reflect and perpetuate those negative stereotypes. These elements combine to infect our society as a whole with the evil of racism. Blacks are among the primary victims of that evil. [page 369]\n[34] The adjudicator in Sinclair explained the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in determining the influence of racialization and stereotypes in the particular situation under inquiry: \u201c\u2026 The evaluation of the dynamics of what occurred and witnesses\u2019 credibility are issues to be determined by the Tribunal, through an analysis of evidence that has been admitted in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s rules. Dr. Henry\u2019s opinion on whether stereotypes played a part in the actions of the City witnesses in this case or how general patterns may have played themselves out here are not within her expertise or appropriately taken into account by the Tribunal \u2026\u201d (paragraph 22)\nIV. The Evidence A. Complainant\u2019s Opening Statement [35] At the outset of the Tribunal inquiry, Mr. Yazbeck, Counsel for the Complainant, stated that Mr. Turner had been employed by the CCRA as a seasonal term employee in Victoria, B.C., from 1998 until 2003. Counsel described the hiring regime during that period as a competitive process which established eligibility lists of all qualified persons, ranked in order of merit; that in 1999 the process was replaced by the current process, which creates prequalified pools of candidates from which CBSA (formerly part of CCRA) managers may exercise discretion in determining which candidates are to be employed.\n[36] To assist the Tribunal, Counsel offered an overview of the Complainant\u2019s case:\n\u2026 But the bottom line for my present purposes is that Mr. Turner has been working in this position. He knows the job, he\u2019s qualified. And you\u2019ll hear evidence as well of his performance appraisals throughout this period, which demonstrate that he performed well in his position. He was a dedicated employee, well liked, hard worker, very resourceful, and so on.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 16, lines 22-25; page 17, lines 1-4.\n\u2026 This is not a case, unfortunately for me, where I can pull out the so-called smoking gun and say, here\u2019s the case for discrimination. As you know, we\u2019re looking for the subtle scent here.\nAnd what happened is that you have an employee that\u2019s doing well, performing well. But when it comes time to get into the prequalified pools in \u2026 \u201803 and then in \u201904, which could result in him having indeterminate employment; secure, long-term employment; something happens. All of a sudden, like that, he\u2019s determined to be unqualified.\nAnd with respect to the Tribunal, I will be urging you to ask the question, ask this question: why? Why did this happen? Why did an employee, who was performing well, had no performance deficiencies, all of a sudden become unqualified?\nThe Complainant, sir, is Levan Turner. He is an older black male, and it\u2019s his position that those factors, as well as his size, were the reasons why he was denied this employment.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 17, lines 6-25; page 18, lines 1- 3.\n[37] Complainant Counsel drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Exhibit C-2 (the Complainant\u2019s Book of Documents, Volume 2, Tab 33) which has particular relevance to the Victoria process:\n\u2026This is an e-mail exchange between Mr. Klassen, who was responsible for assessing Mr. Turner\u2019s capabilities, his performance\u2026 It\u2019s an e-mail to himself, so it\u2019s like a note to file.\nAnd then what he did was, he copied the email to other persons you\u2019ll see listed there. And many of these persons are senior managers, and their names will come up in this hearing as persons involved in the selection processes that we\u2019re dealing with.\nWhat\u2019s important, Mr. Sinclair, is to look at some of the things that this person Klassen is saying about Mr. Turner\u2026.\nIf you look at the second paragraph \u2026 It started talking about how he is perceived. How he sometimes shies away from the harder tasks, or knows the right procedure to take, but asks the Superintendent to advise.\nYou\u2019ll see later that Mr. Klassen\u2019s own reporting of this discussion was that Mr. Turner was shocked to hear this but he wasn\u2019t defensive.\nNext paragraph\u2026 \u201cI went on to explain that this perception has been around for a couple of summers and that it was something he would need to work on next year.\u201d Again a perception. And then at the end of that, the next sentence: \u201cI reminded him that this is not how he is perceived all the time.\u201d\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 19, lines 18-25; page 20, line 1\n\u2026What is this perception? What is this image? And at the end of the day, what I think you will find, sir, is that it\u2019s the perception of an older black male who is large, and you\u2019ll see from the complaint form as well that Mr. Turner\u2019s size is identified as a, as a basis here as well.\nSo the credibility of the staffing processes is very much in doubt. And if you have a process like that, and you\u2019ll hear how it was flawed \u2013 but if you have a process that can so easily fail to respect some of the basic rules governing staffing in the federal public service, it\u2019s not surprising that the process would allow somebody to be disqualified because he\u2019s an older, black, overweight employee. This is not a rigorous system that the Agency employs.\n\u2026 And as you know, based upon the, the authorities of this Tribunal and the Federal Court, in those circumstances there will be a case made, a prima facie case made for discrimination that had not been rebutted.\nThe Chairperson: What is the prima facie case that you\u2019re arguing?\nMr. Yazbek: The prima facie case, sir, is that here is an employee who clearly applied for the position, who was qualified for the position, who was denied the position or positions, but denied the positions for reasons which are pretexts. And the prima facie, the prima facie case is that there is no other explanation but for the employee\u2019s race or age or perceived disability, which is his weight.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 29, lines 1-15\nB. Respondent Counsel\u2019s Reply [38] After the Complainant\u2019s opening statement, Respondent Counsel was content to make his reply to Complainant\u2019s opening statement before Superintendent Ronald Paul Tarnawski began his testimony. At that time, the Chairperson asked Respondent Counsel if Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s testimony would be limited to the eligibility restriction in Vancouver Competition 1002.\nMr. Stark: Yes \u2026 there is some essential background that I believe will be of help in terms of explaining the context and how these competitions are put together. He was also assigned to the recruitment unit that came into existence round about the same time \u2013 well, before these competitions. And a lot of the standardization and competencies that we have been dealing with that were throughout these competencies, he can explain that and what\u2019s behind it.\nThe Chairperson: Why is that relevant? At this point, given all the evidence we have heard, is that going to be useful evidence? I am sure you have already thought about your argument at this point. Is it useful evidence?\nMr. Stark: Well, I would say this: What\u2019s at issue in this matter is an interesting case in the sense that these two selection processes, they are \u2013 essentially they are similar to any other federal board in terms of they are charged with a task of selecting; and seeing whether they are qualified based against the competency.\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson: \u2026as I understand it, the issue is going to be circumstantial because nobody said Mr. Turner didn\u2019t qualify for the Victoria process because he is black, he has a disability, or because of his age. So there has to be some sort of inference drawn from the evidence: right?\nMr. Stark: Yes.\nThe Chairperson: Now we have the Vancouver process where he did qualify except they mistakenly later learn that he shouldn\u2019t even have been in the process because he wasn\u2019t eligible, as they interpreted the restrictions.\nMr. Stark: I think there has to be some care taken there though because the Vancouver process \u2013 again I am paraphrasing what the witness will provide to the court \u2013 but the Vancouver process, unlike the Victoria one, was a two-step process. The first interview only dealt with EIC, effective interactive communication. And as shown on that lead sheet, Mr. Turner achieved a bare pass of 70 percent.\nDuring the course of that interview you probably recall Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence, he was asked about the eligibility restriction. Based upon the discussion that took place in that first interview checks were made and it was discovered that he had in fact interviewed unsuccessfully in other processers since January 1st, 2002.\nThe Chairperson: So what\u2019s the issue in your view? \u2026 The issue is he didn\u2019t get through the Vancouver process?\nMr. Stark: Right.\nThe Chairperson: And the reason he didn\u2019t \u2026from the evidence I have heard, I haven\u2019t heard from Mr. Tarnawski, is because he wasn\u2019t eligible because of the restriction\u2026\nMr. Stark: Right.\nThe Chairperson: And to me the issue is whether that restriction \u2013 which on its face didn\u2019t seem to exclude him and he didn\u2019t think he was excluded \u2013 was applied in a different fashion. And that\u2019s the issue that maybe was improperly applied or interpreted improperly.\nBut that\u2019s nothing that this tribunal can deal with. It has to be demonstrated that it was applied to Mr. Turner as a subterfuge so that he couldn\u2019t get the position because he is black or has a disability or is too old.\nMr. Stark: There has to be a pretext.\nThe Chairperson: Yes.\nMr. Stark: Proven to be a pretext.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 111, lines 1-25; page 112, lines 2-3, 17-25; page 113, lines 1-25; page 114, lines 1-12.\nC. Witness: Christopher James Hughes [39] Mr. Hughes testified about his effort to regain employment with the Respondent in Vancouver Competition 1002, posted June 9, 2003, and Victoria Competition 7003, posted October 11, 2003. As the first witness in this Inquiry Mr. Hughes gave specific testimony concerning the processing of his applications in the two job offerings; he also testified on matters he perceived to be managerial manipulation of job competitions.\n[40] In 1995, Mr. Hughes was employed by Revenue Canada in Victoria, B.C., as a collections officer. Initially a term employee, Mr. Hughes became an indeterminate employee in 1996. In March of 2001, he successfully applied for and was employed in 2002 as a seasonal-customs inspector (May to October), which enabled him to continue his employment in the winter as a business service agent with Revenue Canada. Mr. Hughes claimed that his employment was terminated on September 30, 2004, after he was stricken with a depressive illness that prevented him from working.\n[41] Mr. Hughes testified that in his work as a customs inspector, he became well-acquainted with a fellow customs inspector, the Complainant Levan Turner. Mr. Hughes explained the duties of a customs inspector in Victoria.\nWe were assigned to marine, so we were outside. And our duties were to inspect people, vehicles and boats, anything coming in to Victoria. And cruise ships. So, the Clipper coming from Seattle, the Coho coming from Port Angeles, and all the passengers and cars that come off of them. And the cruise ship terminal at Ogden Point.\nAnd we\u2019d either do a primary assignment which is the first person you see when you come off into customs as the primary questioning. And then you\u2019d also take turns doing secondary which is further searching of the person, like strip search or their luggage and that\u2019s where the arrests happen and the drug seizures.\nAnd we\u2019d also take turns doing cash officer. So anyone that had to pay duties or taxes, you would do the cash. And we also took turns clearing the float planes that came in from Seattle. So it was very varied jobs with lots of duties.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 33, lines 2-23\n[42] Mr. Hughes was asked if he heard comments to Mr. Turner concerning Mr. Turner\u2019s weight.\nThere were lots of comments directed to Mr. Turner about his weight. And people worried about whether he\u2019d have a heart attack and were asking him to lose weight. There\u2019s lots of jokes about fat Americans that were made in front of Mr. Turner.\nAnd I was teased by a lot of younger, fit customs officers. They\u2019d joke around I was getting fat. And both of them that were teasing me ending up getting hired permanently and I did not.\nQ. Those were?\nA. Trent Van Helvoirt and Harper Ecare.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 36, lines 5-9, 14-20.\n[43] Mr. Hughes was asked about student employees and whether they became either term or permanent employees.\nMy experience, and through investigations, I found out a lot of information. And what I found was almost every student I worked with in 2002, \u201803 and \u201804 that wanted to be permanent was hired by CBSA in \u201804, \u201805 and \u201806.\nAnd to me it\u2019s apparent that there\u2019s preferential hiring to young people either in the selection processes or through the student bridging.\nAnd the student programme itself is overused. And over fifty per cent of the employees in the summer are students. And you don\u2019t see that anywhere else in the Federal Government. When I worked at CRA we\u2019d have maybe one or two students in a hundred-person department.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 36 line 25, page 37, lines 1-14.\n[44] When asked to relate his direct experience with Mr. Turner, Mr. Hughes described the Complainant as professional and a team worker.\nI\u2019ve seen him involved in many enforcement actions. One of which I referred to from primary and he got the seizure of the marijuana. I\u2019ve seen him involved in arresting a \u2013 someone for an outstanding warrant with Terry Klassen. I know he\u2019s had use of the proof-screening device to intercept suspected impaired drivers.\nAnd all the training we attended, he was one of the best learners and he understood the material. And I don\u2019t think, I\u2019ve never heard of a complaint filed against him for his interactions with the travelling public.\nAnd, to my knowledge, he is always punctual and took lunch breaks that were acceptable to the managers. I didn\u2019t see him abuse time.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 38, lines 23-25, page 39, lines 1-12.\nKlassen e-mail [45] Mr. Hughes was asked to comment on Exhibit Tab 33, an e-mail circulated by Acting-Superintendent Klassen to other superintendents detailing their perceptions of Mr. Turner as a person who sloughed off work.\nQ. Mr. Hughes, you were present in the room when I made my opening statement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Yes. And I quoted from an e-mail message that Mr. Klassen had written in which he talked about a perception of Mr. Turner. Were you personally aware of any kind of a perception like that?\nA. Anyone who worked with him knew that he was a good worker. People that did not work with him, there was a perception that he was lazy, and that because of his size he couldn\u2019t do that job. \u2026\nA. Yeah, I can give an example. As a cash officer at the night shift if it\u2019s over a certain dollar amount you\u2019re supposed to cash-out. However, if there\u2019s not enough cash to make a proper float you do not cash-out.\nSo I remember the day shift complained about Levan Turner three or four times that he didn\u2019t cash-out. However he didn\u2019t have the cash needed to make a proper float. So this gave rise probably to some of the misperceptions.\nAnd I know for a fact that the day crew complained to Terry Klassen about it. And I also did not cash-out numerous times, but I was never asked about it.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 39, lines 13-24; page 40, lines 11-24.\nVancouver Competition 1002 \u2013 Eligibility Restriction [46] Complainant Counsel put the eligibility restriction in the Vancouver Competition 1002 employment job poster to Mr. Hughes and asked how he interpreted it and whether he discussed it with other employees.\nQ. And then it \u2013 there\u2019s a sentence that\u2019s bolded in the middle of the paragraph: \u201cApplicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be eligible for this process.\u201d Did you notice that when you first saw this?\nA: I did. Every candidate in Victoria discussed this. That applied to the Vancouver process. \u2026 We had been given advance notice internally that it was coming up. So everyone noticed the first day or the day after. And it was discussed around the office a lot.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 45, lines 7-15.\nThe Chairperson: So what did you interpret the restriction to mean?\nA: I interpreted it to mean that, if you had applied since January 1st, 2002 to a competition in Vancouver, you could not reapply. And that\u2019s usually how they did it in the past, they were specific to the location. And they\u2019ve done that in the future too.\nThe Chairperson: So what was your concern, then?\nA. My concern was they would broaden that definition to include any competition anywhere in Canada for customs inspector. Which is what they did to knock Levan out, but I should have been knocked out too and they didn\u2019t knock me out.\nThe Chairperson: \u2026in other words your concern was that, if you had applied for a position, a PM-2 position customs inspector, not just at Vancouver Airport, but anywhere in Canada you would be ineligible?\nA. That\u2019s --- yes, that\u2019s correct. \u2018Cause it\u2019s ambiguous.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 49, lines 2-22.\n[47] Mr. Hughes testified that he applied for the Vancouver Competition 1002 job opportunity and was screened in; that he completed a written package of competencies which was marked and accepted; and then he was interviewed twice. Mr. Hughes testified that he also applied in Victoria for employment offered under the Victoria Competition 7003, and that he was interviewed in December 2003 for a PM-2 customs inspector position. The Chairperson then asked Mr. Hughes if he was concerned that the eligibility restriction in the Vancouver Competition would apply to him.\nA: \u201cYes, oh twice I interviewed and in February 2003 also. That was actually prior to when this posted. So that\u2019s the interview that actually could have screened me out.\nQ. (By Complainant Counsel) So you applied \u2013 did you apply for this competition, this selection process?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what happened with your application?\nA. I was screened and did the written package. I passed that and was called for an interview.\nQ. At any point when either you were screened in or you were called for an interview or in the interview; did you participate in an interview?\nA. I did.\nQ. Okay.\nA. Two interviews.\nQ. Did \u2013 were any questions raised regarding whether you had been interviewed for another PM-2 position since January 1, 2002?\nA. They did not ask me whether I\u2019d interviewed since January 2002. But it was obvious from my resume that I had.\u201d\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, Page 50, lines 10-13, 21-24; page 51, lines 1-7.\n[48] Exhibit Tab 28 was produced to Mr. Hughes. It is a supplementary document to Exhibit Tab 29, a CCRA statement of staffing requirements. Mr. Hughes had seen the document and was asked what information he took from it.\n\u201cA: I would make sure that my resume addressed the experience factors. I would make sure I addressed the education requirement. And this document would also \u2026shows the placement criteria.\nQ. And can you just briefly explain to me at the bottom of the first page of this document, so at the bottom of page 224, there\u2019s a reference to a customs inspector test?\nA. Yes, I took that test in 1997.\nQ. This \u2013 can you just briefly tell me what that test is about?\nA. It\u2019s a four and a half hour test, one of the toughest tests I\u2019ve ever done. And it tests your ability to analyze and to decide, ability to remember things. It has some written communications, some calculations. And it\u2019s designed to see if you\u2019re a good \u2013 would make, have what it takes to be a good customs officer.\nQ. Now, you took it 1997. Did you have to retake it?\nA. No, if you just receive a passing mark, you can use that indefinitely.\u201d\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 52, lines 13-25; page 53, lines 1-11.\n[49] Mr. Hughes testified that he was interviewed twice in the Vancouver Competition 1002, first in April 2004 by Mr. Tarnawski and Holly Freeland, then in May 2004 by Mr. Tarnawski, Mark Northcote and Karen Warren.\n[50] Complainant Counsel asked Mr. Hughes whether he was asked, in the two interviews for the Vancouver job opportunity, about events he had related in his written response to the portfolio of competencies, and why he thought his written responses demonstrated competency.\nA: In both they would pick one or two and only talk about one or two, maybe three, at the most. And I had to expand on what I had written and tried to remember more information. And sometimes that was difficult.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 57, lines 2-6.\n[51] Complainant Counsel then directed Mr. Hughes to Exhibit Tab 34 (Volume 2), the Victoria Competition 7003, posted October 7, 2003, with a deadline of October 17, 2003. Mr. Hughes identified the job posting and testified that it had no eligibility restriction; that he applied, was screened in and received the written competencies package before he received the Vancouver Competition 1002 package; that he passed the written examination and was invited to an interview which took place December 16, 2003; and Mr. Hughes testified that he was assessed on the Victoria Competition before being assessed on the Vancouver Competition.\nQ. And in the interview on the 16th, what transpired. Like you mentioned before, that you always asked what you\u2019re being assessed on or marked on, what happened then?\nA. Well, part of the \u2013 in this selection process I found out actually that my feedback, how they marked it. But they definitely were marking oral communication and they picked I think two or three competencies to talk about so that they could mark my effective communication.\nAnd, when I went to my feedback, they explained that the interview also then \u2013 if you\u2019re invited to the interview, you had passed all the competencies based on the written exam and you were just getting topped up between 70 and 100 per cent on the other competencies based on if you could give more detail.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 60, line 19-25; page 6, line 1-10.\nQ. \u2026 So what did you mean by saying you passed that? Can you just confirm that again?\nA. Well, right in the written package it says they will \u2013 they \u2013 if you don\u2019t meet the minimum requirement which is 70 per cent, your package is screened out and you\u2019re failed. So you\u2019d had to have a minimum of 70 per cent in each competency to even get invited to an interview. And that would have to be demonstrated in the written exam, the portfolio of competencies.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 61, lines 18-25; page 62, lines 1-2.\n[52] Complainant Counsel referred the witness to Exhibit Tab 43 (Volume 2).\nQ. This is something that \u2013 that concerns Mr. Turner. But it indicates that at an interview he did not meet two of the competencies here; okay? And you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a Pringle and Baird involved in the interview?\nA. No, it is not. Based on the way I was explained this competition ran, the only competency he could have failed was effective interactive communication as he would have had a minimum of 70 going into the interview. And they didn\u2019t talk about a team work and cooperation question that differed from the written package and it was exactly the same.\n... A. Because everyone had a minimum of 70 per cent going into the interview based on the written exam. And that was explained to me by Trevor Baird, the board chair, at my feedback session.\nThe Chairperson: So was effective interactive communication not one of the seven competencies?\nA. No. Because it excluded written communication, it was strictly oral communication.\nThe Chairperson: So you\u2019re saying that team work and co-operation was a written competency?\nA. It was, yes.\nThe Chairperson: And in order to \u2013 you had to get at least 70 per cent in all seven competencies?\nA. To be invited to the interview. Yes.\nThe Chairperson: The interview. So that what you\u2019re saying \u2026 here is, if it shows 40, it is your opinion or your view that, once you got 70, you couldn\u2019t get below 70?\nA. Right. Because they talked about the package itself, they didn\u2019t talk about give us a different example of team work, they said okay, look at your written submission and talk about it.\nThe Chairperson: So all you could do was go up?\nA. Exactly.\nThe Chairperson: That\u2019s your view?\nA. That\u2019s my belief, yes. And I was told that by Mr. Baird that it was to top up the marks he didn\u2019t mention anything about going down. \u2026\n(Complainant Counsel referred the witness to page 308 of the Exhibit Tab 43).\nQ. Is this what you were referring to here?\nA. That\u2019s correct. The rules for this competition were effective interactive communication excludes any form of written communication.\nThe Chairperson: Where does it say that?\nComplainant Counsel: You\u2019ll see the title, Mr. Chair, there\u2019s a paragraph and then there\u2019s a note. And it describes the competency as simultaneous communication between two or more people. And then it says this competency excludes any form of written communication.\nThe Chairperson: So effective interactive communication was not part of the written?\nThe Witness: That\u2019s correct. \u2026 Well, they made us talk about three of the competencies that were passed in order to mark our ability to talk orally. So it served a dual purpose, to top up those three we were talking about and to mark effective interactive communication.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 66 lines 1-5, 14-25; page 67, lines 1-17; page 68, lines 9-20; page 69, line 5\nGrievance complaint to the Public Service Commission [53] Complainant Counsel put an investigation report dated May 31st, 2006, to Mr. Hughes (received and marked as Exhibit Tab 77, (a document included in the Complainant\u2019s Book of Documents)). Mr. Hughes confirmed that the investigator\u2019s report resulted from his grievance complaint to the Public Service Commission of irregularities in the Vancouver Competition 1002 and Victoria Competition 7003. During a discussion between the Chairperson and Counsel for the Complainant over the admissibility of the report, Respondent Counsel, who was initially opposed to the report being commented on by Mr. Hughes, agreed that it was relevant.\nMr. Stark: \u2026 I take no issue with it being a relevant document. The Public Service Commission investigator is an investigator assigned under the Public Service Employment Act. They have a statutory function to obviously investigate matters where there are concerns about employment processes.\nAnd I have no issue with the conduct of that and I fully concede that it indicates that there were irregularities in the competition processes, both the Vancouver pre-qualified pool and the Victoria pre-qualified pool that are in issue here today.\nThe Chairperson: The respondent concedes that?\nMr. Stark: Yes.\nThe Chairperson: There are irregularities?\nMr. Stark: Yes, as found by the investigator.\nThe Chairperson: But are you conceding there were irregularities in the process?\nMr. Stark: Yes. And it\u2019s not my intent to re-litigate those issues, the Public Service Commission investigator has made findings and in fact those findings were acted upon by the Public Service Commission itself.\nAnd they issued corrective measures in relation to these two competitions. And we\u2019ll be entering some evidence about what those corrective measures were. And so I take no issue with the fact that their findings are essentially relevant and they will provide yourself with some background as to the events.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 74, lines 2-25; page 75, lines 1-9.\n\u2026 It\u2019s conceded there were problems with the way these pre-qualified pools were actually conducted. And they weren\u2019t in compliance with the Public Service Employment Act.\nNow, further than that, you\u2019ll also hear argument as well that these pre-qualified pools were actually initiated under a different legislation under the Canada Revenue Agency. And the irregularities that you are for the most part talking about that are considered irregularities under the Public Service Employment Act, they weren\u2019t considered to be irregularities under the previous legislation.\nAnd it\u2019s all very complicated, but essentially this Canada Border Services Agency took over the port of entry functions upon its creation. And there was a \u2013 what I\u2019ll argue is a good deal of confusion amongst human resources about how to deal with the change in the applicable legislation. \u2026 I don\u2019t mean to re-litigate the issues that were before the Public Service Commission investigator, the irregularities are accepted. Some of the factual issues I don\u2019t wish to concede. But certainly the findings I take no issue with.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 78, line 25; page 79, lines 1-23.\n[54] Mr. Hughes testified that he was improperly failed in the Vancouver Competition 1002 on his ability to deal with difficult situations and his degree of self-confidence, matters that he asserted were not part of the Vancouver portfolio of competencies.\nMr. Yazbeck: Okay. And just, Mr. Chair, I\u2019ll just draw your attention to page 612, paragraph 95. This refers to what the witness has just been referring to as well, the definitions of professionalism, enforcement, not set out in the POC or the assessment package. And not mentioned in either \u2013 the candidates were never informed about how these qualifications were going to be assessed when they received their POCs and the selection board members did not have the definitions of these two qualifications in front of them when they assessed the candidates.\nThe Chairperson: And so you\u2019re saying those were the two \u2013 two of the competencies that you were assessed on at your second interview, but you had already passed those in Victoria?\nMr. Hughes: That\u2019s what they failed me on. But they actually substituted those other three for those two. So I was never, ever actually tested on professionalism, enforcement. So I was asking them to redo that portion of the competition so that I could actually be assessed (on) the competencies they\u2019re supposed to assess me on.\nThe Chairperson: Which were the three that they substituted?\nA. They substituted in dealing with difficult situations, decisiveness and self-confidence. And those three were not listed on the job poster. And they tried to say they were the same things as professionalism and enforcement.\nThe Chairperson: When were you assessed on those three?\nA. In February through the written package and again in the interview in May \u201904.\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson: Were all five of these on the job poster, Mr. Hughes?\nA. No.\nThe Chairperson: So which three were, which were and which weren\u2019t?\nA. The DDS, decisiveness and self-confidence were not on the poster. \u2026 professionalism, enforcement were. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: So there was something in the job poster about the written competencies? Is that right?\nA. \u2026In the job poster they said they were going to assess professionalism, enforcement.\n[55] Mr. Hughes testified that at his first interview in the Vancouver Competition 1002, he was orally tested on effective communication, but that subsequently, at the second interview in which he was to be assessed on professionalism and enforcement, he was asked questions about dealing with difficult situations, decisiveness and self-confidence and yet was marked on professionalism and enforcement. When queried by the Chairperson how he knew this to be the case, Mr. Hughes testified:\nCause my marks it said beside professionalism 50 and beside enforcement orientation 50. But, when I looked where that matched up to, it matched up to dealing with difficult situations and self-confidence. So they never, ever marked professionalism or enforcement orientation, but they tried to say they did.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 99, lines 1-25; page 100, lines 1-10; page 101, lines 1-11, 22-25.\nHistorical context of eligibility lists and prequalified pools [56] Mr. Hughes was asked by the Chairperson to explain whether pre-qualified pools were used by CCRA. Mr. Hughes testified that CCRA had used pre-qualified pools but changes occurred when the agency became subject to the Public Service Employment Act.\nThe Chairperson: So I read something about Mr. Turner and the eligibility list that was supposed to last for a couple of years and it was extended and he made the eligibility list, but his name was taken off the eligibility list. So is there something about the eligibility list, or are we only talking about the pre-qualified pool? Or do you know?\nA. I thought I had (given) historical context to the complaint, that he was qualified in an eligibility list and then in a pre-qualified pool in 2000. And, from 2000 to 2003, they could have hired him either from that pool or from the CCRA staffing programme without competition.\nThe Chairperson: But do you know when the pre-qualified pool came in?\nA. Yes CCRA brought it in right away, around late 2001, I think, they started doing pre-qualified pools.\nThe Chairperson: All right, one last question. So, if you were on the eligibility list \u2013 why would you be on the eligibility list and be in a pre-qualified pool?\nA. There\u2019s a provision that, when the CCRA came in, that they could still use the eligibility lists. So there was an overlap for a period of time.\nThe Chairperson: And that\u2019s \u2013 the eligibility list no longer exists?\nA. No. they ceased at the end of \u201995 \u2013 or sorry, 2005. That\u2019s when the Public Service Employment Act, (1985) was repealed, but because CCRA came into existence they stopped using it in November 1999, except for ones that overlapped.\nMr. Stark: Mr. Sinclair, perhaps I could interject here. The witness is repeatedly referring to the CCRA and I think he actually means to refer to the CBSA. And that might be adding to some confusion. It\u2019s the CBSA that was created in 2003, December, and the competitions overlapped between the Canada Revenue Agency as it then was and then the pre-qualified pools came under the jurisdiction essentially of the CBSA following December 18, 2003.\nCross-examination of Mr. Hughes (a) Public Service Commission \u2013 report of investigator [57] Notwithstanding his initial objection during direct examination to Mr. Hughes commenting on the findings of the Public Service Commission investigator, Counsel for the Respondent ventured into that area in his cross-examination.\nQ. Mr. Hughes, if we can go to tab 77 of volume 3. And I just want to take you to the investigator\u2019s report and in particular to paragraph 91 that my learned friend took you to. If I can actually take you to the paragraph before that, 90, and I\u2019ll read it to you because it gives some background that the investigator provides.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that some (time) after the competition notice was posted, the hiring manager, Mr. Flagel, decided that he was not satisfied with the assessment criteria which had been established.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019ll stop there. This is in relation to the Vancouver pre-qualified pool; correct, this decision?\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. Okay.\n\u201cOwing to an increasing number of complaints received from travellers, many of which concern the actions and behaviours of relatively new customs inspectors, he felt that certain criteria which were not included in the statement of staffing requirements needed to be addressed when assessing the candidates. As he pointed out he felt that dealing with difficult situations should be one of the qualifications.\u201d\nRespondent Counsel: Could you indicate to the tribunal who Mr. Flagel \u2013 (is) \u2013\nA. Yeah, Mr. Flagel is the district director in charge of Vancouver International Airport.\nQ. Right. And then the investigator continues in paragraph 91:\n\u201cConsequently he directed the selection board members to define or drill down the enforcement orientation and professionalism qualifications in terms of the three criteria of dealing with difficult situations, self-confidence and decisiveness.\u201d\n\u201cHis intent was to ensure that the selection board focussed its assessment of enforcement orientation and professionalism on those elements within each which were the most important for ensuring that competent customs inspectors were hired.\nWhile the intent was noble, it was not carried out in a manner which is fair or transparent for existing and potential candidates or in accordance with the merit principal.\u201d\nNow \u2013 and you, giving your evidence, that\u2019s the mechanism, that\u2019s the switching, if you like, that you were mentioning in terms of assessing criteria that wasn\u2019t on the poster, the job poster?\nA. That\u2019s right.\n\u2026\nQ. So you\u2019 agree with me, then, that all candidate within that competition were assessed equally and according to the same assessment criteria?\nA. They were \u2013 we never did know if the marking was reasonable because\u2026 the investigator decided not to investigate the reasonableness of the marking considering I had won the first two allegations.\nQ. \u2026I\u2019ll take you to paragraph 104, allegation 3.\n\u201c\u2026 As I explained during the first fact-finding meeting, the evidence he presented did not support an allegation of bias, rather it brought into question the reasonableness of the assessment of the two competencies.\u201d\nQ. You\u2019ll agree with me that the investigator found that there was no bias.\nA. Right. \u2018Cause he said what I meant was reasonableness. So the next paragraph clarifies that he did not investigate it because I had already won the two allegations prior and that \u2013 so, for all we know, there could have been lots of inconsistent marking, but he felt it wasn\u2019t worth investigating since the process was fatally flawed.\n\u2026\nQ. So, again you have no evidence at all to provide the tribunal that would \u2026 suggest that any candidates in particular in this pre-qualified pool were treated differently? They were all assessed the same way?\nA. No, I\u2019d say Trent Van Helvoirt and Brianna Hewson definitely were treated different.\nQ. And how were they treated differently?\nA. Well, I\u2019ve reviewed both their packages and there\u2019s many deficiencies in both.\nQ. So \u2013 and they were both employed I take it from your \u2013\nA. They were both hired permanently, yes.\n[58] Months after the filing of the Investigator\u2019s report, The Public Service Commission issued directions implementing corrective measures. One aspect was the fact that the customs inspector position PM-02 had been replaced by a PM-03 status for border service officers.\nQ. Now, in these (sic) record of reasons in paragraph 3, the investigator makes reference to the following:\n\u201c\u2026the revised statement of qualifications for the PM-03 border services officer positions contain the same additional qualifications that CBSA assessed by error in the PM-02 selection process. On its face it would be redundant and ineffective at this stage to require that CBSA reassess qualifications which are no longer required by the current position. \u2026 Now, with respect to the complainant\u2019s own situation, the evidence established that he had failed to attain a passing grade on the qualifications dealing with difficult situations and self-confidence, two of the qualifications now required for the PM-03 border services officer positions. As a result further corrective measures with respect to his (Mr. Hughes) specific circumstances are not required.\nQ. Now, you\u2019ll agree with that finding that those were the two areas \u2013 two criteria that you essentially failed to qualify on the competition?\nA. Well, actually, I strongly disagree with that. As you know, I have a judicial review on this. The investigator never investigated the reasonableness of self-confidence and dealing with difficult situations, or took into (account) the fact that I passed these competencies in Victoria. So I strongly disagree with that statement.\n\u2026\nQ. So these types of competitions, pre-qualified pools, they\u2019re the manner that the Agency uses to hire individuals at the entry level?\nA. Sometimes. Like I\u2019ve said before, they bridge over a hundred students. And they\u2019ve used non-advertised mechanisms too, (and) without competition ones also.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one; page 194, lines 21-25; page 177, lines 22-25; page 178, lines 1-6, 9-10, 18-25; page 179, lines 1-6; page 189, lines10-23; page 194, lines 1- 25; page 195, lines 1-19; page 196, lines 23-25; page 197, lines 1-5.\n(b) Student bridging program [59] In cross-examination, when asked to describe the student bridging program, Mr. Hughes gave a succinct description together with his opinion on its utilization.\nA. It\u2019s designed by the Federal Government to give some flexibility to departments to bridge exceptional students who showed that they were very good workers.\nAnd, from reviewing the CBSA data, it seems they\u2019ve been over-utilizing that and not just filling their staffing needs with that instead of using it for the exceptional student.\nQ. And what evidence do you have of that?\nA. Well, I have copies of every contract they\u2019ve done over the last \u2013 from 2004 to\u201907. And they hired, I think, over a hundred people through student bridging. And the previous four years I think they did a handful.\nQ. \u2026 When you mention the handful, what period are we talking about?\nA. When CCRA had control they rarely ever used that function and they hired people through external processes which had a higher standard of competence. When CBSA took over they started bridging many, many students and, to be a student, you don\u2019t have as high of a standard to cross to become a student, and then they\u2019re sort of brought in through the back door, through this bridging programme, in my opinion.\nQ. \u2026 But when did it start picking up?\nA. In late 2004, early 2005.\nQ. So that (would) have been after the time frame involved in this complaint?\nA. Not if you look at \u2013 if Levan had made the pool like he should have, he would have been eligible to be hired for a year and a half, two years after that.\nQ. Right. But my point is simply that student bridging didn\u2019t start to be utilized more frequently until after the end of these complaint periods. We\u2019re talking about competitions that started in 2003 and finished in \u2013 by the spring of 2004.\nA. Well, they didn\u2019t finish \u2018til mid-2007, after corrective measures.\nQ. All right.\nA. So I disagree with you.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 151, line 22-25; page 152, lines 1-25; page 153, lines 1-16.\n[60] Mr. Hughes was asked how he established that fifty per cent of summer staff are students. He testified it was based on personal experience, that in Victoria many shifts would be over fifty per cent students.\nQ. Did you keep any records of that, or is that just a mental sort of head count, that you\u2019ve taken?\nA. No. I kept time sheets from \u201902 and \u201904 that show that.\nQ. Okay. And why would you keep those time sheets, Mr. Hughes?\nA. After my experience at tax in \u201901 I started keeping records on just about everything.\nQ. Would it be fair to say that after your experience with CCRA you started to be someone who kept records of everything because you were concerned about your employment situation?\nA. I was concerned that people might try to put a different spin on things later. So I wanted to keep an accurate and factual record of what happened.\nQ. Did you believe that your employers had it in for you?\nA. Not at CBSA. No, I did not get that feeling until after they failed me in Vancouver when I was almost done my third term.\nQ. And why did you get that impression? Why did you form that impression?\nA. Because, as I stated earlier, that both of the interviews and written packages were exactly the same. I used the exact same submissions. So I felt, if they passed it in Victoria and they know I\u2019m a customs officer in Victoria in a pool, how could they fail me in Vancouver? It just didn\u2019t make sense.\n\u2026\nQ. \u2026And you were placed into the pool, but you weren\u2019t ever appointed from it?\nA. No I was not.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 154, lines 24-25; page 155, lines 1-25; page 156, lines 1-12.\n(c) Interpretation of the Vancouver Competition 1002 eligibility restriction [61] Mr. Hughes was cross-examined with respect to the eligibility restriction in the Vancouver Competition 1002 and asked how he interpreted the restriction.\nQ. All right. Now, you said that you interpreted that to mean, following discussion, that it was only people who had previously applied in Vancouver competitions that were no long \u2013 or who weren\u2019t to be eligible?\nA. That\u2019s what I took it to mean, yes.\nQ. Can you indicate, you know, why you formed that interpretation?\nA. Because Vancouver always ran their own boards and it was always only open to the lower mainland, we could never apply in the past. And Victoria was kind of the same way, only open to Victoria, they wouldn\u2019t let anyone from the lower mainland apply. So we were always separate. This was the first one they opened up to west of the Rockies. And, therefore, we had never applied to a Vancouver Board before. So that\u2019s how we interpreted it.\nQ. Did it not seem strange to you, though, that they would open up a process where they would stop candidates who may have previously applied in Vancouver, but not stop candidates who may have previously applied elsewhere?\nA. No. Because they had assessed people in Vancouver, and I can see why they wouldn\u2019t want to reassess someone they\u2019ve already determined themselves wasn\u2019t suitable. But if they\u2019ve never had a look at us before, we should be able to have \u2013 be able to make an impression on them.\n\u2026\nQ. So, other than the possibility that they might want to take a look at candidates from outside of the Vancouver area, there\u2019s no real explanation for why they would make that distinction?\nA. Yeah, I could not figure out why they put that there. I mean, there was \u2013 it was ambiguous, is what I mean. I know what they intended.\nQ. What did they intend?\nA. Well, like previously boards, they intended to screen out people from the lower mainland who had applied.\nQ. Is it not a more rational explanation to say what they were trying to do was screen out applicants who had been recently assessed against the same qualifications by other selection boards?\nA. Not necessarily. Because like I\u2019ve heard HR people say different process, different question, might have a different result.\nQ. Who said that?\nA. I\u2019ve heard Barbara Lennox say it, Shaliva Sharma say it, and I think Ron Tarnawski said that.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 164, lines 1-25; page 165, lines 1-4, 10-25; page 166, lines 1-5.\nRe-examination of Mr. Hughes [62] Counsel for the Complainant questioned Mr. Hughes concerning his testimony about two people being treated differently in the Vancouver Competition 1002.\nQ. And you gave an example of two persons Trent Van Helvoirt and Brianna Houston as being treated differently?\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. Did you raise that with the Agency at the time or around the time of these competitions?\nA. I did, yes.\nQ. And, what was done about that by the Agency?\nA. I think it was already in the investigation stage, so it was \u2013 I don\u2019t think I raised it directly. It was during the investigation.\nQ. Do you mean this PFC investigation?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you said you identified many deficiencies in their \u2013 their \u2013 I guess their applications?\nA. I did.\nQ. What were you referring to?\nA. I was referring to notes taken by Karen Morin for Brianna Houston that indicated she had told the board that her superintendent told her she should consider another career, and there\u2019s also many negative notations about her communication skills, yet she was passed on communication skills, and her background was working as a part-time gas attendant prior to being hired, so, no \u2013 no law enforcement background, and she was eighteen or nineteen years old.\nQ. And, my friend had asked you a number of questions particularly about the allegation of bias, and you may recall in your evidence you, often, you refer to paragraph 1-0-5, and you said, yes it had to be read together; and in paragraph 1-0-5 the investigator says: \u2018There was thus no need for this investigator to review this part of the allegation further, or arrive at a conclusion on the matter.\u2019\nA. That\u2019s right.\nQ. Okay, did \u2013 did any other person or body investigate that allegation further or arrive at a conclusion on the matter?\nA. No, they did not, other than the Human Rights Commission which did find that that was one of the reasons to send this matter here.\nThe Chairperson: Which matter is that?\nA. The matter before the Tribunal.\nThe Chairperson: So, your allegation of bias is the basis \u2013 one of the reasons that Mr. Turner ---\nA. No, the way Brianna Houston was treated in the competition.\nThe Chairperson: Is there reason why Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint was sent to the tribunal?\nA. One of the abnormalities in the \u2013 yes \u2013 because she was like eighteen, nineteen years old, not very qualified; notes indicated she should have failed but she gets passed.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 9, lines 7-25; page 10, lines 1-25; page 11, lines 1-11.\nMr. Hughes\u2019 troubled relationship with Revenue Canada [63] In cross-examination, Counsel for the Respondent asked Mr. Hughes about the several grievances that he filed against Revenue Canada.\nQ. During that time did you have any issues and disagreements with Revenue Canada as to your employment \u2026 in that time period of 2003\/4.\n\u2026\nA. There is an ongoing harassment investigation, a number of grievances and an internal affairs investigation that I had requested (in) \u2026 the early part of \u201904. \u2026 in late \u201904, early \u201905 there was a human rights complaint I filed against CRA \u2026based on disability \u2026 depression and stress.\u201d\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 138, lines 14-25.\nQ. Going back in time for moment. The initial grievances, when did the employment relationship with Revenue Canada start going awry?\nA. Well, it started going awry in 2001. And then it went on the back burner for \u201902 and 03 and then it kind of came up again. \u2026 you actually have to go back to September 2000 is where it started. And that\u2019s where I stopped an illegal act at CCRA \u2026 a collections officer had accidentally garnisheed a director of a corporation for the debts of the corporation which you\u2019re not allowed to do.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 139, lines 1- 25.\nAnd this individual had been \u2026 garnisheed for almost a year, probably $5,000.00 had been illegally taken from his employment income. And a number of team leaders knew about it and didn\u2019t stop it.\nQ. And what did you do about that?\nA. I involved my team leader and the media-relations officer to ensure that the garnishee was stopped and the money refunded.\nQ. And did that actually happen?\nA. It did, yes.\nQ. \u2026 now what happened and what caused the grievances to be filed?\nA. Well, within four or five months all of a sudden I started getting blocked on promotions and being treated very adversely. And I believe it was in retaliation to the whistle blowing.\nQ. Do you have any evidence of that?\nA. Not with me. There\u2019s tons before other tribunals and boards.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 140, lines 3-22.\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson:\nI\u2019m not sure I understand what \u2013 where this is going. You may take it as a sign of credibility of Mr. Hughes. But I haven\u2019t heard anything \u2013 in the evidence today that\u2019s not credible in the sense that \u2013 and he may say that this particular individual got a job and they weren\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t follow the process of that particular individual or students that got jobs and then failed or they\u2019re in this particular program et cetera et cetera.\n\u2026\n\u2026I think Mr. Hughes credibility is not really an issue with respect to much of the evidence that he gave. I mean, he may have been somebody who challenged his employers and they didn\u2019t like that, so they did this, that and the other to him, or blocked his promotions, et cetera. But that\u2019s not an issue in this case.\nTranscript: Volume One, section one, page 141, lines 18-25; page 142, line 25; page 142, lines 1-6\n[64] I share the Chairperson\u2019s view that Mr. Hughes was a credible witness whose testimony remained unshaken in cross-examination. His detailed account of the Respondent\u2019s hiring practices and selection process provided a useful context when examining Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint.\nD. Witness: Levan Turner [65] Mr. Turner, originally from Toronto, moved with his wife to Victoria in December 1995 in search of work. He testified that he was interested in becoming a customs inspector or a conservation officer; however, his first job was as a security guard at the Victoria Eaton Centre. His employment as a security guard included instruction in the use of force, techniques for making a proper arrest, and handcuffing a suspect using only as much force as may be reasonably necessary.\n[66] Mr. Turner\u2019s willingness to work as a security guard was a rational progression from his prior voluntary service as an auxiliary police officer with the Toronto Police Department. He explained the Department\u2019s screening process to establish the suitability of potential auxiliary officers, and the training he received to become an auxiliary officer: basic police training including empty-handed control techniques, tactical arrests, handcuffing, and appropriate use of a baton. He also explained that as an auxiliary officer he wore a uniform similar to the regular police uniform, and would assist at public events and on occasion ride-along with regular officers: \u201cSo I went to all kind of calls, regular police calls with a regular force officer and I gained valuable experience from them\u201d. Transcript: Volume One, section two, page 26, lines 14-16.\n[67] Mr. Turner described an incident in which he and a fellow auxiliary officer disarmed a suspect and made an arrest: \u201c\u2026 because as Auxiliary we were allowed to arrest but we had to immediately turn them over to a parent force officer at the time, because that was what we were supposed to do, and by the time the parent force officer got down to us we were able to get all the information from this individual, and be able to run him on the computer systems, and he was arrested and taken away.\u201d Transcript: Volume One, section two, page 28, lines 4-11.\n[68] When asked why he wanted to become a Customs Officer, Mr. Turner replied:\nI just love meeting people, as you can see, because of my Auxiliary background as well. \u2026 law enforcement interests me \u2026 and the interaction with the public. So being that and being a security guard gave me sort of the best of, of both worlds, to be able to do that.\nAnd I really, because of my history with my family, and I can go into that later if you like \u2026 I truly believe you know, being a Canadian citizen, that it\u2019s important to, you know, protect your country. And that\u2019s the reason why I wanted to be a Customs Inspector.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 55 line 1; page 56 lines 1-12.\nWork experience as Customs Inspector [69] In 1998, Mr. Turner answered an advertisement for prospective Customs Officers by mailing in his resume. He was invited to write the Customs Inspector Test (CIT), which he passed, and was thereafter interviewed and subsequently placed 10th on a ranked eligibility list. Counsel asked whether he recalled who interviewed him, and Mr. Turner replied: \u201cYes, believe it or not, yeah I do. It\u2019s way back when. It was Joanne Deans (ph) who was a CI, and Catherine Pringle, who was a Superintendent.\u201d Transcript: Volume One, section two, page 53, lines 7-9.\n[70] Mr. Turner was hired as a term employee, P-1 Customs Inspector, in the Marine Unit for the period May 1998 to October 15, 1998.\nFirst season as a Customs Inspector, May 1998 to October 1998 [71] In his first year of seasonal work as a customs inspector Mr. Turner worked at 816 Government Street, Victoria, in the Marine Unit. He testified that the Marine Unit dealt with scheduled vessels coming to Victoria from Port Angeles (Coho) and Seattle (Clipper). He described working long days involving talking to a lot of people, with a clipboard in hand which noted details of certain persons and vehicles that the Marine Unit had been alerted to be on the lookout for, colloquially described as \u201cwatch-fors\u201d. Mr. Turner described the clearing of persons arriving in Victoria as a two-stage process: primary inspection and secondary inspection:\nQ. I\u2019ve heard these terms before, but can you just describe to us what primary is then first of all?\nA. Okay, sure. Primary line or primary inspection line it\u2019s called \u2013 it\u2019s referred to as PIL. What that is, is that\u2019s the first contact that people would have coming off the ferry. So they would be your first primary inspection booth, just like even if you\u2019re driving through a border crossing the PIL booth would be the primary inspection or the first line of contact with Customs. And that would be the place where you would make your declaration or Customs would ask you your questions, so that would be the first officer that you would come in contact with.\nAnd at that time after you get to that, that booth [\u2026] the Customs Officer would determine at that time whether you are going to be admitted to Canada or whether you\u2019d be sent to secondary for further examination.\nQ. What criteria would you use to make that determination?\nA. Well, we\u2019re trained to use basically, you know, standard questions \u2026 where are you from, how long you\u2019ve been out of Canada, what\u2019s your destination. And we look for indicators, you know, whether we believe them, how fast they answer the question, whether they seem to be evasive, where that would sort of, you know, make our conclusion whether we wanted to send them to a secondary examination or whether we wanted to just admit them to Canada.\nAnd usually we take, you know, anywhere, I mean, depending on the circumstances of course, but I guess we\u2019re just trying to get through as fast as possible.\nQ. And when you were working in secondary then, what was your function there?\nA. Secondary examination would be, what we would do is if they were referred to secondary we fill out a referral sheet, which is a yellow sheet of paper. And on the yellow sheet of paper you\u2019d put down the person\u2019s declaration and what they said and how long they\u2019ve been out of Canada for, what they\u2019re bringing into Canada. Because that would be a legal document saying, well, this is what the person who came to you said that they had in their vehicle. So that\u2019s what we had to go by.\nAnd once we got to the secondary area, the secondary officer would take this referral sheet, look at it and then verify what was said at the primary inspection booth with what was on the referral sheet. And then we\u2019d act on whatever, if there was anything else that was found we\u2019d take appropriate action on that.\nQ. And when you say take appropriate action, what, what sort of actions could you take?\nA. It all depends on what it is. It could be anything from collecting duties and taxes, to Immigration, if we found any sort of documents that were hidden that would prove that what was said at the primary inspection line wasn\u2019t correct, and then we\u2019d take appropriate action at that point.\nQ. You just mentioned Immigration. \u2026 What would you have dealt with there?\nA. If we found, let\u2019s say if they were coming up and, or travelers coming into Canada, and they were saying well they were only coming up here for a visit but meanwhile we have documents showing that they have a house up here in Canada; they\u2019re not actually coming to visit, they actually - could be coming up here to live at their house in \u2013 in Canada. So that would be something that we refer on to Immigration because maybe they\u2019re not actually as a genuine or valid visitor. Maybe they\u2019re actually here living in Canada, but you know, they declared they were just coming up here for a visit. So that would be something we\u2019d refer on to Immigration.\n[\u2026]\nQ. You also mentioned you\u2019re searching and arresting of individuals. Did you have occasion to do that?\nA. Searching, yes we did. I didn\u2019t do any arresting of individuals at the time.\nQ. Okay. And any issues with your performance during this period?\nA. No.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 44, lines 13-25; page 45 lines 1-25; page 46, lines 1-25; Page 47, lines 1-16, lines 19-25; page 48, line 1.\nSecond season as a Customs Inspector, December 29, 1998 to October 1999 [72] At the end of his 1998 term with CCRA, Mr. Turner found work with the Canada Food Inspection Agency as a Plant Inspector. That Agency needed temporary employees to deal with the urgency of an outbreak of gypsy moths. Mr. Turner was interviewed over the phone, hired, trained and worked with the Agency inspecting and certifying Christmas tree farms. However this winter work was interrupted by a new offer of temporary employment from CCRA.\n[73] In late December 1998, Diana Kavalaars, Chief of CCRA in Victoria, telephoned Mr. Turner and informed him he was next on the eligibility list for a temporary CI position. She asked Mr. Turner if he was willing to return to work at that time and offered him a position at the Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) clearing arriving vessels and planes. Mr. Turner accepted the offer, ended his employment with the Canada Food Inspection Agency on December 28, 1998, and resumed his seasonal term employment with CCRA on December 29, 1998, through to the fall of 2000. Mr. Turner testified that he had accepted the term position in the hopes that it would eventually lead to a full-time position as a Customs Inspector.\nThe Chairperson: Without more, you didn\u2019t have to do any testing or interviews?\nA. I didn\u2019t have to do any testing at all.\nThe Chairperson: So she offered that position from December to October?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 55, lines 8-14.\n[74] In Mr. Turner\u2019s second season with CCRA he was assigned to work in the TRC, clearing arriving vessels and planes. He described it as a 24-hour communication service that permits masters of vessels and pilots of planes to phone and obtain clearance to enter Canada. He explained that a Customs Inspector working in the TRC would make the same inquiries of these pilots and masters as at ports of entry to Canada, and would make a determination whether they would be permitted to enter. In the event that a secondary inspection was necessary, arriving planes would have to go to a designated airport with a Customs office, and remain there until arrival of a Customs Inspector.\n[75] Mr. Turner explained that the lack of direct contact with arrivals was overcome by use of CCRA computer systems to determine whether the person had ever been referred to secondary inspection before, or whether there had been an earlier problem with the aircraft or vessel. Mr. Turner asserted that he was competent in the use of the Integrated Customs Enforcement System (ICES) and the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) to determine whether there were any outstanding arrest-warrants for any traveller, or other information regarding prior legal matters relating to them.\n[76] Mr. Turner stated that whenever the Marine Unit was short-staffed, or an exceptionally high number of ship-board passengers were expected, TRC officers would assist in carrying out primary and secondary inspections.\n[77] Mr. Yazbeck showed Exhibit C-1, Tab 7, a February 27, 1998 letter to Mr. Turner which confirmed that he had taken and passed the Customs Inspector Test. According to Mr. Turner, the results of the test were still in effect at the end of his last seasonal employment.\n[78] Mr. Yazbeck showed Exhibit C-1, Tab 8, to Mr. Turner, a document from CCRA. This was a performance review of Mr. Turner for the period of December 1998 to October 1999. Mr. Turner identified the author of the review as Acting Superintendent Todd Perry of the TRC. Mr. Turner remembered Mr. Perry as a very good teacher. The review form lists a number of \u201cGoals and Objectives\u201d, which the Superintendent is to indicate as being \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cnot met\u201d. All of the relevant goals and objectives were listed as being \u201cmet\u201d, including the objective stating: \u201cYou will become knowledgeable with the legislation and regulations related to the duties performed by a Customs Inspector and TRC operations.\u201d In the comment section Superintendent Perry made the following remarks: \u201cYou provided a high level of service in a polite and professional manner. \u2026 You worked well with the rest of the TRC team members. \u2026 Levan I have no criticism of your work. Any guidance I provided to you was accepted willingly. \u2026 I thank you for your assistance with training and guidance you provided to the newer staff that came into the TRC.\u201d Transcript: Volume One, section two, page 64, lines 12-15, page 66-67, line 25-line 12.\n[79] Similar comment was made in Mr. Turner\u2019s assessment for the 2000 summer season at Exhibit C-1, Tab 9: \u201cTeamwork & Cooperation has been a very strong point of yours. You were of great assistance to me in training new staff. You are always looking for ways to improve the operation and share this with the rest of the team.\u201d\n[80] Mr. Perry noted that Mr. Turner\u2019s appearance was always professional and in accordance with Department guidelines. When asked to explain how he helped to train newer staff, Mr. Turner said he taught them how to use the computer systems, and that he would set up mock scenarios simulating contact with an incoming aircraft. This simulated arrival gave co-workers an opportunity to develop computer skills and to improve their capability as interrogators.\nThird season as a Customs Inspector, April 2001 to October 2002 [81] Mr. Turner\u2019s third seasonal term employment was to end in the fall of 2001 however the 9\/11 terrorist attack resulted in an extension of his term and his return to Marine during the summer of 2002. He explained that because he had been working since the previous summer he was automatically put into a pool to be eligible for recall.\n[82] Mr. Yazbeck produced Exhibit C-1, Tab 12, a 2002 Customs Inspector Midsummer Assessment, prepared by Superintendent Trevor Baird of the Marine Section, and signed by Mr. Turner. On the first page it makes reference to Mr. Turner presenting himself in a professional manner even in difficult circumstances. Mr. Turner\u2019s recalled that the \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d concerned an incident with an agitated American traveller who had arrived on the Coho, with whom he was able to deal appropriately. Mr. Turner said he used this incident to illustrate one of his competencies in a posted competition.\n[83] Mr. Turner was asked whether his 2001-2002 duties in the TRC and the Marine Section were different from his earlier duties, and he said the difference was that he had more experience and training:\nA. They weren\u2019t much in the way of difference except me being there longer, I had more experience so I was taking on more jobs, doing clearances, vessels out of front counter in the Long Room, dealing with as (inaudible) CPIC and ICES checks, I had more experience now that I had my training, to do CPIC checks, which is the criminal record checks. I was able to do that now.\nSo what would happen in that case is when I was in the [TRC], vessels would come in, and if a secondary officer needed extra information on somebody or wanted a criminal record check done, he was able to call up to the [TRC] and there were very few of us in there who had access to the system. And so I was lucky enough, or fortunate enough to be able to have access to the system. And I was able to run individuals for the staff down at the, at the boat docks.\nQ. And you also indicate here searching and arresting of individuals. Did you, can you give us any examples of that?\nA. Sure. We \u2013 I would help out whenever there was, when I was in the Marine section of course, I was able to help out if anybody needed any help in searching uncooperative individuals\u2026 So I - helped out of course in doing that, and arresting individuals, you know, if anybody had to be arrested.\nI remember helping Terry Klassen one time \u2026with arresting an individual, searching him and taking him into custody. I also helped out as well with doing, with the approved screening device, which would be a unit that\u2019s used, even out on the street with police today, to verify whether a person is intoxicated. And I was able to do it myself when I was working in Marine, I was able to administer an approved screening device to someone who came off the Coho which I believed at the time was impaired. And I did my primary questioning and sent the individual over to secondary \u2013 or did my primary questioning of the individual. He was sent over to secondary and when I was searching the vehicle I noticed that there, inside the vehicle there was an odor of alcohol and I noticed in one of the cups that there was a residue of alcohol in there.\nSo I thought I had better do a check of this individual. So I did, and realized that individual, he wasn\u2019t impaired. He blew but a warning. So I just basically cautioned him and let him know that, you know, this wasn\u2019t a smart thing to do, he has kids in the car. \u2026 [B]ecause of the indicators I saw in the vehicle I was able to administer an approved screening device.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 85, lines 16-25, page 86, lines 1 \u2013 25, page 87, lines 1-24.\n[84] In the same sequence of testimony, Mr. Turner explained his being trained in a Use of Force Course at CCRA head office, which he described as a week-long training in handcuffing, defensive empty-handed tactics, baton and pepper spray, and that it was a requisite for employment. Mr. Turner also participated in an officer-powers course as it related to arrest of persons and their rights, and a course on firearms offered on weekends at a firing range in which he was trained on how to handle different firearms, to fire them, and to safely load and unload ammunition.\n[85] At the end of this sequence of testimony, Counsel asked Mr. Turner if his goal was to become a full-time employee of the Agency and if that was something Mr. Turner\u2019s managers were aware of.\nA. Oh yes, definitely, yes. For my very first interview, which was back in \u201998, I was advised that these positions that we were applying for were \u2013 were full time, permanent positions. And then once they hired us I was informed that they were no longer going to be full time but they were just going to be term positions.\nTranscript: Volume One, section 2, page 102, lines 4-10.\n[86] After finishing his third seasonal term of employment in October 2002, Mr. Turner testified that he had been informed that there were jobs at Taxation where they needed help in the client service area to take information and answer calls regarding tax questions due to the upcoming tax season: Transcript, page 347, lines 21-25; page 348, lines 6-7. Mr. Turner worked in this position from December to April 2002.\n[87] Mr. Turner\u2019s hopes for a permanent career in border services ended during his last seasonal term as a Customs Inspector May 1 to October 28, 2003.\n[88] During this period he sought two further job opportunities as a Customs Inspector, but was deemed unqualified.\nThe Job Competitions (a) Victoria Competition 7003 [89] CRA Selection Process 2003-2092-PAC-3961-7003 (Victoria Competition 7003) is one of two staffing processes which are the subject of this inquiry into Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint. The positions stipulated on the October 11, 2003 poster for the Victoria Competition 7003 were for permanent, term, or anticipatory positions as Customs Inspector, Victoria \/ Sidney, BC (including Bedwell harbor), with applications due by October 30, 2003 (see Exhibit R-2, Tab 41).\n[90] Mr. Turner applied for employment offered in the Victoria Competition 7003, he successfully completed the \u201cpre-requisite\u201d phase of the process, and was interviewed on December 18, 2003 by the selection board Chairperson Trevor Baird, Superintendent, Victoria Marine Section and selection board member Kathryn Pringle, Superintendent, Victoria Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC), and Janet Sabo, Superintendent, Sidney (See Exhibit C-2, Tab 43 and Exhibit R-2, Tabs 42-48 and 51). On March 5, 2004, Mr. Baird sent a letter to Mr. Turner informing him that he was unsuccessful in the competition, as he was \u201cnot found to have met all of the assessment criteria required for the position\u201d (Exhibit R-2, Tab 50).\n[91] Victoria Competition 7003 was one of three staffing processes for Customs Inspector in Victoria in which Mr. Turner applied and, after interview, was found not qualified to be a customs inspector. The others were (1) Selection Process 2001-CCRA-PAC-3961-7009 (\u201cVictoria Competition 7009\u201d), in which Mr. Turner was interviewed on April 2, 2002 (see Exhibit R-3, Tabs 67 and 69), and (2) Selection Process 2002-1060-PAC-3961-7012 (\u201cVictoria Competition 7012\u201d), in which Mr. Turner was interviewed on February 13, 2003 (see Exhibit\nR-3, Tabs 62-64).\n[92] While the circumstances of the Victoria 7009 (2001) and Victoria 7012 (2002) competitions are not in issue in this inquiry the circumstances of the Victoria 7012 process may have some relevance to the assessment of the credibility of Superintendent Paul Tarnawski. Superintendent Tarnawski was the interview board Chairperson in Vancouver Competition 1002, and in Victoria Competition 7012. These circumstances will be discussed later in this decision.\n(b) Vancouver Competition 1002 [93] The Vancouver Competition 1002 notice was posted June 9, 2003, it was a job opportunity described as, \u201cthis position,\u201d \u2026 \u201cPM-02, Customs Inspector, Vancouver International Airport District, Metro Vancouver District, Pacific Highway District, \u2026\u201d\n[94] The Job Opportunity advertisement contained an eligibility restriction: \u201cApplicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be considered for this process.\u201d\n[95] In April 26, 2004, Mr. Turner was interviewed by a three-member panel \u2013 Ron Tarnawski, Mark Northcote and Karen Morin \u2013 for the Customs Inspector position stipulated in the June 9, 2003 Notice of Job Opportunity.\n[96] Mr. Turner testified that before he applied to the Vancouver Competition 1002, he considered the extent of the eligibility restriction in the Notice of Job Opportunity and concluded that its purpose was to deny eligibility to persons who, since January 1, 2002, had been interviewed in Vancouver for the PM-02 position of Customs Inspector. Since he had not been previously interviewed in Vancouver for the PM-02 position and wanted a permanent position as a customs inspector, Mr. Turner applied and received a competency package (Exhibit C-1,\nTab 23). After submitting a written account detailing his competency, Mr. Turner was invited to an interview which took place on April 26, 2004. Mr. Turner testified that it was a short interview presided over by Superintendent Ron Tarnawski, the other board members being Mr. Northcote and Ms. Morin. Mr. Turner identified Exhibit Tab 64 (Volume 3) as notes of the interview process made by panel members Northcote and Morin recording that he had achieved a passing grade of 70 and had \u201cmet\u201d the required standard of competency. Those notes were crossed out and an entry stated: \u201cnot qualified to interview, not qualified inside the restriction as on poster.\u201d Transcript: Volume One, section two, page 125, lines 7-11.\n[97] Counsel for CBSA conceded that, but for the eligibility restriction, Mr. Turner would have been placed in a pool of qualified potential employees.\nMr. Stark: \u2026 I don\u2019t want to put words in the mouths of my witnesses, but in terms of the position generally of the Respondent, (it) is that the intent of the eligibility restriction was not to preclude candidates who had been successful, for example, in Victoria or elsewhere, from applying in Vancouver.\nThe intent of it was to preclude individuals who had previously been found to be unqualified in \u2013 in competitions for the position of Customs Inspector. And in that case, because Mr. Turner had been found unsuccessful in Victoria, he was in violation of that eligibility restriction.\nAnd the rationale for it is quite simply is that if someone has been assessed within the previous two years, it \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 again, this is my very simplified term, but essentially it\u2019s not worth the time of passing someone up through the competition process when they\u2019ve previously been \u2013 applied and not met the criteria. The feeling is and the belief is that they are better out there getting further experience so that they can come back and after a period of time where they\u2019ve been able to update their skills, improve them, get more experience, then they can be reassessed at a later time. \u2026\nThere is not another reason why he was disqualified; it is the eligibility restriction. There is some other contextual facts as well, which don\u2019t go to why he was found not to be qualified but it was certain facts the Selection Board were aware of.\nEmphasis added\nMr. Yazbeck: Okay. So, just so it\u2019s clear, so he was disqualified because of the eligibility restriction only but you\u2019re saying there were other facts that the Board was aware of that might have affected how they dealt with him.\nMr. Stark: Correct.\nMr. Yazbeck: Okay. All right, I think I know what they are. That\u2019s fine.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 121, lines 20-25; page 122, lines 1-15; page 123, lines 1-13.\n[98] Counsel for the Complainant produced Exhibit Tab 66, notes made by Mr. Tarnawski during the interview, which state that \u201c\u2026we realized that Levan had been interviewed less than one year prior and due to restriction we have on our processes Levan was not eligible to apply for this process.\u201d\n[99] Counsel asked Mr. Turner if the eligibility restriction was discussed in the course of the interview.\nA. No. It was not. You mean to the fact that I was going to be disqualified?\nQ. No \u2026 the issue of you participating \u2013 the restriction \u2026?\nA. Oh, yes they did mention that to me saying that, you know, asking me if I had interviewed previously for this position.\nThe Chairperson: Is that fact true that you had interviewed less than one year prior?\nA Yes, because I interviewed for the Victoria process, but not for \u2013 when they say this position, but for the Victoria process, and that was the reason for the poster.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 127, lines 2-18.\n[100] Mr. Turner testified that when he entered the interview room he recognized Mr. Tarnawski as the Board Chairperson who interviewed him in Victoria in the spring of 2003, and that he told Mr. Tarnawski that they had met before.\nQ. \u2026 and he said yes, I remember the voice and presence.\nA. Yeah, and it was the way he said it, he goes, \u2018Yes, I remember the voice and the presence.\u2019\nQ. Okay. You mentioned you were the only black officer in Victoria. Is that your evidence as well.\nA. Yes.\nQ. So how did the issue of you interviewing previously come up? Like, what was the nature of the exchange?\nA. Well, when I sat down for the interview they asked if I had previously interviewed for, and Ron Tarnawski put his hand on the table, and says \u201cfor this position\u201d. And I said no I hadn\u2019t, and then he said okay, and we continued on with the interview.\u201d Transcript: Volume One, section 2, page128, lines 22-25; page 129, lines 1-12.\n[101] Mr. Turner testified that a week after the interview he received a telephone call from panel member Karin Morin who explained that they had looked into the matter and realized he had been interviewed previously in Victoria, therefore the process would not be continued.\nA. And I guess it was about 15 minutes later I got a call from Ron Tarnawski the Board Chair and he said, let me explain exactly what I meant, it\u2019s only if you were unsuccessful in the Victoria process were you being screened out because you were unsuccessful. And then we got into a conversation of well, that doesn\u2019t make any sense because if you\u2019re unsuccessful that\u2019s not what the \u2013 it doesn\u2019t say that on the poster. \u2026\n\u2026But from what I understood it was, if you were in Victoria and you were successful, from what he wanted me to believe, then you could \u2026 apply and re-qualify again for Vancouver but that didn\u2019t make any sense to me. \u2026 and I said, \u2018well, it doesn\u2019t make any sense, because people who are coming over that are already successfully in a board, then why would you have them re-test again in Vancouver?\u2019 And he Said, well, different board, different questions\u2019.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 132, lines 1-9, 13-18.\n[102] Following this conversation, Mr. Turner received a letter, Exhibit (Tab 68) dated\nJune 1, 2004, sent by Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Northcott stating that \u201c\u2026 if you\u2019ve interviewed for the above-mentioned position since January 1, 2002, you\u2019ll not be allowed to go for this process.\u201d\nQ. And just to be clear, the \u201cabove mentioned position\u201d is Metro Vancouver position. Had you interviewed for that before?\nA. No. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: Can I just clarify something here? You said that Mr. Tarnawski said in telephone conversation, because you were unsuccessful in the Victoria Boarding, you were ineligible to apply for the Vancouver position.\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nThe Chairperson: And that was in April 04?\nA. Of \u201904.\nThe Chairperson: And you get this letter \u2026 on June 1\/04.\nA. Yes.\nThe Chairperson: And looking at the first paragraph, what did you understand that to mean?\nA. I understood that to mean that if I had interviewed for the above noted process, which it says there, specifically states Metro Vancouver, Pacific Highway and Vancouver International Airports, that I was ineligible for this process. And I had not interviewed for that specific position and that\u2019s why I was questioning it. Even though it says there, that that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s still the same thing as in the poster. I had not interviewed for that specific position.\nThe Chairperson: And then you said you wrote a letter to \u2013\nA. I did, yes, because I wanted to make sure that I got something in writing. It says here If I require information please submit request in writing. So I submitted a letter \u2013\nMr. Yazbeck: This is tab 69.\nA. Tab 69, thank you. Thanking the Board for the opportunity to compete and I wanted to, I told them that I had received my letter of disqualification and I wanted them to put down in writing what our telephone conversation was about. And I wanted them to make sure, and I said I did not board for the locations as stated in the competition. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: I guess their answer is going to be, am I anticipating that the position is Customs inspector and the location is irrelevant? Is that the explanation that they gave you?\nA. They said, yes, it\u2019s the position. But not according to what the poster is. The poster, what I was led to believe, the poster is what it says, that it was for a position at metro Vancouver. And the position even though it\u2019s Customs inspector, is totally different at a big airport than it would be here in a marine port. So I wouldn\u2019t even think that (inaudible) it\u2019s saying it\u2019s the exact same position.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 135, lines 20-25; page 136, lines 1-2, 12-25; page 137, lines 1-25; page 140, lines 1-23.\n[103] The Chairperson put further questions to Mr. Turner to clarify whether Mr. Turner believed the posting was for the general category of Customs Inspector or for Customs Inspector in Vancouver. Mr. Turner reiterated his belief that job opportunity was for the position of Customs Inspector in metro Vancouver.\nThe Chairperson: And then when I go to Tab 75, in the Agency\u2019s response to your complaint to the Human Rights Commission at page 566, they say \u201cAt your interview on April 26, 2004, you were advised of the restriction on the poster, applicants who had been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002, will not be eligible for this process. When questioned regarding whether he had applied for the position since January 1, 2002 at the interview, Mr. Turner indicated he had not.\u201d\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nThe Chairperson: Were you questioned during the interview whether you had applied for the position since January 1, 2002?\nA. Yes, I was questioned.\nThe Chairperson: What did they ask you?\nA. They said have you ever applied, and Ron Tarnawski said for \u201cthis position\u201d, and he had a copy of the position, the poster, on his desk, said for \u201cthis position\u201d. So when you do that, I assume it means, you know, for the Vancouver position. I had never applied for Vancouver before \u2013 or sorry, I had never been interviewed for Vancouver before. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: And your understanding of the question was?\nA. Was that he was simply referring to the Metro Vancouver VIA position. Because before then they were always separate.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 155, lines 4-25; page 156, lines 1, 8-12.\n[104] Counsel for the Complainant also asked Mr. Turner further questions on this issue:\nQ. Mr. Turner, could you turn now to tab 80. \u2026 This is another letter to (sic) [from] the agency to the Commission outlining its position. This is from February 2007. And I\u2019d like to take you to page 624, so the second page of the letter. The second paragraph, full paragraph, starting with: \u201cMr. Turner has also been found to not be truthful on occasion. For example, when applying for the position and stating he had not been previously been a candidate in a recent process, was found to be untrue.\u201d I\u2019m going to stop right there. Until you saw this letter, were you aware that the Agency had concluded that your statement about applying for the position was untrue?\nA. No, Not at all. I wouldn\u2019t have had any idea until I got this through my (inaudible) request.\nQ. And have you at any time been given an opportunity by the Agency to explain, to respond to the allegation that you\u2019re untrue (sic).\nA. No.\nQ. And in the same paragraph, there\u2019s a reference to you embellishing on your resume about being a police officer again was untrue. First of all, did you ever state on your resume or otherwise that you were a police officer?\nA. No, I didn\u2019t.\nQ. Okay, what did you say you were?\nA. I said I was an Auxiliary police officer with over 2,000 hours of volunteer experience.\nTranscript: Volume One, section two, page 164, lines 16-25; page 165 lines 1-19.\nCross-Examination of Levan Turner [105] In cross-examining Mr. Turner, Counsel for the Respondent was faced with the task of establishing a rational explanation of the determination by a Victoria Competition 7003 managerial review panel that Mr. Turner lacked the competence and capability to be re-hired as a Customs Inspector, a function he had carried out during the prior four years. The finding, that Mr. Turner had failed to demonstrate his competency, was made after a one-two hour interview, during which the interviewing board members disregarded their personal knowledge that Mr. Turner had been assessed yearly and obtained positive performance reviews during his four-year stint as a seasonal term customs inspector.\n[106] The thrust of Respondent Counsel\u2019s cross-examination was an attempt to demonstrate that Respondent managers, by their positive reviews of Mr. Turner as a customs inspector, could not have engaged in contemporaneous acts of discrimination or differential treatment of Mr. Turner, both before and during the interview process.\n[107] At its high point, the Respondent\u2019s cross-examination failed to defuse Mr. Turner\u2019s allegation of discrimination by reason of race, age and disability. Transcript: Volume Two, section 3, page 137 to 145.\n[108] In dealing with \u201cGoals\u201d and \u201cPerformance Expectations\u201d:\nQ. The first one is \u2018provide quality service to our internal and external clients\u2019 and this is the assessment that is given of you, Mr. Turner. It says: \u2018Levan continues to show, year after year, quality service to the travelling public and his peers. An example is his on the job training of new staff. Levan extends courtesy and knowledge to the travelling public, so they understand what their rights and obligations are\u2019.\nNow, Mr. Turner, you\u2019ve indicated and the basis of your Complaint is that there was something wrong. You\u2019re employer had some issue with you, correct, in terms of either weight ---\nA. Yes.\nQ. \u2013 age? \u2013\nA. Right.\nQ \u2013 race?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It\u2019s certainly not apparent on your Performance Reviews, is it?\nA. No.\nQ. Consistently right through these Performance Reviews, they have assessed you in a positive way?\nA. Yes. That\u2019s why I was shocked when I had that e-mail from Terry at the end.\nQ. So, if there was any calculated intent to treat you unfairly, you would expect quite the opposite? You would expect those \u2013 those \u2013 the differential treatment, the discrimination, to start appearing in the form of negative assessments in your Performance Reviews wouldn\u2019t you?\nMr. Yazbeck: No, I\u2019m going to object. I\u2019m not \u2013 my friend is asking the witness to speculate about what Agency managers might have done in order to engage in this calculated attempt.\nThe Chairperson: I think it\u2019s a fair question, Mr. Stark.\nMr. Turner: Sorry, would you say that again?\n\u2026\nQ. You wouldn\u2019t think that if there was a calculated intent, they would start to make negative remarks about you in terms of your performance?\nA. No, and the reason why is because as a government agency, I don\u2019t think they would want to put something like that, especially related to race or age or weight into any sort of written document. That would be suicide on their part.\nQ. Absolutely, but in terms of the overall assessment of your skills and abilities, they\u2019re not neutral, are they?\nA. No.\nQ. They\u2019re overwhelmingly positive.\nA. Correct.\nQ. They\u2019re if they had of been any calculated intent to discriminate against you, they could have given you neutral \u2013\nA. And then, I would have argued the point.\nQ. They didn\u2019t do that, though, did they? They\u2019ve given you glowing references in pretty much every category?\nA. Yes, they did.\nQ. All right.\nA. Yes\nQ. The only concerns that \u2013 the two concerns, the one I mentioned to you regarding bringing \u2013 how you bring matters to the attention to management and asking to do it in a constructive way, and then there\u2019s the issues with Terry Klassen that we\u2019ll go on to talk about in a second.? Those are the only concerns brought to you attention.\nA. Well, the other one wasn\u2019t, not that I remember, but, yes.\nQ. Okay.\nThe Chairperson: But Klassen was not brought to your attention?\nA. Well, not at this point here. He was going to bring it up after my Performance Review. Yes, we had that discussion.\nQ. Right. All right, and then if we go down to the second goal on this first page, page 2-33 of the Book of Documents, the objective is \u2013 goal is \u2018making appropriate decisions that are consistent with the customs priorities in an ever-changing environment\u2019, and your review is: \u2018Levan continues to learn and apply his knowledge. Thus he is able to provide clients with better service and options. He is able to function on his own in BBO and Clipper Commercial. At times he has taken on a leadership role when the superintendent is not on site.\u2019\nAgain, that\u2019s a very positive review, isn\u2019t it \u2013 a review of you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It\u2019s not neutral?\nA. No.\nQ. It\u2019s a clear message that management in terms of your performance is happy with the way you do your job?\nA. Yes, with\u2014Terry is anyway, yes.\nQ. All right.\nA. Because don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s only signed by one person.\nQ. Now, you mentioned that it\u2019s only signed by one person. I\u2019m not going to dispute that. I just want you to confirm and acknowledge that above these goals, there\u2019s an indication of manager\u2019s names or manager\u2019s name, and there\u2019s three individuals there. There\u2019s M. Gibbons.\nA. Right.\nQ. T. Klassen and R. Pinninger.\nA. Yes.\nQ. They were, in fact, your management team that had authority over you?\nA. Well, Terry was acting superintendent, and the other two were \u2013 I think Mara was acting superintendent, and Rick was a superintendent, so, yes. I don\u2019t know if they actually read this or signed it \u2013 or anything, so I can\u2019t attest to that.\nQ. All right.\nA. You\u2019ll have to ask them.\nQ. All right, and them, under the third goal, it says, \u2018Effectively communicates with clients and team members\u2019 and then you\u2019re assessed in this way: \u2018Through observation of Levan, he has shown a good ability to be clear and concise with travelers and team members. Communication to superintendents through the Flash Report was minimal.\u2019\nA. Correct.\nQ. And, I take it \u2018communication to superintendents through Flash Report was minimal\u2019, that\u2019s a positive thing, rather than a negative ---\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right, so again, this is a positive thing, a positive review of you, in this area?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Next objective is 4, over the page. It reads: \u2018Works cooperatively with members of the team and with other teams\u2019, and then, the response and it relates to you: \u2018Through observation, Levan assisted often at cruise ships, and with the completion of the daily rosters. Levan was willing to take on a leadership role when asked and provided guidance to new employees.\u2019\nA. Yes, it shows I was working pretty hard, yes.\nQ. And that\u2019s a fair representation of your work?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Not unfair one? It represents how you performed?\nA. Yes. It says I was a good employee and I was working hard, and I was really busy.\nQ. Now, finally, on this page and on this document, it says: \u20185; provides fair, responsible and effective enforcement of our programs\u2019, and then the assessment of you is: Levan has a good understanding of the customs enforcement and O.P. process. This can be seen through Seizures 8-1-1, - dash \u2013 \u20186002 - - 6063 and 2OP instance warrant and ASD \u201cWarn\u201d?\nA. Correct.\nQ. That's a good review, isn\u2019t it?\nA. It\u2019s \u2013 yes it is. It shows I would be a good customs inspector.\nQ. All right, now, over, over the page, this is where, - this is essentially the signature page here.\nA. Yes.\nQ. There\u2019s a few last \u2013 and it assessed you as meeting the overall valuation goals?\nA. Correct.\nQ All right, there\u2019s another category above that I suppose which it exceeds, but you\u2019ve certainly been found to meet the appropriate criteria?\nA. Correct.\nQ. And then, the manager has got some comments here. He writes: \u2018In support of the overall assessment, write a brief narrative, and he has answered this essentially by saying, \u2018eligible for re-hire\u2019?\nA. Right.\nQ. So, based upon this Performance Review, and it actually was the last one, I suppose, that you were \u2013 that was done of you while you were working at CBSA?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It\u2019s a very positive review?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And, it\u2019s marked very clearly on there that you\u2019re eligible for rehire?\nA. Correct.\nQ. It\u2019s a clear indication, at least, that the management wants you back next season?\nA. Well, it\u2019s a clear indication that I\u2019m eligible for re-hire because of my qualifications.\nQ. Right.\nA. It doesn\u2019t say that management wants me back.\nQ. Right.\nA. It just says I\u2019m eligible for re-hire. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\nPrima facie case: \u2013 Evidentiary threshold [109] I conclude that Mr. Turner\u2019s testimony in cross-examination sustained and buttressed his credible direct testimony; that standing alone, his testimony, on a balancing of probabilities, establishes a prima facie case of discrimination as alleged against the Respondent.\n[110] Moreover, Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence is enhanced when considered in the context of Mr. Chris Hughes extensive evidence concerning the Respondent\u2019s employment practices and procedures.\nE. Witness: Terry Berent Klassen [111] Mr. Klassen testified that he was a Border Services Officer, 18-years into his career with CBSA. He has spent the last 8 years in Victoria, where he became acquainted with Mr. Turner as a co-worker, particularly during the summer of 2003 when, as an acting-superintendent in the marine section, he supervised Mr. Turner.\n[112] When Respondent Counsel asked for an explanation of the process to complete a performance assessment of an employee, Mr. Klassen described the goals and objectives which are outlined for the employees at the beginning of the summer, and that \u201c\u2026at the end of the summer we would sit down with them again and take a look at the goals and objectives, and relay to them how we felt, either they met them or did not meet them.\u201d Transcript January 19, 2009: page 15, lines 15-18.\n[113] Mr. Klassen identified Exhibit Tab 77, (in Volume 3 - Respondents Book of Exhibits) a document dated September 26, 2003, as Mr. Turner\u2019s performance report that he reviewed with Mr. Turner that evening.\nMr. Stark: Did you have a lengthy discussion with Mr. Turner about his performance that year?\nA. The actual performance evaluation that we\u2019re seeing in front of us right now probably would have been, I don\u2019t know, maybe 10 to 15 minutes in length, after which Levan and I would have signed it off, given him a copy of it, and then we sat down and talked some more, \u2026 about how Levan was perceived, how his work ethic was perceived by the CBSA Superintendents of Victoria.\nTranscript January 21, 2009: page 24, lines 3-8.14-16.\n[114] During Mr. Klassen\u2019s testimony concerning Mr. Turner\u2019s perceived work ethic, the Chairperson became involved, told Mr. Klassen he was again being very vague, and directed Counsel to bring him to the point. Respondent\u2019s Counsel then produced Exhibit Tab 80, identified by Mr. Klassen as an e-mail sent to himself of what he had discussed with Mr. Turner after the assessment was reviewed and signed off. The email read in part:\n\u2026 I then went to the point and started talking about how he is perceived i.e. how he sometime shies away from the harder tasks, or knows the right procedure (a difficult task) to take but ask to supt for \u201cadvice\u201d hoping the supt will use their discretion and go the easier way. It was also pointed out how other inspectors had complained that he had left cash outs for others to do instead of doing them on his shift. These points were delivered in a very compassionate way and Levan responded with shock but not defensively. He kept on saying this is contrary to his work ethic\/nature and the way he sees the world. He asked why he had not been talked to about this in the past and I responded I did not know and thus it was not included on his assessment as he was not made aware of it and could not respond or take corrective action. He felt if supts would have come to him at the time of their concern he could have explained his actions so that it would not be seen as him sloughing things off.\nI went on to explain this perception has been around for a couple of summers and that it was something he would need to work on next year by taking on those difficult tasks and being cognisant of his decisions so that he is not taking the easy way out. I reminded him that this is not how he is perceived all the time but rather I see him as a very good communicator that works well with the public and continues to grow in knowledge. \u2026\n[115] When asked about the email, Mr. Klassen stated the following:\nMr. Klassen: This information in here is not reflected in his assessment, because of the fact that these issues hadn\u2019t been raised with Levan. So, it\u2019s not fair to base his assessment on these perceptions or observations, because they hadn\u2019t been discussed with him at this point in time until that point. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see any of these observations or concerns or perceptions listed in the performance evaluation of 2003, the summer of 2003.\nSo, you know, this talk was had with Levan so that coming back to us in the year 2004, which I had recommended that he be rehired for. Then his next Superintendent the next year could have \u2013 could see this conversation that had taken place with Levan and, you know, work with him to ensure, you know, that these objectives, these learning points were achieved the next year.\nRespondent Counsel: All right. Now, who \u2013 did someone, perhaps one of the other Superintendents, ask you to have this conversation with Mr. Turner?\nMr. Klassen: I\u2019m afraid I, don\u2019t recall. It would be \u2013 I think I initiated it on my own but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just a guess.\nTranscript: Page 26, lines 5-25, page 27, lines 1-3.\n[116] The Chairperson again intervened and asked Mr. Klassen if his e-mail related to his after-the-performance-review dialogue with Mr. Turner.\nA. I raised these issues, yes, from this e-mail \u2013 sorry, I raised -- I talked with Levan about these different issues, perceptions that were out there about Levan, and then I summarized it and sent if off to the Chief in this e-mail.\nTranscript: Page 1764, lines 2-6.\n[117] The Chairperson persisted and asked why the email, Exhibit Tab 80 was not sent to Mr. Turner. Mr. Klassen\u2019s reply appears responsive; however, in cross-examination it is revealed to be an irresponsible exaggeration and not factual.\nThe Chairperson: You prepared this, according to this it shows you prepared it on October 3rd and it went to Diane Cavalaars and the other Supers on the next day.\nA. Yeah, that\u2019s \u2013 I think I probably had the e-mail in draft form for a while and was \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t recall if I started on it immediately after I spoke with Levan or if there had been a couple of days that transpired before I started composing the e-mail.\nThe Chairperson: So, the e-mail outlining the detail, we\u2019ve seen it before, I believe, and without going through it in detail, these were concerns that others had expressed and also reflected some of your concerns?\nA. Correct, with some of the other superintendents and some of mine. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: Why wouldn\u2019t you have passed this e-mail on to him and made him aware \u2026\nA. \u2026 I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t been given a copy of it, why I didn\u2019t forward a copy of the e-mail to him at that time.\u201d\nTranscript: Page 29, line 25, page 29, lines 1-25, page 33, lines 22-25, page 34, lines 8-10.\n[118] At one point Respondent Counsel attempted to have Mr. Klassen clarify his evidence concerning the source of perceptions of Mr. Turner.\nMr. Stark: All right. You also make comment there that how he is perceived. Is that the perception of others, or is that your perception\nMr. Klassen: The perception of how he was perceived was \u2013 would have been from other Superintendents, as well as some of his co-workers.\nThe Chairperson: \u2026 where does it say that, how he was perceived?\nMr. Stark: It doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m asking him in general a question with respect to that. It\u2019s not in his e-mail, although I\u2019m referring, I guess in a sense, to the first line when it says: I went to the point and started talking about how he is perceived?\n[119] Mr. Klassen described the end of summer meeting of superintendents as a roundtable, but named only himself, Rick Penneger and Mara Gibbons as participants; that it was Rick Penneger who \u201c\u2026 made comments alluding to some of these perceptions of looking for an easy way out, \u2026 not helping out as much as maybe some of the other officers.\u201d Transcript January 21, 2009: page 36, lines 19-25; page 37, lines 1-6, 24-25; page 38, lines 1-6.\n[120] Under cross-examination Mr. Klassen admitted that the one incident of Mr. Turner supposedly taking an easy way out was not an enforcement incident. Rather, it was a procedural situation involving paperwork that might have taken up to an hour to complete. Mr. Klassen agreed with Mr. Champ, Counsel for the Complainant, that it was likely that Mr. Turner had the interests of the traveler in mind. Mr. Klassen agreed that Mr. Turner had proactively developed a basis for experienced officers to engage in learning circles with newly-employed officers, a positive example of Mr. Turner\u2019s work ethic. Nevertheless, Mr. Klassen stubbornly maintained that this one incident with a late traveler was a shortcut, and was in keeping with the superintendents\u2019 perception of Mr. Turner.\n[121] Notwithstanding that Mr. Klassen\u2019s evidence was often hesitant and vague, it does establish beyond doubt that the Victoria superintendents were engaged in an pattern of assuming, without proof, that Mr. Turner was avoiding carrying out the full extent of his duties \u2013 assumptions which they intellectualized as negative \u201cperceptions\u201d \u2013 knowing full well that perceiving Mr. Turner as a shirker was diametrically opposed to their own effusive managerial assessments of Mr. Turner, documented in performance reviews in each of his five years of employment as a term Customs Inspector.\n[122] That Mr. Klassen sent his e-mail to the Chief Superintendent and other superintendents on October 4, 2003, only a week before a poster, dated October 11, 2003, was published, announcing the Victoria 7003 staffing competition, brings into question the impartiality of the panellists in their interview of Mr. Turner and their finding that he was not qualified to continue in employment as a Customs Inspector.\nF. Witness: Trevor Baird [123] At the time of his testimony Mr. Baird had been with CBSA and its predecessor agency CCRA for 15 years, and was employed as Chief of Operations, Port of Prince Rupert. Mr. Baird had prior stints in the Lower Mainland operations of CBSA, including the Flexible Response Team dealing with enforcement, and in Victoria from 1999 to 2004, becoming a superintendent in 2002.\n[124] Work assignments of customs inspectors at the port of entry of Victoria.\nThe Chairperson: When you are a superintendent in marine, you are a superintendent responsible for a particular shift, is it just up to the officer to decide where they are going to go? And if you are working in TRC and things get slow, well, I think I will go wander over to Marine, or I will wander over to secondary on the ferries, or I will just sit here and do nothing, or I\u2019ll just wander over. Is it that lax or that loose?\n\u201cA. \u2026the way it\u2019s structured, is that we\u2019ve broken into \u2013 Victoria is broken into specific working units. \u2026 And so the telephone reporting centre has a superintendent that is responsible for managing that piece of the operation.\nThe marine section, which is responsible for doing all the outside processing, which encompasses cruise ships, ferries, aircraft, pleasure craft, float planes, that sort of stuff, will have at times up to three superintendents responsible for it because they are running a seven day week operation encompassing day and afternoon shift.\nThe long room, or our storefront operations, typically has two staff members working in it and they report to the commercial superintendent. So there are three distinct working units going on.\nAs it relates to marine activities, there is a roster daily, and staff are assigned specific duties during the day. And if there are a number of ferries coming in, for example the Clipper ferry which comes in multiple times a day; the Coho ferry which comes in, I believe, twice \u2013 or at least daily \u2013 it did back then \u2013 the roster will designate what staff are needing to be ferry and what specific function they should be doing, whether it be primary or secondary.\nNow, you know, the roster is subject to change, but it gives you the basic outline of what your day looks like.\nAlternatively the TRC, it\u2019s a very static location. If you are working in the TRC you know you are going to be there all day unless your task was going out and doing other things.\nThe superintendents ultimately what they are responsible for in a very simplistic example, is they are trying to manage the resources they have to cover off all the business pressures in a day. And if they encounter problems during the day where there are unexpected arrivals, or perhaps seizures going on that require attention, they will draw on resources throughout the operation in order to \u2013 to keep things moving. So conceivably a marine superintendent could phone the TRC and say, you need to send me some resources, we are backed up.\nSo it is a very fluid environment and I suspect at times it probably does seem like there is a lack of control, but the superintendents have a large number of factors that cause interruption in their day, and they are really trying to manage that.\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 93, lines 20-25; page 94, lines 1-25; page 95, lines 1-25; page 96, lines 1-6.\n[125] Mr. Baird was Mr. Turner\u2019s supervisor in the marine section from May to September 2002. When asked for his impression of Mr. Turner as a customs inspector, Mr. Baird delivered the following backhanded characterization:\nAnd I think that\u2019s where my primary impression comes from is my time as supervising Levan and, you know, again, there are things that as an employee I like about Levan and that he does well, but I would not characterize Levan as fully, fully developing into all of the roles that is expected of a Customs Inspector. And when we\u2019re talking about a part of the job being client services or dealing with agents or brokers or, you know, working the Telephone Reporting Centre or those sorts of \u2013 parts of the job that are more client service oriented, I think, you know Levan has a skill set to do that and I think he\u2019s very comfortable doing that and does a good job doing that.\nIn relation to the parts of the job that are more proactive in terms of enforcement and being out trying to identify non-compliance amongst travellers, doing secondary exams, seeing them through to enforcement, such as seizures, that was not a strong suit, in my opinion, for Levan.\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 97, lines 19-25; page 98, lines 1-13.\n[126] Mr. Baird identified Exhibit R-3, Tab 75 (cross-referenced C-1, Tab 12) as his mid-summer performance review of Mr. Turner, which included the following comments relating to Organizational Competency.\nI\u2019ve always found you to be very polite and courteous when dealing with the public and fellow officers. You always present yourself in a professional manner or even in difficult circumstances. You have a good understanding of Custom regulations and are able to fulfill cash and commercial roles in the ferry terminal.\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 100, lines 8-15.\n[127] The review contained the following addendum: \u201cWhen bringing work-related questions and concerns forward there is an expectation that it will be done in a constructive manner in order to seek a positive resolution.\u201d Transcript: January 21, 2009; page 101, lines 8-11.\n[128] This comment related to non-work times when Mr. Turner was observed with other employees engaging in down-time workplace bull sessions complaining about things happening on the job. Mr. Baird testified that while the complaints were legitimate, the resolution to those problems should be done in a constructive manner.\n[129] In this mid-performance review (Exhibit C-1, Tab 12), after the addendum, Mr. Baird added:\nYou have a demonstrated ability to effectively communicate with clients and fellow officers. You\u2019re able to complete well written, detailed reports and accurately complete Customs forms. You\u2019re able to effectively ask questions, listen to responses, and respond accordingly. You have the potential to become a very effective interviewer.\nSince discussing the need to bring forward issues in a constructive manner, I observe an immediate response from you to rectify this issue. I appreciate the effort you have made and encourage you to continue dealing with the outstanding issues in this constructive manner. (emphasis added)\nI would like to encourage you to gain more exposure in enforcement through secondary exams.\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 106, line 25; page 107, lines 1-8; page 108, lines 13-19; page 109, lines 22-25.\n[130] In his cross-examination Complainant Counsel, Mr. Champ, focused on concerns of Mr. Baird regarding Mr. Turner\u2019s lack of experience in conducting secondary examinations.\nA. Within the scope of secondary, interviewing is part of that. The other part to that is examining vehicles, examining baggage, dealing with persons that are under detention or in custody, personal searches or personal searches is a technical term, strip searches. So, what I\u2019m saying is, you know, that he has an excellent understanding of our primary and secondary procedures, but I\u2019m not specifically notating interviewing.\nQ. Would interview be an examination?\nA. It would be part of an examination.\nQ. Because the last one is: \u201cYou also demonstrate good judgment while dealing with secondary examination and enforcement activity.\u201d So that would include interviews as part of that, I would gather?\nA. It would.\nQ. So, I guess on the whole what I\u2019m trying to say, Mr. Baird, is at mid-term you had observed that Mr. Turner, in your view, was not getting involved in many secondary exams; correct?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. So, in other words, your opinion, once you actually started \u2013 once you raised with him that you wanted him to do more of that, he addressed the fact that he had been doing it. In fact you were very pleased with what he had done.\nA. Correct. From the time the mid-term assessment was delivered in August -- until the final assessment was delivered in October.\n\u2026\nQ. And by the end of the year you\u2019re saying: \u201cYou\u2019ve been involved in many secondary exams\u201d; correct?\nQ. Yes.\nQ. \u2026and in a lot of those secondary exams, I gather that Mr. Turner would have been showing initiative, or he wasn\u2019t sloughing things off, he was getting involved and helping out?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. Because earlier you had suggested that just from your observation he seemed to hang back a bit?\nA. Yes, it was.\nQ. And I gather that that was also addressed by the end of that term?\nA. Yes, it was.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 38, lines 20-25; page 39, lines 1-25; page 40, lines 1-24.\n[131] When asked about the Victoria Competition 7003, Mr. Baird identified Exhibit R-1,\nTab 47 (cross-referenced C-2, Tab 43) as a lead sheet relating to the interview of Mr. Turner that he conducted in Victoria with co-panellists Ms. Pringle and Ms. Zabos. Mr. Baird testified that the entries written on the lead sheet related to the competencies \u2018Effective Interactive Communication\u2019 and \u2018Teamwork and Cooperation\u2019; that in these competencies Mr. Turner was given failing scores of 60 and 40.\n[132] Mr. Baird identified written comments of co-panellist Catherine Pringle, made after the decision that Mr. Turner was not qualified. Ms. Pringle recorded that Mr. Turner had failed to be clear and concise in the matter of his relationship with the Toronto Police Services, leading them to assume that he had been an officer with the Toronto Police Services rather than an auxiliary. The review panel\u2019s assumption resulted from the fact that they had not examined Mr. Turner\u2019s resume which stated he was an auxiliary officer. Nevertheless Mr. Baird and Ms. Pringle determined that Mr. Turner hadn\u2019t been clear in what he was communicating, ipso facto he was embellishing and not truthful.\n[133] In responding to questions from the Respondent\u2019s Counsel, Mr. Baird tended to generalize his answers. One instance of this occurred when Respondent Counsel asked Mr. Baird to indicate where, in Mr. Turners written response to the portfolio of competencies, Mr. Turner had made negative comments of other persons.\nQ. \u2026if we may go to tab 47 again at the assessment we are at \u2026 then under \u2018comments\u2019 you have got another notation: \u2018Written material. Paints other negatively.\u2019 \u2026where is it in Mr. Turner\u2019s written material where he paints others negatively?\nIn a number of the competencies there were areas that appeared to paint others in a negative or diminished light in their involvement in the examples. Dealing with difficult situations was certainly an example. Teamwork and Cooperation we also notated in our notes some of the articulation we felt was negative or derogatory \u2013 not derogatory, but diminished others\u2019 involvement is the example, as well as decisiveness as another example. (emphasis added)\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 173, lines 21-25; page 174, lines 1-5.\n[134] Counsel asked Mr. Baird for a specific example in Mr. Turner\u2019s written submission and Mr. Baird chose \u201cdealing with difficult situations\u201d.\nA. \u201cIn this example is an example where there is an agitated traveler. Our detector dog, handler and canine are trying to do an exam of the vehicle. The superintendent is involved, at that time, Nina Patel. And essentially the traveler is agitated and highly aggressive. In the example it appears that the individual is going to be going back to the United States, isn\u2019t admissible at this point in time.\nAnd in the example Levan is providing an example where he got involved at some point during the secondary examination and his projection of it was able to calm the traveler and provide an explanation as to what was going on, and essentially resolved the situation. And this example, in written material there are some things that I would point to \u2013 and I had come back to point to them \u2013 that detract from other\u2019s involvements. And that certainly came out at the interview when probed on them. Probed on those specific things that he tended to overstate or embellish his role at the expense of others involved.\nIf I can just have a moment, I am just going to review the written submission specifically. For example: \u201cNina stayed behind me and I kept other officers away while I spoke to the individual. When she could see that I was able to calm him down, she approached and started in on the conversation. From this point on I was the only officer this gentleman would talk to.\u201d\nIn this scenario Nina Patel was the acting superintendent of this situation. And you know, an officer with a lot of experience dealing with hostile and aggressive travelers in highly charged situations. And I don\u2019t \u2013 in my own experience she would not stand back and keep other officers away for somebody else to come in and deal with it. So although subtle, it\u2019s not one thing to say I came in and helped, and participated, and tried to calm the individual. But in the sentence he is saying I came in and took over and she stood back and kept others away while I dealt with it. And that \u2013 although on its own, is not significant, it\u2019s a flag that we noted.\nTranscript: January 21, 2009; page 174, lines 18-25;page 175, lines 1-23; page 176, lines1-12.\n[135] With unbridled and inarticulate prolixity, Mr. Baird continued his answer \u2013 it spanned a further five pages of transcript \u2013 painting Mr. Turner as inarticulate and as an embellisher. In doing so he exhibited subjective partiality. I find that it was egregious of Mr. Baird to re-assess Mr. Turner\u2019s written response to the portfolio of competencies which had to have been examined and assessed by one of Mr. Baird\u2019s fellow superintendents, and given passing grades.\n[136] Mr. Baird testified that Mr. Turner\u2019s account of the incident with a difficult traveller was contrary to his own knowledge of Ms. Patel\u2019s ability to deal with hostile and aggressive travellers in highly charged situations, and therefore he had rejected Mr. Turner\u2019s account of the incident as an embellishment.\n[137] Approximately two weeks after the review board made its determination that Mr. Turner was no longer qualified to be a Customs Inspector, Mr. Baird sought out Ms. Patel to get her version of the incident.\n[138] Mr. Baird testified that he engaged in a telephone conversation with Ms. Patel on January 22, 2004 and, from his notes, informed her of Mr. Turner\u2019s account of his dealings with the difficult traveler and asked her if it was described accurately. Mr. Baird referred to notes of his discussion with Ms. Patel:\nThere\u2019s recognition in that Levan did deal with this traveller that, you know, he was good in dealing with him. There\u2019s a comment there that he was, you know, his jovial self, but she went on to disagree with his portrayal of his involvement in the example and she makes note that you know, he\u2019s making others look worse to make himself look better. She maintains that she maintained control of the situation of the individual. She stated that she felt it was, in her words, \u2018completely embellished.\u2019 She also stated, and this was actually in line, too, that she didn\u2019t feel that his involvement was \u2013 that it was not instrumental in dealing with this traveller. She also noted that she felt he, from his perspective, he may think this was his involvement in the example.\u201d\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 22; lines 7-24.\n[139] In cross-examination, Mr. Baird was asked why he felt the need to contact Ms. Patel, when he and Ms. Pringle had already disqualified Mr. Turner from the selection process.\nThe Chairperson: So, why did you call her?\nMr. Baird: Well, because, really, I wanted to know whether the example \u2013 because in the example, as it was portrayed and it was articulated at interview, it was so inconsistent to me that I wanted to follow this up at reference.\nMr. Champ: What was the difference to you at that point, Mr. Baird? \u2026\nA. Well, the short answer is there was no difference other than I wanted to follow this up.\nQ. Other than you wanted to prove that Mr. Turner was a liar?\nA. No, I wanted to validate whether or not the example as presented was accurate.\nQ. You wanted to validate it was accurate. You wanted to prove Mr. Turner was a liar, correct?\nThe Chairperson: I think \u201cliar\u201d is a bit strong, Mr. Champ.\nQ. It\u2019s over a month later. You\u2019re far advanced now in the process. Mr. Turner is already out of the competition. Why did you feel it necessary to validate the accuracy of the information at that stage?\nA. Because from the interview I had questions and I wanted to allay those questions, but you are quite correct, I did not need to do it.\nQ. And what purpose were you going to make of it.\nA. No purpose.\n\u2026\nQ. \u2026You took a lot of initiative to track down Ms. Patel in Quebec to get her recollection of the events, I\u2019m just wondering why?\nA. \u2026At the time it was presented at interview I had questions and I found that his portrayal was so inconsistent with what my knowledge of the workplace was, my observations that I wanted to validate this example, which as a board member, is an option that I have.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 93, lines 18-25; page 94, lines 1-22; page 96, lines 2-13.\n[140] At one point in the cross-examination of Mr. Baird, the Chairperson and Complainant Counsel engaged in a discussion of the purpose of questions being put to Mr. Baird.\nComplainant Counsel: First of all he (Mr. Turner) is invited by his superintendent (Ms. Patel). And his superintendent is dealing with a difficult traveler. So Ms. Patel is right in front dealing with this difficult traveler. She invited or asks Mr. Turner to help out, to take over the discussion, to talk to this individual. Then subsequently he is dealing with the dog handler ---\nThe Chairperson: Let\u2019s get to the point Mr. Champ. It seems to me I may ask this question \u2013 if you were just concerned how Mr. Turner expressed and depicted his colleagues, but you went further than that, didn\u2019t you. You said I, in judging this particular example and scoring it, I am going to deduce my knowledge of these two colleagues and I don\u2019t believe they would act that way. And thereafter I\u2019m questioning the veracity of the example, which is a different thing than just scoring the way it was communicated. So you would deduce extraneous knowledge that was beyond Mr. Turner\u2019s example. Is that correct?\nMr. Baird: That\u2019s correct, although we did not score dealing with difficult situations. As it relates to teamwork and co-operation, we were dealing \u2013 the issue of \u2013 what prompted me \u2013 what prompted me to contact Nina Patel ---\nThe Chairperson: No, before that because you said before you contacted \u2013 I understand what prompted you, because she\u2019s a validator. And your evidence in chief \u2013 in chief in particular, you stated that you did not think that Nina Patel or Ken Moore would act that way on the basis of you working with them for so many years.\nA. Correct.\nThe Chairperson: So you brought in extraneous information that wasn\u2019t in the \u2013 Mr. Turner\u2019s example, and you used that partly, or [indiscernible] as a basis for not qualifying Mr. Turner. That was part of the reasons why you didn\u2019t qualify him. Whereas you are saying I only looked at what was in the package. I looked at how it\u2019s communicated. I asked him some questions in the interview. And I didn\u2019t like the way he communicated, or how he described the situation because it looks like he was making himself look better and everybody else involved look bad That is not good teamwork and co-operation. Right. You didn\u2019t have to go to your knowledge of these other two people and how you think they would have reacted, because that was extraneous. That wasn\u2019t in the material.\nA. That is correct, sir?\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson: Mr. Baird, if you had called Ms. Patel, and she had said he was entirely right in what he said, would you then have changed your score?\nA. No.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 89, lines 15-22; page 90, lines 1-25; page 91, lines 1-25; page 92, lines 1-25; page 93, lines 14-25; page 94, lines 1-23; page 96, lines 21-23.\n[141] I conclude that the foregoing answers by Mr. Baird concerning his post-interview contact with Ms. Patel are implausible. While aware of Mr. Turner\u2019s growing competence as a customs inspector, it was discreditable of Mr. Baird to claim that he had an option, which he exercised after the Selection Board determination, to resort to his alleged personal knowledge of Ms. Patel, Mr. Moore, and the workplace.\n[142] In his direct evidence Mr. Baird summarized his views of Mr. Turner\u2019s written response to the portfolio of competencies:\nIn regards to the written package, it was our observation through, not the entire package, but certainly a large percentage of the package he submitted we\u2019ve talked about dealing with difficult situations; we\u2019ve talked about adaptability; we\u2019ve talked about teamwork and cooperation, and it was in his presentation of his examples where he would overstate or embellish his involvement and provide a negative or detracting articulation of others\u2019 involvement. So, in essence, making himself look good at the expense of others involved, and that was a consistent tone throughout the interview that the Board picked up on. And, again, in regards to my notes specifically, it\u2019s throughout the interview examples as we go.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 16, lines 5-19.\nRelevance of Mr. Turner\u2019s positive performance reviews. [143] In cross-examination, Complainant Counsel challenged the Board\u2019s determination that Mr. Turner was not qualified to be a Customs Inspector, a determination at odds with Mr. Turner\u2019s five-year positive work record which included positive performance reviews completed by Mr. Baird in 2003.\nA. I would not go so far as to say it was entirely inconsistent; however, there would be inconsistency in that there was observation that he has over the years contributed to the team, but again, we\u2019re scoring the example as presented.\nQ. And that excluded all other consideration?\nA. Yes. Well, we have to score what is presented at the interview.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 28, lines 19-25; page 29, lines 1-2.\n[144] Complainant Counsel reminded Mr. Baird that Assessment Standards in the posted notice of the Victoria employment opportunity informed applicants that they may be assessed by standardized tests, written examinations, interviews, reference checks, and employment performance reports.\nQ. \u2026 it was right in the poster that candidates knew that their performance assessments might be considered?\nA. That was an assessment tool we could use.\nQ. But you chose not to. Why not?\nA. We did not ask any candidate to provide an employee performance management report.\nQ. Why not?\nA. Well, because not all employees or applicants would have had employee performance evaluations, and we had enough assessment tools within the other ones listed that using that last tool wasn\u2019t even considered.\nQ. Because there were some people that were hired, in fact, who had no experience in Customs, in that process; correct?\nA. I believe so.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 58, lines 4-20.\nQ. Do you think it would have been reasonable for Mr. Turner to expect that you would have had regard for his performance assessments?\nA. No.\nTranscript January 22, 2009; page 57, lines 6-9\n[145] Mr. Champ put Exhibit R-2 Tab 52 to Mr. Baird, it listed persons found qualified in the Victoria Competition. Mr. Champ named five persons, two had never worked before at customs, two who had only worked one summer with customs.\nQ. Just in general, Mr. Baird, though, you recall there were some people who had gotten through the competition who had maybe only one summer or no experience in customs in that pool?\nA. I was certainly aware that candidates were applying and had various work backgrounds and some had not worked for customs or had worked for customs for a short time.\nQ. And yet \u2013 you were satisfied that those people were more qualified than Mr. Turner who had five years \u2026 experience as a customs inspector.\nA. In the scope of assessing the competence we are asking for, yes.\n\u2026\nQ. And in Mr. Turner\u2019s case you were very confident that Mr. Turner was completely unqualified?\nA. I was absolutely certain that he had not met the qualification standard we were looking for based on his submissions and the assessment tools we were using.\n\u2026\nQ. But at the end of the day here was someone who had been a customs inspector for five years; someone who you had supervised for a season, were you \u2013 in any way had concerns about - the ultimate validity of the process?\nA. No.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 103, lines 1-14; page 104, lines 3-19,\n[146] When considered in the context of his personal supervision and glowing assessments of Mr. Turner\u2019s work as a Customs Inspector, Mr. Baird\u2019s flat \u201cNo\u201d is not worthy of belief.\nKlassen e-mail [147] Mr. Baird testified that it was not unusual for Superintendents to meet and discuss issues in the workplace including various employees. But when asked if he recalled any discussion in superintendent roundtable meetings concerning Mr. Turner, and whether he recalled any negative opinions about Mr. Turner being expressed by Mr. Penneger, Mr. Klassen or Ms. Kavalaars, Mr. Baird\u2019s answer in each instance was \u201cI do not.\u201d\n[148] Complainant Counsel put the Klassen e-mail (Exhibit R-3, Tab 80) to Mr. Baird. After reading it, Mr. Baird denied receiving it, then said it would not be unusual to get such an e-mail from another Superintendent and conceded that he had seen similar e-mails before. Mr. Baird also confirmed that \u201c\u2026 theres a lot of points that have been raised that are consistent with observations I have made.\u201d Transcript: Transcript: January 22, 2009; page 45, line 1; page 46, lines 1-2.\n[149] When Complainant Counsel asked if the Klassen e-mail raised flags about Mr. Turner, Mr. Baird responded irrationally, throwing discredit on his testimony: \u201cI don\u2019t even know, sir, if I read this e-mail. I get hundreds and hundreds of e-mails and I do not read every one.\u201d Transcript: January 22, 2009; page 47, lines 21-23.\n[150] Mr. Baird deepened his discredit when he stated:\n\u2026 If I was tasked to the Portcullis, there\u2019s probably a better chance I didn\u2019t read it, because it didn\u2019t involve me at all. If I was working in Marine that summer \u2013 and again, I\u2019m sorry of my confusion \u2013 but if I was, you know, I very well may have read the e-mail, I may not have, but I get an overwhelming number of e-mails and I certainly do not read every e-mail line by line. So, I can\u2019t with any conviction say I read this e-mail. I don\u2019t know that I did.\n\u2026\nMr. Champ: Well, sir, this e-mail is October 4, 2003, and the competition for which you were the Selection Board Chair was announced about one week after that. \u2026 by the end of October \u201903, all the applications were due, so you got all those applications. You read them all at some point in November and then you started interviews in December \u201903. That\u2019s roughly accurate?\nMr. Baird: I believe so, yes.\nMr. Champ: I\u2019m just wondering, when you were reviewing Mr. Turner\u2019s application maybe less than a month later, a month later, did you consider that in your e-mail box you had an e-mail that said: \u201csubject: Talk with Levan after assessment?\u201d\nMr. Baird: No, I don\u2019t even recall seeing this e-mail. So the answer is no, only to the scope that I don\u2019t remember seeing it.\nEmphasis added\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 48, lines 1-12; page 49, lines 11-25; page 50, lines 1-2.\n[151] Complainant Counsel then asked Mr. Baird if he recalled Mr. Klassen\u2019s second e-mail to Superintendents dealing with sick leave, Exhibit R-3, Tab 81, and Mr. Baird said he did not.\nM. Champ: Did you review these documents to be ready for today?\nMr. Baird: No, I did not.\nMr. Champ: These two e-mails? You did not? Do you think there\u2019s any chance that these e-mails influenced how you handled that Selection Board assessment with Mr. Turner?\nMr. Baird: I don\u2019t believe so.\nMr. Champ: And why do you say that?\nMr. Baird: Because I don\u2019t remember seeing the e-mails.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 53 lines 1-12.\n[152] I conclude that Mr. Baird\u2019s assertion that he never read the Klassen e-mails was evasive and not worthy of belief. I find that Mr. Baird was either negligent in not reviewing the Klassen e-mails when he received them or, more likely, that he reviewed them, and realizing how damaging that admission would he resorted to evasion; and in doing so his actions raise a significant question as to the propriety of the Selection Board process concerning Mr. Turner\u2019s application for consideration as a CBSA employee.\nMr. Baird on veracity of Mr. Turner Mr. Champ: I\u2019ll just be a moment, Mr. Chair, and I will be done \u2026 there is one other point I want to make.\nQ. Just on the recording of auxiliary officer in hour selection board interview assessment, you said that you felt Mr. Turner was misleading and suggesting that he had been a Toronto police officer?\nA. Correct.\nQ. Is it possible that was just the way you interpreted it, what he said?\nA. That is possible. But ultimately it was \u2013 it was him articulating his experience. And it could have been articulated in a manner that was more clear. And so you are correct, it could have been my interpretation of what he said, but that was my interpretation.\nQ. It was right in his resume that he had been an auxiliary police officer. Do you believe it was his intent to mislead you \u2026 I am just asking you, you seemed to have a tendency when you were scoring Mr. Turner that at every time whenever you had concerns about something he said that you jumped to the conclusion that he was being dishonest; is that fair to say?\nA. No.\nQ. No? Or that you just doubted the veracity of what he was saying on many occasions?\nA. At times.\nThe Chairperson: What was your answer Mr. Baird?\nA. At times, sir.\nTranscript: Jan. 22, 2009; page 105, lines 20-25, page 106, lines 1-13, 22-25; page 107, lines 1-7.\nG. Witness: Nina Patel [153] In November 2008, at the time the Tribunal conducted its inquiry into Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint, Ms. Patel had been a federal employee for thirteen years, initially with Revenue Canada, then CCRA, and after 2003 with CBSA. She spent two summers in Victoria, May to September in 1995 and 1996 as a student customs officer, then bridged to term employment in Stewart, B.C. 1996 to1999 \u2013 during that time achieving indeterminate status \u2013 returned to Victoria until 2002, followed by a teaching assignment in Rigaud, Quebec for a year and four months instructing recruit customs inspectors, thereafter returning to Victoria as an acting-superintendent, and through competition, becoming a superintendent. \u201cAnd I\u2019m currently an acting-chief of operations for the Ports of Huntingdon, Aldergrove and Abbotsford airport on the lower mainland in the valley.\u201d\n[154] Ms. Patel identified a written response by Mr. Turner to a portfolio of competencies (the particular competency being \u2018dealing with difficult situations\u2019) and acknowledged that it revealed that Mr. Turner had named her as a person who could validate a particular incident which he relied upon to demonstrate his competency as a customs inspector.\n[155] Ms. Patel agreed that the document described an event in Victoria, and that it was endorsed with some notes dated January 22, 2004, presumable made by superintendent Trevor Baird; and she testified that she couldn\u2019t recall whether Baird read it to her over the phone, or showed it to her to read. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the particulars of what I said to him. I do recall that I didn\u2019t validate the competency based on that I don\u2019t know the specifics of it.\u201d Transcript: Volume Two, section 5, page 228, lines 13-16, page 232, lines 2-5.\n[156] Respondent Counsel then stated\n\u2026perhaps I\u2019ll take you through the notes that Trevor Baird has made of your conversation and perhaps you can tell me whether that assists you with your recollection.\u201d Thereafter Ms. Patel\u2019s answers were qualified by \u201cI think so\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t by memory recall that those are exact words that I stated \u2026\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d, and similar expression of inability to be precise in her recollection.\nQ. Right. And then there\u2019s another line: From his perspective he may think this or that \u2013 I\u2019m not sure which that is. Again, does that accord with your recollection of the information you provided to Superintendent Baird?\nA. Right. \u2018Cause when you\u2019re writing competencies and then you\u2019re writing them from your point of view and then when I said it was completely embellished or that, you know not my character to go behind. However, from Mr. Turner\u2019s point of view, he might have felt that that was the situation.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section five, page232, lines 6-10, page 234, lines 21-25; page 235, lines 1-2.\n[157] The following testimony by Ms. Patel provides insight into Mr. Turner\u2019s account of his participation in the incident:\nQ. \u2026 This male was yelling racial slurs at other officers. What was the \u2013 was this individual known to you?\nA. This \u2013 I can\u2019t recall exactly how he was known to us. But I do know that he had been through before. I don\u2019t know the circumstances surrounding why he was.\nQ. Now in the sentence after that, there\u2019s one, it says: I know it\u2019s just Nina trying to talk to him and cool him down. But he did not like her at all. What would you say in response to that?\nA. \u2026 I don\u2019t recall that at all. I felt in that situation that I did relate to this individual and was able to communicate with him. So I didn\u2019t see that at all.\nQ. \u2026 next sentence says: Nina then came over to me and asked me to talk to the individual. Did you request Mr. Turner to intervene?\nA. I don\u2019t recall specifically. But that wouldn\u2019t be abnormal for me to have asked Mr. Turner to do so.\n\u2026\nQ. And why would that be? Why wouldn\u2019t it be abnormal for you to ask him to do that?\nA. Well, because A, if what was going on there as Mr. Turner was coming down to the situation and I needed assistance, I would have definitely have asked somebody to help out. And Mr. Turner does and has always had a demeanor that is calming and is one that he\u2019s able to talk to people. So I probably definitely \u2013 I don\u2019t remember the specifics of it. But I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t have asked him.\nQ. All right. And then you have the next line: Nina stayed behind me and kept the other officers away while I spoke to the individual. Is that something you would have done?\nA. I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t recall exactly.\nI can\u2019t see myself totally disengaging from the situation. It\u2019s not my personality and not something I would do.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section five, page 236, lines 21-25, page 237, lines 1-19, page 238, lines 7-25.\nCross-Examination of Ms. Patel [158] In cross-examination Ms. Patel was asked to comment on notes made by Mr. Turner recording the incident.\nQ. Now do you recall that you didn\u2019t validate the event?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\n\u2026\nQ. Now, in the notes here \u2013 this records you as saying that Levan was good with this person?\nA. Mm-hmm\nQ. And Levan wrote that you were extremely pleased with the way he handled himself; is that fair to say.\nA. That is definitely something that is also of my character. If Levan was involved, for me to say at the end that \u2018thank you\u2019 to him for whatever his participation in it was.\n\u2026\nQ. When you referred to the comment (by Mr. Baird) about making others looking worse to make himself look better, that\u2019s ---\nA. Mm-hmm.\nQ. So that was your interpretation of whatever was conveyed to you by Mr. Baird? Whatever information he gave you, you interpreted it that way, right?\nA. Right, of the event.\nQ. You don\u2019t know that Mr. Turner was trying to make himself look better, though, right?\nA. I don t know.\nQ. What was your relation to him at this time, like in reporting, work relationship?\nA. So for that summer Mr. Turner was an officer and I was an acting superintendent.\nQ. So did you have any sort of supervisory function over him?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So did any aspect of his performance in that event \u2013 did you comment negatively on any aspect of what he did in that event?\nA. No.\n\u2026\nQ. \u2026do you have an independent recollection whether you did in fact not stand behind Mr. Turner?\nA. I do not.\nQ. So Mr. Turner s recollection here may be correct, it may be accurate?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. \u2026 Mr. Baird records you as saying completely embellished?\nA. Mm-hmm.\nQ. And your evidence a few moments ago was that you can see yourself saying that at the time, right?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. And can you say at all with certainty that you used those words in the conversation with Mr. Baird?\nA. No.\nQ. But you don\u2019t have any independent recollection right now of what you were referring to when you said that?\nA. No.\nQ. And can you say at all with certainty that you used those words in the conversation with Mr. Baird?\nA. No.\n[159] At the end of cross-examination Ms. Patel conceded that Mr. Turner was involved in dealing with the traveler, \u201cHowever his versions of what occurred were, in my opinion, exaggerated to make him look better in the situation.\u201d\nQ. And today you said it painted you in a bad light, right, that\u2019s what you thought?\nA. In my opinion, yeah.\nQ. Did you go and talk to Mr. Turner about what he wrote in ---\nA. No.\nQ. It didn\u2019t concern you that much to speak to him?\nA. No.\nQ. Have you ever known Mr. Turner to mislead people?\nA. Not that I know of.\nQ. Or speak untruthfully?\nA. No.\nQ. He\u2019s frank and friendly?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He\u2019s an open person?\nA. Mm-hmm.\nConclusions arising from Ms. Patel\u2019s testimony [160] I conclude that Ms. Patel was a credible witness; that her evidence does not support Mr. Baird\u2019s opinion that Mr. Turner was untruthful in his portrayal of the incident with a disturbed traveler.\n[161] It is to Mr. Baird\u2019s discredit that he immediately decided that Mr. Turner had embellished his participation in the incident to the degree that it was an intentionally false account. Mr. Baird\u2019s follow-up contact with Ms. Patel, for corroboration of his opinion that Mr. Turner had been untruthful, is significant evidence upon which to infer that Mr. Baird had prejudicially predetermined that Mr. Turner would not be deemed to have the competence to be a border service officer. Mr. Baird\u2019s negative conception of Mr. Turner is contradicted by Ms. Patel\u2019s recollection that, because of Mr. Turner\u2019s calming demeanour as a customs inspector, she asked him to intercede with the traveler.\n[162] Mr. Baird\u2019s bias toward Mr. Turner is also evidenced by his assumption Mr. Turner had lied during the interview by saying he had been a police officer with the Toronto Police Service. The truth is that Mr. Turner included a resume as part his written package, which clearly states that he served as an auxiliary police officer with the Toronto Police Service.\nH. Witness: Shalina Sharma Origin of the eligibility restriction in the Vancouver Competition 1002 [163] Ms. Shalina Sharma, Acting Manager of Resources for CBSA, testified that she supervised seven Resource Advisors assisting hiring managers in the selection process, and that her duties also included providing support and advice during investigation of complaints.\n[164] Ms. Sharma began her career in 1994 with Revenue Canada. On December 12, 2003, when the federal government created the CBSA, Ms. Sharma was assisting Mainland Customs hiring managers in the Pacific Highway District, Vancouver International Airport (VIA), and the Metro Vancouver Marine District, as well as special divisions dealing with Intelligence, Compliance, Trade, and Investigation. \u201cThose were my clients, and for them I helped them with Selection Boards as well as with any training that Selection Board members needed, and provided them with general staffing advice.\u201d Transcript: Volume Two, section four, Page 101, lines 17-20.\n[165] In her direct evidence and in response to questions in cross-examination, Ms. Sharma stated that she drafted the Vancouver Competition 1002 eligibility restriction in her capacity as the resourcing advisor to the recruitment unit members Ron Tarnawski and Mark Northcott.\n\u201cMr. Yazbeck: \u2026 Now you testified that, I think you used the word error, that although this doesn\u2019t refer to candidates not found qualified \u2013 found not qualified, it was an error because that\u2019s what the intention was behind this.\nA. The intent was yes, to not interview again those candidates that were just recently found not qualified.\nQ. So you agree with me that this is ambiguous at best.\nA. It is ambiguous, yes.\nQ. And if an employee interpreted this as meaning that he or she could apply in this position even though he or she had applied say in Victoria, that\u2019s a reasonable statement to make, a reasonable interpretation of this to make?\n\u2026.\nA. I don\u2019t think so. The position, it\u2019s a standard position. This position, same position exists in Vancouver as it does in Victoria. It\u2019s a Border Services officer position, or sorry, at the time Customs Inspector position, it had a national job description. \u2026\nQ. \u2026 If an employee looked at this and concluded that it only referred to Vancouver, you are saying that\u2019s not a reasonable interpretation.\nA. It\u2019s my opinion. \u2026\nQ. And so, Ms. Sharma, if an employee were shown this poster and the person showing it to the employee was pointing to it and said have you applied for this position before, would you think it reasonable for the employee to think that it was the Vancouver position only that the person was talking about?\nA. Again I don\u2019t think it would be.\nQ. \u2026 Now, who was it that asked that this line be put into this notice?\nA. When I met with the recruitment unit they had indicated that they seemed to (be) seeing the same candidates over and over again and you know, do we need to assess someone we found not qualified just two months ago yet again on another process. Because at that time we were running multiple processes in order to combat the shortage of Customs Inspectors. So again, we decided that no, anybody who was found not qualified just recently, and recent being January 1, 2002 we were not going to consider them for this process as not enough time would have lapsed for them to upgrade their skills. \u2026 I felt it could be done.\nQ. And did you draft this sentence.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did they approve this sentence?\nA. They did.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section five, page 140, lines 19-25; page 141, lines 1-9,24-25; page 142, lines 1-4, 16-25; page 143, line 8; page 144, lines 7-20; page 145, lines 7-10.\nStaffing competitions operate within their own rules [166] The Chairperson engaged Ms. Sharma in series of questions relating to how staffing pools operate. Her answers are relevant to the question of whether, by inference, \u201cthe position\u201d of Customs Inspector is limited to staffing requirements of Vancouver, thereby limiting the reach of the eligibility restriction to persons who were interviewed since January 1, 2002, for the position of Customs Inspector in Metro Vancouver.\nThe Chairperson: Before you go on, if somebody had qualified for that position in a competition in Victoria (and) they are placed in the pool. Can Vancouver draw from that pool?\nA. It depends on what the poster said. If Victoria process was put that staffing will occur in Victoria and in the Lower Mainland then Vancouver could have drawn from that pool. But if it was only for specific areas no, then Vancouver \u2013 and Vancouver wasn\u2019t one of those specific areas, Vancouver cannot draw from that pool.\nThe Chairperson: So you are talking about the previous pool that established the area that you could apply from, is that what you are saying?\nA. Right.\nThe Chairperson: If you have got somebody who is qualified for a PM2 and he did that from a posting in Victoria, he is now qualified. Could Vancouver just say, the hiring manager in Vancouver say \u2018I need three PM2\u2019s, is there anybody who has qualified recently in Victoria?\u2019 and just pull them over if they are willing to go.\nA. No. \u2026\nThe Chairperson: So the pools are distinct.\nA. Pools are distinct for the locations that they are being struck for.\nThe Chairperson: And this Vancouver, would that have included the Victoria area?\nA. In this Vancouver process, are you saying could we have staffed for the --- in Victoria? It\u2019s PM2, Customs inspector, Vancouver.\nThe Chairperson: If there was somebody \u2013 oh I see, so every pool is determined by the poster and the area \u2013\nA. That\u2019s identified on the poster.\nThe Chairperson: So that pool is just for that area.\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section five, page 164, lines 10-25; page 165, lines 1-21.\nAspects of competency which ought to be considered by an interview panel Q. \u2026 (Tab 28 of Volume 1). This is a Statement of Staffing Requirements for the Vancouver position, the Vancouver customs inspector position. And I\u2019m just trying to fit this value-based approach into a specific concrete example. I notice at the bottom of the page has assessment standards. And this makes it very clear that the agency could use one or more of the following tools.\nA. Yes.\nQ. It would be up to the discretion of the Selection Board to determine which tools to use?\nA. Yes\n\u2026\nQ. Written exam, interview reference check, they\u2019re all self-explanatory. I take it that this says may be used. Are there other factors or other information that could be used as well, like performance of an employee who has already been in the position?\nA. Not usually. It\u2019s --- especially for an external process, we would not take the performance of an employee into account because that would not be fair to those people that applied that were not employees.\nQ. And so from your point of view, you said --- would it never be the case that you can consider employee\u2019s performance?\nA. No. Usually in an external process, that is not considered. In an internal process, perhaps it might be considered that way. All the candidates are on an equal footing, but it is \u2013 I\u2019ve never done a process where the performance appraisal was considered.\n\u2026\nThe Chairperson: So they send out this Portfolio of Competencies Questionnaire. Now when Mr. Yazbeck says, could they also have decided, the Selection Board for this posting --- could they have decided to look at anything other than, for example, the \u2013 when he gave the performance of the person on the job?\nA. They wouldn\u2019t. I mean it\u2019s not something they would advise them to do, only because this was an external process. And you cannot look at the performance of an individual \u2013 of one individual and not \u2013 everybody that applied on this process were employees, so we couldn\u2019t - we could not do that. We could not use performance appraisals. What we could do was to reference check, based on what the candidate provided as to interview and the written competencies. But performance appraisals are not generally used for external process, in assessing a candidate.\n\u2026\nQ. When somebody (gives) a reference, to do a reference check, they often ask about the employee\u2019s performance in the position, right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that\u2019s another way of looking at performance, correct?\nA. Sure.\nQ. So performance is relevant in these kinds of processes, right?\nA. Yes. But again it\u2019s assessed through a reference check.\nQ. There\u2019s nothing \u2013 you said you haven\u2019t been \u2013 there\u2019s nothing to stop the Selection Board from using a performance appraisal, right?\nA. Again, it\u2019s a value based system; as long as the Selection Board can justify why they would.\n\u2026\nQ And I take it that one of the values of the CCRA\u2019s Staffing Program was to ensure that any selection process it used did fairly and accurately assess the qualifications of employees. Is that fair to say?\nA. Yes.\n\u2026\nQ. When you say \u201cstrict criteria\u201d, what are you referring to \u2013 the eight competencies?\nA. Each of those competencies have criteria attached to them. \u2026And that is what the Selection Board assesses the candidate on. Now, what \u2013 if a manager is giving a candidate \u2013 sorry, an employee \u2013 a performance appraisal or saying \u201cyou\u2019re doing a good job\u201d, well, that\u2019s fine, but another manager is sitting on the Selection Board.\nQ. So if the manager is sitting on the Selection Board, that manager would have some knowledge of the employee\u2019s performance, right?\nA. They would, yes.\nQ. And so that might cause them to wonder why the employee is not performing well in the interview?\nA. It may.\nQ. And that would be \u2013 that could be a relevant factor to consider in assessing the candidate\u2019s qualifications?\nA. No.\nQ. No, it would not be relevant?\nA. I don\u2019t think so because again, there are strict criteria there. If \u2013 the selection process, I mean it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s what we have to work with. The criteria are there under the qualifications. If the candidate does not exhibit those criteria, the Selection Board can only come up with the \u2013 a non-qualified. It happens. It happens a lot \u2013 all the time. It happened to me in the past.\nQ. But you just mentioned that if the employee\u2019s manager is on the Selection Board, he or she may have some knowledge of the employee\u2019s actual performance, right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And if that manager knew that the employee has performed well \u2013 and then in the interview, the employee doesn\u2019t seem to demonstrate the competency to the Selection Board\u2019s satisfaction, is it your conclusion that you would never doubt the conclusion of the Selection Board, that he\u2019s not qualified?\nA. No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\nQ. So it would cast doubts on the Selection Board\u2019s assessment?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Right. And generally speaking, Ms. Sharma, when a man \u2013 we\u2019ve seen evidence of appraisals; and when a manager sits down and appraises an employee, they\u2019re looking at the whole of the employee\u2019s performance, correct?\nA. I guess. I mean I can\u2019t speak for every manager, but sure.\nQ. But if it were you, you\u2019d look at the whole of the \u2013 and if there were \u2013 you would look at the whole of the performance?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Because you \u2013 and if there were specific issues, you would raise them with the employee?\nA. I would have raised it with the employee at the time when the issue occurred.\n\u2026\nQ. Now, yesterday you were talking about what happens when the Selection board \u2013 sorry, when a candidate might fail and the Selection Board could stop. And you alluded to this, this morning as well, I think in response to a question from Mr. Sinclair. Yesterday you said the Selection Board has to be extremely clear that they can do nothing more or do no more to make them pass. In other words the error of the employee has to be egregious, I think was the word you used. Do you remember that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So I take it from your evidence, when you said \u201cextremely clear\u201d, that there\u2019s an obligation on the Selection board to make absolutely certain that the candidate is not qualified?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. And if they don\u2019t do that, then there\u2019s a flaw in the process, right?\nA. Yes.\nAnalysis of the evidence of Ms. Sharma [167] The evidence of Ms. Sharma provides a context in which to assess the manner in which oral interviews of Mr. Turner were conducted by Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Baird as Chairmen of their respective review boards.\n[168] Ms. Sharma\u2019s evidence brings me to the conclusion that the staffing process \u2013 which rejected Mr. Turner as lacking competency to be a Customs Inspector \u2013 was the opposite of rigorous. It was based on a grandiose Portfolio of Competencies (a misnomer), an applicant\u2019s written response which, given a passing mark, lead to an oral interview. The interview process was haphazard and subjective, it pretentiously determined whether a candidate was competent to be a Customs Inspector. The fact is that by definition competent means adequately qualified or capable; becoming qualified or capable requires learning on the job and establishing a state of competence.\n[169] It is noteworthy that the ineffectiveness of the staffing process was disclosed in a comment by the Director in charge of CBSA Vancouver Airport section, Mr. Flagel, a comment that was attributed to Mr. Flagel by Respondent Counsel during cross-examination of\nMr. Hughes:\nOwing to an increasing number of complaints received from travelers, many of which concern the actions and behaviors of relatively new customs inspectors, he felt that certain criteria which were not included in the statement of staffing requirements need to be addressed when assessing the candidates. As he pointed out he felt that dealing with difficult situations should be one of the qualifications.\nI. Witness: Ronald Paul Tarnawski [170] At the time of his testimony before the Tribunal Inquiry on January 22, 2009, Mr. Tarnawski was a superintendent at the Pacific Highway Truck Crossing in the Pacific District (lower mainland region) of the CBSA. Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s career in border services began in 1990 with stints at various ports of entry including Peace Arch, Pacific Highway, and Huntingdon B. C.\n[171] In 2000 Mr. Tarnawski was transferred to VIA where he and Superintendent Mark Northcott established and conducted a regional recruitment unit over the next six years. He explained that each district within the Pacific Region had been responsible for its own recruitment resulting in inconsistent employment processes and, regrettably, competition between districts evidenced on occasion by one district waiting for a staffing pool to be created by another district, then poaching qualified candidates from it. This degree of dysfunction resulted in the directors of CBSA operation in the lower mainland bringing together Marine Operations, Highway Operations and the VIA Operations to be served by a regional recruiting unit.\n[172] Mr. Tarnawski explained that, coincidentally, CCRA was also undergoing some huge changes in regards to the job requirements.\n\u2026 Customs and Revenue at the time was also undergoing some huge changes in regard to job requirements, some of the things that we were now being given authority to do, becoming much more of a law enforcement-type agency. And the directors were also concerned in regards to what we were doing to attract the right candidate in regards to recruitment, or actual recruitment getting out to career [indiscernible] and things like that and then what were we doing to assess those candidates to see that they could actually complete the duties. \u2026 We looked at what other law enforcement agencies were doing; we looked at their recruiting techniques.\nQ. And then what were you doing to assess those candidates to see that they could actually complete the duties?\nA. That was all part and parcel of the creating of the recruiting units. We looked at what other law enforcement agencies were doing. We looked at their recruiting techniques, what kind of advertising material they had, so we started attending recruiting fairs. We created banners and backdrops and literature; all very unique to the Pacific region.\n\u2026\nAnd again, taking from what our partners in law enforcement were doing, what we designed ultimately was a process that would function where a candidate would apply online. \u2026\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 122, lines 14-25; page123, lines 1-8; page 124, lines 12-15.\n[173] Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Northcott ultimately designed a standardized interview process beginning with applications online, the screening of applications by people with experience in screening, the tendering to applicants who passed the screening of a package of seven competencies to be completed in writing and returned, and lastly an interview process for those candidates who had received a passing mark on their competencies.\n[174] In describing the staffing process that he and Mr. Northcott had developed, Mr. Tarnawski testified that all they were looking for in an applicant\u2019s written package was a threshold level of knowledge which would permit board panellists to converse with them in the interview process. Mr. Tarnawski described the first of two interviews, which dealt with effective interaction communication, as being 30 to 40 minutes in duration with a failure rate of 50%.\n[175] Mr. Tarnawski identified Mr. Turner as an applicant that he interviewed in two staffing processes: the Vancouver Job Opportunity and also the earlier Victoria Competition 7012.\n[176] In relation to Victoria Competition 7012, Mr. Tarnawski testified that Victoria was running its own processes and needed a demonstration in the use of Vancouver\u2019s interview guide and rating guide. Mr. Tarnawski identified Exhibit R-3, Tab 62 as the lead sheet or scoring guide used in an interview of Mr. Turner conducted in Victoria on February 13, 2003, as part of Victoria Competition 7012.\n[177] Mr. Tarnawski identified Exhibit R-3, Tab 63 as his notes of the interview he conducted of Mr. Turner. The other panellists were Superintendent Mark Northcott and Victoria\/Vancouver Island Superintendents Kathy Pringle and Rob Farrell. Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s recollection of the interview was that Ms. Pringle and Mr. Farrell were observers who did not participate in the actual assessment of Mr. Turner.\n[178] Mr. Tarnawski identified Exhibit R-3, Tab 63, as his notes of the interview and was asked if they refreshed his memory of the event.\nWell, I remember attending \u2013 I remember interviewing Mr. Turner. I remember making notes. Do I remember the intricate details of that interview? No, I don\u2019t.\n\u2026\nWhat my notes are telling me is that after some questions in regards to dealing with the difficult situation and after comments in his interview questions regarding decision making, I notate that: \u2018He is not getting all the information before making decisions. Errs on side of the importer or the traveller. Although the candidate is making numerous assumptions regarding who he is dealing with and how he should treat them \u2013 or how he should deal with them. Compares how you must treat American travellers due to race situation. States: I am assessing people and make decisions as they are walking up to me or by looking at what type of car they drive.\u2019\nI have put there: \u2018Concerns over lack of overall officer awareness regarding DDS.\u2019 Which is dealing with a difficult situation.\nSo basically what my notes are saying to me is that he\u2019s making assumptions and he\u2019s making decisions based on assumptions. And that\u2019s not a good thing in the sense that it could go either way. You know, sometimes, sure your assumptions can be correct, but quite often what it can end up with is it can end up as a complaint at the front counter where somebody felt that they didn\u2019t receive proper treatment or maybe they received improper treatment, or vice versa. You may not recognize a threat or a risk when it\u2019s actually standing there in front of you.\nEmphasis added\nTranscript: January 29, 2009; page 131, lines 20-23; page 134, lines 1-25; page 135, lines 1-6.\n[179] The February 13, 2003 Victoria interview of Mr. Turner is disturbing for two reasons:\n[180] First, Mr. Tarnawski used Mr. Turner, without permission, as a teaching aid in demonstrating his interviewing skills to Ms. Pringle and Mr. Farrel. This clearly disturbed Mr. Turner.\nMr. Yazbeck: Mr. Turner, you were just referring to not being called back in the summer of 2004. Your complaint \u2013 and we\u2019ve been talking about the Victoria competition and the Vancouver competition. Do you have the same concerns about those?\nA. Yeah, I have the same concerns about those. I think with all the extra board members they had for the process, being the four that I had for \u2013 in 2002, and the three I had at the end of 2003 and the three board members I had in the Vancouver process. I felt that I was definitely being intimidated.\nI believe the one where Janet Sabo sat in, who is the wife of Trevor Baird, and I think that she was invited just to watch Trevor Baird make a fat, old black man squirm at the interview stage.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section three; page 25, lines 6-25.\n[181] Second, Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s reasoned speciously in concluding that Mr. Turner was making assumptions rather than reasoned decisions in portraying how he dealt with travelers in primary examination. That Mr. Turner\u2019s explanation: \u201cI am assessing people and make decisions as they are walking up to me or by looking at what type of car they drive,\u201d is decision-making based on assumptions. It is clear to me that Mr. Turner\u2019s assessment of people as they approached primary inspection was a process of estimation, a first step in deciding what questions ought to be asked of the traveller. Moreover, Mr. Turner\u2019s overall testimony revealed that once he made his initial assessment, and depending on the nature of answers to his questions, then, and only then would he, as a Customs Inspector, make a decision to allow entry or require a secondary interview.\n[182] Mr. Stark returned to the Vancouver employment competition and had Mr. Tarnawski identify a selection process poster relating to Vancouver process Number 2003 1727 PACK 39611002 (Vancouver process 1002). Mr. Tarnawski testified that it was \u201c\u2026 a career opportunity notice for positions that would be posted to the VIA, Metro Vancouver District, or the PAC Highway District that was run by Superintendent Mark Northcott and myself.\u201d Transcript: January 29, 2009; page 135, line 25, page 136, lines 1-4.\n[183] The eligibility restriction stated that \u201cApplicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be eligible for this process.\u201d\nCross-Examination of Mr. Tarnawski [184] Under rigorous cross-examination Mr. Tarnawski agreed that he applied a flawed eligibility restriction to disqualify any applicant who, within the two-year period after January 1, 2002, had been deemed unqualified in Vancouver Competition 1002, a staffing process for employing customs inspectors.\nMr. Champ: First of all, let\u2019s be clear, the poster, itself, says if you\u2019ve interviewed before.\nA. Right.\nQ. It didn\u2019t say anything about successful or not successful?\nA. Right.\nQ. So, we can assume anyone who has read this, they wouldn\u2019t have understood any restriction to qualify \u2026\nA. Okay. I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t assume anything. You can assume that. I don\u2019t assume that, because that was neither the intent. I\u2019m sure that that may have caused some issue, and I think I said that very early on this afternoon.\nQ. Right.\nA. Because I know the wording was incorrect and I knew that we \u2013 there were probably gaps when we saw it out on the poster. But I\u2019m not going to jump to conclusion and say people assumed anything.\nTranscript; January 22, 2009; page 174, lines 8-25; page 175, line 1.\nQ. You note up here, while we\u2019re on this poster, it says selection process number, advertising number, then it says: \u201cPM2 Customs Inspector, Vancouver and International Airport District, Metro Vancouver District and Pacific Highway District. So those are three different districts, correct?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. So, when you created that pool, those three districts could draw on the pool?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. And that \u2013 isn\u2019t it a fair interpretation that\u2019s this position? This position means Customs Inspector in these three locations.\nA. I\u2019m not going to suggest to you what you should or should not believe. What that\u2019s telling you is where these positions are for in this poster. That\u2019s what this is telling you.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 178, lines 20-25; page; page 179, lines 1-15.\nThe Chairperson: So if I have been interviewed for a customs inspector position \u2013 and you didn\u2019t limit to those locations \u2013\nA. Right\nThe Chairperson: So you would have said, if I have been interviewed, for anybody who is an applicant has been interviewed for the position of customs inspector since January 1st, 2002, will not be eligible for this competition?\nA. that\u2019s what it says.\nThe Chairperson: Anybody who has been interviewed will be ineligible?\nA. That\u2019s what it says, yes sir.\nThe Chairperson: You didn\u2019t apply it that way though, did you?\nA. No, it\u2019s not the way we applied it. Now I can\u2019t tell you how many people from Victoria that we interviewed, but if we found people \u2013 if people were identified as being qualified in the previous process, we weren\u2019t fitting them into that restriction. As I say, the wording causes nightmares I think.\nThe Chairperson: Well, it would have caused nightmares to applicants too; right?\nA. Yes.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 177, lines 5-25; page 178, lines 1-3.\n[185] Mr. Champ showed Exhibit R-2, Tab 33 to Mr. Tarnawski, a letter dated June 1, 2004, signed by Mr. Tarnawski and sent to Mr. Turner, stating that he was not eligible for the Vancouver Job Opportunity. Mr. Tarnawski testified that it \u201c\u2026 was very possible the letter was created specifically for Levan Turner.\u201d Transcript: January 22, 2009; 204, lines 9-11.\n[186] Mr. Champ suggested that Mr. Turner was the first applicant screened out by the eligibility restriction and Mr. Tarnawski agreed that it was \u201c\u2026 absolutely very possible,\u201d and also agreed that it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that Mr. Turner was the only applicant screened out.\nQ. Why was it Mr. Turner that jumped out at you and Mr. Northcott?\nA. What do you mean \u2018jumped out\u2019 at us?\nQ. Why is he the only one? Out of the seven \u2013six or seven, eight \u2013 six or 700 applicants to the Vancouver competition, why was he the only one screened out on that basis?\nA. Well, I think this was the first process we ran the restriction; okay?\nQ. Right.\nA. And there was obviously some recognition.\nQ. Right. So, you recognized him, but not anyone else?\nA. I would say yes.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 205, lines 6-7; lines 5-18.\n[187] In his testimony during cross-examination, Mr. Tarnawski agreed \u201cabsolutely\u201d that an applicant who did not make it through the Victoria Competition 7003 could have made it through the Vancouver Competition 1002 even though the competency packages were the same. Yet he also acknowledged that the eligibility-exclusion of Mr. Turner from the Vancouver Competition, midway through the interview process, was, as the Chairperson put it \u201c\u2026kind of a mess.\u201d\n[188] With respect to Exhibit R-2, Tab 33, the template letter dated June 1, 2004 sent to Mr. Turner informing him he had been disqualified by virtue of restricted eligibility, Mr. Tarnawski agreed that no other applicant was sent this letter; that it was \u201cabsolutely very possible\u201d that of the six or seven hundred applicants it was \u201cvery possible\u201d Mr. Turner was the only one disqualified.\n[189] Exhibit Volume R-3, Tab 91, a master list of candidates in Vancouver Competition 1002 was put before Mr. Tarnawski, and, in a somewhat lengthy cross-examination, it was established that the vast majority had no experience as customs inspectors. Moreover it was established that several candidates with minimal qualification were deemed qualified and placed in the staffing pool, while Mr. Turner, an experienced customs inspector, a candidate who had achieved a passing mark in the interview process, was subjected to an irrational disqualification. Therefore, the circumstances of the disqualification must be examined to determine whether the technical disqualification of Mr. Turner was a pretext used to deny Mr. Turner the opportunity to continue in the employment of the Respondent. Was it a pretext to conceal that an older black man with a perceived disability of obesity did not fit the image of law enforcing Border Service Officer? If so, it subjected Mr. Turner to differential treatment as a former employee of the Respondent and was a discriminatory practice contrary to the CHRA.\n[190] Mr. Champ ended his cross-examination by challenging Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s explanation that it was Mr. Turner\u2019s voice and presence that enabled him to recall their earlier contact in the interview process for Victoria competition 7012.\nQ. So Mr. Tarnawski, you appreciate now that Mr. Turner feels a bit aggrieved because he was apparently the only person who was screened out of this competition on the basis of this restriction?\nA. Okay.\nQ. And it would seem that he was picked out at least because both of you \u2013 because you recognized his voice and presence from meeting before?\nA. Yeah. When you say that, I can see how that might be taken in the wrong light. If I can maybe just suggest something here, Levan walks into the room, he is a happy guy, okay?\nQ. Yes.\nA. And Levan had a smile, right? And Levan liked to do things like he was bright in the room and you knew Levan was here. And Levan would put his name on cards and put it in front of them at the interview, because he is looking at the upside of things all the time. Levan always seemed to be an up person. Now, if you say I said I remembered him because of his presence and you are trying to imply something that might be inappropriate, that\u2019s not my character, sir. Okay? If I said that somewhere it would be because of the up things that I have seen of Levan, not because of something inappropriate. So I\u2019m not sure what you are attempting to \u2013 what you want somebody to infer from that.\nQ. Mr. Tarnawski, I will just put it this way: without any ill intent on your part, far from it ---\nA. Okay.\nQ. ---is it possible that just the fact that Mr. Turner is a larger man and a black man that he stood out to you, you just recognized him more than others?\nA. Well I didn\u2019t interview, I don\u2019t think, a whole pile of people that would meet the same physical characteristics as Mr. Levan Turner. But I interviewed a lot of people that were very happy people just like Mr. Turner. Okay? So Mr. Turner, you know, every time we meet there is conversation that occurs between the two of us because he an up kind of guy, and he is an easy guy to talk to. And that\u2019s what I remembered about Mr. Turner. And it was easy to remember one of four or six that was in the room that day. I didn\u2019t have to remember 500 or 600 that I was going to come back to the Lower Mainland and interview.\nTranscript: January 22, 2009; page 244, lines 3-25; page 245, lines 1-25.\nAnalysis of the last question put to Mr. Tarnawski in cross-examination [191] The question put to Mr. Tarnawski \u2013 (\u2026 is it possible that because Mr. Turner is a large man and a black man that he stood out to you, and you just recognized him more than others?) \u2013 is a question that Mr. Tarnawski could have answered with a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019; instead he became reticent, which in itself raises the question whether he was phobic and had an aversion to saying \u201cYes, I remember Mr. Turner because he is a large black man who had a positive personality.\u201d Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s reticence is wrapped in the coincidental circumstances (1) that Vancouver Competition 1002 included a restriction, co-authored by Mr. Tarnawski, which denied eligibility to persons who had been interviewed in any prior job posting within the previous two years; and (2) the eligibility restriction was flawed by an ambiguity which Mr. Tarnawski became aware of immediately after the competition was announced; and (3) despite being aware of the ambiguity of the restriction Mr. Tarnawski applied it only to Mr. Turner\u2019s candidacy soon after he and his fellow members of the reviewing panel had deemed Mr. Turner qualified to be placed in a pool of potential customs inspectors; and (4) the disqualification effectively ended Mr. Turner\u2019s aspiration to become a Border Services Officer.\nV. Analysis A. Preface to Reasons for Determination [192] In his opening remarks Complainant\u2019s Counsel asked:\n\u201cWhy? Why did this happen? Why did an employee, who was performing well, had no performance deficiencies, all of a sudden become unqualified? The Complainant, sir, is Levan Turner. He is an older black male, and it\u2019s his position that those factors, as well as his size, were the reasons why he was denied employment. \u2026 there will be a prima facie case made for discrimination, that had not been rebutted. \u2026that there is no other explanation but for the employee\u2019s race, age or perceived disability which is his weight.\u201d\n[193] In written argument Complainant\u2019s Counsel stated:\nAt law, the question is whether he is perceived by others to have some type of disability, and is treated in a discriminatory manner as a result. People who are overweight often face this stereotypical view that obesity equates with laziness.\nMr. Turner\u2019s opinion on why he was denied further employment [194] During the inquiry Chairperson Sinclair asked Mr. Turner what conclusions he reached upon learning that other seasonal term employees were called back to work in the summer of 2004, while he was not offered work; and Complainant Counsel asked Mr. Turner a similar question regarding the Victoria and Vancouver staffing processes at issue here. Mr. Turner testified:\nA. It was mostly students and \u2013 it was most of the staff that was there the previous year.\nThe Chairperson: So when you heard that, you concluded, you were angry and you concluded what.\nA. I was extremely angry and I was extremely upset. Because all the work that I had put in and all the years that I had been there, I mean, my qualifications were, as far as I was concerned, were top notch. And they had \u2013 working for the government, I know now there are many recourses or other avenues that they could use to hire somebody.\nSo it must have been that they really didn\u2019t want me back and I figured, it must be because of my race and, you know, I don\u2019t look good in a uniform that they would expect me to look, and I\u2019m too old. They probably figured I\u2019m going to be a draw on the system.\nTranscript: Volume Two, section three; page 24, lines 1-21.\nDeterminations: Vancouver Competition 1002\/ Victoria 7003 [195] On a balance of probabilities I am satisfied that the respective Review Panels in both the Vancouver Competition 1002 and the Victoria Competition 7003 denied Mr. Turner adjudicative impartiality. I conclude that both processes were conducted without propriety and incorrectly with respect to Mr. Turner\u2019s applications to become an employee of CBSA, a border-police agency with a developing law enforcement culture, working synergistically with Canada\u2019s other law enforcement agencies. The key question for the Tribunal in this case is whether adjudicative partiality and it corollary, adverse differential treatment experienced by Mr. Turner \u2013 by inference that an older, obese black man does not fit the image\/mold of border police \u2013 is linked to discrimination based on a prohibited ground under the CHRA. This matter will be discussed at greater length, later in this decision.\nCredibility of witnesses [196] In R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51 (R.E.M.), Chief Justice McLachlin commented at paragraph 49 that findings of fact on credibility may involve factors that are difficult to explain:\nWhile it is useful for a judge to attempt to articulate the reasons for believing a witness and disbelieving another in general or on a particular point, the fact remains that the exercise may not be purely intellectual and may involve factors that are difficult to verbalize. Furthermore embellishing why a particular witness\u2019 evidence is rejected may involve the judge in saying unflattering things about the witness; judges may wish to spare the accused who takes the stand to deny the crime, for example, the indignity of not only rejecting his evidence in convicting him, but adding negative comments about his demeanour. In short, assessing credibility is a difficult and delicate matter that does not always lend itself to precise and complete verbalization.\n[197] In F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53 (McDougall) at para. 76, rendered at the same time as R.E.M.:\nIn the end, believing the testimony of one witness and not the other is a matter of judgement.\n[198] In Van Berkel v. MPI Security Ltd (1997) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/504 (B.C.H.R.C.) Member Designate Kenneth Attafuah, referring to McDougall, stated:\nIn accordance with these judicial guidelines, the testimony of each witness has been examined for consistency with the preponderance of probabilities which surrounded the existing circumstances of the complainant\u2019s employment with [the corporate respondent]. I have also scrutinized the evidence for plausibility under the circumstances and weighed the witnesses\u2019 motives. In addition, I have paid attention to their powers of observation, memory and recall, as well as their attitude and demeanor under oath, and the manner in which they testified. Finally, I have checked their testimony for lack of internal coherence or any significant inconsistencies and contradictions.\n(a) Complainant witness Christopher Hughes [199] Mr. Hughes testified about his unsuccessful efforts to regain employment with the Respondent in Vancouver Competition 1002, posted June 9, 2003, and Victoria Competition 7003, posted October 11, 2003. As the first witness in this inquiry, Mr. Hughes gave specific testimony concerning the processing of his applications in the two job competitions; he also testified on matters which he perceived to be managerial manipulation of job competitions.\n[200] In 1995, Mr. Hughes was employed by Revenue Canada in Victoria, B.C. as a collections officer. Initially a term employee, Mr. Hughes became an indeterminate employee in 1996. In March 2001, he successfully applied for, and was employed in 2002 as a seasonal-Customs Inspector which enabled him to continue his employment in the winter as a business service agent with Revenue Canada. Mr. Hughes became ill with a depressive illness and was terminated on September 30, 2004. Mr. Hughes openly testified that he challenged his employer, initially as a whistleblower, then through grievance procedures relating to hiring processes, with a complaint to the Public Service Commission which produced an investigation report of employer irregularities, and finally, with complaints of discrimination under the CHRA.\n[201] In accordance with the judicial guidelines cited supra, I have considered Mr. Hughes\u2019 testimony with particular attention to its plausibility and coherence. Finally, I am satisfied that Mr. Hughes direct testimony remained intact under cross-examination.\n[202] Mr. Hughes testimony reflected detailed knowledge of the Respondent\u2019s staffing processes, acquired in the course of his own disputatious dealings with the Respondent\u2019s management. In particular, he was diligent in ferreting out a considerable amount of documentation which gave him information on other applicants who had applied successfully for employment with the Respondent.\n[203] I find as a fact that Mr. Hughes was a credible witness. His evidence may provide context in which to consider the evidence of the Complainant and the Respondent witnesses.\n(b) Complainant Levan Turner [204] I paid particular attention to Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence given under lengthy cross-examination. It remained significantly consistent with his evidence in chief on the core issues of the case, and it verified the competency he achieved during his five years of seasonal term employment with the Respondent. I conclude as fact that Mr. Turner was a credible witness.\n(c) Respondent witness Shalina Sharma [205] Ms. Sharma gave plausible testimony concerning the CBSA staffing processes, and the changes in the staffing processes over the years, particularly the difficulties caused by the unanticipated creation of CBSA in late 2003. In her direct testimony, Ms. Sharma was openly partial on the core issue of the ambiguous eligibility restriction which she authored for the Vancouver Competition 1002 staffing process. However, under vigorous cross-examination, Ms. Sharma conceded that the flawed restriction, on the face of the Notice of Job Opportunity, could have been interpreted as applying only to persons who had applied for employment as a PM-02, customs inspector to work in the location specified in the Notice, namely VIA District, Metro Vancouver District, and the Pacific Highway District.\n(d) Respondent witness Ron Tarnawski [206] On the core issue of the eligibility restriction in Vancouver staffing process and the manner in which he interviewed the Complainant, Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s seemingly plausible direct testimony became inconsistent and argumentative when tested by rigorous cross-examination, particularly as to his intractable and incomprehensible application of the eligibility restriction on a broad basis. The result was inevitable, Mr. Turner said \u201cno\u201d in answer to a preliminary question in the interview process, (whether he had previously applied to be a customs inspector in Vancouver), making no mention of a prior application in the Victoria region. It was a catch-22 trap created by Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s decision to shamelessly apply an ambiguous restriction which he co-authored, and applied solely to Mr. Turner, upon whom he cast the shadow of untruthfulness.\n(e) Respondent witness Terry Klassen [207] Though often vague and inconsistent, Mr. Klassen, an Acting Superintendent, gave a truthful account of a meeting with the Complainant and their discussions concerning an annual performance review he had completed for the Complainant. I am satisfied that Mr. Klassen was frank in relating a further conversation with the Complainant which took place after their discussion concerning the performance review, a discussion in which Mr. Klassen revealed to the Complainant that the Victoria superintendents held negative perceptions of the Complainant as being lazy and tending to avoid the more difficult work expected of a customs inspector. I also accept that in the aftermath of these discussions, Mr. Klassen prepared two emails to himself in which recorded his discussions with the Complainant, emails which he subsequently forwarded to all fellow superintendents, including Trevor Baird and Catherine Pringle.\n(f) Respondent witness Trevor Baird [208] Mr. Baird\u2019s testimony was paradoxical, verbose rather than direct. Too often when asked a simple question Mr. Baird would respond with argument rather than with a dispassionate and objective answer.\n[209] I conclude that Mr. Baird was not a credible witness on the core issues raised by the Complainant.\n[210] In particular, by refusing to bring into the interview process the fact that he had given positive performance reviews of Mr. Turner\u2019s work as a customs inspector, coupled with his attempt in the aftermath to get Ms. Patel to agree that Mr. Turner\u2019s account of dealing with a difficult traveller was exaggerated and untruthful, Mr. Baird revealed himself to be unscrupulous. And it raises the question: Was the interview process a pretext, predetermined by a stereotypical discriminatory perception of the Complainant, that he was lazy and untruthful because he was older, black and clinically obese and therefore unacceptable to be employed as a Border Services Officer?\n(g) Respondent witness Nina Patel [211] Ms. Patel\u2019s memory of the incident in which Mr. Turner assisted her in dealing with an aggravated and difficult traveller was understandably diminished by the passage of time. Nevertheless she was a credible witness despite being caught between Mr. Baird\u2019s out-of-the-blue telephone call to her in which he pressed her for a negative assessment of Mr. Turner\u2019s version of the event and her own opinion of Mr. Turner as a customs inspector gained during one summer in which time he worked under her supervision. At the end of cross-examination, Ms. Patel conceded that she had requested Mr. Turner to deal with the traveller but, in her opinion, his account presented to the review panel was exaggerated to make him look better. Ms. Patel then testified that she had never known Mr. Turner to mislead people, or speak untruthfully, and that he was a frank, friendly and open person.\nB. Analysis of Victoria Competition 7003 [212] The Victoria Job Opportunity interview of Mr. Turner was conducted by Mr. Baird as the Chairperson of a review panel in a manner which denied Mr. Turner an adjudicated determination of his competency as a customs inspector, a determination that would have enabled Mr. Turner to continue to seek employment with the Respondent. Under rigorous cross-examination, Mr. Baird revealed that the interview had been rendered extremely unreasonable, it was in fact an absurdity, by the panel\u2019s refusal to consider Mr. Turner\u2019s positive employment record as a Customs Inspector, a record written in part by Mr. Baird. When considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, I infer that Mr. Baird had determined beforehand that Mr. Turner \u2013 an older black man perceived to be disabled by obesity \u2013 did not meet Mr. Baird\u2019s expectations of a Border Services Officer capable of carrying out CBSA\u2019s newly mandated law-enforcement role in servicing travellers passing through Canada\u2019s ports of entry.\n[213] I am persuaded by the argument of Mr. Champ, Counsel for Mr.Turner, that the Victoria superintendents perceived Mr. Turner to be lazy and dishonest, based on their stereotypical assessment of Mr. Turner who was older, obese, and black. On a balancing of probabilities Mr. Klassen\u2019s two e-mails circulated to all the superintendents, including Mr. Baird and Catherine Pringle, establish this racist attitude of the Victoria superintendents. No other candidate was the subject of a similar e-mail.\n[214] The Klassen e-mails were circulated to the superintendents on October 4 and October 12, 2003. The Victoria Competition was open from October 11 to October 30, 2003. Mr. Turner was interviewed on December 18, 2003 by Chairperson Trevor Baird, and panellists Catherine Pringle and Cathy Zabo.\n[215] When confronted in cross-examination over the Klassen e-mails, Mr. Baird denied any knowledge of them, claiming that he was too busy to have looked at his inbox during the time they were sent to him and the other superintendents. The improbability of Mr. Baird\u2019s explanation swept aside the last vestiges of his credibility.\n[216] Approximately ten days after the interview panel\u2019s decision, Mr. Baird telephoned Ms. Patel to have her corroborate his opinion that Mr. Turner had untruthfully related their respective actions during the incident with a difficult traveller. Based on Ms. Patel\u2019s evidence I am satisfied that she asked Mr. Turner to speak with the agitated traveller, knowing from her experience with Mr. Turner that he would be able to calm the man down, which he did. This extraordinary post-interview action by Mr. Baird, Chairman of the review panel, is an aggravating circumstance that underscores my conclusion that the decision to label Mr. Turner as unqualified to be a customs inspector was a pretext to ensure that an older, obese, lazy black man, as Mr. Turner had been stereotyped, would not be employed by the newly created law-enforcement oriented CBSA.\n[217] I conclude that the Review Board\u2019s decision to determine competency based solely on Mr. Turner\u2019s answer in the interview made the interview process arbitrary, discriminatory and pretextual.\n[218] On a balancing of probabilities I find that that the interview process was a pretext, it was a process that subjected Mr. Turner to discrimination by reason of a perceived disability of obesity, his race and age; with the result that Mr. Turner was subjected to differential treatment as a former term employee of the Respondent.\nC. Analysis of Vancouver Competition 1002 [219] The Vancouver job opportunity advertisement stated that \u201cApplicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be considered for this process.\u201d The job opportunity also defined \u201cthis position\u201d as \u201cPM-02, Customs Inspector, Vancouver International Airport District, Metro Vancouver District, Pacific Highway District, English.\u201d\n[220] I conclude that the eligibility restriction was flawed by a latent ambiguity. It has two meanings - one broad, the other narrow. In its broad meaning, the restriction would apply to applicants who had been interviewed anywhere in British Columbia and the Yukon since January 1, 2002, or for that matter anywhere in Canada, for the position of a PM-02 Customs Inspector. In its narrow or literal meaning the restriction would apply to applicants who had been interviewed in Vancouver since January 1, 2002, for the position as a PM-02 Customs Inspector, Vancouver International Airport District, Metro Vancouver District, Pacific Highway District.\n[221] At one point the Chairperson put this simple and obvious ambiguity to Mr. Tarnawski, suggesting that the eligibility restriction could have been interpreted as applying only to persons who had previously been interviewed for the position of Customs Inspector in the metro Vancouver region. Mr. Tarnawski admitted that the wording was ambiguous:\nMr. Tarnawski: \u2026 the wording caused us nightmares.\nThe Chairperson: It would have caused nightmares to the applicants, too, right?\nMr. Tarnawski: Yeah.\nEmphasis added\nTranscript: Page 2126, lines 21-24\n[222] I conclude that the eligibility restriction, authored by Ms. Sharma at the request of Mr. Tarnawski and his recruiting unit partner, Mr. Northcote, was not scrutinized by them, individually or collectively, to ensure that it had a clear and singular meaning to persons seeking employment with CBSA.\n[223] It was only after the public posting of the Vancouver Job Opportunity that Mr. Tarnawski realized the restriction was ambiguous. Common sense should have alerted Mr. Tarnawski to the risks involved in applying the restriction to applicants responding to the advertisement of the employment opportunity \u2013 it didn\u2019t. Instead, Mr. Tarnawski forged ahead with the staffing process, adopting a practice of asking every interviewee whether they had previously been interviewed for the position in question during the restriction period, assuming that the interviewee would assume that it meant anywhere in British Columbia.\n[224] In my view, the rule of contractual interpretation that an ambiguous term shall be interpreted against the party that authored it should apply to pre-employment staffing processes carried out by the Respondent CBSA. Accordingly, by this rule of contra proferentem, the eligibility restriction ought to have been interpreted by the Respondent in the interests of persons responding to the job posting notice, including Mr. Turner. Had Mr. Tarnawski done so, it would not have disturbed the staffing process of the Vancouver Job Opportunity.\n[225] During the interview for the Vancouver competition, Mr. Tarnawski asked Mr. Turner whether he had been interviewed after January 1, 2002, for \u201cthis position\u201d, indicating the Customs Position as described in the poster advertising the Vancouver Job Opportunity. Mr. Turner said he had not, relying on his interpretation of the eligibility restriction, and did not disclose his prior interview in a Victoria staffing process.\n[226] Mr. Turner testified that he had carefully considered the eligibility restriction and interpreted it to apply only to applicants who had previously applied for employment as a Customs Inspector in CBSA\u2019s Metro Vancouver region. When Mr. Tarnawski asked \u201cHave you ever applied for this position\u201d Mr. Turner replied \u201cNo\u201d.\n[227] Days after the interview, (and based on his recognition of Mr. Turner from his interview in Victoria Competition 7012,) Mr. Tarnawski verified the date of the Victoria interview, immediately disqualified Mr. Turner, then exacerbated matters by assuming that Mr. Turner had been untruthful in failing to disclose the prior interview in Victoria.\n[228] Earlier in this decision, I dealt with the February 13, 2003 Victoria Competition 7012 interview and made a finding of fact that Mr. Tarnawski had too quickly concluded that Mr. Turner had been guilty of making assumptions, when Mr. Turner described in the interview how he dealt with travellers. In arriving at this assessment of Mr. Turner, I concluded that Mr. Tarnawski demonstrated his own propensity to make assumptions, and I conclude that this propensity was a factor in the Vancouver interview. When faced with Mr. Turner\u2019s narrow interpretation, Mr. Tarnawski rashly applied the ambiguous eligibility restriction broadly, and treated Mr. Turner\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 answer as untruthful, and as an attempt to deceive the Vancouver panel.\n[229] During the inquiry, Counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that had the eligibility restriction not been applied, Mr. Turner would have been found to be qualified, that he had demonstrated sufficient competency during his first interview to be placed in a staffing pool, carrying with it the possibility of an offer of employment by CBSA. Nevertheless, Counsel for the Respondent maintained that the process was properly terminated by Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the ambiguous eligibility restriction.\n[230] I note that it was clearly established in cross-examination of Mr. Tarnawski that no other applicant for employment in the Vancouver Job Opportunity was subjected to the treatment meted out to Mr. Turner: he was the only candidate screened out on the basis of the eligibility restriction, even though a consistent application of that restriction would have screened out other candidates as well; and he was the only candidate to receive a post-interview letter stating that he had been disqualified.\n[231] In that it was Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s recognition of Mr. Turner which led him to verify the date of Mr. Turner\u2019s prior interview and to apply a broad interpretation of the eligibility restriction solely to Mr. Turner, it is to Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s discredit that he did not verify the eligibility of other candidates based on this same interpretation. This amounts to an egregious breach of the panel\u2019s duty to act impartially toward Mr. Turner.\n[232] In conducting a Selection Board interview to determine the competency of an applicant seeking employment with CBSA, management\u2019s review panelists must change modes, shedding managerial partiality, and donning adjudicative impartiality.\n[233] Instead, Mr. Tarnawski, as Chairman of the Vancouver Competition 1002 Review Panel exhibited intransigence and was vexatious in deciding to disqualify Mr. Turner because Mr. Turner had interpreted the eligibility restriction as applying only to applicants who had been interviewed in Vancouver for the position of Customs Inspector in the Vancouver Region of CBSA. I conclude that Mr. Tarnawski could have, and ought to have, interpreted the eligibility restriction narrowly without creating any problems in the Vancouver Competition 1002.\n[234] That Mr. Turner was subjected to differential treatment with negative consequences in the course of the Vancouver process is beyond dispute. The Tribunal must assess whether this adverse differential treatment amounts to discrimination based on prohibited grounds.\nD. Application of Relevant Law The Shakes decision (a) Applying Shakes to Vancouver Competition 1002 [235] As noted above, the Shakes and Israeli decisions established a three-part test to establish a prima facie case of discrimination:\n(4) the complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\n(5) the complainant was not hired; and\n(6) someone obtained the position who was no better qualified than the complainant, but lacked the attribute on which the complainant based their human rights complaint.\n[236] Respondent Counsel acknowledged that, but for the eligibility restriction, Mr. Turner would have qualified for the staffing pool in the Vancouver process; and this, along with Mr. Turner\u2019s positive performance reports establishes that Mr. Turner was qualified for employment as a Customs Inspector. This satisfies the first part of the Shakes test.\n[237] The second element is also met, since Mr. Turner was not hired for the position.\n[238] The third element of the Shakes test takes on a unique complexion in Vancouver Competition 1002 because the employer\u2019s rationale in deciding not to put Mr. Turner in the staffing pool of competent applicants was based on ineligibility, rather than lack of competency.\n[239] I am satisfied from the testimonies of Mr. Hughes, Mr. Turner, Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Baird that it has been clearly established that other candidates who lacked the attributes upon which Mr. Turner based his complaint, namely age, race, and perceived disability due to obesity, should have been screened out based on a consistent application of this eligibility restriction, and were not. In my view, this meets the third element of the Shakes test.\n[240] In addition, based on Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s evidence, I conclude that the vast majority of applicants to the Vancouver Competition 1002, unlike Mr. Turner, had no prior employment experience with either CCRA or it successor CBSA. This reinforces my conclusion with respect to the third element of the Shakes test.\n(b) Applying Shakes to Victoria Competition 7003 [241] The evidence of Mr. Turner, supported by that of Mr. Hughes, and to a significant degree the testimony under relentless cross-examination of Mr. Baird, establishes the three elements required in Shakes. The Complainant was (1) qualified for employment as a customs inspector\/border services officer; (2) and was not hired; (3) other applicants, without the qualifications of the Complainant and lacking the attributes on which the Complainant based his complaint, subsequently obtained employment with the Respondent.\n(c) Applying Basi v CNR to Vancouver Competition 1002 and Victoria Competition 7003 [242] The Respondent argued that the decisions of the respective interview boards were a proper exercise of management discretion; in the Vancouver process, that Mr. Turner, though qualified, was ineligible because of the restriction published in the job poster; and in the Victoria process, that Mr. Turner, though otherwise competent as a customs inspector, had failed to demonstrate his competency to be a customs inspector during the brief interview process. The Respondent\u2019s argument is unsound and misleading.\n[243] Considering the totality of the circumstances of the two competitions, and both being pretextual, I am convinced that the subtleness of discrimination permeated both staffing processes, and that neither process was as innocent as claimed to be. Since this is a case of circumstantial evidence, it raises the question whether an inference of discrimination ought to be drawn. I conclude that the evidence of the Complainant and Mr. Hughes establishes that such an inference is much more probable than the possible inference of circumspect conduct on the part of the Respondent employees Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Baird.\n(d) Applying the Radek decision to the Vancouver and Victoria competitions [244] Radek alerts a tribunal to be aware of the effect of compound discrimination in order to avoid relying on a single axis analysis. In that regard I am mindful that Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint of discrimination is based on several grounds of discrimination, and that s. 3.1 of the CHRA specifically provides that a discriminatory practice includes a practice based on the effect of a combination of prohibited grounds, raising the likelihood that a primary ground of discrimination may be synergistically intersectional with, and compounded by, other less obvious grounds of discrimination.\n[245] I conclude that Mr. Turner\u2019s complaint contains intersectional grounds of discrimination and that compounding discrimination did occur, and is a factor in my determination that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice against Mr. Turner.\nE. Response of the employer to prima facie case Vancouver Competition 1002 [246] Has the Respondent provided an adequate \u2013 which is to say more probable \u2013 explanation for the differential treatment of the Complainant in the Vancouver Competition 1002? It is my determination that the Respondent has not provided a reasonable explanation.\n[247] Moreover the Respondent failed to provide a reasonable explanation of the broad interpretation of the ambiguous the eligibility restriction and why it was not applied to any other applicant than Mr. Turner. Indeed, on the record before the Tribunal, it appears that no explanation for this differential treatment was offered at all.\n[248] That recognition of Mr. Turner prompted an inquiry as to his eligibility, stands in stark contrast to Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s admission that no other candidates were disqualified, his excuse being that it would have been too much work, hence the practice he adopted of asking each candidate if they had been interviewed in a prior competition, and acceptance of a negative reply as sufficient to permit the interview process to proceed.\n[249] However, I must move beyond Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s explanation of the review panel\u2019s decision that Mr. Turner was in breach of the eligibility restriction and consider the probability of stereotypical attitudes affecting Mr. Turner\u2019s candidacy in Vancouver Competition 1002. In this regard, I am inexorably drawn by the probabilities surrounding this case to conclude that Mr. Tarnawski negatively stereotyped Mr. Turner as an obese, older black man, likely to be lazy and untruthful, and therefore unacceptable as a potential employee of the newly established law-enforcement-oriented CBSA.\n[250] I conclude that Mr. Tarnawski\u2019s imposition of the eligibility restriction against Mr. Turner was pretextual, and that it was an arbitrary and expedient way to end Mr. Turner\u2019s candidacy in the staffing process, thereby denying Mr. Turner an opportunity to become an indeterminate employee with CBSA.\nVictoria Competition 7003 [251] Has the Respondent answered the prima facie case of discrimination with an adequate \u2013 which is to say a more probable \u2013 explanation for the differential treatment of the Complainant in Victoria Competition 7003? It is my determination that the Respondent has not provided a reasonable explanation.\n[252] It is beyond comprehension that Mr. Baird, Chairperson of the Review Panel, a Superintendent who had worked with Mr. Turner and written positive performance reports of his work as a Customs Inspector, would dogmatically exclude from the panel\u2019s assessment of Mr. Turner the fact that Mr. Turner had competently worked as a Customs Inspector in the previous five years. This totally injudicious process was worsened by Mr. Baird\u2019s amoral attempt, shortly after the interview, to get Superintendent Nina Patel to verify that Mr. Turner had been untruthful in describing to the panel how he dealt with an agitated traveller, an action Mr. Turner performed at the request of Ms. Patel.\n[253] This egregious and injudicious behaviour is not a reasonable explanation for the panel\u2019s assessment that Mr. Turner lacked the competence to be a Customs Inspector, rather it is a basis for the inference of fact that Mr. Baird had negatively stereotyped Mr. Turner as a lazy, older, obese, black man, and decided to deny him the opportunity to continue working for the CBSA as a uniformed Border Services Officer.\n[254] Considering the foregoing conclusions I have reached with respect to both the Vancouver Competition 1002 and the Victoria Competition 7003, and in the context of the surrounding circumstances testified to by Mr. Turner, and in accordance with relevant case law, I find that the Respondent discriminated against Mr. Turner contrary to s. 7 and s. 10 of the CHRA by reason of Mr. Turner\u2019s age, race, and perceived disability of obesity; and subjected Mr. Turner to differential treatment as an employee.\n[255] Lastly, I am guided by the Sinclair decision, in which the adjudicator relied on Spence, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, quoting, in part:\nA significant segment of our community holds overtly racist views. A much larger segment subconsciously operated on the basis of negative racial stereotypes. Furthermore, our institutions, including the criminal justice system, reflect and perpetuate those negative stereotypes. Blacks are among the primary victims of that evil.\nVI. Determinations [256] Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence established a prima face case that CBSA superintendents Ron Tarnawski and Trevor Baird separately subjected him to discriminatory practices, in matters related to employment, on the grounds of age, colour and perceived disability of obesity\n[257] Based on reasons stated throughout this decision, and in all the surrounding circumstances of this case, I made findings of fact that Mr. Tarnawski and Mr. Baird were not credible witnesses; they revealed similar characteristics, often reticent, often resorting to prolixity in order to avoid making direct and dispassionate answers. Both floundered under cross-examination. Wherever their evidence differs with that of Mr. Turner, I have accepted Mr. Turner\u2019s evidence.\n[258] Neither Mr. Tarnawski nor Mr. Baird provided a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory.\n[259] I find that the interviews of Mr. Turner by Mr. Tarnawski (Vancouver Competition 1002) and Mr. Baird (Victoria Competition 7003) were flawed and injudicious, that they were conducted in a manner which denied Mr. Turner an opportunity to compete for indeterminate employment with CBSA; and that in each case the decision was arbitrary and pretextual, based on prejudice and constituted discriminatory practices under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[260] Section 7 of the CHRA reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[261] Section 10 of the CHRA reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nVII. Decision [262] I find that the Complainant has substantiated his allegation that, because of his age, race, and a perceived disability of obesity, he was subjected to discriminatory practices contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA by CBSA\u2019s refusal to continue to employ him and by its pretextual and discriminatory use of the staffing practices in Vancouver Competition 1002 and Victoria Competition 7003, which resulted in the Complainant being deprived him of employment opportunities.\n[263] Section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA provides that a complainant may be compensated up to $20,000 for pain and suffering experienced as a victim of a discriminatory practice. After a subsequent hearing on remedy, I will order the Respondent to pay such amount as may be appropriate to the Complainant compensating him for pain and suffering experienced after he was denied employment opportunities.\n[264] Section 53(3) of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to the victim if the respondent is found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. I find that Respondent managers Ron Tarnawski and Trevor Baird acted wilfully in denying the Complainant an opportunity for employment I will, in due course, after the remedy hearing, make order in compensation for their wilfulness.\n[265] Section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA provides that a victim may be compensated for any and all wages of which he was deprived as a result of the discriminatory practice. I find that the Complainant did suffer lost wages that he would have earned as a Border Services Officer. The amount of wage loss shall be determined after the hearing on remedy. The wage loss shall be determined by calculating the total earnings the Complainant would have earned as a Border Services Officer and deducting from that sum the amount of salary the Complainant has been able to earn from other mitigating employment. Income earned by the Complainant in his effort to mitigate his loss of earning as a Border Services officer must be supported by particulars and personal income tax returns.\n[266] Interest is payable in respect of all awards made in this decision under s. 53(4) of the CHRA. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. Interest is to be calculated from the date of the complaint with respect to the compensation for lost wages, pain and suffering, and special damages.\n[267] During the hearing on remedy I will consider whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to order the Respondent to offer employment to the Complainant.\n[268] The Tribunal shall retain jurisdiction to deal with all matters arising out of this decision for a period of one year after its release.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

Among other remedies, the Tribunal ordered that the Complainant be compensated for all lost wages and benefits that she would have earned between March 1, 2007 and September 29, 2010, had she been actively working for CN during that time. More specifically, the Tribunal ordered as follows:\n[183] The complainant seeks compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all loss of wages and benefits from March 1st, 2007 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[2] In another ruling of the Tribunal dated October 2nd, 2013, the parties were directed to provide submissions on two issues;\na) The proper methodology for calculating wages (inclusive of \u201cextras\u201d) owed to the Complainant?;\nb) Whether the Complainant is entitled to compensation in lieu of benefits she did not receive, and if so, the amount of the compensation to which she is entitled?\n[3] Having taken into consideration the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal is now ready to render its decision in the hope that it might bring some closure to this matter.\n[4] Establishing the appropriate compensation is not an exact science. In the instant case, this exercise is complicated even more by reason of the complex nature of the Collective Agreement, specifically in regards to the payment of wages and extras. In this regard, it is also important to remember that the parties had ample opportunity, at the hearing, to submit evidence in support of their arguments regarding both the issue of discrimination and the issue of damages. Likewise, I must be careful in dealing with the matters put before me. This procedure must not been considered as if there has been a bifurcation of these two issues. This is not the case. I must also be careful not to allow the parties to submit new evidence on the issue of damages. The questions put to me here must be answered with the evidence that was submitted at the hearing.\n[5] Subsection 53(2)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 provides that the person found to be engaging in a discriminatory practice can be ordered to \u201ccompensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice\u201d. Hence, the Complainant is to be put, as much as possible, in the same position she would have been in had she been actively employed with the Respondent.\n[6] In her brief, the Complainant argues that her wages should be calculated by multiplying the applicable mileage rates in the Collective Agreement by the figure of 4 300 miles per month. The Complainant, referring to Article 22.10(a) of the Collective Agreement, argues in essence that she was guaranteed wages of 4 300 miles per month. Article 22.10(a) provides as follows:\n22.10 (a) Employees assigned to runs identified in article 36.2 or road or joint spareboard at terminals that included extended run territory and who are available for duty for their entire mileage month will be entitled to :\n\u2022 4300 miles if working as a conductor;\n\u2022 such guarantee will be prorated for each 14 day board adjustment period.\n[7] Although CN\u2019s obligation is to enable employees to earn 4 300 miles, by providing sufficient numbers of work opportunities, the language of Article 22.10(a) also specifies that the guarantee of 4 300 miles applies only to conductors \u201cwho are available for duty for their entire mileage month\u201d. So, if a conductor chooses not to make himself or herself available for part of a month, for whatever reason, then he or she will not be entitled to the 4 300-mile guarantee for that month. In this regard, Article 22.01(b) provides that the 4 300-mile guarantee \u201cwill be reduced proportionately by the number of miles in road service for each tour of duty the employee would have earned had they been available, and for each call missed\u201d. It further provides that an employee who misses more than two calls in a 14-day period \u201cwill not be entitled to any guarantee\u201d and will be paid only for those miles actually worked. Article 22.10(c) provides for the guarantee to be reduced if an employee books rest in excess of 14 consecutive hours. I agree with the Respondent that, when taken together, these provisions establish that Conductors are not entitled to be paid 4 300 miles each and every month of their employment. Various decisions made by Conductors may have the effect of reducing their guaranteed wages or even eliminating them altogether.\n[8] In order to sustain her claim for wages calculated at 4 300 miles per month, the Complainant would need to demonstrate that in each and every month between March 1st, 2007 and October 17th, 2010, she was available for duty the entire month. There was no evidence submitted at the hearing to support this contention. In their briefs, both parties referred to events that occurred after 2010 to try to support their respective arguments regarding the interpretation that should be given to this Article. I will not consider this evidence, since it was not available to the Tribunal when it rendered its decision.\n[9] The test I will apply is how the Tribunal would have determined the matter in 2010 had it been asked to render a specific decision on the issue of lost wages. Having taken into consideration the arguments of both parties on this matter and having reviewed the decision of 2010 and the evidence submitted then, I conclude that the Respondent\u2019s approach would have been the approach retained. The Tribunal would have chosen a comparative approach and, since the parties had referred during the hearing to Mr. Thom and to no other employees, Mr. Thom would have been considered as the appropriate comparator. In her brief, the Complainant does make reference to other employees who, according to her, would be better comparators, but given that none of these were identified at the hearing, I will not consider them in this decision.\n[10] Mr. Thom was a Conductor working at the Complainant\u2019s home terminal of Jasper throughout the relevant period and it was established at the hearing that he had similar seniority to the Complainant. I agree with the Respondent that, because of their similar seniority, the Complainant would possibly have received the same amount of work opportunities as Mr. Thom. For those periods when Mr. Thom was absent from work, the Respondent substituted the earnings of the non-absent employee who was immediately junior to Mr. Thom at the relevant time. Therefore, by examining the work Mr. Thom performed when he was working and the work that the Conductor immediately junior to him performed when he was not working, the Respondent arrived at a reflection of the work that would have been assigned to the Complainant. This might not be as precise or as accurate as the Complainant would like, but without a crystal ball this is as precise as can be and I fail to see how the Tribunal would have arrived at a different conclusion had the matter been put to it during the hearing.\n[11] In regards to \u201cextras\u201d, the Respondent uses the same methodology as it used to calculate wages. In fact, the Respondent paid to the Complainant an amount equivalent to the total compensation that Mr. Thom earned during the relevant time, inclusive of wages and \u201cextras\u201d. As with wages, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the methodology used by the Respondent to calculate the \u201cextras\u201d is the most accurate possible. If the Tribunal had had to calculate the \u201cextras\u201d, considering the evidence that was before it, it would also have \u201cused\u201d the same methodology.\n[12] In regards to benefits, the Tribunal\u2019s decision states that the Complainant must be compensated for all loss of benefits. It does not specify any particular methodology for calculating her loss of benefits. The Complainant submits that she is entitled to compensation in lieu of the benefits she did not receive and that the proper methodology for determining the amount of compensation payable to her is a comparative one, based on the value of yearly premiums paid by the Respondent to procure the benefit plan. The Respondent, for its part, argues that the Complainant is not entitled to compensation in lieu of benefits because she continued to be covered under her husband\u2019s employee benefits plan. The Respondent also employs her husband.\n[13] Having reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments on this issue, the Tribunal concludes that the position of the Complainant is the most sensible one. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Complainant is entitled to compensation in lieu of benefits in the amount of the value of yearly premiums paid by the Respondent to procure the benefit plan, less any amounts paid by the plan provider for the Complainant\u2019s benefits under her husband\u2019s plan during the relevant time period. According to figures exchanged by the parties during the tentative negotiations to resolve this matter, the amount of the yearly premiums was fixed at $2 965.90 per year, for a total amount of $10 627.88. Therefore, the Complainant is entitled to the amount of $10 627.88, less the net dollar amount of benefits paid for her under her husband\u2019s plan. In order to determine what this amount is, the Complainant will consent to the plan provider releasing this information to her and to the Respondent simultaneously.\n[14] The answer to the two questions is therefore as follows:\na) What is the proper methodology for calculating wages (inclusive of \u201cextras\u201d) owed to the Complainant?\nThe Tribunal concludes that the methodology used by the Respondent for calculating wages, inclusive of extras, is the proper methodology.\nb) Is the Complainant entitled to compensation in lieu of benefits she did not receive, and if so, the amount of the compensation to which she is entitled?\nYes, the Complainant is entitled to compensation in lieu of benefits she did not receive. The total amount of these benefits is fixed at $10 627.88, less any amount of benefits paid for her under her husband\u2019s plan. The Complainant will consent to the plan provider releasing what these amounts were to her and to the Respondent simultaneously.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 14, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1355\/8505\nStyle of Cause: Denise Seeley v.

Background [1] On January17, 2005, Ms. Yanick Lindor, the complainant in the case, filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) pursuant to sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), against the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada, the respondent herein.\n[2] On March 17, 2010, under section 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Commission referred the portion of the complaint that involved the complainant\u2019s alleged disability to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal), and accordingly the Commission dismissed the portion of the complaint with respect to the prohibited grounds of discrimination as to age, colour and the complainant\u2019s family status.\nA. Complainant\u2019s position [3] At the very beginning of the hearing, counsel for the complainant indicated to the Tribunal that it had to first decide on liability and, based on the Tribunal\u2019s decision, a second hearing with respect to damages might be required.\n[4] In his argument, counsel for the complainant stated that he would call two witnesses: Yanick Lindor, the complainant and Isabelle Borr\u00e9, a labour relations officer for the Canadian Association of Professional Employees.\n[5] In summary, counsel for the complainant stated that there was a disability that would be proved at the hearing, that the complainant had been a victim of discrimination under section 7 of the Act, that the complainant had suffered differential treatment and that the respondent was aware of this. Lastly, he invoked the provisions of section 14 of the Act regarding harassment.\nB. Respondent\u2019s position [6] In his presentation, the respondent\u2019s representative indicated to the Tribunal that there was no prima facie evidence of discrimination based on a disability as alleged by the complainant.\n[7] In addition, the respondent\u2019s representative told the Tribunal that the complainant had not complied with the basic requirements of the program that she had agreed to and that there were always significant shortcomings in the complainant\u2019s work.\n[8] He indicated to the Tribunal that the decision to dismiss the complainant was made solely on the basis that the complainant could not meet the basic requirements of the program and was not motivated by the complainant\u2019s alleged disability.\n[9] He said that the respondent terminated the Learning Program, which the complainant had agreed to, solely because of her unsatisfactory performance, which was apparent throughout the relevant period and that therefore the respondent did not engage in a discriminatory practice.\n[10] In terms of its evidence, the respondent called the following seven witnesses:\n\u2212 Louise Caron, translator with the Translation Bureau, Criminology Unit, which is part of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada;\n\u2212 Manon Boucher, the complainant\u2019s supervisor;\n\u2212 C\u00e9line Marchand, the complainant\u2019s coach;\n\u2212 Simon Audy, translator with the Translation Bureau, Criminology Unit;\n\u2212 Micheline Audet, Case Manager for the complainant\u2019s file;\n\u2212 Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Labour Relations Officer in this case;\n\u2212 Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, Director of the Translation Bureau\u2019s Multilingual and Regional Translation and National Security Branch.\nII. Facts A. Complainant\u2019s evidence - Yanick Lindor [11] At the beginning of her testimony, the complainant indicated to the Tribunal that she had agreed on October 10, 2002, to take a translation course under the TR Learning Program (Socio\u2011economic, Political and Legal Translation\/Criminology) in Ottawa. This agreement was further to an offer made by the respondent in a letter dated September 26, 2002, in which the complainant had been invited to receive training to become a translator under the TR Learning Program commencing November 18, 2002.\n[12] In support of that letter was a summary of the conditions of employment, which set out the salary, probationary period and learning period. The learning period would enable the complainant to obtain a Standard of Competence (TR-02 level) within a maximum two\u2011year period, with the possibility of being appointed more quickly to the operational level, i.e. the TR\u201102 level.\n[13] As the summary of the conditions of employment shows, the objectives of the Learning Program would enable the complainant to obtain [translation] \u201ctraining to achieve the Standard of Competence (TR-02 level)\u201d, with the [translation] \u201cestablishment of a business culture within a public administration context\u201d and the \u201cdevelopment of a client service ethic\u201d (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-3).\n[14] The same summary referred to the ability to work under stressful conditions, [translation] \u201cdisplaying qualities like flexibility and availability in a context of optimizing resources\u201d (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-3 of the complainant\u2019s documents).\n[15] Accordingly, following the acceptance of the offer the respondent had made to her, a developmental plan was prepared in the complainant\u2019s name for a two\u2011year period from November 18, 2002, to November 18, 2004.\n[16] It is to be noted that, in the developmental plan submitted to the complainant, in general, it takes a recent graduate in translation two years to reach the desired working level, which means that:\n\u2022 he or she fully meets the qualitative requirements of the employer, namely the ability to translate autonomously every type of text received by his or her unit or team, depending on the specific situation in the unit, regardless of level of difficulty and degree of urgency (autonomously means that the vast majority of the employee\u2019s texts do not require revision);\n\u2022 he or she fully meets the quantitative requirements of the employer, namely the ability to achieve the targeted production level, which is measured in terms of revenue generated.\n(Exhibit P-1, Tab A-5)\n[17] In the same plan, it is noted:\n[I]t is reasonable to assume that an employee recruited at the TR-01 level through the Translation Bureau\u2019s TR Learning Program will generally need two years of training before achieving professional autonomy and a performance level matching the revenue objective that has been set.\n(Exhibit P-1, Tab A-5)\n[18] In other words, this developmental plan provided for a two\u2011year training period, which would prove fateful for the complainant, as the evidence will show.\n[19] Similarly, it is useful to point out that the same developmental plan noted the following:\nHowever, the Translation Bureau is under no obligation to keep a TR-01 on staff for the entire two\u2011year period and can terminate his or her employment at any time during the course of the Program if it is clearly established that the employee will not achieve the required level of competence during the course of the Program, as demonstrated by the employee\u2019s failure to fully achieve all the applicable objectives for a given phase of the Program. Exception: employees recruited from within the Public Service.\n(Exhibit P-1, Tab A-5)\n[20] In order to accomplish the objectives in this developmental plan, a coach was assigned to the complainant, C\u00e9line Marchand.\n[21] Also, Manon Boucher was in charge of this unit at the time.\n[22] Throughout the duration of the training, periods of assessment were to take place every three months.\n[23] Shortly after the developmental plan began, just before the Christmas 2002 holiday period, her coach, C\u00e9line Marchand, asked to meet with her in the Translation Bureau\u2019s boardroom without knowing exactly the reason for the meeting.\n[24] At that time, Ms. Marchand informed the complainant that they did not want to keep her and that she should make a decision during the upcoming holiday period; according to Ms. Marchand, the complainant was told [translation] \u201cI don\u2019t see a future for you in the Bureau. \u201d\n[25] Needless to say, the complainant was stunned. The complainant said that she was not expecting this type of comment. She was surprised, disappointed and lost. She told the Tribunal that her holidays were awful and, despite the fact that Ms. Marchand had asked her to make a decision about her future in the Translation Bureau, the complainant said that she made the decision to come back with the best of intentions, i.e. to translate faster with certain tools. Consequently, in January 2003, the complainant continued her Learning Program.\n[26] Subsequently, the complainant referred to her first assessment dated March 4, 2003, which was given to her in the presence of her coach, Ms. Marchand and Ms. Boucher on March 4, 2003.\n[27] According to the complainant, she indicated to the Tribunal that she [translation] \u201cwas coming along\u201d and, in this regard, she was satisfied and saw that it was possible for her to progress within the Translation Bureau.\n[28] Similarly, an assessment for phase two was prepared, dated June 12, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-8).\n[29] This report also referred to results [translation] \u201cpartially achieved\u201d, and in other comments at the end of the report, the following was stated:\n[translation]\nYanick is an employee who wants to learn and do well. The numerous recommendations in these assessments are related to the difficulties she is having in submitting her translations on time. By learning to organize her time better, applying herself to rendering the source text well, choosing the correct, relevant terms and carefully rereading the final product, Yannick will gradually become more self\u2011confident and will increase her pace of work.\n(Exhibit P-1, Tab A-8)\n[30] In her testimony, the complainant said that after this second assessment she was positive but that her supervisor, Ms. Boucher, told her that she was being transferred to another unit. She was very surprised and did not understand what was going on. According to the complainant, Ms. Boucher told her that a friend had asked her for help in another unit. Although she said she was upset by this news, the complainant indicated that she was not worried and continued to work very hard. However, she noted that Ms. Boucher was angry with her.\n[31] Then came the third assessment dated September 16, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-9).\n[32] In the qualitative performance objectives, we note some partially met objectives as well as others that were fully met.\n[33] In the [translation] \u201cother comments\u201d section, we note the following: [translation] \u201cYanick seems to have reached a plateau for the moment. It is true that there are numerous points that need to be corrected and that it is not easy to improve everything quickly, but these aspects are the essential components of a translator\u2019s work.\u201d (Exhibit P-1, Tab A\u20119).\n[34] It was at that point that the situation deteriorated rapidly, according to the complainant.\n[35] She noted that her coach, Ms. Marchand, no longer had as much time to coach her. She was criticized, but the complainant stated that she redoubled her efforts; in addition, she told the Tribunal that there was too much stress. She spoke to Ms. Boucher about this, but it was too much. The complainant indicated that she felt too pressured and said that she had a hard time with Ms. Marchand. She went back to see Ms. Boucher, but almost every time she went to see Ms. Marchand, it was a panic situation. As well, she felt that everything she did was criticized, and Ms. Marchand told her that she no longer had time to work with her. The complainant said that she felt like she was on trial. She said that she trembled on several occasions without knowing what was really happening.\n[36] In the face of such pressure, the complainant said that one morning she had a headache, an upset stomach, she was trembling, then lost consciousness, and it was her husband who picked her up. A visit to her doctor on September 26, 2003, led to a doctor\u2019s note, which was filed as Exhibit P\u20111, Tab A-10, stating that, because of a personal situation, the complainant would have to take some time off work and be assessed in three weeks.\n[37] Subsequently, the complainant provided another medical prescription dated October 14. 2003, to her employer, which indicated a further period of leave until November 4, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-11).\n[38] In her testimony, the complainant stated that Ms. Boucher telephoned her almost every day for information about documents, passwords and the status of her work. The complainant said that at the very beginning she cooperated with Ms. Boucher and told her that she would work on certain documents at home and then return them to Ms. Boucher in due course. She felt that her home was being invaded. Also, the complainant indicated that she did not know that it was depression, but her doctor told her that. Her doctor told her not to do any work and to stop answering the phone, which she did.\n[39] Similarly, the complainant stated that her doctor had not specified that she was suffering from a nervous breakdown but, according to her, that type of information is not disclosed. She did not discuss with her doctor whether that diagnosis was to be included in the various doctor\u2019s notes that were provided to her employer. In response to the absences mentioned in the various doctor\u2019s notes, Manon Boucher established an intervention plan with respect to the complainant. In a first email, which Ms. Boucher sent to the complainant on November 26, 2003 (Exhibit P\u20111, Tab A-14), she said that the intervention plan was ready and that a meeting would be held on Wednesday, December 10, 2003, in the presence of the complainant\u2019s representative, Isabelle Borr\u00e9, and with Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Labour Relations Officer at Public Works and Government Services.\n[40] It is to be noted that the various doctor\u2019s notes submitted to the employer contemplated a gradual return to work by the complainant of two days, three days and later four days a week.\n[41] At the hearing, the complainant described this meeting of December 10, 2003, with Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Isabelle Borr\u00e9 and Manon Boucher as stormy and said that during the meeting she needed to leave the room, wanted to disappear and found the atmosphere intolerable. In her testimony, the complainant also referred to a medical consultation report dated December 19, 2003, signed by her family doctor, Dr. Janet Seale, addressed to Mich\u00e8le Delisle, the complainant\u2019s consulting psychologist at that time. It stated that the diagnosis was depression and anxiety. The complainant told the Tribunal that she did not remember giving the report to her employer.\n[42] Still regarding the doctor\u2019s note of December 19, 2003. the complainant told the Tribunal that she had taken steps to meet with a psychiatrist and a psychologist with the assistance of her treating physician, hence the doctor\u2019s note of December 19, 2003.\n[43] The complainant also told the Tribunal that she participated in a skills review from January 26 to 30, 2004. She said that at that point she was in a period of progressive return for work purposes, two to three days a week following her doctor\u2019s advice. Accordingly, she informed Ms. Boucher that she could not work more than three days a week. However, the complainant said that Ms. Boucher indicated that it was imperative that she participate in training on those dates. Next there was a fourth performance assessment as part of her Learning Program, dated January 12, 2004 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-20).\n[44] Once again, the complainant obtained results demonstrating that she had not completely met the objectives of the Learning Program. The report was again signed by C\u00e9line Marchand, coach, Manon Boucher, manager, and the complainant.\n[45] Another doctor\u2019s note dated February 4, 2004 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-21), which was given to Manon Boucher, stated that the complainant was not 100% back to normal but that a progressive return of three days a week, with breaks, was indicated before her complete return to work.\n[46] Then came the various assessments regarding the action plan that had been established because of the complainant\u2019s health.\n[47] An assessment dated January 2004 stated that the complainant was still regularly making distraction errors and writing initialisms that sometimes did not agree, cumbersome sentences that lacked clarity as well as passages that were misunderstood and illogical (see the report at Exhibit P-1, Tab A-22).\n[48] The assessment also states: [translation] \u201cafter a year of work in our unit, Yanick should no longer be making these errors in her texts this often but should only need guidance in understanding our areas of work\u201d (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-22, paragraph 4).\n[49] Other reports also show the unenviable progress in the complainant\u2019s performance. She also drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to other doctor\u2019s notes that show an increase from three to four days in a work week (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-26 (doctor\u2019s note dated April 1, 2004)).\n[50] Another doctor\u2019s note dated April 16, 2004, shows that clearly the complainant was affected by the condition that afflicted her at the time, that she was experiencing a great deal of stress, had difficulty sleeping and was suffering from headaches.\n[51] Then came a doctor\u2019s note dated April 16, 2004, which indicated a sick leave from April 19, 2004, to July 19, 2004 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-28).\n[52] During the same time period, a letter dated April 22, 2004, signed by Manon Boucher of the Translation Bureau (Criminology Unit) informed the complainant that her participation in the TR Learning Program was terminated as of April 6, 2004, i.e. the end of the work day indicated. This letter from Manon Boucher was accompanied by another letter signed by Jocelyne Doyle\u2011Rodrigue, Director, Multilingual Translation, Regions and National Security, which confirmed the following: [translation] \u201cyou did not demonstrate that you were able to reach the competency standards required for your position. Therefore, I am advising you that we are going to terminate your participation in the TR Learning Program on April 6, 2004, at the end of the day\u201d (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-29).\n[53] With these letters, an assessment for March 2004 with respect to the action plan that had already been established indicated that the complainant\u2019s performance had declined and that, consequently, the quality of the complainant\u2019s work did not really meet the Translation Bureau\u2019s expectations.\n[54] After receiving this letter from Ms. Boucher, together with the March 2004 assessment and the letter from Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, the complainant told the Tribunal that [translation] \u201cthat was the end, the last nail in the coffin.\u201d\n[55] The complainant told the Tribunal that she felt shame, rejection, sadness, pain and even disgust. She confirmed to the Tribunal that that was the beginning of her major depression.\n[56] The complainant also told the Tribunal that, on her doctor\u2019s recommendations, she provided her employer, Manon Boucher, with information about her condition, which was sent based on the various doctor\u2019s notes filed in the record.\n[57] Lastly, the complainant referred to an email dated May 25, 2004, from Manon Boucher addressed to all staff members of the Translation Bureau (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-30). In that email, Ms. Boucher informed the staff that Yanick Lindor was leaving, even though the complainant was ill at home and not working. The complainant described this email as follows: [translation] \u201cShe had to destroy the animal.\u201d\n[58] On cross\u2011examination, the complainant confirmed that at the end of the summer of 2003, i.e. towards the end of July 2003, her situation at the Bureau began to deteriorate. She confirmed that Ms. Marchand was still coaching her but was asking her to stop repeating the same errors.\n[59] Also, on September 16, 2003, at a meeting regarding her assessment with C\u00e9line Marchand and Manon Boucher, the relationship became very difficult.\n[60] On cross\u2011examination, when respondent\u2019s counsel asked her whether she remembered that Ms. Boucher was asking her to work more than the doctor was asking of her, the complainant stated that Ms. Boucher was asking for production that she was not able to reach.\n[61] She also confirmed that she had no pressing financial problems that could make her ill. She indicated that her husband was also employed.\n[62] In response to a question asked by counsel as to whether the complainant\u2019s employer had accommodated her from November 2002 to January 2006 based on the medical certificates provided, the complainant confirmed positively that this was the case [translation] \u201cif it were done appropriately.\u201d\n[63] Lastly, on cross\u2011examination, she confirmed that she had received an email from Manon Boucher dated June 1, 2004, apologizing about the fateful email dated May 25, 2004, that had been sent to all Translation Bureau employees.\n[64] The complainant said that she was mortified by that email, which her son received and that even if the intentions were laudable, [translation] \u201ckilling\u201d a person is not laudable in her view and that by sending it Manon Boucher slapped her family in the face.\n- Isabelle Borr\u00e9 [65] As part of her evidence, the complainant also called Isabelle Borr\u00e9, Labour Relations Officer for the Canadian Association of Professional Employees.\n[66] Ms. Borr\u00e9 confirmed that she assisted the complainant at various meetings that took place between management and the complainant in regards to monitoring the Learning Program and the action plan that was implemented as a result of the doctor\u2019s notes that the complainant sent to the respondent\u2019s representatives.\n[67] Ms. Borr\u00e9 confirmed that the meetings with Ms. Lindor and the respondent\u2019s representatives were not friendly, that the complainant was very affected, she cried and trembled and that the micromanagement was very difficult for the complainant. She noted that the complainant was clearly suffering from considerable stress.\n[68] Ms. Borr\u00e9 also informed the Tribunal that she noted that the complainant\u2019s doctor wanted her to stop working, that the complainant was experiencing a great deal of anxiety, which became an illness and that it was obvious that [translation] \u201cshe was ill, had circles under her eyes and was exhausted.\u201d\n[69] She confirmed to the Tribunal that the sending of the May 25, 2004, email by Manon Boucher to all staff at the Translation Bureau did not impress her and that this did not excuse the action or the blackening of the complainant that appeared in that email.\n[70] Ms. Borr\u00e9 also informed the Tribunal that the two\u2011year period indicated in the learning period was not a fixed deadline or a limit that could not be moved, according to her.\n[71] On cross\u2011examination, Ms. Borr\u00e9 indicated that, with respect to the action plan established to enable Ms. Lindor to achieve the objectives of the TR Learning Program, the chances that the complainant could be rehabilitated were nil. She also noted that Ms. Lindor wished to continue working even though she was not certain that she was able to understand the extent of her own illness.\n[72] Ms. Borr\u00e9 confirmed to the Tribunal that she was relieved when the complainant\u2019s psychiatrist ordered her to stop work completely in a doctor\u2019s note dated April 16, 2004. She also referred to her own notes dated April 7, 2004 (Exhibit P-1, Tab B-12), where she referred to the fact that the complainant\u2019s doctor did not agree that she should continue to work four days a week.\n[73] The same note mentions that the complainant needed money, which she confirmed at the hearing.\nB. Respondent\u2019s evidence [74] In presenting its evidence, the respondent called the following seven witnesses:\n\u2212 Louise Caron, translator since 1975 and at the time of this case, Director of the Legal and Economic Branch;\n\u2212 Micheline Audet, Disability Management Advisor;\n\u2212 Manon Boucher, chief, Criminology Unit of the Translation Bureau at the time of this case;\n\u2212 C\u00e9line Marchand, translator with 31 years of experience at the Translation Bureau, Criminology Unit, and the complainant\u2019s coach;\n\u2212 Simon Audy, translator at the Translation Bureau and proofreader of the complainant\u2019s texts;\n\u2212 Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Labour Relations Advisor for the Translation Bureau;\n\u2212 Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue; at the time of this case, Ms. Doyle\u2011Rodrigue was the Director of the Multilingual Translation, Regions and National Security Branch at the Translation Bureau.\n- Louise Caron [75] In her testimony, Louise Caron, who was Director of the Legal and Economic Branch at that time, informed the Tribunal that the Learning Program that the complainant was involved in and had been given an offer to participate in was based on the Translation Bureau\u2019s needs and was in competition with the private sector at that time.\n[76] As a result, the recruitment method that was in effect at that time enabled the Translation Bureau to replenish its workforce. It was therefore agreed that the TR program was to take two years and that this timeframe should enable a person to reach the objectives set for training new translators. This two\u2011year timeframe was consistent with the industry norm and has proven to be sufficient.\n[77] Ms. Caron referred to the fact that the two\u2011year training was intended to be full\u2011time and that part\u2011time work was not accepted. Accordingly, translators had to work five days a week. If accommodations had to be made, the deadline could be deferred in light of a period of absence.\n[78] She confirmed to the Tribunal that a coach\u2019s work involved the work aspect more than the medical aspect. She also confirmed that each case is different and that a coach must speak to the manager about any problems. With respect to discipline and accommodations, labour relations were to take over at that point. The manager was ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the Learning Program for a candidate.\n[79] She also confirmed that the two\u2011year timeline set out in the developmental plan could be the subject of an accommodation, for example for maternity or sick leaves.\n- Micheline Audet\n[80] During her testimony, Micheline Audet confirmed that she has been a disability management advisor since 2001 and facilitates the return to work of employees who have been ill. Each situation has to be assessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis.\n[81] Ms. Audet explained that the receipt of a medical certificate was therefore crucial in this assessment. She confirmed to the Tribunal that she had received a call from Manon Boucher on September 26, 2003, during which Ms. Boucher informed her that Yanick Lindor had to stop working for three weeks. Ms. Audet confirmed that she saw the medical certificate filed as P-1, Tab A-10, which mentioned a personal situation with respect to the complainant\u2019s medical condition. She did not ask the complainant\u2019s doctor any questions with respect to this medical certificate.\n- Manon Boucher [82] The respondent then called Manon Boucher, the manager in Yanick Lindor\u2019s case.\n[83] Ms. Boucher confirmed that the complainant\u2019s texts contained [translation] \u201coddities\u201d as of the first assessment stage. She confirmed that there were unexpected things, commas, words used improperly and that this did not look like finished work. She told the Tribunal that the complainant\u2019s performance appraisals contained annotations of objectives partially met and confirmed that Ms. Lindor began to experience problems at the beginning of the learning period.\n[84] Ms. Boucher informed the Tribunal that at the September 16, 2003, assessment, i.e. the third step, the objectives had not been met and that there were many improvements but the same errors were always present, which were [translation] \u201cbasic things.\u201d\n[85] Accordingly, she considered preparing an action plan and identifying the improvements the complainant had to make.\n[86] She confirmed to the Tribunal that the day after that meeting, i.e. September 17, 2003, the complainant began her sick leave. Subsequently, on September 26, 2003, a doctor\u2019s note was provided (Exhibit P-1, Tab A\u201110).\n[87] The witness told the Tribunal that she thought that the complainant was reacting to the action plan that had been suggested to her. She thought that the complainant had a stress issue.\n[88] Ms. Boucher confirmed that the complainant had given her the doctor\u2019s note in person without providing any details about the nature of the complainant\u2019s condition.\n[89] Ms. Boucher confirmed that she and C\u00e9line Marchand had prepared the proposed action plan and that it was submitted at the meeting on December 10, 2013, in the presence of Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Isabelle Borr\u00e9 and the complainant. Contrary to what Ms. Lindor claimed, Ms. Boucher told the Tribunal that the meeting lasted between an hour and an hour and a half. There was no shouting and she did not see Ms. Lindor cry. She indicated to Ms. Lindor that, unfortunately, she had to work twice as hard. She also informed the Tribunal that Yanick Lindor\u2019s medical condition was never disclosed to her, but she suspected it was stress. She told the Tribunal that, in her view, she did not have the right to ask about the exact nature of the complainant\u2019s condition. She confirmed to the Tribunal that the situation at the Translation Bureau is very stressful and that this requires constant concentration.\n[90] Finally, she noted that the expected objectives were not met and that, subsequently, Ms. Lindor spoke less and less, while being aware that there was more backsliding than progress in her situation.\n[91] Ms. Boucher indicated to the Tribunal that, at the third assessment in March 2004, it was noted that there had been a setback in the complainant\u2019s situation and that the assessment in question was not very positive. In light of this situation, she discussed it with Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, her immediate boss, and that, in the end, since it was always the same stumbling blocks, it became apparent that continuing the Learning Program was not a good idea for the complainant. Accordingly, Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue wrote an official letter on April 6, 2004, to terminate the complainant\u2019s Learning Program.\n[92] With respect to the email that was sent on May 25, 2004, to all Translation Bureau employees, Ms. Boucher referred to a letter of apology that was subsequently provided (Exhibit I-1, Tab 3).\n[93] On cross\u2011examination, Ms. Boucher confirmed that, in regards to the possibility of suspending the learning project for the complainant, this situation was not normal and that it had been done. Moreover, she confirmed that there was never a question of extending the suspension or extending it for another year. She also confirmed to the Tribunal that in Ms. Lindor\u2019s specific circumstances, the maximum amount of resources and assistance was provided to the complainant.\n[94] However, she observed that Ms. Lindor became increasingly silent and that it was difficult to have a discussion with her because she did not respond. Ms. Boucher also informed the Tribunal that Ms. Lindor was responsible for telling her if the situation was unsuitable for her. As to the possibility of further accommodation, she told the Tribunal that she had no information on Ms. Lindor\u2019s health problems and that the medical certificates were those provided by the complainant herself.\n- C\u00e9line Marchand [95] In presenting its case, the respondent called C\u00e9line Marchand, who had over 31 years of service in the Criminology Unit. She became the complainant\u2019s coach with respect to the facts of this case.\n[96] In her testimony, Ms. Marchand referred to the fact that she noted that the complainant was having problems, which indicated that her work was not up to standard because there were many errors. She saw that there would be a big gap between the complainant\u2019s work and the objectives she had to meet. She said the following to the Tribunal: [translation] \u201cwe were heading for a catastrophe.\u201d\n[97] She referred to a January 2004 assessment regarding the action plan that had been prepared following the problems noted and the complainant\u2019s absences. She referred to mistakes regularly made as a result of distraction errors, writing initialisms that sometimes did not agree, cumbersome sentences that lacked clarity as well as passages that were misunderstood and illogical. She confirmed that uniformity was again a problem. She also stated that Simon Audy, who reviewed all of Ms. Marchand\u2019s revisions, very often found typographical errors that, in spite of everything, had escaped Ms. Marchand\u2019s attention.\n[98] She confirmed that after a year of working at the Translation Bureau, the complainant should no longer have been making these types of errors in her texts but should only have needed to be guided in understanding the areas of work.\n[99] She found it abnormal to always create a special environment around the complainant because of her difficulties.\n[100] In December 2003, she indicated that [translation] \u201cthings were going badly.\u201d\n[101] She even found texts in the archives that repeated word for word a text that had been given to the complainant to translate.\n[102] It was the same text taken by the complainant in another place in order to do this translation. She noted that Ms. Lindor took twice the time required to do a translation. With respect to the complainant\u2019s first sick leave, on cross\u2011examination, Ms. Marchand indicated that, although she had never doubted the complainant\u2019s medical condition, she had no idea what the condition was. She assumed that it was because of work.\n[103] At the hearing, Ms. Marchand referred to a checklist from December 2002 to April 2004 (Exhibit I-1, Tab 22).\n[104] It contains references to the effect that the complainant was not fast, was disorganized and that there was something else that could have been troubling her, but without further details.\n[105] She noted clearly that the complainant\u2019s work was not up to standard, without being told by the complainant what could be causing her problems. She indicated [translation] \u201cit was silence the entire time, maybe after ten years she would have been able to meet her objectives, but the program was two years, I could not give her more.\u201d\n- Simon Audy [106] As part of its evidence, the respondent also called Simon Audy, who is also a translator at the TR-02 level, but who was a translator at the TR-03 level at the time of this case.\n[107] Mr. Audy told the Tribunal that the errors in the documents filed by the respondent as Exhibit I-2 were errors [translation] \u201cthat were surprising for a TR in training.\u201d\n[108] He noted that there were many quite serious errors in the complainant\u2019s work and that normally, she should have been more advanced considering the time that had passed.\n- Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher [109] The respondent also called Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Labour Relations Advisor for the period in which the facts of this case occurred. Her work consisted of giving opinions and advice to management.\n[110] Ms. Durocher participated in certain meetings, including the one on December 10, 2003, which led to the preparation of an action plan that was established to enable the complainant to correct shortcomings and reach the required steps in the Learning Program. According to her, the atmosphere was not tense but delicate and, to say the least, cordial.\n[111] With respect to the complainant\u2019s medical restrictions, she observed that there were only some notes on her progressive return, nothing more.\n[112] On cross\u2011examination, with respect to the possibility of extending the Learning Program, Ms. Durocher told the Tribunal that this situation was raised when the complainant returned and that if a suspension of seven weeks in total had occurred, the end of the program would have had to be shifted. She confirmed that once the suspension was granted and taken, there was a recommencement but that it was necessary to stay within the two\u2011year period, which is provided for in the program. Ms. Durocher indicated to the Tribunal that the work had to be done based on the program and that the expectations remained the same but that the quantity of work and the deadlines were established on the basis of the number of hours of work allowed under the medical certificates. The workload was given according to the number of hours, considering the medical certificates.\n- Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue [113] Finally, the respondent called Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue as its last witness. As mentioned before, Ms. Doyle-Rodrigue was the Director of the Multilingual and Regional Translation and National Security Branch.\n[114] She confirmed to the Tribunal that the end of the program could not be changed but that management had taken the complainant\u2019s illness into account after an assessment of all the completed phases and, considering the difficulties that existed at that time and that could not be overcome, it was decided to terminate the program.\nIII. Law [115] At the hearing, counsel for the complainant told the Tribunal that he was relying on sections 7(b), 14 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and indicated that the respondent\u2019s accommodation because of the complainant\u2019s condition was inadequate.\n[116] For a comprehensive understanding of this case, it is useful to review sections 7(b), 14 and 14.1, which read as follows:\nSection 7: It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 14: (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nMarginal note: Sexual harassment\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 14.1: It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[117] In this regard, counsel for the complainant referred to the fact that the complainant had been harassed by the various actions of the respondent\u2019s employees.\n[118] In reply, counsel for the respondent indicated to the Tribunal that only the complainant\u2019s performance was considered in the decision to terminate the TR Learning Program.\n[119] He also said that the Tribunal must in fact find that the disability was a ground for dismissal in applying the legal provisions noted above.\n[120] The underlying legal principles in applying the Act are now well known.\n[121] It is up to the complainant to establish, on a prima facie basis, a case of discrimination or at least one of the alleged bases. In that regard, the required threshold for establishing proof of discrimination is extremely low. As such, the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following: \u201cA prima facie case . . . is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2011employer\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at page 558). The respondent\u2019s response or explanation must be credible.\n[122] Similarly, the response or explanation must be sufficient and not a pretext (Basi v. Canadian National Railway (no1), (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), at paragraph 38474).\n[123] Once the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the complainant is entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at pages 202 to 208).\n[124] It should be noted that the employer\u2019s evidence may be established on balance of probabilities.\n[125] Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent to demonstrate that the alleged discrimination did not occur or that the conduct seems to not be discriminatory or justified.\n[126] To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the complainant must establish that she had suffered differential treatment based on her disability, contrary to section 7 of the Act. Furthermore, the complainant does not need to demonstrate that the discrimination was not intentional (see Bhinder v. CN, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 561, at page 57).\n[127] In evidence, the respondent must demonstrate that the alleged discrimination did not occur or did not originate in conduct that was itself discriminatory. To do so, the respondent must demonstrate the following on a balance of probabilities:\n[T]hat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; . . . that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and . . . that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n(British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, at page 5)\n[128] Once the legal principles have been established, the Tribunal must therefore answer the first question, that is, whether the complainant did discharge her burden of proof by establishing, in a prima facie manner, a case of discrimination or, at least, one of its basis.\n[129] After attentively reviewing the evidence in the record and considering the testimony of the various witnesses and the exhibits submitted at the hearing, the Tribunal indeed finds that the complainant duly discharged her burden of proof.\n[130] More specifically, the Tribunal did in fact note a medical condition that the respondent knew about, and even if that medical condition was not initially specified in the medical certificates submitted by the complainant, paragraph 7(b) of the Act appears to have been violated by the respondent.\n[131] Finally, the Tribunal finds that the evidence is sufficient and was established preponderantly to effectively establish the conditions in paragraph 7(b) of the Act. The respondent was duly informed that the complainant had a disability, a definition of which can be found in section 25 of the Act.\n[132] Moreover, even if the diagnosis was not established from the start and communicated to the respondent\u2019s representatives, that is, Ms. Boucher and Ms. Marchand, at the first sign of the complainant\u2019s condition, the testimony of Ms. Boucher and Ms. Marchand indicates that they strongly suspected that stress was the cause of the complainant\u2019s said condition.\n[133] Taking into account the existence of a condition, even if it was not specified to the respondent, the implementation of an action plan established by the employer for the benefit of the complainant and, subsequently, the dismissal or termination of the TR Learning Program that the complainant was part of, it appears to the Tribunal that all of the requirements have been met to establish, in a prima facie manner, the existence of conditions regarding the application of paragraph 7(b) of the Act.\n[134] Considering the reversal of the burden of proof onto the respondent, did it discharge such a burden based on the criteria established by the case law?\n[135] After giving much consideration to the evidence in the record, more specifically the testimony of the complainant, as well as that of Manon Boucher and C\u00e9line Marchand, the key witnesses in this case, the Tribunal finds that, indeed, the respondent discharged its burden of proof for the following reasons.\nA. Complainant\u2019s theory of the case [136] In its analysis, the Tribunal was confronted with two theories. The first theory is that of the complainant and relies essentially on knowledge by the respondent of her having a medical condition or disability, knowledge which should have led the respondent to make inquiries regarding her health (Mackenzie v. Jace Holdings and another (No. 4), 2012 BCHRT 376; Wall v. Lipp\u00e9 Group, 2008 HRTO 50; Fendick v. Lakes District Maintenance (No2), 2005 BCHRT 573; Martin v. Carter Chevrolet Oldsmobile, 2001 BCHRT 37).\n[137] Second, after a more in-depth analysis of the complainant\u2019s health, the employer should have adopted an accommodation process with the complainant based on the more in-depth analysis of her health.\n[138] The complainant\u2019s representative believes that the accommodation process must be carried out up to the point of undue hardship as established in the case law and, more specifically, in the following decisions: Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970; Gordy v. Painter\u2019s Lodge (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225; Machado v. Terrace Ford Lincoln Sales, 2011 HRTO 544 (CanLII); Conte v. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., 1999 CanLII 1022 (CHRT); Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10 (CanLII).\n[139] In fact, the complainant alleges that the respondent [translation] \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that the complainant\u2019s medical condition or disability had to result in further accommodation, which was not adopted by the respondent. Furthermore, the complainant directly criticizes Manon Boucher for not requesting an inquiry into her health by Health Canada and finds that the respondent had an obligation to do so and to make further inquiries into her disability.\n[140] Furthermore, the complainant criticizes the respondent for not considering extending the two-year period set out in the learning plan and states that there is no proof of undue hardship from an extension of the said TR Learning Program. The complainant alleges that the two-year period set out in the TR Learning Program is merely an internal limit for the respondent and, in that regard, finds that there was no evidence a contrario that the two\u2011year period or extending the two-year period could have resulted in undue hardship.\nB. Respondent\u2019s theory of the case [141] The second theory is the respondent\u2019s claim that the complainant was removed from the TR Learning Program based solely on her poor performance, and not her disability.\n[142] Certainly, in the evidence, the Tribunal noted that there was no medical assessment or report describing the complainant\u2019s disabilities with respect to her ability to carry out her work, not to mention that such an analysis could have perhaps made it possible to further analyze the accommodations required based on the complainant\u2019s condition.\n[143] The conduct of both the complainant and the respondent\u2019s representatives must be analyzed with respect to this gap.\n[144] In other words, does the failure to obtain such medical expertise rest solely on the employer, or, is there also a need to consider the complainant\u2019s conduct in the disclosure of medical information under her control? That analysis must be done according to the criteria established in Renaud, where the Honourable Mr. Justice Sopinka stated the following:\nThe search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry. Along with the employer and the union, there is also a duty on the complainant to assist in securing an appropriate accommodation. The inclusion of the complainant in the search for accommodation was recognized by this Court in O'Malley. At page 555, McIntyre J. stated:\nWhere such reasonable steps, however, do not fully reach the desired end, the complainant, in the absence of some accommodating steps on his own part such as an acceptance in this case of part-time work, must either sacrifice his religious principles or his employment.\nTo facilitate the search for an accommodation, the complainant must do his or her part as well. Concomitant with a search for reasonable accommodation is a duty to facilitate the search for such an accommodation. Thus in determining whether the duty of accommodation has been fulfilled the conduct of the complainant must be considered.\nThis does not mean that, in addition to bringing to the attention of the employer the facts relating to discrimination, the complainant has a duty to originate a solution. While the complainant may be in a position to make suggestions, the employer is in the best position to determine how the complainant can be accommodated without undue interference in the operation of the employer's business. When an employer has initiated a proposal that is reasonable and would, if implemented, fulfil the duty to accommodate, the complainant has a duty to facilitate the implementation of the proposal. If failure to take reasonable steps on the part of the complainant causes the proposal to founder, the complaint will be dismissed. The other aspect of this duty is the obligation to accept reasonable accommodation. This is the aspect referred to by McIntyre J. in O'Malley. The complainant cannot expect a perfect solution. If a proposal that would be reasonable in all the circumstances is turned down, the employer's duty is discharged.\n(Renaud, above, at pages 994 and 995)\n[145] In the evidence that was submitted in this file, the Tribunal finds that the complainant\u2019s conduct has not been without reproach.\n[146] In fact, in the evidence submitted, the Tribunal also noted a disability insurance information request that refers to a diagnosis of depression and anxiety (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-40). That request was signed by the doctor who treated the complainant, Dr. Janet Seale, who corrected the document dated October 17, 2003, and changed the date to October 24, 2003.\n[147] In that regard, it is useful to note that the complainant\u2019s symptoms related to her medical condition apparently started on September 17, 2003, the day after she met with those in charge of the TR Learning Program regarding her performance evaluation (see the section entitled [translation] \u201cEmployee information\u201d, completed and signed by the complainant on October 21, 2003, document in Exhibit P-1, Tab A-40).\n[148] Later, the document mentions various consultations with Dr. Seale starting on September 26, 2003 and Mich\u00e8le Delisle, the complainant\u2019s psychologist, on November 10, 2003.\n[149] In the various meetings that followed, and more specifically in the one on December 10, 2003, during which an action plan was developed by Manon Boucher and C\u00e9line Marchand for the complainant considering her medical condition, the complainant did not, at any point, refer to that disability insurance request or to the diagnosis contained therein.\n[150] Similarly, a doctor\u2019s note dated December 19, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A\u201116), addressed to Mich\u00e8le Delisle, regarding the complainant\u2019s medical condition, mentioned the same diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Again, that doctor\u2019s note was never shown to the respondent.\n[151] Oddly enough, the first doctor\u2019s note addressed to the employer dated September 26, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-10) refers to a [translation] \u201cpersonal situation\u201d, and contains no more information on the complainant\u2019s medical condition.\n[152] Subsequently, a second doctor\u2019s note dated October 14, 2003, submitted to the respondent, again had no more information on the complainant\u2019s disability. Similarly, a third doctor\u2019s note dated November 12, 2003, addressed to the respondent, also contained no other information on the complainant\u2019s medical condition. Finally, how should the fact that the fourth doctor\u2019s note, which was dated December 19, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-16), and referred to a diagnosis of depression and anxiety, was submitted to Mich\u00e8le Delisle, the complainant\u2019s consulting psychologist, and not to the respondent be interpreted?\n[153] In fact, regarding the doctor\u2019s note dated November 12, 2003 (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-13), which was submitted to the employer, how should the complainant\u2019s testimony be interpreted when she said that her doctor never told her that she was having a nervous breakdown and rather that, according to her, [translation] \u201cit\u2019s the type of information that isn\u2019t disclosed\u201d?\n[154] The Tribunal finds that the complainant\u2019s failure to disclose some personal information undermines her credibility in this case.\n[155] But there is more regarding the complainant\u2019s attitude in this case. Indeed, on December 10, 2003, at a meeting with her representative and the respondent\u2019s representatives, it was agreed that an action plan would be developed to enable the respondent to track the complainant\u2019s progress (Exhibit P-1, Tab A-15).\n[156] Note that the action plan, dated November 2003, states the following in its first paragraph:\n[translation]\nThe employee had to take time off for five full weeks for medical reasons and returned to work for two days a week afterwards (upon the advice of her doctor, who deemed her able to work 15 hours a week); the program was interrupted. It should have resumed the week of November 3, but Ms. Lindor was allowed two additional weeks to help her return to her duties slowly. The program was therefore reactivated on November 17, 2003.\n[157] The action plan is clearly an accommodation that was provided to the complainant. The complainant and her representative participated in meetings to establish such an action plan. To that effect, the complainant was therefore entitled to, considering her disability, which she knew about (even if not specified), intervene in the development of the action plan and be able to let the respondent know if such an action plan suited her.\n[158] In fact, in developing the action plan, the complainant considered her availability, which her doctor reported, for progressive return to work of two, three or four days per week. She therefore participated in the remedies based on her medical condition that she herself disclosed with doctor\u2019s notes from her own doctor.\n[159] The evidence shows that despite the action plan and the doctor\u2019s notes provided by the complainant regarding her progressive return to work, the complainant\u2019s performance did not improve.\n[160] As such, the Tribunal finds that the respondent cannot be criticized for making the necessary arrangements considering the medical condition, as disclosed by the complainant, in order to accommodate her.\n[161] Considering the particular facts in this case, the Tribunal finds that the respondent\u2019s obligation to investigate the complainant\u2019s medical condition should not take precedence over the complainant\u2019s obligation to adequately inform the employer of her medical condition, which she knew about or could have easily known about with more information on the exact nature of her medical condition.\n[162] As stated by the Honourable Mr. Justice Sopinka in Renaud, the Tribunal finds that the complainant\u2019s failure to adequately inform her employer of her medical situation, as well as to take reasonable action in this case, considering her medical condition, that she knew about or could have known about in this case, are also at the origin of the failure of the respondent\u2019s proposal. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes, like in Renaud, that the complainant in this case cannot expect a perfect solution.\nIV. Decision [163] The complainant and her representative had the opportunity to present all of the possible solutions based on her medical condition and to ensure her accommodation by the employer, which did not refuse according to the evidence in the record.\n[164] In its search for case precedents regarding this case, the Tribunal was able to identify Butler v. Nenqayni Treatment Centre Society, 2002 CanLII 12274 (CHRT), where the employment of the complainant, Butler, was terminated after several efforts to find other functions for the complainant, which were unsuccessful.\n[165] In that decision by the Tribunal, which was presided over by Member Anne L. Mactavish (Butler v. Nenqayni Treatment Center Society), the following was stated in applying Meiorin (British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3), and Grismer (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868): \u201c[a]s has been previously noted, the search for accommodation is a two way street, with both the employer and the employee having certain responsibilities.\u201d\n[166] In another of the Tribunal\u2019s decisions (Benoit v. Bell Canada (Qu\u00e9bec), 2004 CHRT 32 (CanLII), Member Athanasios D. Hadjis also had to review the issue of the communication of medical information from a complainant to an employer.\n[167] In that decision, where the complainant had an alcohol abuse problem, the complainant\u2019s employment was terminated not only because of his alcoholism, but also because of his weak performance record when compared with the other managerial employees.\n[168] Despite the differing facts in this case, in Benoit, the complainant, by his own admission, deliberately and successfully misled his supervising directors into sincerely believing that he was not an alcoholic.\n[169] Member Hadjis, reiterating the comments of the Supreme Court of Canada in Renaud, also referred to the fact that there was a responsibility on the part of the employee to take matters into his own hands and ask for help.\n[170] In that regard, he stated that the search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry that commands \u201can active participation on the part of the complainant\u201d (Benoit).\n[171] In conclusion, Member Hadjis stated that, even though not convinced that the complainant\u2019s alcoholism was a factor in the decision to terminate his employment, he found the explanation provided by the respondent reasonable and, as a result, the explanation was not pretextual.\n[172] Finally, the Tribunal cites Graham v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 40 (CanLII), a decision presided over by Member J. Grant Sinclair.\n[173] In the latter case, the complainant, Sandra Graham, who worked for the Canada Post Corporation (CPC), filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission after asking a co-worker at CPC to intercede on her behalf with senior CPC management to try and resolve the difficulties she was having with her manager because of her absence.\n[174] In that decision, the Tribunal found that the complainant indeed suffered from a disability during the period in which she was absent from work. Member Sinclair found that, despite the presence of a disability, the complainant did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[175] Similarly, Member Sinclair applied Renaud of the Supreme Court of Canada and stated the following:\nTo facilitate the search for an accommodation, the complainant must do his or her part as well. Concomitant with a search for reasonable accommodation is a duty to facilitate the search for such an accommodation. Thus in determining whether the duty of accommodation has been fulfilled the conduct of the complainant must be considered.\n(Renaud, above, paragraph g at page 994)\n[176] Member Sinclair found that it was not possible for CPC to devise an appropriate accommodation for the complainant (paragraph 93 of the decision).\n[177] Consequently, the complaint of discrimination by the complainant, Graham, against CPC was not substantiated and in the end her complaint was dismissed.\nV. Conclusion [178] Like in Butler, Benoit and Graham, above, I find that the complainant knew or should have known her medical situation and could easily have communicated it to the respondent based on the evidence submitted to the Tribunal.\n[179] Similarly, the action plan that was implemented within the TR Learning Program, which the complainant was participating in, included sufficient accommodation elements to enable the complainant to find solutions with respect to her disability, and this was proven at the hearing.\n[180] The Tribunal cannot assume that the complainant voluntarily hid and did not disclose her complete medical situation like in the above-mentioned Benoit, but certainly the failure to provide the respondent with the medical certificates or doctor\u2019s notes that were provided to her insurer and her psychologist, Mich\u00e8le Delisle, seriously affects the complainant\u2019s credibility.\n[181] Considering the information the complainant provided to her employer and the testimony of the various witnesses, including primarily the testimony of Manon Boucher and C\u00e9line Marchand, the Tribunal finds that the respondent did fulfil its duty to accommodate and that, if such accommodation was not successful in the complainant\u2019s situation, she is largely responsible for the failure of the respondent\u2019s proposal.\n[182] Finally, in light of the evidence before it, the Tribunal notes that the complainant had a lot of difficulty complying with the TR Learning Program before September 16, 2003, the date of the initial assessment meeting to establish and correct the difficulties she was encountering.\n[183] In doing so, the Tribunal seriously questioned the complainant\u2019s ability to actually become a translator and tolerate all of the stress that can result from such a role.\n[184] As a result, the Tribunal finds that even an extension beyond the two years provided, as set out in the TR Learning Program, might not have resulted in the complainant becoming a translator at the TR-02 level.\n[185] Based on these findings, the Tribunal finds that considering further accommodation in the complainant\u2019s specific situation would have certainly amounted to undue hardship on the respondent. It therefore appears to the Tribunal that further accommodation was not reasonable based on all of the circumstances in this case. As the Honourable Mr. Justice Sopinka pointed out in Renaud, the complainant cannot expect a perfect solution (Renaud, above, at page 995).\n[186] The Tribunal therefore finds that the discrimination complaint made by the complainant, Yanick Lindor, against the respondent, Public Works and Government Services Canada, is not substantiated.\n[187] Consequently, the complaint is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 9, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal file: T1465\/1110\nStyle of cause: Yanick Lindor v.

Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2013 CHRT 35 [the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling], the Tribunal provided a detailed background of these proceedings (see paras. 1-10).\n[2] In sum, the Tribunal has found the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination to be substantiated (see Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10), pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. To remedy the discrimination, the Tribunal made an order related to the Complainant\u2019s pension, among other orders (see Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 20 [Outstanding Remedies Ruling]). However, the Tribunal first left it to the parties to work out the details of implementing the pension remedy. The parties were unable to do so and returned to the Tribunal for clarification. In the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling, the Tribunal clarified the pension remedy order, but requested further submissions from the parties before finally ruling on the matter.\n[3] This ruling provides a final determination of the pension remedy.\nII. The pension remedy and its intent [4] The Tribunal ordered as follows with respect to the Complainant\u2019s pension:\nThe Respondent shall restore the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her layoff to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her pension plan half of the pension contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous pension plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost pension benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS. I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined in my reasons.\n(Outstanding Remedies Ruling at para. 22)\n[5] The parties agree that the Respondent\u2019s obligation under the above order is to implement the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff; and, that those benefits can be provided under the applicable pension plan.\n[6] With regard to the period following layoff, the parties disagreed with respect to what was owed the Complainant: 50% of the pension contributions the Respondent would have made; or, 50% of the pension benefits the Complainant would have received, less the contributions the Complainant would have made. In this regard, the Tribunal provided the following clarification:\nFor the period following her layoff, only half of the employer\u2019s pension contributions are awarded. Half, because the Tribunal is remedying the possibility the Complainant shared with one other candidate of retaining her job with the Respondent, and not the loss of the job itself; and, only the employer\u2019s pension contributions, because the Complainant did not lose her own contributions. She simply did not pay into the pension plan following her layoff.\n(Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling at para. 23)\n[7] The parties agree that half of the employer\u2019s normal contributions for the period of February 23, 2007 to June 1, 2013 is $17,789.72. However, the parties disagree about the inclusion and calculation of special contributions and interest in the pension remedy. Following the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling, further submissions were requested from the parties on the subject of the special contributions and interest.\n[8] Now having reviewed the additional submissions and supplemental actuarial reports on the subject of special contributions and interest, I have a more complete understanding of the applicable pension plan and how it works. On this basis, I view the disagreement between the parties on the subject of special contributions and interest to be one of wording, based on the language used in crafting the pension remedy. That is, the Tribunal\u2019s use of the terms \u201cbenefits\u201d for the period up until the Complainant\u2019s layoff, versus the use of term \u201ccontributions\u201d for the period following layoff.\n[9] The intent of the Tribunal in using these two separate terms was simply to distinguish between the period before and after the Complainant\u2019s layoff. Namely, \u201cemployer contributions\u201d was used to describe the period following layoff to emphasize that the Complainant\u2019s contributions should not be included in the calculation of the lost pension for that time period. Otherwise, the aim of the remedy was to ensure \u201cthe Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS\u201d (Outstanding Remedies Ruling at para. 22). For the period after layoff, the Tribunal intended the Complainant to receive whatever amount the Respondent would have given her (at 50% and minus her own contributions) \u201c...had the Complainant remained in its employ\u201d (Outstanding Remedies Ruling at para. 22).\n[10] While the Tribunal indicated in the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling that the Respondent was correct in interpreting the pension remedy for the period after layoff as being 50% of the pension contributions the Respondent would have made, when a consideration of special contributions and interest is taken into account, this is the equivalent of the Complainant\u2019s interpretation of 50% of the pension benefits the Complainant would have received, less the contributions the Complainant would have made. They are equivalent because the applicable pension plan is a defined benefit as opposed to a defined contribution. The Complainant aptly described the difference between the two:\n12. In a defined contribution plan, the employees and the employer contribute a certain and set amount of money to the plan. These contributions are invested in the market to generate further money for the pension plan. The benefits that the pensioners receive upon retirement will depend upon the amount of the contributions and how well the market has done over the period of time that the contributions have been invested. For example, if the market has done very well over the time in which the contributions have been invested, the benefits will be relatively high. However, if the market did poorly over the time in which the contributions were invested, the benefits will be relatively low. The pension benefits under such a plan are not a set amount and are uncertain (\u201cundefined\u201d). A defined benefit pension plan is, in many ways, opposite of a defined contribution pension plan.\n13. In a defined benefit pension plan, the employer\u2019s contributions are not set and are uncertain (\u201cundefined\u201d). However, the pension benefits are certain and set (\u201cdefined\u201d). Accordingly, it does not matter how well or how poorly the market does, a defined pension plan guarantees a pensioner a sum certain in accordance with that pension plan.\n14. In a defined benefit plan, the risk of the market doing well or poorly is borne by the employer. For example, when the market is doing well, the employer may not have to make any contributions at all to fund the promised pension benefits. However, when the market is doing poorly, the employer may have to make contributions that are far in excess of what the employees are required to contribute to fund the promised pension benefits. Either way, it is the employer\u2019s responsibility and obligation to ensure that the pension plan is funded sufficiently to ensure that retirees receive their specified, defined, set benefits upon retirement.\n15. Accordingly, as may be seen, in a defined benefit plan, the amount of contributions that employers are required to make at any given time can vary dramatically. However, the amount of benefits that a pensioner is guaranteed to receive is fixed and certain, pursuant to the terms of the pension plan.\n16. Since, under a defined benefit pension, the employer does not contribute a defined and certain amount at regular intervals, the amount of the contributions would have to be estimated based upon certain assumptions. Regardless of assumptions used, the amount of contributions, at any point in time, may have no bearing to the amount of benefits. Ultimately, the pension benefits must be funded but the pattern of contributions to fund the pension benefits can vary immensely.\n(Written Submissions of the Complainant regarding the Complainant\u2019s Pension, July 31, 2013, at paras. 12-16)\n[11] The Respondent is in agreement with this general explanation (Written Submissions of the Respondent Pension Remedy, September 27, 2013, at para. 23).\n[12] As mentioned in the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling, the Tribunal does not have expertise in interpreting and calculating pensions. It crafted the original pension remedy based on the submissions of the parties and evidence before it at the time. Only well after the original remedy did the parties provide actuarial evidence and evidence pertaining to the workings of the pension plan. In retrospect, given the pension is a defined benefit, it would have been much easier for the Tribunal to order that the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits be restored at a rate of 50% for the period after layoff, minus her contributions, as the Respondent has previously indicated (Written Submissions of the Respondent Pension Remedy, September 27, 2013, at para. 27). However, and again as stated in the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling, this is not a question of revisiting the Tribunal\u2019s pension order, but ensuring it is implemented properly and that a victim of discrimination receives the full amount that is due to her.\nIII. Calculation of the pension remedy for the period after layoff [13] While the parties have interpreted the Tribunal\u2019s order differently, fortunately, when the considerations above are taken into account, both parties\u2019 actuarial reports arrive at the same amount for the lost pension post layoff.\n[14] At Appendix D of the Respondent\u2019s actuarial report submitted on September 27, 2013, it calculates 50% of the Complainant\u2019s pension benefit for the period following layoff and reduces the benefit for the value of what the Complainant\u2019s contributions would have been during that time. The Respondent calculates the lump sum value of the Complainant\u2019s pension following layoff, at 50% and minus her contributions, to be $98,863.81.\n[15] Similarly, at Appendix 1 of the Complainant\u2019s actuarial report submitted on October 18, 2013, the actuary calculates the \u201cMissing Employer Contributions (normal cost plus special payments plus interest)\u201d for the period following layoff and concludes that the Respondent\u2019s contributions would have been $98,863.81.\n[16] Both parties have arrived at the same figure of $98,863.81, whether the calculation is based on 50% of the employer contributions or 50% of the pension benefit, less the Complainant\u2019s contributions, for the period following layoff. Again, this is due to the fact that the applicable pension plan is a defined benefit as opposed to a defined contribution plan.\nIV. Respondent\u2019s submissions for the exclusion of special contributions and interest [17] The Respondent submits that special contributions and interest should not be taken into account in implementing the pension remedy ordered by the Tribunal.\n[18] According to the Respondent, the Tribunal ordered payment of contributions for the period following layoff; and, theoretically, the special contributions attributable to the Complainant do not concern the period following layoff, they concern the period before layoff. In other words, the special contributions arising after the layoff are not \u201cfor the period following layoff\u201d they are \u201cfor the period before the layoff\u201d because they fund, in part, the benefit earned through service before the layoff. In the Respondent\u2019s view, for the special contributions required in the period following layoff to be theoretically applicable to the Complainant, the Tribunal would have had to direct that the benefits accrue past the date of layoff; however, the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling confirms the opposite order was given. If special contributions for the period following layoff were awarded to the Complainant, the Respondent says this would result in double recovery for the pre-layoff period because the Complainant would be receiving both the benefit and the contributions which fund that benefit for the same pre-layoff period.\n[19] In the alternative, if special contributions were to be awarded, the Respondent estimates the Complainant\u2019s portion of the \u201cactual special contributions\u201d required \u201cduring\u201d the period following layoff to be $8,501.00, 50% of that amount being $4,251.00.\n[20] The Respondent\u2019s argument for the exclusion of special contributions is a narrow and strict interpretation of the distinction between benefits and contributions, and the wording of the Tribunal\u2019s order. Given the pension is a defined benefit, the exclusion of special contributions, or only including the \u201cactual special contributions\u201d required \u201cduring\u201d the period following layoff, would stray far from the intent of the Tribunal\u2019s order of awarding the Complainant comparable retirement benefits to those she would have received from the Respondent had the Complainant remained in its employ. There is no double recovery because, again, the pension is a defined benefit. Regardless of whether the special contributions were paid pre or post layoff, the pension benefit remains the same. Furthermore, to award only the special contributions \u201cactually paid\u201d after the layoff would not come close to remedying the Complainant\u2019s actual loss and, again, is irrelevant to the defined benefit scheme of the applicable pension.\n[21] The Respondent also submits the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to order interest on employer contributions. It says the Pension Remedy Clarification Ruling confirmed the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay pension benefits for the period before the layoff and 50% of employer contributions for the period after layoff. The Tribunal never ordered the Respondent to pay interest on either the benefits or the contributions. In fact, the Respondent points to the Outstanding Remedies Ruling where, in awarding interest on other compensatory remedies, the Tribunal declined to award interest on the pension because \u201cthe remedies related to the Complainant\u2019s pension [...] were not awards of compensation, as they were made to restore a privilege pursuant to section 53(2)(b) of the Act\u201d (at para. 21). According to the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is in line with section 53(4) of the Act, which gives the Tribunal the authority to include an award of interest on orders to pay compensation only. As the pension remedy is not an award of compensation, there is no authority to include an award of interest. In the Respondent\u2019s view, that decision stands and cannot now be changed except through judicial review.\n[22] In the alternative, the Respondent submits that if the Tribunal concludes it can award interest on the pension remedy, the Tribunal should not grant the interest claimed because it is well beyond the rate of interest normally awarded by the Tribunal and there are no circumstances before the Tribunal justifying a departure from that normal practice (see Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)). In the further alternative, the Respondent claims the Complainant\u2019s actuarial report does not properly calculate interest on normal or special contributions because it does not use the appropriate rate of return.\n[23] Including interest on normal and special contributions in the pension remedy is in no way connected to the Tribunal\u2019s ability to award interest under section 53(4) of the Act or Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). Rather, the interest or the rate of return on the investment of normal and special contributions, is a function of and included within the applicable pension plan. Again, this is because the pension is a defined benefit as opposed to a defined contribution plan. As a defined benefit, the starting point in calculating the present remedy is what the Complainant\u2019s pension benefit would have been had she remained in the employ of the Respondent. Subtract what the Complainant\u2019s contributions would have been and you are left with what the employer must contribute to provide for the defined benefit. While the wording and interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s order has led both parties to calculate the remedy differently, ultimately, they have arrived at the same amount: $98,863.81. Any difference in the applicable rate of return on normal and special contributions does not change this end result.\n[24] Whether you describe the employer\u2019s contributions to the pension plan as normal or special contributions; and, whatever method you use to account for the rate of return on those contributions; at the end of the day, the Respondent must provide a defined benefit to its employees. While the Respondent\u2019s contributions vary, the benefit remains the same. Therefore, to exclude special contributions and interest from the present remedy, and only award normal contributions as the Respondent advocates, would not come anywhere close to ensuring \u201cthe Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS [...] had the Complainant remained in its employ\u201d (Outstanding Remedies Ruling at para. 22).\nV. Implementation of the pension remedy [25] For the period up to the Complainant\u2019s layoff, the parties have confirmed that the Complainant\u2019s full pension benefits are available to her; and, that those benefits can be provided under the applicable pension plan.\n[26] For the period after layoff, the Respondent says the applicable employer contributions cannot be paid directly into the pension plan as contemplated by the Tribunal\u2019s order. According to the Respondent, doing so would be a violation of the Income Tax Act and could have serious consequences to the pension plan and its members. The Respondent proposes providing the amount as a lump-sum payment, which the Complainant can then deposit into an RRSP.\n[27] Alternatively, the Complainant proposes that the Respondent could purchase an annuity that pays the Complainant a guaranteed defined benefit of $405.44 per month. The Respondent is not in favour of this option because of the extra cost that it would have to incur to implement it, which it estimates to be between $24,000.00 and $60,000.00. According to the Respondent, imposing such an option, when a more cost effective option is available to provide the same benefit, is not consistent with the Outstanding Remedies Ruling, stating that the pension remedy is not an attempt to punish the Respondent.\n[28] The Complainant\u2019s RRSP deduction limit as of 2013 is not sufficient to cover $98,863.81 (Tab 5 of the Expert Report of Louis Ellement, July 29, 2013). Unless the Complainant\u2019s 2014 RRSP deduction limit is sufficient to cover the amount, the pension remedy will have to be provided to the Complainant as an annuity. The added cost of paying for the annuity is not a punishment against the Respondent. It is the cost of implementing the Tribunal\u2019s order, which the Respondent says it cannot implement through its own pension plan. The Tribunal\u2019s order provided:\nIf it is not possible to restore the previous pension plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost pension benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS.\n(Outstanding Remedies Ruling at para. 22)\n[29] Also, the amount due to the Complainant will have to be adjusted to the date the terms of the order are implemented.\nVI. Order [30] Therefore. pursuant to the reasons above, the Tribunal\u2019s final ruling and order with regard to the Complainant\u2019s pension remedy is as follows:\n(1) The Respondent shall restore the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff and pay those benefits to her through the pension plan.\n(2) For the period from her layoff to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to provide the Complainant half (50%) of what her pension benefits would have been had she not been laid-off, minus what her contributions would have been ($98,863.81 adjusted to the date of implementation).\n(3) If the Complainant has sufficient room in her RRSP for the total amount awarded in Order (2) above, then the amount will be provided to her as a lump-sum payment.\n(4) If the Complainant does not have sufficient room in her RRSP for the total amount awarded in Order (2) above, then the Respondent shall purchase an annuity that pays the Complainant a guaranteed defined benefit equivalent to half (50%) of what her pension benefits would have been had she not been laid-off, minus what her contributions would have been ($405.44 per month adjusted to the date of implementation).\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 10, 2014\n",

Complaints & Motion [1] An inquiry by this Tribunal was requested by the Commission as a result of two complaints alleging discrimination and discriminatory practices contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \"CHRA\").\n[2] The first complaint was filed on January 19, 2005 pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. The thrust of the complaint is discrimination against the Complainant personally and discriminatory policies, based on age, in various job selection processes with the Respondent.\n[3] The first complaint was dismissed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 44(3) of the CHRA. The Complainant applied for judicial review, and on September 27, 2010 the Federal Court allowed the application of the Complainant. As a result of the Federal Court decision, the Commission conducted a second investigation into the allegations, and on August 25, 2011, it referred the matter to the Tribunal.\n[4] A second complaint was filed by the Complainant on July 9, 2008, pursuant to section 7 of the CHRA, alleging discrimination between 2001 and 2008 due to age and disability, again in various job selection processes with the Respondent. Investigation into the second complaint found that it involved substantially the same issues as the first complaint, and on December 19, 2011, the Commission decided that an inquiry by the Tribunal was warranted.\n[5] On June 27, 2012, the Tribunal granted the Complainant's request for both complaints to be heard together.\n[6] On January 31, 2013, the Respondent filed a Statement of Particulars, but did not produce any documents listed in its List of Documents.\n[7] Disclosure of the Respondent's first batch of documents was by way of a DVD produced on March 12, 2013. The Complainant states that particulars of disclosure, including the names of the candidates in the selection processes, were redacted. Subsequent disclosure on May 1, 2013 contained the balance of the documents. However, the Complainant states that portions of that material were also redacted.\n[8] On August 13, 2013, a case conference was held, during which discussions of the redactions took place. It was agreed that the Respondent was to provide an amended List of Documents addressing the issue of the redactions, and further, was to provide a List of Documents which was more specific and would assist the Complainant's counsel in identifying and organizing the documents.\n[9] On September 9, 2013, the Respondent provided the Complainant's counsel with an amended List of Documents.\n[10] On October 18, 2013, the Complainant filed a notice of motion making a request pursuant to Rule 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) for:\n(1) An order that the Respondent disclose redacted portions of all arguably relevant documents it has produced to the Complainant, in accordance with its obligations under Rule 6 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure;\n(2) In the alternative to (1), an order fixing a date for an in camera hearing, where Complainant's counsel can examine the unredacted documents and the Member can determine their relevance, after hearing from the parties;\n(3) An order that the Respondent disclose Corporate Administrative Systems (\"CAS\") reports for persons appointed to the positions of Custom Inspector and Border Services Officer in Pacific Region (British Columbia and Yukon), for the period between 2001 and 2009, including the date of their hire and age (or birth date);\n(4) An order that the Respondent disclose letters to students notifying them of their appointments to Customs Inspector or Border Services Officer positions in Pacific Region (British Columbia and Yukon), pursuant to the CBSA policy \"Student Bridging - Appointment Without Competition\", in addition to any documents used by CBSA to assess their qualifications for indeterminate employment;\n(5) That the Tribunal direct the Respondent to explain the basis upon which it claims public interest privilege for each document, or portions of which, it claims is covered by this privilege;\n(6) That the Tribunal fix a deadline of November 8, 2013, for the Complainant to file a written reply to the Respondent's response to the present motion;\n(7) That the Tribunal grant an oral hearing of the present motion.\n[11] In support of the motion, the Complainant's counsel filed the Affidavit of Mally McGregor, dated October 17, 2013.\n[12] The Respondent filed a response on November 8, 2013 opposing the relief sought and seeking dismissal of the Complainant's motion. The Respondent also filed the Affidavit of Sheila Anderson, affirmed November 7, 2013.\nII. Issue 1: Redacted documents [13] The position of the Complainant is it requires the names of the job candidates in the relevant job processes in order to identify and organize documents related to the Complainant\u2019s allegations. The Respondent had proposed and prepared a candidate list where each candidate was assigned a \"candidate number\". Each candidate was assigned one number, which did not change if there were multiple applications. According to the Respondent, there are 201 names on the list of candidates. The submission would be that the Complainant would be able to identify the candidate name by the corresponding number, which had been entered on the documents in question.\n[14] The Complainant's counsel wrote a letter dated January 13, 2014 indicating that the proposed solution was not satisfactory, and argued as follows:\nFirst of all, given that the normal rule would be to disclose everything that is relevant as a matter of principle these items ought to be disclosed. If they were disclosed pursuant to the normal rule, then we would have relevant documents which included the names and which would make it far easier to prepare for the case. Without these names on the documents in question, a laborious and time-consuming process will be necessary in order to correlate each document to a name. Given that the normal rule at the production stage is disclosure, we should not be put through that prejudice when there is clearly no evidence of harm at this point.\nSecond, the Complainant already has in his possession many of these documents which include these persons' names. If the Respondent is truly concerned about the confidentiality of that information, then the issue will have to be addressed in a confidentiality order from the Tribunal in any event. Otherwise, the Complainant may very well use the documents that he has with these names and then we will end up with some documents with names and some without. This makes little sense going forward.\nFinally, in some cases, the actual name may be relevant. For example, Mr. Hughes may have some very specific concerns about how a particular candidate was treated based upon his knowledge of that person's name. Moreover, we may wish to put questions in cross-examination to other witnesses which relate to the names of these candidates. It is inevitable that the names would therefore be disclosed in this proceeding and therefore that confidentiality order will be needed in any event.\n[15] The Tribunal also heard brief oral arguments from the parties on the issue of redactions on a conference call on February 20, 2014. In particular, the Tribunal requested that, in addition to the authorities already submitted, the parties address the issues raised in Grand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v. Attorney General of Canada, 2013 CHRT 3; and, Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2013 CHRT 12 [Emmett].\n[16] At the case conference on February 20, 2014, oral submissions were made addressing the issue of redactions and the variety of orders the Tribunal could make. The Respondent and Complainant agreed that the candidate names not be redacted subject to an appropriate order from the Tribunal as to confidentiality, similar to that found in Emmett at paragraphs 71-74. The balance of the personal information would remain redacted.\n[17] Inasmuch as the parties have agreed on this issue, I order:\nThe parties and their representatives to keep confidential all information regarding the identity of job candidates involved in the selection processes at issue in these complaints.\n[18] As a further precaution, I would note that during the hearing process, although the names of the job candidates would be open, the Tribunal will ensure whenever possible that their names not appear in a decision.\nIII. Issues 2, 6 & 7: Request for in camera hearing; to fix a deadline for filing a reply to the motion; and, to have an oral hearing on the motion [19] In light of the proceedings and ruling on issue 1 above, it is unnecessary to address issues 2, 6 and 7 of the Complainant\u2019s motion. If such is not the case, the Complainant is to notify the Registry within seven days and request further clarification. The Respondent shall have five days to respond to the Complainant's request.\nIV. Issues 3 & 4: Disclosure of Corporate Administrative Systems (\u201cCAS\u201d) reports and student appointment letters [20] In the Complainant's motion, he made a request for CAS reports and student appointment letters. The Complainant argues these reports and letters are relevant to the section 10 aspect of the first complaint and provide age-related circumstantial evidence from which the Tribunal may draw inferences of discriminatory conduct and practices.\n[21] The Respondent says the motion for disclosure was the first notice it received that the Complainant was seeking production of these documents. While it has begun the process of marshalling the required documents, it says producing these documents will take some time. Before an order is made, it asks that it be given an opportunity to review the requested documents, obtain the advice of counsel, and then consider and develop a position as to the relevance of these documents and whether any privilege might apply.\n[22] The Complainant confirmed at a case conference on February 20, 2014 that the request for these documents remains a live issue, but that they may not be required prior to the hearing dates on May 21-23, 2014.\n[23] Therefore, considering the Respondent has been on notice of the Complainant\u2019s request for these documents since October 18, 2013, it should be able to provide a response thereto by May 1, 2014. If the Complainant wishes to provide a reply, he can do so by May 12, 2014. If need be, the Tribunal will deal with arguments on this point at the commencement of the hearing on May 21, 2014.\nV. Issue 5: Public interest privilege [24] At the February 20, 2014 conference call, the Complainant confirmed that this aspect of the motion has been complied with. Therefore, no ruling is necessary.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Introduction [1] The Complainant, Pierre Croteau started working for Canadian National Railway Company (\u201cCN\u201d) in 1992. He progressed his way to the position of train conductor without incident. Unfortunately, as will be discussed in these Reasons for Decision, things changed for the worse in the Fall of 2003. Due to injuries initially and the onslaught of a mental disability, Mr. Croteau has not worked in his pre-injury\/illness conductor\u2019s job since 2004. Indeed, he has been on unpaid leave since May of 2008.\n[2] The relationship between employer and employee quickly deteriorated beginning in 2003-04. The Complainant filed an internal harassment complaint against two supervisors, along with grievances, a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and \u201cduty of fair representation\u201d Canada Labour Code complaints against his union. Mr. Croteau also filed a complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) alleging discrimination and harassment contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d) based on the prohibited ground of disability.[1]\nII. Background [3] The Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal on December 15, 2010. Some time prior to the commencement of the hearing on January 9, 2012, a motion to limit the scope of the inquiry was filed by CN. Other than on this motion and a subsequent motion for non-suit, the Commission did not participate in the hearing. With regard to the motion to limit the scope of the inquiry, I heard the motion and dismissed it without prejudice to the Respondent\u2019s renewing it at the conclusion of the Complainant\u2019s case. Mediation also took place before and during the hearing.\n[4] This Complaint involved 11 allegations of harassments from 2003-07 and a continuing allegation of failure to accommodate from 2004 to the end of the hearing in 2013. The hearing lasted 36 days, including a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of the Complainant\u2019s case. There were many breaks during the hearing to accommodate the panic attacks experienced by the Complainant. This was manageable and the Complainant was able to return. There is a mountain of viva voce and documentary evidence (10 binders of exhibits) in which to analyze and consider too. And of course, there are final submissions and books of authorities filed as well.\n[5] From the parties\u2019 and the witnesses\u2019 points of view, memories fade and giving testimony becomes more difficult \u2013 some events going back to 2003. From the Tribunal\u2019s perspective, it made it more challenging to adjudicate.\nIII. Use of Initials [6] Because of the allegations made against certain individuals and\/or findings I have made, I have chosen to use initials or letters to identify them rather than their full name, in order to protect privacy interests.\nIV. The Complaint [7] Mr. Croteau claims that his rights under sections 7 and 14 of the CHRA were violated by CN based on the ground of disability. Section 7 reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\nbased on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSubsection 14(1) reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice,\n\u2026 \u2026\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[8] The scope of the Complaint, as defined by the Statement of Particulars and further stipulations by the Complainant, through his counsel\u2019s final submissions, is as follows:\nThe essential substance of Mr. Croteau\u2019s case includes allegations of a continuous pattern of harassment and behaviour by the Respondent that started in 2003 and continues to the present. It is Mr. Croteau\u2019s contention that he was singled out and harassed, his character falsely impugned and his and his family\u2019s privacy invaded in violation of his privacy rights by CN because of the fact that he needed medical leave for a personal medical issue in 2003 and also due to two workplace injuries in 2004. The first injury affected his shoulder and the second his knee. Mr. Croteau further contends that the cumulative effect of the actions of CN caused him to develop anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder for which it has failed to meaningfully comply with its duty to accommodate, which has exacerbated and prolonged his conditions.\nV. Context to this Case: The Railway Business [9] I wish at the beginning of my Reasons to comment on the unique context of the Respondent\u2019s business \u2013 freight rail. This is a dangerous business when things go wrong. CN\u2019s witnesses and the exhibits filed speak to the one issue that looms above all others at CN \u2013 SAFETY, of its employees and the public. Derrick Colasimone, the current General Manager, Michigan Division, which includes Sarnia and Windsor, who is very experienced in the railway business, including having been a conductor and locomotive engineer, was eloquent in expressing the nature of the railway business, the importance of safety and the inherent dangers of operating a railway business. This is a highly safety-conscious, regulated industry, for obvious reasons. As he put it: \u201cSafety enables performance\u201d is our motto. If you run a safe railway, everything else is gravy\u2026It\u2019s a very unforgiving industry. You don\u2019t get hurt \u2018a bit\u2019.\u201d As well, the freight railways often transport dangerous goods. Every rule in the Railway Rules Book is there for a reason, many of which were promulgated on spilled blood (lessons learned from fatal accidents).\n[10] I heard evidence about the extensive regulation of the railway industry and oversight by Transport Canada. And of course, there are tremendous internal rules and monitoring by CN, including regular efficiency testing. Conductors (who are responsible for the overall operation of the train) and engineers (who are responsible for the operation of the locomotive) are deemed safety-critical positions (\u201cSC\u201d), requiring the highest fitness for duty requirements and review. There are other SC positions such as trainmasters, yardmasters, etc. Below those positions in terms of safety designation are safety-sensitive (\u201cSS\u201d) jobs (e.g., rover). And below those are positions that are non-SC\/SS and which have no safety designation, such as clerical positions.\n[11] I also heard evidence about the rules concerning the reporting of injuries and accidents by train crew. More than one CN witness testified about the fact that \u201cno injury is too small\u201d to be reported (which is mandatory, not optional) and investigated. As Mr. Colasimone pointed out, any safety rule violation has the potential to be a fatality. He used the example of \u201cdetraining\u201d. The train crew member could fall under the train.\n[12] I say the foregoing because, as will be seen in these Reasons for Decision, and contrary to the Complainant\u2019s submission, \u201cthe safety issue\u201d was no \u201cred herring, smoke screen or justification to explain harassment and inability to accommodate\u201d the Complainant on the part of CN. While there is not one CHRA for one workplace and another for the rail industry, context is important. As well, \u201csafety\u201d is specifically identified as a factor to consider in assessing whether proposed accommodation would impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d within the meaning of section 15(2) of the CHRA. It was quite clear to me after this long hearing that \u201csafety\u201d is an overarching and defining consideration to CN, the railway industry in general and to the government who regulates it.\nVI. Motion for Non-Suit A. The Election Issue [13] At the conclusion of the Complainant\u2019s case, counsel for the Respondent indicated he intended to bring a motion for non-suit. I received written submissions about the issue of whether CN would be put to an election not to call evidence if the motion was heard. I ruled that it would not be required to make an election.\n[14] Regarding the issue of the election in a non-suit motion, I have a few comments which I first made in my Reasons for Decision in Fahmy v. GTAA, 2008 CHRT 12. First, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to decide whether an election is required and to hear a motion for non-suit: Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785. Hughes J. pointed out at para. 22 that the matter of requiring an election is one of procedure, not of law or natural justice: \u201cTribunals should be allowed reasonable latitude when it comes to procedure\u2026\u201d Second, there are thoughtful decisions at the Tribunal-level both requiring and not requiring an election to be made prior to hearing a motion for non-suit. In both decisions, the respective members agreed that the question should be decided in the circumstances of each case: Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), [1999] C.H.R.D. No. 5 and Filgueira, 2005 CHRT 30.[2] In the civil context, most jurisdictions in Canada do not require an election.[3] While there are sound legal and policy reasons for both determinations, I am more persuaded by the arguments in favour of not requiring an election, for the reasons stated in Fahmy.\nB. The Law With Respect to Non-Suit Motions [15] While a defendant\u2019s resources and the public purse should not be burdened to pay for frivolous or vexatious claims, courts have set a high bar for non-suit motions to succeed. This is done through various means: the prima facie test requiring a presumption that a plaintiff\u2019s evidence be believed; forcing an election to be made by a defendant (in those jurisdictions that require it); and the awarding of costs against an unsuccessful moving party. The courts have clearly determined that it should not be too easy for a defendant to knock out a lawsuit on a motion for non-suit. Perhaps there is a fear of delay to the process if unsuccessful non-suit motions became the norm. On the other hand, as Adjudicator Wildsmith stated in Gerin v. IMP Group Ltd., [1994] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4, at para. 21: \u201c\u2026I note that the motion for non-suit is a potential safeguard against abuse.\u201d\ni. The Prima Facie Case in Non-Suit Motions [16] The test for the moving party is as set out by Hughes J. in Filgueira, at paras. 24-25:\nA motion for non-suit requires that the Court or Tribunal consider the evidence from the point of view that, if believed, does it establish at least a prima facie case. As stated by McIntyre J. of the Supreme Court of Canada in \"O'Malley\" (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536) at paragraph 28:\n\"The complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\"\nThe Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in J.W. Cowie Engineering Ltd. V. Allen (1982), 26 C.P.C. 241 especially at paragraphs 12 to 17 reviewed the nature and level of evidence sufficient to satisfy the \"prima facie\" test. Jones JA for the majority at paragraph 14 gave a succinct statement of the law:\n\"It is clear that the mere fact there is some evidence, however weak, does not prevent a trial Judge from granting the motion.\"\n[17] An unsuccessful motion for non-suit does not mean that the plaintiff will win the day at the conclusion of the hearing proper. It simply means this high bar for a preliminary dismissal has not been reached.\n[18] It is important to note the different analytical approaches used in the non-suit and \u201con the merits\u201d determination. As Member Groarke noted in another decision in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 32, at para. 12, in a motion for non-suit there is a different kind of analysis undertaken than that carried out \u201con the merits\u201d at the end of a hearing. The courts have been quite clear that a trial judge or adjudicator should not do the regular weighing and assessing of evidence, including credibility, that is done in the normal course at the conclusion of a trial or hearing. The trier at the non-suit is measuring the case from a prima facie perspective \u2013 very superficially, \u201cat first glance or sight\u201d as the Latin term prima facie literally means. No in-depth perusing of the evidence or assessment of the credibility of the witnesses is done. Indeed, the bar is cast so high that it is only if the complainant\u2019s case is totally unbelievable or far-fetched that it should be disbelieved.[4]\n[19] The role of the trial judge in a motion for non-suit was canvassed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in FL Receivables Trust 2002-A (Administrator of) v. Cobrand Foods Ltd. (2007), 85 O.R.(3d) 561. The Court held that the trial judge applied the wrong test in granting the non-suit motion \u201c\u2026by going beyond his limited mandate\u2026\u201d on the non-suit motion. Laskin J.A. wrote at paras. 35-36:\nOn a non-suit motion, the trial judge undertakes a limited inquiry. Two relevant principles that guide this inquiry are these. First, if a plaintiff puts forward some evidence on all elements of its claim, the judge must dismiss the motion. Second, in assessing whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the judge must assume the evidence to be true and must assign \u201cthe most favourable meaning\u201d to evidence capable of giving rise to competing inferences\u2026\nIn other words, on a non-suit motion the trial judge should not determine whether the competing inferences available to the defendant on the evidence rebut the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case. The trial judge should make that determination at the end of the trial, not on the non-suit motion. See John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman & Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada, 1999) at 139.\nI assume that the Court is not suggesting the \u201cassumption of truth\u201d of the evidence includes evidence that is unbelievable in the extreme, or simply preposterous.\n[20] I also wish to point out that there is some confusion in the case law about whether the test requires that the evidence would or could trigger liability. Courts and tribunals have taken both approaches and some avoid the issue altogether. In Filgueira, supra, Hughes J. quotes with approval at para. 6 the following passage in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant: \u201cThe judge must conclude whether a reasonable trier of fact could find in the plaintiff\u2019s favour if it believed the evidence given in the trial up to that point.\u201d [My italics.] It appears clear that the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the \u201ccould\u201d approach, at least in the civil and criminal context, which I have followed here.[5] I see no reason to deviate from it in proceedings before the Tribunal.\nC. Reasons for Ruling on the Motion for Non-Suit [21] On July 19-20, 2012, I heard argument on the motion for non-suit. On October 9, 2012, I advised the parties of the following ruling:\nThe motion for non-suit is granted in part; specifically, with respect to allegations #9 (notebook during rules refresher class) and #10 (non-disclosure of surveillance tapes). The motion was disposed of in accordance with the \u201climited inquiry\u201d paradigm of a non-suit motion: i.e., the trier must assign the most favourable meaning to the Complainant's evidence and not apply the usual assessing and weighing of evidence and credibility that a trier does in the normal course after the close of a hearing. CN may, but is not required to, adduce evidence with respect to the remaining harassment and \u201cfailure to accommodate\u201d allegations\u2026\n[22] One will see from my ruling above that I essentially gave no reasons. This addresses the commentary in the various cases dealing with elections and non-suits concerning whether reasons should be given, and when and to what extent, where an election is not required. Adjudicator Slotnick in Potocnik v. Thunder Bay (City), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 16, at para. 16 cites with approval the approach taken in Tomen v. O.T.F. (No. 3), (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/223 not to give reasons. At para. 10, Adjudicator Slotnick states:\n\u2026where an adjudicator does not require an election and ends up rejecting the motion to dismiss the complaint, the proper procedure is to give no reasons. Otherwise, the party that is about to present its evidence would have the advantage of the adjudicator\u2019s thoughts on the evidence of the other party.\nIn Filgueira, supra, Member Groarke refers to a respondent \u201ctaking the temperature\u201d of the Tribunal. I agree that a respondent should not get an advantage from bringing an unsuccessful non-suit motion by getting to \u201ctest the waters\u201d of a tribunal. The adjudicator should not give reasons, other than to say whether a prima facie test has been made out. That is the approach I have taken in this case.\ni. Particular Allegations and Facts in this Non-Suit Motion [23] I now turn to apply the law on non-suits to the allegations and facts in issue here. CN argues that there is no evidence which, if believed, is capable of supporting a finding of liability against it on either sections 7 or 14 of the CHRA based on the prohibited ground of disability. The allegations are based on the Complainant\u2019s \u201csubjective beliefs\u201d alone. The Complainant, of course, argues the opposite.\n[24] I have carefully examined the evidence, both viva voce and documentary, presented by the Complainant and his witnesses. As I indicated in my ruling, I was satisfied evidence existed which, if believed, could trigger liability on nine of the eleven allegations of harassment and the failure to accommodate allegation.[6] For two of the eleven harassment allegations, I found otherwise and dismissed them.\n[25] I have done this analysis on the motion for non-suit following these legal parametres: giving the most favourable interpretation to the Complainant\u2019s evidence and that of his witnesses; and not taking into account questions of credibility. I will focus on the two allegations that I non-suited.\n[26] \u201cI am gay\u201d notation in Rules exercise book: Mr. Croteau alleges that Don Schenk, a supervisor, wrote the phrase \u201cI am gay\u201d in the Complainant\u2019s exercise book during a Rules Refresher class on May 31, 2007. There is no dispute that the words were in the book. Terrence Gallagher, Senior Human Resources Manager, investigated and acknowledged the incident to the Complainant in his letter of June 12, 2007. He wrote that the books are normally \u201cre-used from class to class\u201d and inspected before redistribution. \u201cIn this case, unfortunately, the writing in the booklet went unnoticed. And we are unable to determine who had written the comment in the booklet,\u201d he penned. \u201cI was glad to get it [the letter],\u201d said Mr. Croteau during his testimony. Mr. Gallagher also called him. CN would take steps to make sure that such an incident would never happen again.\n[27] Mr. Croteau believes unequivocally that Mr. Schenk wrote the words. Mr. Croteau testified that there were six other employees in the class, but didn\u2019t know them. He had reviewed the book (60-80 pages) prior to the class and didn\u2019t see those words in it. During the break, he went to the washroom. When he returned, only Mr. Schenk was present. He then noticed the words in question. He concedes that he does not know if anyone else had come into the room when he was absent. He became visibly upset and was having a panic attack. Mr. Schenk noticed and asked him what was wrong. The Complainant refused to give him the book to inspect and repeated: \u201cI am not gay and I am not quitting.\u201d\n[28] At the hearing, he testified that even though he was experiencing a \u201csevere\u201d panic attack (at a 9.5-10 level according to Mr. Croteau) during the incident, he nevertheless had a clear recollection of the event and was sure Mr. Schenk had written it. He even suggested a connection between the incident and his perceived \u201ccut in pay\u201d (i.e., that he should be paid a full day\u2019s wages even if he worked for less than that). The Complainant acknowledged later that Mr Schenk was not responsible for \u201cpay issues\u201d nor involved in his return-to-work (\u201cRTW\u201d) regime, other than teaching this Rules class.\n[29] Mr. Croteau also testified that because his brother passed away from AIDS 12 years before the incident, that Sarnia is a small town and everyone was aware of the cause of his brother\u2019s death, that he drove a red VW Beetle car which he described as \u201cnot a manly car\u201d, that he was \u201coff and on\u201d work due to his personal medical issue, he thought that people \u201cassumed he was gay.\u201d He conceded that no one at CN ever made a comment, disparaging or otherwise, about these topics, other than the book incident in May 2007.\n[30] CN\u2019s counsel argues that this harassment allegation is \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cbizarre\u201d, based solely on the Complainant\u2019s subjective belief. In the alternative, even if I were to find that Mr. Schenk had written those words, Mr. Schenk is not a named respondent and CN can avail itself of the section 65 (vicarious liability) provision of the CHRA.\n[31] Complainant counsel responds that CN has not met the high threshhold for successfully non-suiting this allegation and is conflating the test for non-suit with the usual post-hearing test of evaluating evidence and credibility. The Complainant has met the low hurdle of establishing a prima facie basis for this allegation.\n[32] With respect to the above evidence and argument, I find that the Complainant has not established a prima facie basis for this allegation. The allegation is based solely on the Complainant\u2019s perception and belief, without any evidence even tending to suggest that Mr. Schenk wrote those words.\n[33] In the alternative, had I not dismissed this allegation at the non-suit stage, I would have done so on a balance of probabilities at the conclusion of the hearing. There was no adversarial relationship or history between the Complainant and Mr. Schenk. He had no motive to do this. Based on the evidence, Mr. Schenk was surprised at Mr. Croteau\u2019s discombobulation and inquired what was wrong and wanted to see the book. Mr. Schenk\u2019s Memo to File, written a few days after the incident, showed that he was both surprised and concerned with what had happened and the impact on Mr. Croteau. After the class, he even asked the Complainant if he wanted him (Mr. Schenk) to call him a taxi to go home. I also note that it would have been very risky for him to have written those words, given that Mr. Croteau or the other employees could have walked in at any time during the break.\n[34] In addition, there can be no CHRA liability here because even if Mr. Schenk did write those words in the book, the evidence establishes that CN pursuant to subsection 65(2) of the CHRA: did not \u201cconsent\u201d to the act; \u201cexercised all due diligence to prevent the act\u201d; and subsequently exercised all due diligence \u201cto mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\u201d CN has extensive anti-discrimination\/harassment policies. Furthermore, it would go through the Rules books before they were re-used in another class. Finally, CN looked into the matter when it became aware of what had happened. Indeed, Mr. Croteau testified that he appreciated Mr. Gallagher\u2019s investigation (unsolicited by Mr. Croteau) and response (phone call and letter).\n[35] Non-disclosure of surveillance tapes: Mr. Croteau alleges that CN failed to provide him with full disclosure with regard to the private investigation surveillance tapes that he had requested. The evidence during the Complainant\u2019s case was that CN showed him the March 2004 surveillance tapes during the investigation meeting with Trainmaster Kevin Mau on May 11, 2004. CN offered to provide him with a copy of the tapes, but Mr. Croteau would have to pay a \u201ccopy fee\u201d to the third party production company. CN was not profitting from copies being made. Mr. Croteau stated that CN was offering to sell the tapes to \u201cthird parties\u201d at a profit. The evidence in the Complainant\u2019s case also showed that his wife, who also testified, was told that she could receive a copy of the tapes for a fee. Mr. Croteau testified that he was not willing to pay for the tapes, given his financial situation and \u201cout of principle\u201d. He thought he should have gotten copies for free. He also testified that the \u201csurveillance issues\u201d were part of the \u201cworkplace issues\u201d required to be resolved for his healing in order to RTW. This implies that the copy-fee requirement prevented him from getting the tapes and resolving the \u201csurveillance issues\u201d which in turn prevented him from re-integrating into the workplace. I do not accept this.\n[36] Reviewing the evidence in the Complainant\u2019s case on this allegation under the limited non-suit inquiry and assigning it the most favourable interpretation short of preposterousness or absurdity, I cannot let this allegation continue beyond the non-suit motion stage. I find no nexus or link between the evidence of this allegation to a violation of harassment under section 14 of the CHRA.\nVII. Reasons for Decision on the Merits: Introduction [37] Having dismissed the motion for non-suit on nine of the eleven harassment allegations and the adverse, differential treatment (failure to accommodate) allegation, I asked counsel for the Respondent if he wished to call evidence. Understandably, Mr. McFadden answered \u201cyes\u201d and I proceeded to hear CN\u2019s witnesses and the brief Reply evidence of the Complainant. What follows are my Reasons for dismissing the Complaint on the merits after a full hearing, putting the witnesses and their testimony, the documentary evidence, etc. under the scrutiny that a trier normally does upon completion of the hearing \u2013 i.e., weighing and assessing evidence, including questions of credibility.\nVIII. The Law [38] The initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the CHRA rests with a complainant or the Commission: Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28. Once that is established, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish a justification or explanation for the discriminatory practice or action: Canada (A.G.) v. Lambie, [1996] F.C.J. No. 1695, at para. 16. The respondent\u2019s explanation should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004, at para. 22.\n[39] Also relevant to the instant case is the legal principle that: \u201cIt is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue in order that the complaint may succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors for the employer\u2019s decision\u201d: Morris v. Canada (Armed Forces) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 69.\n[40] The case law recognizes the difficulty of proving allegations of discrimination by direct evidence. Discrimination is frequently practised in a very subtle and subterranean manner. Overt discrimination is rare: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No.1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 5038. Rather, it is the Tribunal\u2019s task to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there is what is described in the Basi case as the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination.\u201d\n[41] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses: Premakumar v. Air Canada (No. 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 81.\nA. Harassment [42] Part of this Complaint involves harassment allegations. Section 14 of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice to \u201charass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d Although \u201charassment\u201d is not defined in the CHRA, the case law of the courts and human rights tribunals have developed an accepted definition of any words or conduct that is unwelcome or ought to be known to be unwelcome (from an objective standard)[7] based on a prohibited ground. While the case law generally requires repetitious or persistent acts, courts and tribunals have also considered a single, serious event as sufficient to constitute \u201charassment\u201d.[8] If the test were merely from the subjective, personal belief of complainants, it would be very difficult for respondents to mount a successful defence.\n[43] Developing a working legal definition of \u201charassment\u201d outside of the sexual harassment sphere is challenging, since the latter iteration of the test developed first. The vast majority of the case law deals with sexual or racial harassment. That said, there is of course a commonality. It is important to recognize when dealing with allegations of \u201cdisability harassment\u201d that it denotes more than just being uncomfortable or offended in the sometimes difficult, sensitive discussions between management and employees. For example, an employer has the right to manage its employees and issues relevant to the operation of its business, such as making, monitoring and enforcing rules in the workplace. The key is to examine whether the conduct has violated the dignity of the employee (e.g., as a result of belittling or degrading treatment by the employer linked to the ground of disability) from an objective perspective such that it has created a hostile or poisoned work environment.[9] In Day v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 43, Member Jensen wrote at para. 184:\nThe jurisprudence on harassment is premised on the idea that the conduct in issue is, by its nature, extraneous or irrelevant to the legitimate operations and business goals of the employer. Derogatory comments or constant and unnecessary questioning about a disability which are humiliating and demeaning are examples of conduct that is extraneous to the legitimate operation of a workplace.\nB. Duty to Accommodate [44] I have considered the following general legal principles and case law (this is not an exhaustive list):\n(1) The duty to accommodate is a multi-party obligation and exercise involving: the employer; the employee; and if applicable, the bargaining agent. I have written in this and other Decisions that the process should resemble a dialogue, not a monologue: Jeffrey v. Dofasco Inc., 2004 HRTO 5, aff\u2019d (2007), 230 OAC 96 (Div. Ct.). The employee may make suggestions as to his\/her preferences, but must accept a reasonable solution (short of perfection) proposed by the employer addressing his\/her needs. The outer limits are that of undue hardship, considering health, safety and cost,[10] or synonymously referred to as \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d: Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970. The duty to accommodate is neither absolute nor unlimited: McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, at para. 38;\n(2) Renaud also states that complainants have a duty to facilitate the accommodation process. In Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment), 2003 FCA 133, the Federal Court of Appeal held that where the employer proposes a reasonable accommodation, the complainant cannot insist on his or her preferred alternative accommodation, even if the alternative would not create undue hardship;\n(3) The goal is to address or accommodate the employee\u2019s needs in order that s\/he is able to do the essential duties of his\/her job. To that end, employers should be \u201cinnovative yet practical\u201d and creative when considering how best this may be accomplished in each case: British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Comm.) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (\u201cMeiorin\u201d), at para. 64;\n(4) An employer does not have a \u201cmake-work\u201d obligation of unproductive work of no value and doesn\u2019t have to change the working conditions in a fundamental way. However, it \u201cdoes have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee\u2019s workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work.\u201d: Hydro-Quebec v. Syndicat des employe-e-s de Techniques Professionnelles et al., 2008 SCC 43, at paras 16-18;\n(5) \u201cFairness in the accommodation process is not\u2026limited to a fair assessment of the complainant\u2019s fitness for duty. Rather, the notion of fairness extends to all facets of the accommodation process\u2026to the point of undue hardship.\u201d See Day v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 43, at para. 68; Meiorin, supra.\nC. The Cruden Case [45] This case is key to the matter before me. In Attorney General of Canada v. Cruden et al., 2013 FC 520 (appeal recently argued), Mr. Justice Zinn reversed a Decision of the Tribunal: Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency and Health Canada, 2011 CHRT 13. Ms. Cruden had filed a complaint against the parties because she was refused a posting to Afghanistan partly due to a medical assessment that determined that, because of her Type I diabetes, she was medically unfit for that posting.\n[46] Although the Tribunal had found that CIDA would have been caused \u201cundue hardship\u201d to accommodate Ms. Cruden\u2019s needs in Afghanistan, it nevertheless upheld her complaints against CIDA and Health Canada \u201cbased on its finding that there were \u201cprocedural shortcomings\u201d in the accommodation process.\u201d In other words, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is a separate procedural component in the duty to accommodate requirement in the CHRA that can be independently breached and attract remedies, \u201ceven when their employer cannot accommodate the disability without undue hardship.\u201d Zinn J. disagreed with the above interpretation of the CHRA and set aside the Tribunal\u2019s Decision.\n[47] As CN\u2019s counsel, Mr. McFadden, correctly points out, there is a divergence in approaches to this issue among the courts (Zinn J.\u2019s Decision in the above case and the Ontario Divisional Court in ADGA Group Consultants Inc. v. Lane et al., 91 O.R. (3d) 649, by human rights tribunals (he cited several Decisions of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, including Lane and one from this Tribunal pre-Cruden - Day v. Canada Post Corp., 2007 CHRT 43); and by labour arbitrators. One approach is to award compensation for \u201cpain and suffering\u201d or general damages for procedural breaches in the duty to accommodate even when substantively-speaking, the respondent was unable to accommodate the needs of the complainant to the point of undue hardship. The other approach, as determined by Zinn J. in Cruden, is to end the inquiry once a determination has been made that the respondent was not able to substantively accommodate the complainant without incurring undue hardship.\n[48] This is a very important judgment, now on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, and having ramifications well beyond the matter before me. It is the present, binding statement of the law and I shall follow and apply it to the instant case.\n[49] Mr. Bolter, the Complainant\u2019s counsel, submits that Cruden stands for, among other things, the proposition that there is no separate procedural right once the Tribunal has found the respondent has met the undue hardship test. However, \u201cprocedure\u201d is still important for a couple reasons. In para. 69, Zinn J. stated:\nIn paragraph 66 of Meiorin [a key Supreme Court of Canada Judgment dealing with the bona fide occupational requirement (\u201cBFOR\u201d)\/duty to accommodate defence]\u2026the Supreme Court is merely stating that a court or tribunal can look at the procedure employed in the accommodation process as a practical tool for deciding whether an employer has established \u2013 on an evidentiary basis \u2013 undue hardship: [he then quotes the passage from the Supreme Court\u2019s Judgment]. [My emphasis.]\nHe then goes on to write at para. 70:\nThat is not to say that the procedure used by the employer when considering accommodation cannot have significance in any given case; indeed, in practical terms, if an employer has not engaged in any accommodation analysis or attempts at accommodation at the time a request by an employee is made, it is likely to be very difficult to satisfy a tribunal on an evidentiary level that it could not have accommodated that employee short of undue hardship...That is the very real and practical effect of the evidentiary burden to establish a BFOR resting with the employer. [My emphasis.]\nIn other words, and as CN\u2019s counsel submits, an employer may do nothing and have \u201cguessed right\u201d. That is no doubt a dangerous legal strategy, but it is open to an employer to do, according to Cruden.\n[50] The important carve-out or exception to the above regarding a separate procedural duty to accommodate was stated by Zinn J. at para. 79:\n\u2026there is no independent and separate discriminatory practice as set out in the CHRA that rests only on the accommodation process or the manner in which a policy or guideline is applied in the accommodation process, unless of course the process itself or the application of the policy or guideline is conducted in a substantively discriminatory manner. [My emphasis.]\nAn example of the above exception might be if a company said, \u201cFor physical disability accommodation requests, we will consider them immediately, but for mental disability accommodation ones, we require a criminal record check before we implement any mental disability RTW.\u201d\n[51] Applying Cruden to my Decision, I shall consider the accommodation process used by CN as a practical tool on an evidentiary level to determine whether it has satisfied the Respondent\u2019s BFOR\/duty to accommodate defence. As well, I will determine whether Zinn J.\u2019s carve-out\/exception in para. 79 applies to the case before me.\nIX. Findings of Credibility [52] As an adjudicator, I am mindful that the hearing room is an artificial environment where witnesses react in individual and different ways to the stresses of giving testimony, etc. Accordingly, their demeanour is used as only one indicium of credibility. More important is the content of their testimony and what they did, said and wrote (as documentary evidence is important too) in the past events that form the basis of the subject-matter of the Complaint before me, and how their evidence fares in the context of the totality of the evidence presented. I also wish to add that finding a witness credible or not does not mean that everything the witness says or writes is accepted or rejected. I have tried to make sense of all the evidence and make findings of fact about what actually occurred.\n[53] In regard to the above, I have done my best to determine whether the truth of the Complainant\u2019s (and CN\u2019s) story is in \"harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\" (Farnya v. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 at 357 (B.C.C.A.)).\n[54] As in many cases, credibility played an important part here. In my Reasons, I comment on the credibility of various witnesses. Here specifically, I wish to comment mainly (but not exclusively) on the credibility of the most important witness in the hearing: the Complainant. It is the Complainant who has launched this proceeding (along with other internal\/external processes) based on a multitude of events over the course of ten years. He bears the initial prima facie burden to establish his allegations.\nA. The Complainant [55] The Complainant\u2019s credibility was in question throughout the hearing, both in terms of what he said on the stand and what he wrote in emails and letters, and as juxtaposed against other witnesses\u2019 evidence. I find that in many instances he was not credible and his evidence not reliable. He was on the stand for several days. The content of many of his answers was unbelievable. The Complainant was frequently evasive in his response to questions posed by CN\u2019s counsel. Mr. Croteau did not answer many questions the first time around; some required repeated re-asking, particularly in cross-examination. Often, he only provided a clear response when I re-phrased counsel\u2019s question. This was commented on by Mr. McFadden during the hearing. Sometimes he would contradict himself within the span of minutes, and certainly from the examination-in-chief to the cross-examination. Language was not an issue as Mr. Croteau is fluent in English, both verbal and written. I do not believe that his anxiety related disorders were the problem either. He appeared to understand the questions. When at times he was experiencing panic attacks, either he or I would initiate a break in the proceeding. He was always able to resume.\n[56] With regards to my comments above, I wish to stress that I do not believe that Mr. Croteau was intentionally deceiving the Tribunal. For the most part, I have concluded that he truly believes what he has testified to. From his perspective and according to his beliefs, CN harassed him, CN failed to accommodate his disability and return him to work, and he, on the other hand, had fully and with good intentions participated in the RTW process.\n[57] I will outline now some of the more stark examples of the evidence affecting his credibility and the reliability of his evidence. It is important to understand that, as Mr. McFadden put it, \u201cthe centre piece of unreality\u201d begins with the short conversation of November 19, 2003 between Mr. Croteau and KS, the Risk Management Officer (\u201cRMO\u201d): \u201cEverything after that that happened to him was because [KS] was angry with him for not revealing his personal medical issue in that 2-3 minute conversation.\u201d This is the genesis of his \u201cwork related issues\u201d and affects his entire case based on his subjective perception of KS (and Superintendent TC) and CN in general. At times, Mr. Croteau seemed paranoid and presented an almost conspiracy-like description of CN \u2013 named and unnamed personnel \u2013 trying to \u201cruin\u201d his life. This included the union who initially supported him and on whom he relied to communicate with CN, including acting as a conduit of information and documentation. At one point in his testimony, he indicated that his once-ally, the union, was colluding with CN against him.\n[58] The most stark examples of his paranoia or fear of KS were revealed when he dropped these bombshells during his testimony:\n(1) Since 2004 and to this day, he has daily thoughts (5-6 times per day) that KS \u201cmight kidnap or hurt\u201d his two sons. This is so even though KS, according to her evidence, left Sarnia for Oakville in April 2004 and later the employ of CN in 2007; that he had no contact with her at CN since May 2004; that he has not seen her since his Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration (\u201cCROA\u201d) arbitration hearing in July 2008; that she has never threatened to hurt him or his family;\n(2) He had fears of travelling to Toronto to this day, as he was afraid of KS possibly going to his home in Sarnia in his absence pretending to be an insurance salesperson in order to harm his family. He pointed out that his wife does not know what she looks like;\n(3) To this day, his anxiety symptoms are triggered whenever he encounters someone with the same names as KS, or a woman with blonde hair. I note that he did not attend the hearing when KS testified;\n(4) He often thinks of KS when approaching or leaving his home.\n[59] I say the above not to denigrate or make light of Mr. Croteau\u2019s feelings. He has a profound fear of KS to this day and by extension, a fear of CN in general. This will be canvassed later when discussing whether Mr. Croteau could ever realistically RTW at CN. Dr AB indicated that the above fears could be seen as symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d), but that they were not indicative of a Delusional Disorder.\n[60] In his testimony, he stated that at his investigation meeting with Kevin Mau and his Union representatives on May 11, 2004, KS (who was not in attendance at the meeting) pushed him in the corridor and not lightly. KS testified that that never happened. Mr. Mau did not testify, and the Complainant did not call the union rep in attendance, Mr. Scarrow, to testify. The evidence I heard was that Mr. Scarrow is a senior union executive with great experience and no \u201cshrinking violet\u201d. Had KS shoved the Complainant as described, Mr. Scarrow or others there would have interceded. There was no documentation of this alleged incident by the union. It commented on less serious matters, but not this. I do not believe that KS shoved Mr. Croteau.\nB. Leslie Croteau and Cheryl Hames [61] Leslie Croteau is the wife of the Complainant. I found her to be a credible witness. She admitted that her knowledge of most of the events at CN is based on what her husband had told her. However, she did attend the March 1, 2005 meeting with Human Resources Manager Terrence Gallagher, her husband and the union. She also had a phone conversation with KS on April 23, 2004. The phone conversation will be dealt with later in these Reasons.\n[62] Ms. Croteau also gave evidence about how the events had changed her husband, as a person, husband and father. She also discussed the impact of finding out about the March\u2011April 2004 surveillance of her husband, which included surveillance of her and their two children.\n[63] Cheryl Hames is the sister-in-law of the Complainant. She testified about a brief conversation she had also with KS on April 23, 2004. I find her to be a credible witness as well.\nC. CN\u2019s Witnesses [64] CN proffered seven witnesses:\n(1) KS \u2013 formerly employed with CN in different positions, but as a RMO during the 2003-04 incidents in question;\n(2) Vanessa Paquet \u2013 currently employed with CN, she was a RTW Co-ordinator and RMO during 2004-08;\n(3) Terrence Gallagher \u2013 currently employed with CN and Human Resources Manager dealing with Mr. Croteau\u2019s internal harassment complaint and RTW matters;\n(4) Derrick Colasimone \u2013 currently holds the senior position of General Manager of CN\u2019s Michigan Division (which includes Sarnia);\n(5) Suzanne Fusco \u2013currently an Employee Relations Officer for CN and worked in Human Resources in 2004-08;\n(6) Kathy Smolynec \u2013 the Senior Manager in Occupational Health Services (\u201cOHS\u201d) department; and\n(7) Laura Waller \u2013 RTW Co-ordinator.\n[65] I find that CN\u2019s witnesses were credible and that their evidence was generally reliable. They answered the questions succinctly and their viva voce testimony was generally consistent with the documentary evidence entered, and with the preponderance of the evidence in the case. Some of their witnesses were quite candid, in particular Messrs. Gallagher and Colasimone. I will discuss their evidence under the various subsequent headings in these Reasons.\nX. Dr. AB and His Proffered Expert Evidence [66] The Complainant has seen Dr. AB, an experienced psychologist for approximately 150 hours worth of sessions since August 2004. Beyond a doubt, of the all the health care professionals who have seen Mr. Croteau, Dr. AB has had the most lengthy, extensive relationship with the Complainant.\n[67] The Complainant sought to have Dr. AB qualified to give expert opinion evidence about the following: \u201canxiety disorder; PTSD; adjustment disorder; panic attacks and the impact of those on individuals and specifically Mr. Croteau; causation of these disorders; ability of people with PTSD to RTW generally and specifically Mr. Croteau; what things need to be put in place for a RTW for the Complainant; [and to] comment on Dr. Chad\u2019s IMEs.\u201d\n[68] CN\u2019s counsel opposed the request to have Dr. AB qualified as an expert. He did not oppose his giving testimony as the Complainant\u2019s treating psychologist, although he submits that the Tribunal should be \u201creluctant to rely on anything he said. CN\u2019s reasons for its position are:\ni. Dr. [AB]\u2019s diagnosis of Mr. Croteau is by his own admission at odds with the requirements of the DSM-IV[11] and with the prevailing opinion in the psychiatric\/psychological [sic] professional (at least with respect to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder);\nii. his professional relationship with Mr. Croteau has crossed the line into an unrestricted advocacy on behalf of Mr. Croteau, and he does not have the objectivity that adjudicators require of medical professionals; and\niii. Dr. [AB] in his evidence refused to change his view or opinion even when he became aware that the facts upon which he originally formed the opinion were different from what he understood.\n[69] Based on the second and third submission above, I decline to qualify Dr. AB to give expert opinion evidence on the matters requested. However, his evidence as Mr. Croteau\u2019s treating psychologist will be considered and given appropriate weight.\n[70] In coming to this conclusion, I have reviewed the leading Supreme Court of Canada Judgment dealing with the nature and admissibility of expert evidence \u2013 R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 \u2013 and its four criteria. Interestingly, the criteria do not include a stand-alone requirement of independence and impartiality. However, Canadian courts have inferred the same: see for example R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, at para. 87, footnote 8, leave to appeal denied [2010], S.C.C.A. No. 125; and Es-Sayyid v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FCA 59, at para. 43, leave to appeal denied [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 116.\n[71] There is no question, in my view, that Dr. AB is a knowledgeable, articulate psychologist. Notwithstanding the absence of academic writings and presentations at conferences which usually find their way into an expert\u2019s curriculum vitae, this did not concern me in terms of his ability to provide expert opinion evidence on the matters sought. He has significant experience in these matters. He has been in private practice since 2000 and also worked in a hospital. He indicated that he has done over 1,000 assessments, primarily in the context of motor vehicle accidents, with at least one-third of them dealing with RTW issues. Much of his work comes from insurers and the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. He said that he doesn\u2019t usually see his clients post-IME.\n[72] My concerns are with items 2 and 3 of CN counsel\u2019s submissions. I do find that Dr. AB has \u201ccrossed the line\u201d into the realm of an advocate, and falling short of the degree of objectivity required of an expert. Perhaps this was unavoidable or even desirable from a clinical standpoint. In cross-examination, Dr. AB agreed that to build the relationship with a patient and Mr. Croteau specifically, it is important that he believes that you believe what he says. Dr. AB has played a significant role in Mr. Croteau\u2019s pathway to healing, as Mr. Croteau attested to.\n[73] Mr. Croteau has testified that he hopes one day to be \u201cfriends\u201d with Dr. AB, when he won\u2019t need his professional assistance. Notably, at the December 3, 2008 meeting to discuss new allegations of harassment with Ms. Fusco, Mr. Schenk, Mr. Croteau and Dr. AB, the latter was introduced as Mr. Croteau\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d who was there to assist him. This was notwithstanding that Dr. AB had, since 2004, been treating Mr. Croteau and whose fees were paid initially by the insurer and then by CN. Not only did Mr. Croteau introduce him as his \u201cfriend\u201d, not once indicating he was his psychologist, but Dr. AB did not correct him and failed to disclose his professional capacity and role.\n[74] There were times in Dr. AB\u2019s testimony that he came across more as an advocate than an expert. For example, during his cross-examination about Mr. Croteau\u2019s perception of CN and the workplace conflict, when invited to admit that sometimes both parties are blameworthy, he replied in the affirmative. However, when it was then put to him: \u201cIs it possible that he [Mr. Croteau] is mistaken, that he was partially or wholly to blame?\u201d the witness replied, \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible theoretically, but not likely, from having known him for over 100 hours, as a bystander who wasn\u2019t there, it didn\u2019t sound like he played a large role in the incidents\u2026and should [not] be blamed for it.\u201d\n[75] I also agree with CN\u2019s counsel that there were several examples where Dr. AB refused to change his evidence involving his opinion of the Complainant\u2019s conduct even when confronted with powerful evidence to the contrary. Mr. McFadden argues that \u201cno contrary facts matter\u201d to Dr. AB when it comes to Mr. Croteau, thus showing the lack of objectivity and neutrality required of an expert giving evidence before a court or tribunal. Counsel raised the issue with Dr. AB about his client\u2019s less-than-honest withholding of key information to him in April 2008. Following Dr. Chad\u2019s third IME and recommendations, CN proposed a Transition Work Plan (\u201cTWP\u201d) involving shadowing the night rover. Mr. Croteau objected indicating inter alia that he was concerned that he would be shadowing a different rover each shift and that they would be privy to confidential information about his medical condition. Ms. Paquet wrote back to Mr. Croteau on April 25, 2008 indicating that would not be so. But Mr. Croteau failed to disclose this key information to Dr. AB when they met. He had Dr. AB write a letter to CN reiterating his original concerns on April 30, 2008.\n[76] With regards to the above issue, during cross-examination, Mr. McFadden put it to Dr. AB that the Complainant had been \u201cdishonest\u201d with him. Dr. AB replied, \u201cI can\u2019t account for why he said that to me.\u201d Counsel then asked if he was not concerned that he was \u201cbeing used as a dupe\u201d by Mr. Croteau. The witness paused and finally answered: \u201cYes, there is obviously a contradiction here and I can\u2019t account for it.\u201d Counsel then said that he was \u201cbeing used\u201d to which the witness replied that he was not concerned that he was being used \u201cin an improper fashion because I\u2019ve known him for over eight years. I assume there is some explanation.\u201d Mr. McFadden then suggested to the witness that it wouldn\u2019t be \u201chighly ethical conduct\u201d for Mr. Croteau to use Dr. AB \u201cto propagate an untruth\u201d on CN. Dr. AB responded: \u201cIf he did do that, yes, that would concern me.\u201d He then appeared evasive and nervous and talked about this issue in an abstract, almost philosophical way in the context of being in a \u201cprofessional relationship\u201d and not having any reason to doubt that person. He said that he would \u201cgive people the benefit of the doubt. There must be an explanation here...I don\u2019t know what happened here, but I assume there\u2019s some sort of explanation.\u201d\n[77] As well, there is the perception of a lack of objectivity and a tone of advocacy in Dr. AB\u2019s summary of his work with the Complainant dated November 4, 2011. On page 4, he uses phrases such as \u201cwhen the plug was pulled on the [RTW] program\u201d, and \u201cwhen CN closed the door with respect to the [RTW] plan.\u201d In another instance, on page 2, he described Mr. Croteau as being engaged in \u201cA fight to obtain justice\u201d with regards to CN \u201cover the last seven years\u201d. On page 5, he concludes that his client would have succeeded \u201cif he had only been given a proper chance to succeed.\u201d Dr. AB made other references in his testimony and letter to \u201cappropriate supports\u201d and \u201cwith proper support\u201d. The totality of these comments would leave one with the impression that Dr. AB is advocating on behalf of Mr. Croteau and attributing fault or blame to CN.\n[78] I also note that there is the perception of a pecuniary interest: i.e., the Complainant is claiming compensation in this hearing for past unpaid and future sessions with Dr. AB. The Complainant indicated that Dr. AB was only seeking payment for past sessions if the Complainant receives compensation for them as a result of an Order in this proceeding.\n[79] Based on the foregoing, I conclude that Dr. AB does not meet the requirements of an expert witness. As such, I did not consider his evidence as expert opinion evidence. However, his evidence as Mr. Croteau\u2019s treating psychologist, including Dr. AB\u2019s diagnosis and treatment of Mr. Croteau, the psychologist\u2019s interaction with CN in meetings, telephone conversations, correspondence, etc. with respect to Mr. Croteau will be given due consideration and weight.\nXI. The Harassment Allegations [80] I will deal now with the nine remaining harassment allegations of the Complainant and the issues that flow from them, under section 14 of the CHRA. As indicated by Mr. Bolter in argument and as demonstrated by the Complainant\u2019s testimony and documents, and understandably so, Mr. Croteau sometimes used the term \u201charassment\u201d (in the generic, plain meaning, layperson\u2019s use of the word) to include not just \u201charassment\u201d as we would define it in CHRA proceedings, but also as denoting a failure to accommodate his disability needs to the point of undue hardship in his RTW at CN. These nine harassment allegations were the ones specifically advanced at the hearing by the Complainant and argued by his counsel (and defended and argued by CN).\nA. Allegation #1: November 19, 2003 Conversation Between KS and the Complainant [81] The Complainant alleges that on or about November 19, 2003, he went to KS\u2019s office to get a Short Term Disability (\u201cSTD\u201d) form for his personal medical issue. He claims that she insisted on knowing what the personal medical issue was and was rude and persistent and got increasingly angry when he would not tell her. He also claims that she slammed her drawer. Her office door was apparently open during this exchange which lasted approximately 5-10 minutes. He ended up leaving as KS was not the person who had the non-Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (\u201cWSIB\u201d), non-work related leave forms and his reason-for-leave was not work related. He never disclosed his personal medical issue to her.\n[82] KS testified and denied the allegation. She was surprised and clearly upset when many months later she was presented with his internal harassment complaint regarding this event. She said that she had no previous conflict with Mr. Croteau and had previously been involved with an accommodation for him as a result of a taxi accident injury. The conversation was brief, a few minutes. Her door was open, so if there had been such an altercation, others would have heard.\n[83] KS joined CN in 1985. She occupied various field positions, including trainmaster, conductor and engineer, before she joined management. KS made it clear that, as an experienced manager and RMO at the time, she was trained not to inquire into employee\u2019s personal medical issues, that there was a \u201cbrick wall\u201d between Medisys\/OHS and \u201cfield people\u201d like her when it came to employee\u2019s personal medical information. She averred that she has a \u201crecollection\u201d of the meeting, some nine years later: \u201cMaybe five minutes in my office. He came in and indicated he needed paper work for an absence. I needed to confirm if it was work related or not because the process [and the form] would be completely different.\u201d If it was work related KS would deal with it; otherwise (for personal injury\/illness) the employee would deal with Debbie Robinson.\n[84] In her Statement given to CN\u2019s Human Resources department looking into the internal harassment complaint, she wrote:\nI remember Pierre coming to my office about a personal condition. I also remember asking him if it was work related and he had stated that it wasn\u2019t so I sent him to Debbie for the info on the new forms\u2026The only conversation with Pierre about his injury was whether it was work related or not. Our follow-up is very different depending on whether we are dealing with a personal injury or a work-related injury.\n\u2026 \u2026\nOne of the first things I learned as a RMO was that if an employee had a personal condition that I was not entitled to know anything about it. I would never ask him those personal questions knowing that it was not my business to know\u2026I think his visit lasted less than a minute.\n[85] KS testified that she would \u201cnever\u201d ask an employee the nature of his\/her illness: \u201cWe knew it was not our business and not allowed to ask.\u201d She stated that she had dealt with 500 employees in similar situations looking for forms and would ask if the matter was work related or not: \u201cI never crossed that line, wouldn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t benefit me, there would be no reason to ask for it.\u201d She said that none of the 500 said employees had ever alleged that she made such inappropriate inquiries, other than Mr. Croteau.\n[86] This is a classic \u201che said-she said\u201d situation. There was no other evidence presented about this event. However, Mr. Croteau\u2019s wife and sister-in-law testified about phone conversations they had on April 23, 2004 with KS where she was inquiring the whereabouts of Mr. Croteau. Ms. Croteau testified that KS was not only rude and aggressive, but revealed personal medical information and wanted to know \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with him now\u201d. I find that Ms. Croteau and Ms. Hames were credible witnesses. It is possible that on November 19, 2003 KS was being nosey, curious to know the personal medical reason for the form-request and asked Mr. Croteau to disclose it. However, based on my credibility and reliability concerns regarding the Complainant, and having heard KS\u2019s testimony, on a balance of probabilities I find that it is more likely that she was aggressive, assertive, impatient or even rude during that in-office conversation with Mr. Croteau, including when ascertaining whether the illness was work related or not, but did not ask him to disclose the personal medical issue. This clearly does not trigger liability under section 14 of the CHRA. I also wish to add that throughout the hearing Mr. Croteau commented about people\u2019s manners, so-and-so \u201cwas rude\u201d, etc. Manners and proper etiquette are important to Mr. Croteau, and understandably so. This may have informed his perception of the incident.\n[87] In the alternative, even if she did ask the nature of his illness (other than whether it was work related or not), such an inquiry would not constitute harassment based on disability under the CHRA for the following reasons: such an inquiry, which information was not provided by Mr. Croteau, would be more of an attempted breach of privacy. This would not qualify as \u201cunwelcome conduct\u201d of such a singular, significant nature or repetitious, persistent nature based on the prohibited ground of disability or created a poisoned work environment, on the objective-based standard.\n[88] This is a significant allegation as it is the genesis, according to the Complainant, for what followed, both in terms of harassment and the failure to properly accommodate him based on his disability. As Complainant counsel, Mr. Bolter stated: It was the turning point in his relationship with [KS]\u201d and I would add, with CN too. While the later disclosure of the video surveillance exacerbated the situation, this meeting set off the deterioration of his work-life.\n[89] Mr. McFadden described the Complainant\u2019s allegation about the November 19, 2003 incident as \u201cthe centre piece of unreality. He actually believes this and everything after November 2003 that happened to him\u2026was because [KS] was angry at him for not revealing his personal medical issue in this 2-3 minute conversation around November 19, 2003.\u201d Counsel also submits: \u201cIt has an echo effect: in every case, he comes back to this conversation. It established an animus or vendetta by [KS] against him that infects the rest of CN. And it carries through to 2007 when she was long gone.\u201d\n[90] It is clear from Mr. Croteau\u2019s testimony that the genesis of his Complaint is this November 19, 2003 conversation in KS\u2019s office. Indeed, he claimed events thereafter, including with other CN managers, were linked to, or influenced by, KS: a conspiracy-like attempt or vendetta to harass and terminate his employment from CN. At one point in his evidence, he stated that four employees had told him that KS was out to get him fired. When asked to name them in the hearing, he replied that he only knew the name of one of the four employees. However, he would not name that one employee for fear of retribution against that employee by CN. For fairness and natural justice reasons, I place no weight on this evidence.\nB. Allegation #2: Mau investigation meeting on December 15, 2003 [91] Trainmaster Kevin Mau convened an investigation meeting on December 15, 2003 regarding Mr. Croteau\u2019s failure to \u201cprotect his assignments\u201d in relation to two missed calls. This was in violation of CN terminal policy. This was almost one month after the November 19th incident in KS\u2019s office. A union representative was present for part of the meeting. The Complainant alleges that KS was responsible for Mr. Mau\u2019s calling him in for an investigation. This was not the first investigation meeting that the Complainant had attended. He acknowledged the policy (can\u2019t miss more than 1\/28 shifts) and practice at CN. Mr. Croteau also testified that CN was \u201cvery intense\u201d about such attendance matters at this time with all their employees. He has no evidence that Mr. Mau either knew about his personal medical issue or the November 19th conversation in KS\u2019s office or even that the two of them had spoken about it or about Mr. Croteau. In particular, Mr. Croteau viewed as \u201charassment\u201d the fact that Mr. Mau told him that he could be fired for lack of attendance.\n[92] Other than Mr. Croteau\u2019s personal belief, there is no evidence to suggest that this investigation meeting was linked to his conversation with KS on November 19, 2003, which I have found did not breach the CHRA. The December 15, 2003 investigation was per a standard, non-discriminatory CN policy. As for Mr. Mau\u2019s comment that he could be fired for lack of attendance, I find that this comment was essentially made in line with best practices which require managers to keep their employees informed of the consequences of breaches of (non-discriminatory) policies, in this case dealing with attendance. There was no animus or threat, express or implied, here. I note that Mr. Mau did not testify. I had indicated during case management part-way through the hearing that I did not need Mr. McFadden to call either Mr. Mau or TC to the stand, but that he was free to do so if he wished. He chose not to call them. Mr. Bolter also could have chosen to call them as witnesses, but did not do so.\nC. Allegation #3: January 8, 2004 shoulder injury re-enactment [93] On January 8, 2004, Mr. Croteau sustained a shoulder injury while pulling a hand- brake. He alleges that KS improperly required him to participate in an immediate re-enactment of the injury and \u201cinterrogated\u201d him. Mr. Croteau acknowledged in testimony that CN\u2019s policy was to do a re-enactment, however slight the injury or accident, as quickly as possible after the incident. This was part of CN\u2019s safety-first ethos.\n[94] Mr. Croteau testified the total time involved in the re-enactment process was at least several hours. He did acknowledge that the actual re-enactment itself lasted only five minutes. What was peculiar to him was that this was the first time, to his knowledge, that KS was involved in the re-enactment process. Mr. Croteau also objected to the fact that his wife was left waiting in the car. He also testified that KS said that he hadn\u2019t pulled the brake properly and that Mr. Brownlee had said, \u201cDon\u2019t go there [K].\u201d He averred that he began to feel \u201ctargeted\u201d by CN at this point and called his union.\n[95] I find no CHRA harassment violation here. KS was following standard CN policy when an injury was reported. Her involvement in re-enactments was an important part of her job as a RMO. It had no connection to her November 19, 2003 conversation with Mr. Croteau (which I already have found to be non-discriminatory). The re-enactment took a mere five minutes. As for the wait-time, Mr. Croteau had gone home and realized that he hadn\u2019t handed in his injury\/accident occurrence report so had to return to the terminal. KS, Ms. Paquet, Mr. Colasimone and Ms. Fusco also testified about the policy and practice: that CN wants to do re-enactments in every case if possible and as soon as possible after the event. No injury is too minor for a re-enactment to be done, and on the same train and equipment if possible. As well, Paul Sutor who attended had not complained about the re-enactment.\n[96] Regarding, Mr. Brownlee\u2019s comment: \u201cDon\u2019t go there [K]\u201d, without more, I cannot determine if there was any negative, discriminatory taint to it. Furthermore, there was no discipline imposed in relation to Mr. Croteau\u2019s operation of the hand-brake, and no Q and A investigation ordered. Had KS wanted to target or get Mr. Croteau, this would have been an opportunity for her to do so. Rather, she was simply doing her job: to find out why an injury happened and to try to prevent future ones.\nD. Allegation #4: March 10, 2004 knee injury [97] Mr. Croteau injured his knee while de-training on March 10, 2004. Notably, this was his second injury in two months. The Complainant testified that KS questioned him about the injury and criticized his accident\/injury record: which was 12 injuries in 10 years. KS testified that it was 11 injuries from October 1993-January 2004: \u201can exceptionally high number. That\u2019s why he was on the list to talk to [TC].\u201d At the end of his meeting with KS, the evidence shows that she offered the Complainant a drive to the hospital which he declined, and she reminded him to return the medical forms filled out by his doctor. Mr. Croteau testified that as he was \u201cstressed out\u201d from KS, he did not directly return the forms to her as directed but, rather, he asked the Union to do so on his behalf.\n[98] I stress that no re-enactment was done immediately after the accident as he said that he was in pain and wanted to go to the hospital. And he did. The doctor provided him with a note indicating a 3-day restriction period. However, Mr. Croteau alleges that it was harassment for KS to have kept him there and questioned him in an accusatory manner about his latest injury and tell him that he had a bad injury record. He also stated that she screamed at him as he ran down the stairs: \u201clike a screech, she was completely unhinged.\u201d\n[99] Having heard the testimony of the Complainant and KS and having reviewed the documentary evidence, I do not find that CN and its employee KS harassed him. First, KS had questioned the bona fides of his injury based on how he said and wrote that it happened: i.e., he twisted his knee while de-training vs. after de-training. I am not suggesting that Mr. Croteau was less than honest about this. And there is a semantical aspect to this issue. However, I find that KS was not unreasonable in questioning him and even having doubts about the veracity of his reporting given the apparent contradictions in his versions. If this had been his first injury in ten years, I might have viewed it differently, but this was his 12th injury in 10 years, and his 2nd in 2 months. Furthermore, it was her job as RMO to question such matters. I heard evidence in the hearing that it was not uncommon for employees to try to avoid responsibility for injuries. I am not suggesting Mr. Croteau did this, simply that, given the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for KS to question him and certainly not harassment based on the prohibited ground of disability under the CHRA.\n[100] I am not willing, based on my general credibility\/reliability concerns about the Complainant, and having heard KS\u2019s evidence, to find that KS \u201cscreeched\u201d at him. She may have lost her patience with him, but that per se does not constitute harassment under the CHRA.\n[101] Regarding her questioning of his work injury record, again I find no violation of the CHRA. The documentary evidence outlines each and every injury that the Complainant sustained: 12 in 10 years. Much time was spent at the hearing going through each injury-incident. I agree that a few of the twelve injuries may be characterized as minor ones and not due to his negligence or failure to follow the rules, but not all twelve, and over a period of ten years.\n[102] Mr. Bolter asks me to make an adverse inference that CN failed to produce the comparative computer records showing injuries for certain employees over a given period. Various CN witnesses testified that such information was available. However, CN did not provide a reason for not producing it. While I find it odd that it was not produced, I decline to draw an adverse inference. (I note that Mr. Bolter could have made a request for an Order of production.) I heard from several CN witnesses regarding their opinion on an injury record of 12 in 10 years. Mr. Gallagher was especially colourful in his description, calling it \u201cabysmal.\u201d He averred that \u201cone injury per year or more is a very, very poor record. Very few employees have a record like that.\u201d The hearsay statement of TC was that he had never been injured in his thirty years at CN. Ms. Paquet stated that the Complainant\u2019s record was \u201chigh and consistent; a lot of injuries and at least every year or other year\u2026.He has a lot of unsafe behaviour.\u201d And these comments are coming from experienced CN managers, most of whom had extensive \u201crunning trades\u201d experience as conductors or engineers, and all of whom had to maintain their train crew training and qualifications.\n[103] Of the CN witnesses, Mr. Colasimone has the most train crew experience, in operations and management and occupies a senior management operations position at CN. I place great weight on his evidence. He too was quite clear about his views on such an injury record. When asked, \u201cHow common is it for employees in the running trades to suffer no injuries,\u201d he replied, \u201cVery common, better than half.\u201d Then he was asked, \u201cIf you saw an employee with a record like this, 12 in 10?\u201d He answered, \u201cI would be very concerned. That employee would become a \u2018focused employee\u2019\u201d and he would speak with him\/her and draw the \u201cstick man\u201d injury diagram.[12] However, that did not occur with Mr. Croteau. Other than KS raising his record with him on March 10, 2004 and requiring him to speak with TC which he did, nothing further occurred: he was certainly not made a \u201cfocused employee\u201d. When asked how Mr. Croteau could have \u201clasted\u201d with a record like that over ten years, Mr. Colasimone answered, \u201cDifferent management styles. Obviously he slipped through the cracks. I personally can\u2019t imagine it happening.\u201d He also agreed that it was an \u201cabysmal safety record\u201d and the Complainant would have been a \u201cfocused employee\u201d under his watch. Of this I have no doubt. As well, it does not appear that he was \u201con the radar\u201d \u2013 a subject of discussion on the weekly national safety call with management including Mr. Creel, the number two senior executive directly below the CEO of the company.\n[104] Notwithstanding that it appears the Complainant \u201cslipped through the cracks\u201d (other than KS having him speak with TC about his safety record in 2004), I find that Mr. Croteau had real safety issues and a poor safety record as a conductor at CN. I recognize that this is at odds with the Complainant\u2019s perception of himself as \u201cone of the safest employees\u201d at CN.\nE. Allegation #5: The Video Surveillance of Mr. Croteau and his family [105] This may be the most significant allegation in terms of the impact it had on Mr. Croteau and his mental health condition. If he didn\u2019t have severe anxiety related disorders before becoming aware of the surveillance in the Q and A investigation meeting with Mr. Mau on May 11, 2004, he most certainly developed them at that point, and his symptoms became worse as time went on.\n[106] Following his knee injury on March 10, 2004, the Complainant provided his union with a medical note initially indicating that he could RTW on modified duties and shortly thereafter, provided another note with conflicting medical restrictions, indicating that he could not RTW at all until March 29, 2004. These notes were not provided directly to CN but instead provided to his union. During the 20-day absence, Mr. Croteau did not communicate directly with CN management but instead contacted his union. The evidence shows that KS questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Croteau\u2019s sick leave, and that CN retained an outside private investigation firm to conduct video surveillance of him during his absence. There were two periods of surveillance, one in March 2004 and the other one month later.\n[107] The surveillance captured, among other things, Mr. Croteau playing soccer with his children in a park, Mr. Croteau playing basketball with some adult friends and footage of his house from the street and various shots of either Mr. Croteau or his wife driving their cars. All of the surveillance was shot during daylight hours and in public spaces.\n[108] The Complainant testified that he believed KS and Mr. Schenk had authorized the surveillance and that it had been undertaken out of suspicion that he was gay because he had this personal medical issue and because of general common knowledge in Sarnia that his brother had passed away due to AIDS. The evidence indicates that while KS recommended surveillance, it was authorized likely by Tony Marquis, the General Manager. While not involved in the decision to surveil Mr. Croteau, Mr. Colasimone, who currently holds the position that Mr. Marquis held in 2004, testified that he had authorized surveillance of employees in the past and been involved in a couple dozen of them. Often it would be done if the company was suspicious about the activities, injuries or absences from work of an employee. Sometimes, \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d would raise suspicions. Mr. Gallagher and Ms. Fusco also testified about the reasons or situations which might trigger CN having an employee surveilled. The evidence was clear that CN did not lightly order surveillance of employees, which is an expensive exercise. But clearly, given the sequence of events in March and April 2004 involving Mr. Croteau, including his 20-day Absent Without Leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d) period, back briefly and then off again, and conflicting medical notes and inability to reach him, cumulatively raised the suspicion of KS and senior management. Ultimately, he was not disciplined for the 20-day AWOL period. I accept that he had asked the union to advise CN because he didn\u2019t want to deal directly with KS. The union was acting as his agent or representative or \u201cbuffer\u201d between him and KS.\n[109] Although ultimately CN did not use the surveillance tapes to discipline Mr. Croteau, his activities on the tapes playing soccer and basketball would have been a reasonable basis for an employer\u2019s suspicions to be raised and to question the validity of an employee\u2019s absences from work. I take \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that playing soccer and basketball are activities that involve pivoting and twisting in different directions, something which might be inconsistent with a claim of being unable to work due to a knee injury.\n[110] I also wish to address the issue of Mr. Croteau making himself unreachable by phone. KS testified that she tried 58 times to reach the Complainant by phone. Her list of the dates and times of the calls was entered into evidence. Mr. Croteau says she is lying; she never made those calls. He had a home number and two cell numbers. When she called his two cell numbers, the phones appeared to be turned off because there was only a standard message that the person is not available, but no voice mail attached to them. I find two things strange. First, that KS would have the time, for she testified that she was quite busy during this period, to place 58 calls to Mr. Croteau. Second, that well before call #58, she wouldn\u2019t embark on another method to contact him \u2013 e.g., by registered mail. Finally, it is odd that Mr. Croteau would not have voice-mail attached to his phone to ensure that he did receive important messages from his employer. That said, although KS was perhaps overzealous, having listened carefully to her testimony and reviewed the exhibit listing the details of her calls, I do find that she placed those 58 calls to Mr. Croteau, but to no avail.\n[111] I find no CHRA violation in the ordering of the surveillance, nor in the methods of the third party private investigator. Clearly KS and her superiors were suspicious of the bona fides of Mr. Croteau\u2019s absences and injury. They had reasonable grounds for their suspicions, based on the sequence of events including the changing content of doctors\u2019 notes, the difficulty in reaching him, etc. There is no harassment based on the prohibited ground of disability here. Clearly, Mr. Croteau and his family were upset. His wife testified too about this. And I don\u2019t doubt them. I can appreciate that it would be very upsetting to learn that one was followed and filmed by a private investigator. And I also appreciate that Mr. Croteau feels that there was no objective, justifiable reason for such surveillance. But I find otherwise. It is not a violation of the CHRA for an employer or insurer or WSIB to order surveillance of an individual who claims to be injured or disabled, so long as there are reasonable grounds for it and the decision to conduct surveillance is not based on discriminatory considerations.\n[112] As for the report of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (\u201cPCC\u201d) into the complaint filed by Mr. Croteau against CN for the surveillance, it had concluded that CN had ordered the surveillance prematurely, without first taking less restrictive methods. The PCC did not find that CN had harassed Mr. Croteau or had no lawful basis to surveil him and his family. And in any event, the PCC\u2019s determination under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 does not determine the result of my inquiry into a violation of the CHRA.\n[113] Mr. Croteau objected to the private investigator\u2019s methods, including filming his wife and children in his absence. The investigator did not testify. I do not know why he chose to do that. However, I viewed the surveillance tapes. All were taken from public venues. I speculate that collateral surveillance was taken as the investigator was ascertaining whether Ms. Croteau would be meeting her husband. But clearly Mr. Croteau was the subject of the surveillance, the family\u2019s and others\u2019 inclusion merely collateral. I reviewed the written reports of the investigator in this vein. This was a licensed private investigation firm \u2013 a third party hired by CN. There is no evidence to suggest that CN told the private investigation firm to surveil Ms. Croteau or her children or in general how to conduct the surveillance exercise. Again, I emphasize my appreciation of the impact this had on Mr. Croteau (and on his wife) when he learned of the surveillance on May 11, 2004. The effects were immediate and palpable, including moving one son to the other son\u2019s bedroom. As well, it offended his self-image as a safe, hardworking, honest employee and that others at CN had suspicions about him and may have thought otherwise of him.\nF. Allegation #6: May 11, 2004 investigation meeting with Kevin Mau [114] This was the occasion where Mr. Croteau first learned of his surveillance. Mr. Croteau was called into a Q and A investigation meeting, as required by CN policy and the collective agreement, regarding his 20-day failure to report AWOL period from March 10-30, 2004. Mr. Croteau alleges that holding an investigation meeting was a form of harassment. He also challenges the inordinate length of the meeting. He also alleges and testified that Mr. Mau commented that he had \u201ccute kids\u201d and felt that comment was of a threatening, \u201ccreepy\u201d nature, though not of a sexually inappropriate nature. As well, he alleges that KS \u201cshoved\u201d him in the hallway, though she was not in attendance at the investigation meeting.\n[115] Mr. Croteau was shown the surveillance video footage during the meeting. Mr. Mau did confront him about being seen playing soccer and basketball while he was off due to a knee injury. The Complainant acknowledged that Mr. Mau said \u201cthere was nothing in the footage that CN could use.\u201d\n[116] Mr. Mau did not testify. However, having reviewed the investigation report and considering Mr. Croteau\u2019s testimony and written internal complaint dealing with this issue, I am of the view that the purpose of the meeting, as required by the collective agreement before any discipline can be meted out, was to address CN\u2019s reasonable suspicions around his 20-day AWOL period, including questions as to why Mr. Croteau was unreachable during this time, why he went to different doctors and what he was doing while off during that time. I do not detect a scent of harassment to this investigation meeting. He was not being targeted because he was injured, ill or disabled. I agree with Mr. McFadden that the non-harassment message CN was imparting to him (and any other employee) was: \u201cif you go AWOL and can\u2019t be reached and it looks like you\u2019re doctor-shopping, you may be placed under surveillance\u201d and called into a Q and A investigation meeting.\n[117] It is true that the meeting was inordinately long \u2013 under five hours, taking into account the three breaks of twenty minutes. And it exceeded the form\u2019s space for a maximum 98-questions and required a second sheet, with a total of 125 questions being asked. Having reviewed the investigation transcript, though I would have expected questions about how the actual knee injury occurred and more than one question about the soccer\/basketball playing, it is clear from the questions that CN had doubts about the veracity of his 20-day absence from work and his lack of communication and reach-ability during that period (i.e., KS had attempted to reach him by phone 58 times). I note that in cross-examination, at first the Complainant denied that he had ever been asked by Mr. Mau about playing in the park with his kids. However, when shown the document, he recanted. It is also clear that Mr. Mau was probing to see if he was running a business (perhaps as a pilot) while AWOL. CN unquestionably was suspicious about the bona fides of his injury and\/or absences. As indicated earlier, regardless of the outcome and conclusion, CN had reasonable, non-harassment grounds to conduct this Q and A investigation meeting.\n[118] It is true that Mr. Gallagher testified that he thought it was \u201creally dumb\u201d and \u201cabsolutely useless\u201d to show the surveillance tape: \u201cWhy show the tape if you got nothing\u2026\u201d However, when reviewing his evidence in its entirety, certain things are clear. First, Mr. Gallagher only saw \u201capproximately ten minutes\u201d of the tapes of the soccer playing. It was his first week in the region and didn\u2019t know the people involved. He stated: \u201cRobert Bruder asked me to see it and my opinion of it to justify an investigation of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation of his illness.\u201d He watched it on a Friday and was told Mr. Croteau was returning to work on Monday. It is clear to me that he thought it was \u201creally dumb\u201d to show him the surveillance a few days before he was returning to work. In his re-examination, he stated: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought it dumb and useless if Mr. Croteau was coming back in a month or there was no known [return] date.\u201d He was not saying that putting him under surveillance was \u201creally dumb\u201d or for some illegitimate purpose.\n[119] Regarding the allegation of \u201cyou have cute kids,\u201d Mr. Mau did not testify. However, while I believe that subjectively speaking, Mr. Croteau may have felt threatened by this \u201ccreepy\u201d remark, objectively speaking it would appear to me to be nothing more than a compliment, a way of breaking the tension in a stressful Q and A meeting environment. I note that Mr. Croteau testified that he never had any personal conflict with Mr. Mau. There was no animus there. As for the allegation regarding KS shoving him in the hallway, I have already made a finding about it in the \u201ccredibility\u201d section of this Decision.\nG. Allegation #7: Tuition reimbursement denial [120] Mr. Croteau alleges that his supervisor had approved his application for education tuition reimbursement, then was told by TC that CN would not approve it. Mr. Croteau alleges that this constitutes harassment based on the ground of disability because he was targeted or singled out because of his legitimate absences from work.\n[121] On March 30, 2004, TC told the Complainant that CN felt he had been AWOL, that KS had been trying to contact him and that he was not communicating with the company.\n[122] On July 2, 2004, TC had told Mr. Croteau over the phone that, \u201cI talked it over with our HR people and we\u2019re not really prepared to offer some assistance for education.\u201d When asked why not, he replied: \u201cWell it depends on the individual. It depends on whether they are promotable. It depends on what they\u2019re taking. I had them review it and they declined.\u201d\n[123] In the July 5, 2004 meeting in TC\u2019s office that was secretly taped by Mr. Croteau, TC told the Complainant that he has \u201cgot to display the proper management techniques, come to work, be productive, not hurt yourself, and that\u2019s all part of being a manager.\u201d The Complainant responded: \u201cAbsolutely. And if you talk to anyone around here, I\u2019m probably one of the safest people around here. I listen to the Rules. I follow my instructions to a \u2018t\u2019\u2026\u201d\n[124] Further on, TC said that he had been working at CN for thirty years and never injured himself. He then commented on the Ontario WSIB being more lenient \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s almost communism\u201d \u2013 than workers\u2019 compensation boards in the Western provinces (CN admonished TC for making that comment). TC then commented: \u201cI haven\u2019t even seen the tapes cause I heard you\u2019re playing ball or soccer with your kids or something\u2026And you\u2019re off on compensation\u2026That\u2019s just a minor example. You\u2019re originally slated to modified duties and all of a sudden, bang, it changes to totally unfit for duties, and we can\u2019t contact you for a month.\u201d\n[125] Mr. Colasimone was asked about CN\u2019s educational assistance program and its decision to approve, and then not approve said tuition reimbursement. The witness averred that he couldn\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t have been honoured when the form had been signed and approved:\nNo comment, without more information. Something is missing. We pride ourselves on doing what we say we will do. There is more to the story. It would have to go to at least an Assistant Superintendent level and confer with the GM; that\u2019s a lot of money\u2026Criteria had to be met and it definitely has to benefit the company.\nI note that it appears that it was never approved at the Assistant Superintendent level, only by his supervisor, and for one course only.\n[126] Having reviewed the viva voce and documentary evidence and considered legal argument, I do not find the above allegation to be made out. The reasons as stated above do not constitute harassment based on disability. I accept that, due to the events that had transpired, CN management (at the Assistant Superintendent level or higher) did not believe Mr. Croteau was displaying \u201cpromotable\u201d behaviour or was of management calibre, at that time. That is not to say that CN would not have come to a different conclusion in the future. For example, while communicating through the Union is not improper, from CN\u2019s perspective it was probably not \u201cgood management practice\u201d. In other words, an employee that wants to become management, but is afraid to deal directly with management is not \u201cgood management material\u201d. Mr. Bolter argues that TC made \u201cerroneous assumptions\u201d and the \u201cemployer reneged on the agreement for the wrong reasons\u201d constituting harassment. That may well be true vis-\u00e0-vis the first two parts of his submission, but not the third: I find no harassing behaviour based on disability here. If anything, it may be a breach of contract or tort, but that is beyond my mandate and I make no such finding.\n[127] I appreciate that it was upsetting to Mr. Croteau that CN approved, then disallowed his tuition assistance application. There is no question that Mr. Croteau was ambitious and viewed himself very differently as an employee than did CN. For example, he told TC that he was one of the safest employees around. At one point in his testimony, he voiced that he had aspirations one day to reach the pinnacle of CN\u2019s management \u2013 that of the CEO, like his role model, then CEO (and now CEO of rival Canadian Pacific Railway) Hunter Harrison.\nH. Allegation #8: TC improperly relied on hearsay and misinformation [128] This allegation is related to the preceding one. Mr. Croteau alleges that in \u201creneging\u201d on General Supervisor Paul Sutor\u2019s approval, TC had improperly relied on hearsay and misinformation from CN\u2019s Human Resources and Labour Relations people.\n[129] It is true that TC had received some hearsay and inaccurate information. For example, when he said that Mr. Croteau was on compensation during the time he was seen playing soccer and basketball, that was technically untrue. However, the Complainant had, by that time, applied for WSIB payments. But beyond this point is the one that a manager is entitled to seek information from human resources or labour relations within an organization. And s\/he may receive some erroneous information and apply it, but absent a CHRA \u2013tainted intention or adverse impact to discriminate or harass, the CHRA is not engaged. There is no evidence, other than Mr. Croteau\u2019s belief, that CN (be it via KS, TC or others) denied this one-course tuition subsidy because it was punishing him or targeting him because of his disability. The reasons supporting this conclusion were explained in the preceding section dealing with allegation #7.\nI. Allegation #9: Mr. Croteau being disciplined in 2006 for the March 2004 absences [130] In January 2006 CN issued a 14-day deferred suspension (which was never applied and removed from his record) for his failure to contact CN during the 20-day AWOL period in March 2004. Kevin Mau had brought him in for a Q and A investigation meeting on May 11, 2004. Mr. Croteau alleges that the discipline itself and the timing of it constitute harassment.\n[131] From my review of the evidence, there is only Mr. Croteau\u2019s personal belief that the discipline was meted out and was delayed to harass him and is related to his conflict with KS on November 19, 2003. KS had left Sarnia for a promotion at the Oakville terminal in April 2004.\n[132] Regarding the discipline penalty itself, Mr. Bolter had agreed that technically his client was AWOL during this 20-day period. The penalty was deferred, meaning that it would be applied if there were a recurrence. It was never applied. It was subsequently wiped clean from his personnel record. Even if CN was wrong in meting out that deferred penalty, I see no CHRA harassment violation here, no proven pejorative link to the prohibited ground of disability.\n[133] As for the timing of it, in cross-examination Mr. Croteau reluctantly agreed that CN had waited as he was away from work from May 14, 2004-February 26, 2007 on STD, then Long Term Disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits. And he agreed that the Union might have requested CN to wait too. I add that he was not prejudiced by this delay in the deferred suspension.\n[134] Mr. Croteau grieved this matter with CROA. An arbitrator dismissed the grievance.\n[135] In conclusion, having considered the evidence of the harassment allegations individually and then in the aggregate, and applying the principles enunciated in the case law, I find no violation of Mr. Croteau\u2019s rights under section 14 of the CHRA.\nXII. Failure to Accommodate Allegation [136] Having reviewed the voluminous amount of evidence, I find that the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of adverse differential treatment contrary to subsection 7(b) of the CHRA. This requires an explanation and justification from CN. The Respondent led evidence to establish a BFOR under section 15(1)(a) of the CHRA and as part of that defence, that it provided reasonable accommodation or in the words of the statute - accommodation to the point of undue hardship - under section 15(2). Hence, the focus of the section 7 allegation turned on CN\u2019s ability to show that it had provided reasonable accommodation of Mr. Croteau\u2019s disability needs.\nA. Mr. Croteau\u2019s Diagnosis\/Medical Condition and Restrictions [137] The Complainant\u2019s diagnosis\/medical condition is integral to understanding how things unraveled as they did in this ten year period from injury\/illness\/disability to the end of the hearing. His medical condition has informed his responses to people and events at CN, preventing a successful RTW. It is difficult to determine the degree to which Mr. Croteau\u2019s thoughts, responses and conduct are attributable to his mental health condition throughout this period. However, what is certain is that his medical condition, the resulting impacts and often destructive consequences are real and not imagined.\n[138] What was Mr. Croteau diagnosed with and has it changed throughout this 10-year period from 2003-13? His team of health professionals consisted of his family physician, Dr. Gannon and his psychologist, Dr. AB. As well, Dr. Larry Chad, a psychiatrist and Deputy Chief of Psychiatry at Toronto East General Hospital, conducted three Independent Medical Examinations (\u201cIME\u201d) and played an integral role. Others involved on CN\u2019s end from a medical perspective were Dr. Leger, its Chief Medical Officer; and nurses at CN\u2019s OHS department (formerly called Medisys, a private company contracted by CN). There were other CN employees involved with RTW matters, but outside the confidentiality \u201cwall\u201d erected to protect the employee\u2019s confidential medical information, such as the Risk Management Officer, the Manager of Human Resources, the RTW Co-ordinator, and various operational managers\/supervisors.\n[139] Upon examining the medical documentation from Drs. Chad, Gannon and AB and references to it from CN\u2019s OHS documentation, I will refer to his diagnosis and condition as \u201canxiety related disorders\u201d. These will include the symptoms described such as the panic attacks, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, and PTSD symptoms.\n[140] Also of importance are the restrictions used by CN in Mr. Croteau\u2019s back to work TWPs. The four restrictions were based on the medical information received from Drs. Gannon, Chad and AB. They remain unchanged as of the end of the hearing, as confirmed by the Complainant through his counsel. They are:\n(1) Cannot occupy a safety sensitive\/critical position or perform such duties;\n(2) Cannot operate moving railway equipment;\n(3) Cannot assume responsibility for the safety of others; and\n(4) Cannot work alone.\n[141] While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact time that he developed these conditions, the genesis of the underlying workplace conflict, at least in terms of the harassment allegations, appears to be the November 19, 2003 brief meeting in KS\u2019s office. What also seems to be accepted is that the anxiety related disorders became significantly worse or amplified with the revealing of the surveillance tapes to Mr. Croteau at the investigation meeting on May 11, 2004. I cannot overstate the significance of this event on Mr. Croteau\u2019s psyche. Had this event not occurred, it is likely that the escalation of events in the years afterward would not have occurred and there would have been a different and more positive outcome in Mr. Croteau\u2019s life, both at work and at home. I agree with Dr. AB\u2019s evidence that Mr. Croteau\u2019s mistrust of CN grew to the point where his anxiety related disorders became chronic and \u201cgeneralized\u201d beyond the \u201cwork related issues\u201d so often quoted in the reports and documentation of Drs. Chad, Gannon and AB.\n[142] In the case of anxiety-related disorders, as with many health conditions, doctors and other health care providers rely on what the patient tells them and how they \u201cpresent\u201d. And of course in the mental health field, there are tests that can be administered. Bearing this is mind, it is worth considering whether Drs. Chad, Gannon and AB would have come to a different conclusion regarding diagnosis, prognosis and treatment for Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW at CN, including whether he could ever RTW successfully at CN, if they had been aware of certain key facts.\n[143] With regards to the above and by way of example, Mr. Croteau indicated a continuous fear\/paranoia about KS potentially kidnapping his two sons and has asked me to award him compensation for special damages to allow him to sell his house and move because, among other things, he is afraid to let CN know where he lives. He clearly expressed a \u201cfear of CN and KS knowing where I live.\u201d When asked if he wishes to move because the home is associated with this bad period in his life or because CN will cause him harm, he replied: \u201cBoth.\u201d Dr. AB testified that he was unaware of this, and that such fears never came up in any of their 150 sessions. There was no mention of this in Dr. Chad\u2019s three IMEs.\n[144] I also suspect that had Dr. Chad \u2013 the only psychiatrist to have seen the Complainant \u2013 been made aware of these matters, they would have figured prominently in his IMEs, and that his diagnosis and\/or recommendations might have been different with regards to Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW prospects as a conductor at CN.\n[145] I note that CN was entitled to rely on the medical opinions of Drs. Chad and Gannon and on the psychological opinion of Dr. AB. From the CHRA one may infer a duty upon the employer to seek relevant information about the employee and his\/her accommodation needs, and the employee has a corresponding duty to facilitate the gathering of this complete and accurate information.\n[146] Furthermore, at this point going forward, as Mr. Croteau is still an employee of CN while on unpaid leave and CN still has an obligation to accommodate his disability \u201cneeds\u201d, the above is relevant to the issue of whether Mr. Croteau\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d could be accommodated to the point of undue hardship with the goal of his being able to perform the essential duties of the job for which he was hired \u2013 train conductor.\n[147] I also wish to note that in none of the medical documentation, nor in Dr. AB\u2019s testimony nor in any of the submissions from Complainant counsel was there any suggestion that Mr. Croteau lacked capacity to understand what he was saying or doing, including during the hearing. Complainant counsel stated that he believed that his client had the capacity to retain and instruct him throughout the process. While Mr. Croteau experienced many panic attacks during the hearing, for which we often took breaks, he was able to participate throughout the process, including several days of his own testimony. This is not meant to minimize the real symptoms he was experiencing during his panic attacks.\nB. Accommodation History and Findings [148] In fairness to the Complainant, while he alleges a general and continual failure to accommodate his disability needs to the end of the hearing, he does acknowledge that CN did accommodate his needs at some points in this period between 2007-13. However, his counsel was not able to enumerate those specific acts of proper accommodation.\n[149] On January 8, 2004, Mr. Croteau injured his shoulder while using the handbrake. Two months later, on March 10, 2004, he injured himself again, this time hurting his knee while he was de-training. He went to the hospital and the first doctor he saw gave him a note that he was to be off for four days, and able to RTW with modifications as required. I note that KS was trying to reach him because she had modified duties available for him. In essence, CN was at this point ready to accommodate his \u201cneeds\u201d. As indicated earlier, Mr. Croteau went off work injured for twenty days, from March 10-31. He had asked his Union to communicate with CN regarding his absence and provide the required paper work. There was miscommunication to say the least as KS was trying to reach him (58 phone calls made by her). CN considered him AWOL. He returned from April 1-18, 2004, and then was off again for a personal medical issue (unrelated to the shoulder or knee injury) on April 19. He returned on April 21 and was off again on May 14, 2004.\n[150] On April 23, 2004, KS had a \u201crude\u201d conversation with the Complainant\u2019s wife (who called KS a \u201cbitch\u201d) and a later one with the Complainant\u2019s sister-in-law. In both, KS was looking for Mr. Croteau. By this point, on her recommendation and approved by senior management, surveillance of Mr. Croteau was ordered twice \u2013 the first in March and the second in April, unbeknownst to Mr. Croteau until May 11, 2004. At this point, CN was suspicious of Mr. Croteau\u2019s injuries and absences from work.\n[151] From May 14, 2004-February 26, 2007, the Complainant was not working at CN. He subsequently exhausted his STD, then LTD benefits. He was being held out to be totally unable to work. He also received EI benefits. From 2004-07, there was a window of three weeks that Mr. Croteau was not receiving disability benefits and was able to be accommodated. Aside from that brief window of time, CN was not legally obligated under the CHRA to accommodate the Complainant\u2019s disability during this three-year-period. During this time, CN having received Dr. Chad\u2019s first IME with the diagnosis and expert opinion that the issue was \u201cwork related\u2026without any restrictions due to psychiatric factors\u201d, indicated that it would remove the \u201cwork related issues\u201d \u2013 KS and TC \u2013 from the equation in terms of potentially have any dealings with the Complainant.\nDr. Chad and the First IME Report dated June 10, 2004\n[152] Dr. Chad wrote that \u201cMr. Croteau reported that prior to April\/May of 2003, he was well both physically and emotionally.\u201d He had \u201cno prior significant past depressions, mood swings or anxiety attacks, no prior psychiatric contact, had never been suicidal and had never been psychiatrically hospitalized.\u201d He also penned: \u201cMr. Croteau reported that his boss [KS] did not get on his case until November of 2003.\u201d\n[153] Dr. Chad indicated that Mr. Croteau said that he has one to two anxiety attacks a day and can\u2019t concentrate: \u201cI can\u2019t even unload a dishwasher without messing it up.\u201d This was problematic given the dangerous work involved as a train conductor. He then wrote: \u201cMr. Croteau feels that he is essentially anxious as a result of work related stress and his fear of being fired.\u201d At page 7, the doctor stated: \u201cMr. Croteau was asked whether he thought he was able to work for another boss at this time and responded \u201cabsolutely\u201d. He indicated that he thinks he can work if his work issues are settled.\u201d The concept of \u201cwork issues being settled or resolved\u201d will become a key part of the diagnosis and RTW attempts. Dr. Chad indicated that the Complainant remarked that since December 2003 \u201chis boss [KS] started getting on his case for his attendance and having accidents.\u201d Dr. Chad also wrote that Mr. Croteau said that \u201che has a lawyer regarding his harassment suit and intimidation suit with Human Rights.\u201d\n[154] Dr. Chad indicated that the Complainant presented as \u201creasonably clear\u201d and \u201ccoherent\u201d. \u201cOverall, he did not appear to be significantly depressed or anxious\u2026There was no indication of any psychotic thinking.\u201d From a diagnostic standpoint according to the DSM-IV, Dr. Chad said Axis I \u201cAdjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and Occupational Problem\u201d applies. He wrote at pp. 13-14:\nThe history suggests that Mr. Croteau developed an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood in relation to his general work related stress and the problems with his boss, and the pain with his [personal medical issue]. He does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a Major Depressive Episode at this time. Similarly, he does not meet the diagnostic criteria for an Anxiety Disorder at this time. In that work related issues are significant precipitating factors to him getting depressed, anxious and stopping and continuing to remain off work, he also has an Occupational Problem.\n\u2026 \u2026\nWhile Mr. Croteau may continue to have some intermittent mild mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression, these are not generally of a nature or severity that are consistent with him being totally disabled from working at this time, if work related issues were sorted out.\n[155] Again, at p. 14, Dr. Chad writes:\nMr. Croteau\u2019s current psychiatric symptoms are not at a severe enough level that should be preventing him from returning back to work on a full-time basis as soon as work related issues are sorted out. In the absence of sorting out work related issues, he would be probably too anxious to perform in a safe effective manner as a result of his anxiety and decreased concentration.\n[156] Finally, he concludes:\nIf work related issues were sorted out, Mr. Croteau should be able to work on a regular full-time basis at this time without any restrictions due to psychiatric factors. He is in agreement with this\u2026The prognosis for continued improvement is good provided that his work related issues are sorted out. [My emphasis.]\n[157] It is important to note that, as of June 10, 2004, psychiatrist Dr. Chad is telling CN that Mr. Croteau could RTW full-time as a train conductor \u201cwithout any restrictions due to psychiatric factors\u201d so long as \u201cwork related issues were sorted out\u201d. At that point, \u201cwork related issues\u201d are the conflict between the Complainant and KS and TC.\n[158] On August 25, 2004, Mr. Croteau had his first session with Dr. AB. On November 5, 2004, Dr. AB wrote: \u201cIt appears that Mr. Croteau\u2019s return to work is on hold, due to more legal type issues, and not so much related to psychology.\u201d\nThe Second IME Report dated January 4, 2005\n[159] Seven months later, Dr. Chad sees the Complainant again for a second IME. At this point, Mr. Croteau was still off work and in receipt of benefits. He had filed his internal harassment complaint and was pursuing a complaint with the PCC regarding the surveillance issue. Dr. Chad reported that the Complainant said he was having problems sleeping at night and experiencing panic attacks and poor concentration.\n[160] At pp. 8-9, Dr. Chad states: \u201cMr. Croteau was asked why he has not returned back to work as yet and responded that this is as a result of work issues not having been sorted out. Mr. Croteau indicated that if CN were to allow him back now, he would not want to go back until the work issues were sorted out. If the two bosses [KS and TC] with whom he has complaints were not there, he would go back at this time\u2026\u201cI\u2019m not going to set myself up for revenge.\u201d\u201d\n[161] Dr. Chad makes the following diagnosis at pp. 13-14:\nHe appears to have gotten stressed out and to have developed an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\u2026He does not meet the full diagnostic criteria for an Anxiety Disorder. He does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\u2026In that work related issues are the major precipitating and perpetuating factors to him getting stressed out, anxious and stopping and continuing to remain off work, he also has an Occupational Problem.\n\u2026 \u2026\nWhile Mr. Croteau may continue to suffer from some intermittent mild mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression, these are not generally of a nature or severity that are consistent with him being unable to work at this time\u2026He should be able to meet with his employer at this time and deal with work related issues.\n\u2026 \u2026\nIf Mr. Croteau were to return back to work at this time, without work related issues having been sorted out, he may have some difficulties performing at his regular tasks as a result of anxiety, some concentration difficulties and some difficulties with his attention span. Not dealing with work related issues, will only perpetuate his mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression and prolong his absence from work\u2026\n\u2026 \u2026\nIf work related issues are dealt with, there need not be any specific restrictions regarding Mr. Croteau returning back to work on a regular full time basis\u2026Mr. Croteau does not require any psychotropic medications at this time. A referral to a psychiatrist at this time is not necessary\u2026The main intervention that is necessary at this time is to sort out his work related issues. This appears to be more of a work related issue than a psychiatric disability issue. [My emphasis.]\n[162] In January 2005, with CN having received Dr. Chad\u2019s second IME, RMO Bob Leonard wrote the Complainant indicating that he would like to meet to discuss Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW. This was met with fierce, over-the-top opposition from both the Complainant and the Union who was acting on behalf of the Complainant. They did not even want to meet to discuss the RTW. Mr. Croteau stated that he thought CN was trying to force him back to work as a conductor too soon. I do not accept this. The evidence is clear that what was being proposed was simply a pre-RTW meeting. I agree with Mr. McFadden\u2019s submission that this constituted an unjustifiable refusal to participate in the \u201caccommodation dialogue\u201d and could have resulted in serious consequences to Mr. Croteau, including arguably dismissal.\n[163] On March 1, 2005, a key meeting took place to discuss the Complainant\u2019s internal harassment complaint against KS and TC. The Memo to File indicates that the Union wanted to discuss RTW, but Mr. Gallagher responded that the meeting was called to deal with Mr. Croteau\u2019s internal harassment complaint. Note that at this point in time, the Complainant was also aware of CN\u2019s surveillance of him via a private investigation firm and was clearly exhibiting signs of anxiety related disorders. The meeting was with Mr. Gallagher, the Complainant and his wife, and three senior Union members. During this meeting Mr. Croteau presented his \u201cwish list\u201d to resolve the internal harassment complaint. \u201cI was going by what the Union wanted,\u201d said Mr. Croteau on the witness stand. Mr. McFadden suggested that he was trying \u201cto hide behind the Union\u201d and blame it. The Complainant disagreed. Mr. Gallagher came right out and said it was not a \u201cflexible\u201d list and urged them to do some \u201chorse-trading, and negotiate.\u201d After reviewing the testimonies of the Complainant and Mr. Gallagher and the list as found in the Memo to File entered as an exhibit, I find that Mr. Croteau wanted inter alia:\n(1) KS and TC punished, disciplined, and perhaps even fired;\n(2) An apology from CN and from both KS and TC to Mr. Croteau and his family;\n(3) Compensation for lost earnings\/benefits.\n[164] In the Memo to File, Mr. Gallagher wrote: \u201cI sought clarification of the remedy [s]ought by Mr. Croteau. Following a rather lengthy caucus Mr. Croteau brought forth the following reply: \u201cAs a remedy must be a deterrent 1 Dollar may be too much and 1 Million dollars may not be enough, we will not know until the process is over.\u201d\u201d The Complainant testified about its meaning: \u201cIf Mr. Gallagher did a proper human rights investigation, at the end of the day, I wasn\u2019t looking for money. The Union told me this.\u201d Mr. McFadden responded by asking the Complainant how he expected CN to respond to such a proposal? He answered, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. My intention was to wake up the HR department.\u201d CN\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cYour purpose was to design a settlement that was somewhat ridiculous so they won\u2019t talk to you anymore?\u201d The Complainant disagreed. When I interjected and suggested that it might look like a roadblock or obstacle to CN, the Complainant replied: \u201cYou may be right. The Union dropped me shortly after\u2026I can appreciate that CN might see it as this guy doesn\u2019t want to settle, return to work.\u201d I too can see how Mr. Gallagher and CN came to this conclusion \u2013 that in order to heal and RTW, the above \u201cwish list\u201d needed to be agreed to by CN.\n[165] What is remarkable about the above is that just a couple weeks earlier, Mr. Croteau and the Union were refusing to even meet to discuss a RTW. Yet Mr. Croteau stated at the March 1, 2005 meeting that if CN agreed to the \u201cwish list\u201d, he would RTW as a conductor immediately and without restrictions. Mr. McFadden cross examined him on this issue and asked: \u201cThe memo says if the conditions are met, you would be back to work in March 2005 in your full, unrestricted duties as a conductor, yet you said today that you couldn\u2019t, you were in bad shape then?\u201d Mr. Croteau answered, \u201cI see your point.\u201d This makes me question his credibility and bona fides about returning to work during this period. It also lends credence to CN\u2019s argument that Mr. Croteau always had an \u201cAlternative Plan\u201d \u2013 pursue his internal harassment complaint, \u201cwait for the PCC report\u201d, \u201cgo to CROA [grievance]\u201d, and wait until his disability benefits run out\u2013 but not to RTW. I note too at page 2 of his prospective \u201cjudicial review\u201d of the CROA arbitration dismissal (sent to the Federal Court, the Canadian Judicial Council, the PCC, etc. but never actually filed as a judicial review application), Mr. Croteau wrote: \u201cFor the past three years I have been cooperating with my union\u2019s decisions in regards to their plan of action for having me remain off work due to my illness in which I was receiving long term disability while awaiting the outcome of the Privacy Commission\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n[166] The Complainant attacked Mr. Gallagher\u2019s harassment investigation, both in terms of the conclusion and its process. Based on my review of the evidence, I find that Mr. Gallagher\u2019s (and that of Ms. Fusco who worked on it before going on leave) investigation was fair and reasonable, both in its process and conclusion. The investigation process consisted of the following: CN\u2019s Human Resources department received the written complaint which was longer and more detailed than most and reviewed it; they contacted the alleged perpetrators for their written response; Ms. Fusco made a chart comparing who had said what on different topics; a meeting was held on March 1, 2005 with the Complainant, his wife and Union representatives; Mr. Gallagher made it clear that he would accept further submissions from the Union following the meeting which it never sent; Mr. Gallagher also invited the Union to send any further evidence in support of the complaint, which it did (tapes of conversations between Mr. Croteau and TC); Mr. Gallagher invited a senior colleague unfamiliar with the complaint to listen to the tapes and provide his opinion.\n[167] Mr. Croteau was given a fair chance to present his harassment case to Mr. Gallagher. The latter came to a different conclusion from Mr. Croteau. Mr. Gallagher concluded that there was no merit to the harassment allegations against KS and TC. At most, KS may have been \u201cassertive\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d toward Mr. Croteau, but that did not constitute harassment. I appreciate that Mr. Croteau did not agree with Mr. Gallagher\u2019s conclusion, but at some point, there must be finality to the process.\n[168] During this period as noted, Mr. Croteau was on leave receiving disability benefits and therefore not able to work. However, CN did do things to assist in his eventual RTW during this time. First, CN had dealt with the \u201cwork related issues\u201d as identified by Dr. Chad: i.e., KS and TC. KS was promoted to a job in Oakville in the summer of 2004 and Mr. Mau filled in the spot of TC if any interaction with the Complainant by TC was needed. Second, CN was making efforts to find the Complainant work. CN proposed an accommodated position, that of Fire\/Safety Watch in Sarnia on March 15, 2005. Mr. Croteau wanted to show the offer to Dr. Gannon to see if it was within his restrictions. Two weeks later, on March 28, 2005, Great-West Life accepted his LTD application. Mr. Croteau did not respond to this proposed TWP for nine months. By December 2005, CN had indicated that the position itself no longer existed.\n[169] On November 30, 2005, Dr. AB stated that he agreed that \u201ca graduated return to work, in a non-safety sensitive position, while monitoring his symptomatology, is warranted\u2026\u201d On December, 14, 2005, noting the \u201cserious panic attack\u201d that Mr. Croteau recently had in attempting to RTW, he recommended that his client remain off work for a couple of months.\nC. April 2007-May 2008 Accommodation Period [170] For almost three years (2004-07), Mr. Croteau was on leave, receiving disability benefits. The first significant meeting after his benefits ran out took place on April 4, 2007 at Mac Yard in Concord, north of Toronto. In attendance were Mr. Croteau, Mr. King, the Union representative, Mr. Gallagher, OHS Nurses Jackie Andersen and Marge McCauley (by phone). Mr. Croteau, as he often did, secretly taped the meeting. The tape was played in the hearing. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Complainant\u2019s RTW. From the start, it was quite apparent that Mr. Croteau wanted to re-hash his previous harassment allegations that had been dismissed by Mr. Gallagher when his investigation closed in April 2005. By April 2007, the first of those allegations (the November 19, 2003 conversation in KS\u2019s office) was 3 \u00bd years old. To give credit to Mr. King, he told the Complainant to literally (and figuratively) \u201cclose his [complaint] binders\u201d on this issue and to focus on the RTW. Mr. Croteau said, \u201cI just want to deal with this one set of lies.\u201d At this point, Mr. Croteau had been on leave for three years, receiving a fraction of his pre-disability income. One can see his obsession, persistence, stubbornness \u2013 however one may describe it\u2013 in not letting go of this issue. In his testimony, Dr. AB described Mr. Croteau as someone who \u201cwon\u2019t give up, not in a negative sense\u2026He\u2019s like a dog you give a bone to, doesn\u2019t let it go\u2026He\u2019s extremely principled. When he gets something in his mind, he goes for it.\u201d At this point, CN reasonably interpreted Dr. Chad\u2019s first and second IME as indicating the non-\u201cpsychiatric factors\u201d at play were the \u201cwork related issues\u201d of KS and TC. However, looking back now and hindsight being 20\/20, it is apparent that the \u201cwork related issues\u201d had expanded beyond the prevention of any interaction of KS and TC with Mr. Croteau to include the surveillance, the harassment investigation process and its conclusion\/findings.\n[171] At this April 4, 2007 meeting, several topics were discussed:\n(1) Mr. Gallagher reassured Mr. Croteau that the deferred discipline penalty in 2006 had been expunged from his record and he sent a letter immediately after the meeting to that effect. Mr. Croteau acknowledged that \u201cit was a good start\u201d;\n(2) Mr. Croteau wanted to be paid the \u201cbelt pack rate\u201d for a full day\u2019s work when he returned to work, even if he worked for less than the standard eight hour shift. Mr. Gallagher said he would look into this. He did and emailed Denis Fournier at CN Payroll department. Mr. Croteau said that he was \u201cpromised\u201d that he would be paid at this rate. My review of the evidence suggests otherwise. One can hear Mr. King on the tape saying that they would like CN to consider doing so and Mr. Gallagher agreed to look into it;\n(3) The issue of RTW and location was discussed. On the tape, Mr. Croteau said: \u201cI will return to work at Sarnia.\u201d Listening to the tape and reviewing the other evidence (viva voce and documentary), I find that CN reasonably thought that Mr. Croteau was only interested in RTW at the Sarnia terminal, and nowhere else.\n[172] There is no question that this was an emotional meeting. Mr. Croteau was \u201cbawling\u201d and crying in the meeting. According to the Complainant\u2019s testimony, shortly after this meeting, the Union (who he said thought Mr. Gallagher\u2019s investigation report was \u201ccorrect\u201d) \u201cdropped him\u201d and the relationship between the Union and Mr. Croteau became negative and adversarial, leading to the Complainant\u2019s launching a section 37 Duty of Fair Representation complaint with the Canada Industrial Relations Board (\u201cCIRB\u201d).\nD. The Five RTW Attempts [173] CN\u2019s plan, in cooperation with the Complainant and Union, was to ease the Complainant back into the workplace, with the eventual goal of returning him to his pre-injury\/disability job of conductor. This was in keeping with the diagnosis and restrictions as set out by Dr. Chad and Dr. Gannon. There was no set time etched in stone, but clearly progress was to be made to that eventual goal of returning to the conductor\u2019s position.\n[174] CN agreed to pay for the Complainant to see Dr. AB in a \u201cdesensitization\u201d program. Initially, it was difficult for Mr. Croteau to even physically enter CN\u2019s terminal in Sarnia. CN ended up paying for Dr. AB\u2019s counseling for approximately one year, longer than originally anticipated and approved. The program was to start with Mr. Croteau working with Dr. AB on the basics of going \u201con the property\u201d and then \u201cde-briefing\u201d. Dr. AB would be paid to attend on-site with the Complainant. Hopefully, the Complainant would improve to the point of being able to start a TWP. As Mr. Croteau could do more, more tasks would be assigned. Assessment would be ongoing, with the confidentiality \u201cwall\u201d remaining between OHS and RTW and operations.\ni. Attempt #1: Job-shadowing Rover Joe Russell [175] In August 2007, CN proposed that the Complainant job-shadow rover Joe Russell on the night shift. A TWP was created with the erstwhile four conditions\/restrictions. On August 15, 2007, there was a conference call between Ms. Paquet, the Complainant and Dr. AB to discuss the TWP.\n[176] The rover position is safety-sensitive and curtailed by Mr. Croteau\u2019s restrictions. However, Mr. Croteau would be only \u201cshadowing\u201d the rover. This accommodated\/RTW plan lasted for only one shift. CN\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Leger, who by statute and the Canadian Railway Medical Rules Handbook (\u201cMedical Rules Handbook\u201d), has final say on TWPs essentially vetoed this TWP. He felt that because \u201cshadowing\u201d implies the employee can assume the job, he had concerns about the safety-sensitive components of the job vis-\u00e0-vis Mr. Croteau.\nii. Attempt #2: Administrative\/Clerical Work with Tino and Robinson [177] On August 22, 2007, Ms. Paquet had a telephone conversation with Dr. AB who agreed to a clerical position for the Complainant and told Ms. Paquet that \u201che expects the employee to return to his conductor job.\u201d On September 17, 2007, OHS received a medical update indicating that the Complainant would be better suited to clerical work given his condition and restrictions. A meeting took place among Mr. Gallagher, Ms. Paquet, Will Nolan and the Complainant. An 8-week TWP was developed that would involve doing administrative\/clerical work under the supervision of supervisor Brian Tino and later Debbie Robinson, who \u201ccut and paste\u201d and \u201cscrounged up\u201d work for Mr. Croteau to do. It was clearly a make-work project. (I note that Sarnia no longer has such positions.) However, as Ms. Paquet logically pointed out in her testimony, there is still some \u201cvalue\u201d to CN to have an accommodated employee back on-site, that there is a therapeutic aspect to having the employee back in the workplace. This accommodated work lasted for approximately one month.\niii. Attempt #3: Shadowing Rover LG [178] Consistent with the medical reports and updates, it was decided that it would be useful to achieving the eventual and ultimate goal of RTW as a conductor to have the Complainant \u201cin the field\u201d rather than in an office doing make-work \u201cpaper-work\u201d. A TWP was created that would have Mr. Croteau job-shadow morning\/day rover LG, who occupied the position herself as an accommodative measure. Again, the goal was to \u201cshadow\u201d first, then actually do the rover tasks and eventually RTW as a conductor.\n[179] Mr. Croteau commenced this job-shadowing on October 17, 2007. It lasted less than two months due to a serious \u201cpersonality conflict\u201d between the Complainant and LG. The Complainant said that LG called him a \u201cmental freak\u201d and he accused her of doing personal errands on company time. LG accused him of always \u201cbad-mouthing\u201d the company and other things. It is clear that it was not working out and the two of them needed to be separated.\n[180] On November 1, 2007, OHS received a medical update that the Complainant would be required to decrease his work hours back to six hours per day over a 3-4 week period. As with all other medical recommendations, CN complied.\niv. Attempt #4: Radio Inventory Clerk [181] The next TWP was for the position of radio inventory clerk, gathering and re-numbering radios in the basement. This took place from December 13, 2007-April 12, 2008 \u2013 four months. It is clear from Mr. Croteau\u2019s testimony and the documentary evidence that he was bored in this job and wanted more responsibility. As well, he testified that sometimes he had no more than \u00bd-1 hour\u2019s worth of productive work in a day. He testified that often he would read technical journals. This was clearly a make-work project, of little value to CN, other than as Ms. Paquet said earlier, getting him back into the cycle of working on site and with other CN employees. As she correctly pointed out, often there\u2019s a barrier just getting the employee physically back to the job site. Other employers might not have seen it as a useful exercise. To CN\u2019s credit, it did.\n[182] By December of 2007, CN was getting concerned that Mr. Croteau\u2019s progress had hit a plateau and that he was no closer to returning to work as a conductor then as he was in April 2007. Brian Tino, who on \u201cgood terms\u201d with Mr. Croteau and who supervised him during his clerical and radio inventory TWPs, sent an email on December 14, 2007 to Ms. Andersen at OHS and copied to several CN people involved in Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW program. He asks Ms. Anderson to \u201carrange to review all medical reports on Mr. Croteau to determine his future status.\u201d He is concerned about the apparent lack of progress and \u201clittle improvement\u201d: \u201c\u2026[W]e have progressed to 6 hours and seem to be stuck there.\u201d He says that they need to assess the situation to see if he will \u201cever reach\u201d his pre-injury\/disability duties as a conductor \u201cin Sarnia.\u201d There is clearly an understandable frustration at the lack of progress and where to go from there. But he is taking the correct path: reassess Mr. Croteau\u2019s status, taking into account the medical condition and restrictions. CN then decides to get IME #3. As Ms. Smolynec testified, ordering costly IMEs is not common for RTW cases at CN; having three is highly unusual. But to CN\u2019s credit, it went ahead and had Dr. Chad perform his third IME. I note that the Complainant resisted having a third IME done, insisting that he was \u201cimproving all the time.\u201d\n[183] CN also received a completed CN form - Medical Report on Mental Health - from Dr. Gannon dated January 17, 2008. Surprisingly, Dr. Gannon wrote: \u201cPatient is improving \u2013 prognosis is good.\u201d\n[184] In a letter incorrectly dated November 29, 2008 but which Dr. AB believes was written by him sometime after November, 29, 2007 (not 2008) but before April 20, 2008, he stated:\nAs you know, Mr. Croteau continues to have panic attacks at work.\n\u2026 \u2026\nIn discussing these attacks with Mr. Croteau, we have ascertained a certain pattern to them, that they seem to be precipitated by certain events or activities related to \u201cpolitics in the workplace,\u201d e.g., hearing other workers complain of job conditions, dealing with supervisors, reading upsetting notices on the bulletin board, etc.\nDr. AB was recommending that Mr. Croteau be placed outside of the \u201coffice environment\u201d and in the yard with the trains as that \u201cmight be beneficial, in that being out in the yard he would be removed from the things which have been triggering his panic.\u201d\nThe Third IME Report dated February 3, 2008\n[185] By January 2008, after five months of RTW attempts, CN was seeing no real improvement in terms of Mr. Croteau progressing to the ultimate goal of returning to his pre-disability job of train conductor. It looked as if Mr. Croteau had hit an improvement-plateau; hence, the decision to get a third IME.\n[186] At p. 5, Dr. Chad writes:\nMr. Croteau reported that his goal is to return back to his conductor\u2019s job\u2026Mr. Croteau reported that essentially, if he got an apology and some compensation for the money he lost, he would feel better\u2026He explained that he won\u2019t quit, because \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u2026Mr. Croteau reported that all of his bosses have changed\u2026He explained, however, that he wants more responsibility.[13]\n[187] At p. 7, Dr. Chad states: \u201cMr. Croteau reported that he wants to return back to his conductor role. \u201cBe the CEO actually\u201d. He explained that he would like to move up in the ranks at CN\u2026Mr. Croteau reported that he continues to have six panic attacks a day when he is working.\u201d\n[188] Dr. Chad made a change of diagnosis in his third IME. He felt that under the DSM-IV Mr. Croteau most fit in the category of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety with a Differential Diagnosis of Panic Disorder and Occupational Problem. In Axis IV, Mr. Croteau was identified to have \u201cMajor recent stressors [that] include his work-related issues and some financial constraints.\u201d\n[189] Dr. Chad continued at p. 12:\nThe history suggests that Mr. Croteau got increasingly stressed out in 03\/04 in relation to his perceived harassment at work\u2026As he continues to have some panic attacks, the differential diagnosis would include a Panic Disorder. There, however, appears to have been some significant improvement regarding his panic attacks since he returned back to work in September of 2007\u2026It is my impression, that if he were gradually given more responsibilities, this would decrease his anxiety level and would speed up his recovery time regarding his panic attacks\u2026His anxiety appears to be largely in relation to work-related issues, and these will need to be sorted out in the work context. [My emphasis.]\n[190] At page 13, Dr. Chad concludes:\nIt is my impression, that Mr. Croteau should be able to gradually increase his responsibility level at work. He should be fit to occupy a safety sensitive critical position, with increasing responsibility. It might be helpful for him to initially, at least, get involved in such a position in a shadowing role and then initially, at least, be more closely supervised\u2026It is my impression, that restricting his responsibilities has been inadvertently contributing to his anxiety level at work and to his panic attacks. It is my impression that a gradual increase in his responsibilities would be paralleled by a decrease in his anxiety level.\n[191] What I gather from the three IMEs is that Mr. Croteau, according to Dr. Chad, suffered from an Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Occupational Problem that by the time of the third IME included the Differential Diagnosis of Panic Disorder. What is also quite noticeable is the prolific use of the phrase \u201cwork-related issues\u201d throughout the three IMEs. At first, they seemed to be identified by Dr. Chad as interaction with KS and TC only, based on what Mr Croteau had told him. However, once those two managers were no longer in the picture, the \u201cwork-related issues\u201d continued and even expanded with the introduction of the revealing of surveillance of Mr. Croteau and the conclusion of the Gallagher investigation with a result not to the liking of the Complainant. I will come back to the key matter of \u201cwork-related issues\u201d later in these Reasons.\nv. Attempt #5: Rover-shadow Position [192] As indicated above, in Dr. Chad\u2019s third IME dated February 3, 2008, he recommended inter alia that the Complainant be given increased responsibilities as a way of improving his progress toward the eventual goal of a RTW as a conductor. He suggested it be outside of the office, non-clerical, i.e., job shadowing, subject of course to CN CMO\u2019s review and approval. Dr. Chad maintained the four restrictions. This was also consistent with Dr. AB\u2019s letter written sometime after November 29, 2007. In response to his IME, as it had done in the past, CN followed the recommendation and created a TWP for shadowing the night Rover. Remember that the Medical Rules Handbook requires that safety-critical employees (e.g., conductors) be \u201csymptom-free\u201d for six months before returning to their job.\n[193] Dr. Leger approved the rover-shadow position. The plan was for night rover Charlie Knight to train Mr. Croteau as he shadowed Mr. Knight. When Mr. Croteau was ready to assume the rover position, Mr. Knight would move into the afternoon shift, as afternoon Joe Russell was returning to his regular position. Mr. Croteau made it clear in his complaint to the PCC and in his testimony that he thought CN was placing him in the night shift slot due to his upcoming CROA arbitration, so that he could not prepare for it presumably. As Mr. McFadden argued, Mr. Croteau was telling Dr. Chad in the third IME that he wanted more responsibility and wanted to eventually RTW as a conductor. Counsel rhetorically asked: \u201cWhat did that mean? Do more radio inventory work?\u201d Here CN was acceding to his wishes and Dr. Chad\u2019s recommendation.\n[194] On April 7, 2008, Ms. Paquet sent a letter to Mr. Croteau regarding shadowing the midnight rover. It said if he had \u201cany questions or concerns\u201d to contact her. He responded on April 9th with his concerns: (1) he didn\u2019t want to job-shadow a different person each night; and (2) those persons would know his confidential medical information. He stated that he could not move to a night position on such short notice, so his start-date was delayed. Ms. Paquet wrote back on April 25, 2008 that he would not be working with a different person every night, but in fact the same person; that Mr. Tino would stay as his contact person; and that only his restrictions would be conveyed and only when necessary. She also addressed what she considered a \u201cthreat\u201d in his letter. As well, she said that his CROA arbitration should have no impact on his RTW program.\n[195] Unbeknownst to Ms. Paquet, on April 16, 2008, Mr. Croteau had submitted a letter from Dr. Gannon restricting him from the night shift. It naturally went to OHS. It then notified her of this new restriction (It had never been raised previously in Dr. Chad\u2019s IME, or by Drs. Gannon or AB). Of note during Dr. AB\u2019s cross-examination, he stated that from his reading of Dr. Gannon\u2019s letter, Dr. Gannon wasn\u2019t just saying \u201cno night shift\u201d but he also meant place Mr. Croteau on the morning\/day shift. I do not agree with Dr. AB\u2019s interpretation of Dr. Gannon\u2019s letter.\n[196] The Complainant argues that he could not work the night shift because he had become used to working earlier shifts in previous accommodated positions, he was experiencing profound insomnia and that he couldn\u2019t speak to his wife on the night shift (22:00-06:00 hrs.). CN argues that he suddenly raised this objection and got Dr. Gannon to sign a letter to that effect because he wanted the time during the day to prepare for his upcoming CROA hearing. Mr. Croteau testified that the paper-work and preparation were already complete. His wife testified that they were quite busy during this period \u2013 \u201ca lot was happening.\u201d I have some sympathy for Mr. Croteau\u2019s position regarding his reasons for objecting to the night shift. In any event, as in the past, as \u201ccoincidental\u201d or \u201csuspicious\u201d as this sudden shift restriction appeared to be, CN acceded to the medically-backed request. Mr. Croteau ended up only working one week on the night shift.\n[197] CN made arrangements then with rover Knight to have Mr. Croteau shadow him on the afternoon shift, and when Mr. Croteau was ready to move into the rover position, Mr. Knight would then move back into the night shift so that Mr. Croteau could have the afternoon shift (14:00-22:00 hrs.). A job offer went out to Mr. Croteau to work the afternoon shift. On April 30, 2008, OHS received another medical update \u2013 this time from Dr. AB \u2013 indicating that the Complainant could not work afternoons and instead suggesting that he work with a Yardmaster (a Safety Critical position that can be called upon to work any shift). Normally CN would rely on notes from physicians. This is the first time that it had relied solely on psychologist Dr. AB\u2019s recommendation alone when it came to the imposition of, or change to, work restrictions. In any event, CN agreed and by this time, Mr. Croteau had only worked two afternoon rover-shadow shifts.\n[198] It was clear to CN at this point that Mr. Croteau\u2019s preference and only medical clearance was for the morning\/day rover-shadowing position. It is clear from the evidence that CN was not prepared to agree to this as LG was being accommodated in the rover position. Because of the interpersonal conflict between the two earlier, bringing them back together was not a viable option. I agree. Furthermore, CN could not displace one accommodated employee for another. That said, Ms. Paquet suggested that Ms. Reaume, the Union representative, might speak with LG to see if she would be agreeable to a move to another slot. The Union never got back to Ms. Paquet.\nE. May 6, 2008: Mr. Croteau Placed \u201cOut of Service\u201d \u2013 leave without pay [199] At this point, CN was running out of options for Mr. Croteau. Mr. Gallagher stated in an email on April 30, 2008 that he wanted a conference call set up as soon as possible to discuss the next steps. It never took place. No explanation has been provided by CN. Instead, on May 6, 2008, Ms. Paquet had sent a letter to Mr. Croteau and telephoned him, advising the Complainant that, as there was no available, productive work for him within the four restrictions, he was being put \u201cout of service\u201d or on unpaid leave of absence. CN would continue to look for work for him that met his restrictions. This was a devastating moment for Mr. Croteau, as he testified; an emotion-laden situation for sure. Ms. Paquet testified that on the call, but not in the letter, she had asked Mr. Croteau if he would be willing to relocate outside of Sarnia, but that he did not reply. She also suggested that he speak with Ms. Reaume, his Union representative, to see if arrangements could be made with LG to move her from the morning\/day shift.\n[200] Mr. Croteau was cross-examined on the issue of whether he responded to Ms. Paquet\u2019s question about being willing to relocate outside of Sarnia:\nA. It sounds familiar.\nQ. She will testify that you didn\u2019t respond until the January hearing.\nA. I said, \u201cThat would be no problem\u201d I\u2019m sure. I would have said, \u201cDo something.\u201d\nQ. Her evidence will be that you didn\u2019t say anything.\nA. Why wouldn\u2019t I have answered?\nQ. In the January hearing, Member Garfield asked if you ever told CN that, you said \u201cI don\u2019t think I told them, but would never have said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d Now you\u2019re saying you did?\nA. \u2026It\u2019s familiar, it\u2019s not in stone.\nMr. Croteau\u2019s answers above are convoluted, vague and contradictory. I appreciate that he was quite upset during that phone call. I prefer Ms. Paquet\u2019s evidence on this point. On a balance of probabilities, I find that Mr. Croteau did not respond to this question during the call, nor afterward until the hearing in 2012.\nF. Post-May 6, 2008 Events [201] On July 14, 2008, Arbitrator Picher dismissed the CROA harassment grievance due to delay (doctrine of laches). Incidentally, it was during this arbitration hearing that Mr. Croteau saw KS for the first time since 2004.\n[202] On August 13, 2008, Ms. Reaume asked Ms. Paquet for a new TWP, indicating that all shift restrictions were now removed. CN responded that it would require updated medical restrictions from Mr. Croteau\u2019s physician. This was provided by Dr. Gannon two weeks later: no shift restrictions, but still a safety-critical work restriction. (I note that while seeking accommodative work, at the same time Mr. Croteau was also seeking LTD benefits, meaning that he was essentially unable to work. I also note at this time that he and his family were experiencing serious financial problems.)\n[203] Dr. AB wrote a subsequent letter to CN dated August 27, 2008 indicating that \u201cMr. Croteau\u2019s psychological difficulties prevent him from returning to his previous employment as a conductor at CN, but that he is now able to return to work on modified duties.\u201d In his final letter placed into evidence dated April 20, 2009, Dr. AB wrote to CN \u201cto clarify my position with respect to his work capabilities.\u201d He reiterated that the Complainant\u2019s \u201conly work place restriction is not to work in a safety sensitive position.\u201d Though not labelling it as a \u201crestriction per se\u201d, he recommended a day shift for Mr. Croteau.\n[204] On September 22, 2008, Mr. Croteau filed a section 37 Canada Labour Code complaint against his Union for unfair representation. He testified that at this point he felt his Union had been colluding and \u201cin cahoots\u201d with CN against his interests. The CIRB dismissed his application on May 12, 2009. Of interest at page 5, the Board wrote: \u201cThe Board is not a grievance arbitrator and does not determine whether CN abided by its human rights obligations. But the Board does note, and Mr. Croteau did not contest, that there have been a significant number of attempts to find Mr. Croteau work that fit within his changing limitations.\u201d I agree.\nMeeting with the Complainant, Ms. Fusco and Others on December 3, 2008\n[205] On October 14, 2008, Mr. Croteau made further allegations that he had been harassed at CN post-July 14, 2008. Ms. Fusco contacted him and sent him an agenda for a meeting at Mac Yard in Concord scheduled for December 3, 2008 to discuss these new allegations.\n[206] The meeting lasted approximately 18 minutes. It was attended by Ms. Fusco, Mr. Schenk, Mr. Croteau and Dr. AB (who as mentioned earlier was introduced as a \u201cfriend\u201d and not by his professional role). Mr. Croteau made it clear from the start that he wanted to re-hash the harassment allegations going back to 2003. Ms. Fusco indicated that these had been thoroughly investigated by Mr. Gallagher and that the matter had been closed in April 2005 \u2013 over 3 \u00bd years ago. Mr. Croteau responded: \u201cIf [CN] cannot accept that there has been harassment prior to July 2008, then we have nothing to talk about.\u201d He was visibly upset and called CN \u201cliars\u201d. However, he and Dr. AB confirmed that there were no new harassment allegations. Ms. Fusco then \u201cshifted the tone of the meeting and confirmed with Pierre that he was currently off sick and that he had restrictions.\u201d The meeting ended shortly thereafter.\n[207] On December 16, 2008, Ms. Fusco sent him a follow-up letter to the December 3, 2008 meeting \u201c\u2026wherein you requested that I review your restrictions to determine whether or not there was suitable work for you in Sarnia.\u201d [Emphasis added.] He replied by letter with some concerns and clarifications on January 5, 2009. As will be discussed later, while CN continued in its efforts to look for suitable, available work for Mr. Croteau, there was no further communication from CN on this subject until the Tribunal hearing in 2012. No updates from CN, nothing.\n[208] Since being put on leave without pay in May 2008, Mr. Croteau has been working part-time at Princess Auto in Sarnia. He testified that he experienced a significant panic attack when one of the managers got fired. To his credit, in 2009 he went back to school at Lambton College. He also applied for various jobs, including with the Canadian Coast Guard. I find that he has made reasonable, laudable efforts to mitigate his wage loss.\nG. May 2008-June 2013 Accommodation Efforts including the Job Search Radius [209] As Mr. McFadden correctly acknowledged, as Mr. Croteau remains employed with CN, it has an ongoing obligation to accommodate his disability to the point of undue hardship or, in other words, provide reasonable accommodation.\n[210] As will be discussed later, it is CN\u2019s position that until Mr. Croteau\u2019s testimony in January of 2012, it did not know, or could not be reasonably deemed to have known, that Mr. Croteau was willing to relocate outside of Sarnia. I agree. It is clear from the April 4, 2007 meeting (and the December 3, 2008 meeting too for that matter) that he was only willing to stay in Sarnia. Based on the evidence before me, I find that Ms. Fusco confirmed his restrictions at the December 3, 2008 meeting and that she would speak with Ms. Paquet to \u201csee if there were any positions available for him in a non-safety critical capacity at Sarnia.\u201d At no point, did he correct her and suggest that CN look beyond Sarnia. She sent him a confirmatory and a \u201cfollow-up\u201d letter, both dated December 16, 2008: \u201cWe will continue to review the positions at Sarnia against any new medical information that is provided to us.\u201d In his reply of January 5, 2009, he corrected her on a couple of points, but not on the important issue of the job search radius being limited to Sarnia.\n[211] In Ms. Reaume\u2019s email to CN dated August 13, 2008 exploring a possible RTW for Mr. Croteau, she too focused on jobs in Sarnia. It is manifest in the evidence that the Union too was of the belief that Mr. Croteau was only interested in accommodated work in the location of Sarnia.\n[212] When did it become clear that Mr. Croteau was willing to relocate outside of Sarnia? The answer is: at the hearing in January 2012. While testifying, he averred that he would have worked outside of Sarnia and that he felt that CN should have realized that. At one point, he insisted that he had told CN that. Then he recanted and stated that CN should have inferred his willingness to leave Sarnia from his letters such as the comment in one of them that he wanted to come back to CN.\n[213] I noted this development at the hearing and directed that Mr. Croteau advise CN of the appropriate search parametres. As a result, Ms. Cialone wrote a letter to Mr. Croteau dated May 22, 2012 indicating that she understood that Mr. Croteau was now interested in an accommodated position even outside of Sarnia. She suggested that \u201ca nearby large center such as Toronto [Mac Yard is CN\u2019s biggest terminal] would yield the best opportunities\u2026If no such positions are available, CN could extend its search to other regions. Please indicate whether or not you would be willing to relocate to the Toronto area\u2026\u201d Mr. Croteau replied through his counsel in a letter dated June 5, 2012. Mr. Bolter stated that his client takes the position that he was never unwilling to consider work in other locations. He said that Mr. Croteau\u2019s preference was Sarnia, \u201cor as close to Sarnia as possible\u201d, but that he would be wiling to relocate to Toronto for a \u201creasonably stable\u201d position. In the next paragraph he then referred to a position \u201cin Toronto or elsewhere.\u201d At this point, it was clear that Mr. Croteau was willing to relocate to the Toronto area. How far \u201cor elsewhere\u201d extended to in his mind I did not know for certain until the last day of the evidentiary part of the hearing \u2013 June 12, 2013. In reply evidence, Mr. Croteau was clear and unambiguous for the first time on this topic: he would be willing to relocate anywhere, from \u201ccoast to coast to coast\u201d in Canada.\n[214] What is interesting is that, notwithstanding the ambiguity about the search radius extending beyond Sarnia, and the miscommunication between the Complainant and CN on this point, CN had in fact been searching for suitable, available work for Mr. Croteau beyond Sarnia while he has been on unpaid leave.\n[215] Laura Waller, a RTW Co-ordinator at CN who recently took over the files of colleague Tania Cialone (who went on maternity leave), testified at the hearing. Also entered into evidence were emails from both Ms. Waller and Ms. Cialone dealing with RTW efforts made while Mr. Croteau was on unpaid leave. Ms. Waller testified about the monthly national \u201ccomplex cases\u201d conference calls at CN aimed at finding accommodated positions for injured\/disabled employees. Represented on the calls are OHS, Human Resources, Labour Relations and Ms. Waller\u2019s RTW group. They go over the files of the relevant employees to try to match them with available accommodated jobs. OHS does not share the diagnosis or other confidential medical information with the other participants. Ms. Waller stated that said employees usually remain on the list for a few years so the group becomes familiar with their circumstances and restrictions. No Minutes of the meetings, spread sheet or written confirmation of the content of said calls was entered into evidence. CN\u2019s counsel said that such documentary evidence contained privileged information as that department had been merged with the legal department at CN. Mr. Bolter did not challenge that these monthly complex conference calls took place; rather, that we don\u2019t know if Mr. Croteau\u2019s name came up on every call and that the meetings didn\u2019t \u201caddress his unique needs and issues.\u201d While I find it odd that there was no written information of said \u201ccomplex calls\u201d produced at the hearing, I accept the testimony of Ms. Waller. She was credible.\n[216] Ms. Waller said that she has been looking for a clerical job for one employee with similar restrictions to Mr. Croteau\u2019s to no avail since 2008 in the Greater Toronto Area. Some of her searches also occurred in 2009 and 2010 for clerical\/sedentary work. She remarked:\n[At Mac Yard for accommodation] it\u2019s very difficult right now because there aren\u2019t that many open positions that are not safety critical\/safety sensitive\u2026There hasn\u2019t been any other jobs posted, so unfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of movement on the accommodation list\u2026It\u2019s been over a year or more [since the last clerical job accommodation at Mac Yard]\u2026The only bulletin that came out was the CAW [Canadian Auto Workers union] bulletin [for the crew-dispatcher positions].\n[217] Mr. McFadden asked her about the number of available clerical jobs (non-\u201cSC\/SS\u201d) from May 6, 2008 to present. She answered: \u201cIn Sarnia, none. At Mac Yard, there were clerical jobs within crew dispatch [not SC\/SS] that were filled by the CAW [members]. Not one was filled for accommodation at Mac Yard; Ontario, none.\u201d She indicated that there are no cross-bargaining unit placements for clerical jobs at CN. And there are very few clerical jobs to begin with. She stated that, with Mr. Croteau\u2019s restrictions (e.g., no SC\/SS duties), \u201cIt rules out quite a few jobs, such as those in transportation, engineering department, and some mechanical. It just leaves clerical type work.\u201d\n[218] Ms. Waller also testified in detail about the efforts they made for Mr. Croteau and the possible, available accommodated positions fitting the four restrictions and why they didn\u2019t result in a match:\n(1) Track inspection system: involved work done on the computer, not a physical job, more clerical, a little bit of travelling; but CN didn\u2019t need anyone; it was never filled. She thought it was a funding issue;\n(2) Janitorial work: not available because CN contracts out such work in Eastern Canada. To CN\u2019s credit, her manager contacted the Vice-President, Eastern Canada to see if something could be done. They got a response that CN is not in the janitorial business there. She wasn\u2019t aware of any opportunities outside of Eastern Canada;\n(3) Rover position in Sarnia: no available afternoon rover from 2009-11 and no rover position now for the evening (night) shift;\n(4) Job vacancies in Sarnia between January 2008-November 2010: She wasn\u2019t aware of any such positions. This list was from Ms. Cialone and indicated that they were not applicable because either they were of a SC\/SS nature, or they required a Red Seal journeyman trade certification;\n(5) Crew dispatcher jobs: CAW had the right to bid first; if not filled, CN could look outside to another bargaining unit. All the jobs were filled by the CAW [Mr. Croteau was not a member of the CAW];\n(6) Windsor Fire\/Safety Watch: She wanted it for another worker to be accommodated and it was not suitable for Mr. Croteau because of his restrictions. This job only existed in Windsor. If Mr. Croteau had taken that job, Ms. Cialone would have had to find another job for the displaced employee. As Mr. McFadden rightly pointed out, the CHRA does not require accommodation of one disabled employee by displacing another from his\/her job.\nMs. Waller noted that it\u2019s always \u201charder\u201d to find accommodated work in smaller terminals: fewer office jobs; fewer jobs in general there.\n[219] Ms. Waller acknowledged that the documents in Ms. Cialone\u2019s file start in 2011 and go to November 2012; there is nothing in the file pre-2011, specifically from 2008-11. (Though I note that there is entered into evidence an email from Ms. Cialone dated November 24, 2008 referable to Mr. Croteau\u2019s file.) When asked if she found this surprising, she answered: \u201cNot necessarily\u2026no action may have been required; nothing happened. I guess we can improve the process to put \u2018No action taken because outside restrictions\u2019.\u201d She clearly rejected the suggestion that Ms. Cialone was being \u201cpassive\u201d or not being \u201ccreative\u201d in her efforts on behalf of Mr. Croteau: \u201cNo, Tania was pretty active looking\u2026We do take an active approach.\u201d She also noted that Mr. Croteau\u2019s four restrictions had not changed and had been deemed permanent by OHS. This is reflected in the May 22, 2012 letter from Ms. Cialone to the Complainant. The witness acknowledged that she doesn\u2019t know what CN did for him from May 2008-2011 as she wasn\u2019t on this file.\n[220] In answer to a question about the job search radius, according to Mr. Bolter\u2019s June 5, 2012 letter, Ms. Waller said it appeared that Mr. Croteau\u2019s preference is still Sarnia, but that he would consider relocating to Toronto:\nIt\u2019s not clear if he means \u2018outside Ontario\u2019. I would probably want to clarify that\u2026I\u2019ve extended the search to all of Ontario, but not beyond. I\u2019m not quite sure if he wants to go out of province. It\u2019s not clear [on June 12, 2013 Mr. Croteau finally clarified that: \u201ccoast to coast to coast\u201d]\u2026I haven\u2019t looked out West for him.\n[221] Mr. McFadden then had her confirm that her knowledge of Ms. Cialone\u2019s efforts to find suitable, productive work for Mr. Croteau is based on the documents before the Tribunal, but that in 2011, she had tried to RTW others so she was familiar with what was available then job-wise. Ms. Waller answered in the affirmative and also asserted that she had similar knowledge of what had been available from May 2008 to 2011. She confirmed that the only suitable positions available from 2008-11 were the crew dispatch jobs and they were all filled by the CAW. I note that Ms. Cialone sent out an email to CN managers across Ontario on May 13, 2011 inquiring about available clerical work for Mr. Croteau: \u201cCN is looking very actively for an accommodation for an employee who has been off for many years.\u201d\n[222] I accept Ms. Waller\u2019s evidence and the documentary evidence filed by CN regarding efforts it made to find available, suitable work within Mr. Croteau\u2019s restrictions from May 2008 to the end of the hearing in June 2013. Mr. Croteau did not make it clear until the hearing that he would consider work outside Sarnia. Furthermore, during the hearing the clarity progressed from his January 2012 testimony, to the June 5, 2012 letter of his counsel, to the Complainant\u2019s reply evidence of \u201ccoast to coast to coast\u201d on June 12, 2013. Notwithstanding the gradual evolution, CN was steps or miles ahead of Mr. Croteau in terms of its own accommodated job search radius. CN met its statutory duty to accommodate here.\n[223] I do not accept that either Mr. Croteau told CN (prior to the hearing in 2012) that he would relocate outside of Sarnia or that CN should be deemed to have known this. It was clear from Mr. Croteau\u2019s actions and words from 2007 to 2012 that he wanted to RTW in Sarnia and only Sarnia. Furthermore, I note that Mr. Croteau submitted lengthy written documents to CN and to various tribunals and agencies in the form of letters, his internal harassment complaint, his CROA arbitration grievance, his section 37 complaint against the Union, etc. And his written works went from the grand to the minutiae. He has no problems expressing himself using the written word. Had he wanted to work outside of Sarnia, on this major issue of great importance to him, Mr. Croteau would have said so. It only required one sentence of unequivocal expression to CN. But as mentioned earlier, while this is relevant as far as a question of credibility, in terms of the ultimate result, it would have made no difference. Why? Because CN, on its own initiative, searched beyond Sarnia and nothing suitable was available.\n[224] As for CN\u2019s accommodation efforts from 2007-May 6, 2008, I also find that it has established its statutory defence of a BFOR with accommodation to the point of undue hardship. The RTW efforts involved five attempts at accommodation, not counting the failed March 2005 Fire\/Safety one. CN acted in good faith. It wanted to return Mr. Croteau to the job that he had been hired and trained for, and actually did for years, that of conductor. CN always followed the medical recommendations and tried to work with the Complainant and his Union representatives in a constructive manner.\nH. Why Were Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW Attempts Unsuccessful? Why Did CN\u2019s BFOR\/Accommodation Defence Succeed? [225] This first question is not a simple one. We are dealing with a human being, not a machine. He clearly had (and has) severe anxiety-related disorders. Of that I have no doubt. But I believe the RTW efforts were unsuccessful for the following reasons:\n(1) Mr. Croteau did not fully participate in the accommodation process:\n[226] Mr. Croteau did not fully cooperate in the process at all times and fell short at times of his legal obligation to participate in the accommodation dialogue. For example, at the hearing he listed jobs that he felt CN should have considered accommodating him in. But these jobs were outside his qualifications and\/or restrictions, such as an electrician position that requires Red Seal certification after several years of study and apprenticeship. He wanted to shadow the Yardmaster. But this is a SC job. Why would CN have him shadow a SC position that he was never hired to do? In January 2005, he (and the Union) wouldn\u2019t even meet to discuss his RTW. On March 1, 2005 he attended the meeting with the Union and Mr. Gallagher where he made the cryptic \u201c$1 may be too much and $1 Million may not be enough\u201d comment and submitted a list of demands which rightly gave CN the impression that this was not an employee who truly wanted to RTW, unless it was on his terms only. If CN agreed to his terms, he apparently would have returned to work that very month.\n[227] As well, he altered a CN document and had his supervisor sign it. Mr. Gallagher testified that this could have resulted in his receiving half the demerit points needed to result in dismissal. Mr. McFadden submitted that it could have led to serious discipline, including dismissal from employment at CN. I agree with Mr. McFadden that, had CN really intended to \u201cget\u201d Mr. Croteau as he feared, the Complainant had provided the company with plenty of ammunition and opportunity. Also, Mr. Croteau was not forthright in the April 30, 2008 meeting with Dr. AB and having him write to CN to include a shift restriction from the shadow-rover TWP based on information on two points that the Complainant knew just five days earlier from Ms. Paquet\u2019s letter to be false.\n[228] It is true that he did not refuse to do accommodated assignments, but when he was doing them, it seemed like he was going through the motions only. It may be due partly to the make-work nature of some of the RTW jobs. This is one of the conclusions I draw from the evidence in this 36-day hearing.\n(2) His Fear\/Paranoia\/Mistrust originally focussed on KS, but then extended to CN:\n[229] I use the above terms, not in the medical, clinical sense (e.g., paranoia), but in their every day plain, dictionary meaning sense. It was clear to me throughout the hearing that Mr. Croteau had (and still has) a profound fear of KS. The kidnapping fear was an obvious example. I do not say this to demean or belittle Mr. Croteau. I do not believe that he is making this up. The problem is that, even though KS and TC left the picture very quickly at CN\u2019s insistence and had no further interaction with Mr. Croteau, their impact (mainly KS\u2019s) lingers on: Indeed, her image haunts him still. This fear\/paranoia about KS eventually extended to a profound mistrust of all things \u201cCN\u201d. The \u201cwork related issues\u201d often repeated in Dr. Chad\u2019s IMEs and the reports and letters from Drs. Gannon and AB had extended beyond KS and TC. This was highlighted when the Complainant testified that he wanted compensation to cover his moving expenses because he did not want CN to know where he lives. The mistrust extended to the Union too and his belief that it was in collusion with CN against his interests. In the hearing, he would not accept benign explanations and motives for CN\u2019s actions; for example, about CN\u2019s having paid for Dr. AB\u2019s sessions with him and well beyond the initial time (and cost) allotment it had set.\n(3) Mr. Croteau wanted Agreement or there was to be no resolution of \u201cwork related issues\u201d:\n[230] There was a circular reasoning at play here: a Merry-go-round or Groundhog Day-ish aspect to this case. I believe Mr. Croteau when he testified and wrote that he needed to heal in order to RTW. But the question is: What did he require in order to heal so that he could RTW? I do not accept that it was simply a matter of a better process: e.g., more meetings with Ms. Paquet, a better harassment investigation by Mr. Gallagher (and not necessarily a different conclusion\/findings). No, what he was seeking in addition to these things was AGREEMENT \u2013 that KS and TC were \u201cguilty\u201d of harassing him, that CN was \u201cguilty\u201d for putting him (and collaterally his family) under surveillance, that he receive an apology and compensation and discipline of KS and TC, etc. The list of demands at the March 1, 2005 meeting I believe were sincerely held conditions precedent in Mr. Croteau\u2019s mind for his healing and RTW at CN. Anything less would not do.\n[231] There was an interesting exchange in cross-examination between Mr. McFadden and Dr. AB. Counsel put it to the witness that it was clear from the evidence that Mr. Croteau wanted an apology, and that the removal of KS and TC by CN, such that they had no more involvement with the Complainant, was not sufficient. But what if they didn\u2019t do anything wrong, asked Mr. McFadden. How could CN resolve Mr. Croteau\u2019s \u201cwork related issues\u201d then? Dr. AB responded: \u201cI\u2019m also a couple\u2019s therapist. With open communication, legitimately trying to understand each other sometimes does work. Is an apology necessary? Maybe if they all sat down in a room\u2026\u201d With no disrespect intended to Dr. AB and his skills as a psychologist and couple\u2019s therapist, while this may be a therapeutic prescription that sometimes works, it would not succeed here. More conversations, TWPs, letters, \u201csit-down\u201d meetings or the re-opening of the harassment investigation would not have made a difference unless CN ultimately AGREED with Mr. Croteau with regard to the perceived wrongs allegedly visited upon him by KS, TC, CN, the Union, etc. Without this, there would be no healing, and without the healing which Mr. Croteau testified about several times, there would be no successful RTW.\n[232] Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW progress had hit a plateau. Sure it was better than in August 2004 when he couldn\u2019t even go onsite without a major panic attack. But in terms of actually progressing to the point of reasonably being able to RTW as a conductor, his recovery was nowhere close to that goal, notwithstanding the medical evidence to the contrary. I say this because Drs. Chad, Gannon and AB were not fully informed by Mr. Croteau of his true feelings and fears about KS and CN in general. Dr. AB wasn\u2019t even aware of Mr. Croteau\u2019s \u201ckidnapping\u201d fear regarding KS, for example.\n(4) There was no available, suitable work for Mr. Croteau:\n[233] Finally, there was no available, suitable work that fit within Mr. Croteau\u2019s four restrictions, as well as his geographic one. As discussed earlier, CN was even ahead of Mr. Croteau in terms of extending its job search radius beyond Sarnia. As Ms. Waller\u2019s testimony (and to a lesser extent Mr. Colasimone\u2019s) and the documentary evidence showed, at CN there was (as of the last day of the hearing) nothing available in terms of a clerical job.\n[234] Based on the foregoing, I find that CN has successfully established its BFOR\/accommodation defence under sections 15(1)(a) and 15(2) of the CHRA.\nI. Procedural Accommodation\/Best Practices Issues [235] As indicated earlier, Zinn J. in Cruden held that there is no separate procedural duty in the accommodation process which can be breached and attract remedies on its own where there has been a substantive finding of undue hardship. Accommodation must be reasonable (to the point of undue hardship); it need not be perfect: Renaud.\n[236] From this long hearing, while I find that CN has mounted a successful BFOR\/accommodation defence, there are some aspects of its process that, while not imposing CHRA liability (as they certainly do not meet the exception carved out by Zinn J. in para. 79 of Cruden), nevertheless fell short of \u201cbest practices\u201d and upon which I wish to remark.\n(1) Better communication with accommodated employees\/changes to TWPs:\n[237] I accept the evidence of Mr. Croteau that there were times when CN made changes to his TWP on short notice and without his input. Suffice to say that best efforts should be made to eliminate such occurrences in general, and specifically in relation to employees with Mr. Croteau\u2019s diagnosis of anxiety-related disorders. I also include in this category the delay in advising Mr. Croteau, following the April 4, 2007 meeting, as to whether he would be paid at the \u201cbelt pack rate\u201d. This caused undue stress about a fundamental aspect of the employer-employee relationship - pay - and to an employee who was under serious financial pressures. The above examples were not causes of the unsuccessful RTW attempts.\n(2) Communication with \u201cout of service\u201d injured\/disabled employees:\n[238] The evidence before me was that there was no direct communication between CN and Mr. Croteau regarding efforts made to find him accommodated work after the December 3, 2008 meeting with Ms. Fusco and Mr. Schenk and the follow-up letter. Surprisingly, there was not even an official status update from June 5, 2012 (when Mr. Bolter wrote his responding letter to CN about his client\u2019s willingness to relocate in the Toronto region \u201cor elsewhere\u201d) to the end of the hearing in June 2013, other than the evidence of Ms. Waller. I agree with Mr. Bolter that this leads an employee to think that nothing is being done. No evidence was led about CN\u2019s policy and general practices about communication with \u201cout of service\u201d employees.\n(3) Updated\/Current Medical information:\n[239] The most current medical information on file from a physician regarding Mr. Croteau is from Dr. Gannon. He wrote a letter and a prescription note both dated August 28, 2008. The prescription note reads: \u201cHis patient may return to work without shift time restrictions.\u201d He also completed a CN \u201cMedical Report on Mental Health (Safety Critical Position)\u201d for Mr. Croteau dated October 2, 2008. Dr. Chad\u2019s last IME Report is dated February 3, 2008. Dr. AB\u2019s last letter to CN is dated April 20, 2009. Dr. AB testified that he hasn\u2019t assessed Mr. Croteau for fitness to RTW for some time. He states that he \u201csuffers from chronic severe anxiety related disorders.\u201d His condition progressed to being chronic.\n[240] During the hearing, Mr. McFadden indicated initially that his client might have another (fourth) IME done. Later, at the hearing on April 16 and June 13, 2013, counsel said that CN likely would not, but instead look to the Complainant\u2019s family physician regarding Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW restrictions, etc. I note that CN had not done any of these things, as of the last day of the hearing. I don\u2019t know if CN has done any of them since then.\n[241] I appreciate that, based on Mr. Bolter\u2019s June 5, 2012 letter and his submission on behalf of his client during the hearing that the four restrictions remain, CN may not think it necessary to seek updated medical information from a physician, especially given that there is no available work based on these restrictions. As well, Ms. Waller testified that OHS informed them that Mr. Croteau\u2019s four restrictions were deemed permanent, as reflected in Ms. Cialone\u2019s letter to Mr. Croteau dated May 22, 2012. I also accept that, based on the many panic attacks during the hearing, CN takes the position that Mr. Croteau has not been symptom-free for six months for SC work, as required by the Railway industry Medical Rules Handbook, and that the underlying conditions that prompted the SC\/SS restriction for example, have not changed significantly, if at all.\n[242] With regards to the preceding paragraph, generally speaking, \u201cbest practices\u201d would suggest getting updated medical information to confirm work restrictions. They originate from the physician data in the first place. However, in the instant case, had CN taken the procedural accommodation step of obtaining further, updated medical information from Mr. Croteau\u2019s physician from 2009 onward, I find on a balance of probabilities that substantively it would have made no difference in terms of the outcome for the ultimate goal: Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW at CN. I say this for the reasons outlined in the preceding section \u201cWhy Were Mr. Croteau\u2019s RTW Attempts Unsuccessful? Why Did CN\u2019s BFOR\/Accommodation Defence Succeed?\u201d\nXIII. Conclusion [243] Based on the foregoing, the Complaint has not been substantiated and is accordingly dismissed. This has been a long hearing with much evidence, covering a decade\u2019s worth of events. I know that Mr. Croteau will be disappointed. I have listened very carefully to him (and to CN) in the presentation of their respective cases. During his testimony, Mr. Croteau said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping this Tribunal will bring me closure.\u201d With a great deal of compassion and empathy, I hope that Mr. Croteau will be able to achieve closure and heal with the love and support of his family, his internal strength and determination, and Dr. AB\u2019s help. He\u2019s an intelligent, thoughtful person with many years ahead of him.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

Background. 1\nII........... Position of the Parties. 1\nIII......... Analysis. 3\nIV......... Ruling. 5\nI. Background [1] On March 26, 2014, the Commission referred Barbara Barrie\u2019s two complaints dated April 29, 2013, to the Tribunal to conduct an inquiry and render a decision on the matters. The first complaint is against Canada Post Corporation (Canada Post) (20130538) on the ground of age and sections 7, 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The second is against the Association of Postal Officials of Canada (Association) (20130539) on the ground of age and sections 9 and 10 of the CHRA. The Commission requested a single inquiry in the two complaints.\nII. Position of the Parties [2] On April 24, 2014, the Tribunal offered the parties an opportunity to participate in a mediation session in an effort to settle the complaints prior to a hearing in the matters.\n[3] On May 14, 2014, the last response from the parties was received and confirmed that all parties had accepted to participate in the mediation process.\n[4] On the same day the Tribunal set the June 11, 2014 deadline for the parties to file their mediation briefs.\n[5] On May 22, 2014, the Respondent, the Association, wrote a letter to the Tribunal asking that the parties be afforded the opportunity to complete their negotiation discussions, scheduled to reconvene the week of June 9, 2014, prior to filing mediation briefs and attending mediation. The Association mentions that the issues before the Tribunal are a topic of discussion in the collective bargaining.\n[6] On May 23, 2014, the Respondent, Canada Post, requested an extension to Friday, July 11, 2014 for filing of their mediation brief due to the conflicting vacation and litigation schedules between their instructing clients and their counsel. The same day, the Respondent, the Association clarified it wasn\u2019t seeking an extension of the June 11, 2014 deadline to a specific date, rather; it is requesting that the Tribunal hold this matter in abeyance pending the conclusion of collective bargaining. The Association indicated that the parties are scheduled to reconvene bargaining in June 2014. However, the Association submits it is unlikely that a renewal agreement will be reached until the fall.\n[7] On May 27, 2014, Canada Post agreed with the Association\u2019s request. On the same day, the Complainant responded that it objects to the Association\u2019s request to put the file in abeyance. The Complainant contends that her complaint is based on the wording of the collective agreement that was signed in September 2009 and expired March 31, 2014. The Complainant further advances that regardless of what the results are of the current negotiations, the results will have no relevance or impact to her situation since the new agreement will run from April 1, 2014 forward. The Complainant contends that the collective agreement bargaining cannot go back and address past situations. Moreover, the Complainant is retiring effective September 12, 2014. Finally, the Complainant has no concerns with the June 11, 2014 deadline and supports Canada Post's request for an extension to file their mediation brief.\n[8] On June 2, 2014, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of May 23, 2014, and the Complainant\u2019s response of May 27, 2014, the Commission indicated that it does not consent to the Association\u2019s request. It is the Commission\u2019s position that the mediation should go ahead as planned, presuming all parties remain willing to go forward.\n[9] In their June 2, 2014 reply, the Association submits that from a public policy perspective, it is in the best interest of all involved that the parties (Canada Post Corporation and the Association of Postal Official of Canada) reach an amicable resolution via collective bargaining. Notwithstanding the potential interpretation which the Complainant and the Commission may ascribe to the collective agreement and specifically the clause in dispute, the Association submits that the parties to the collective bargaining be given the first opportunity to repair any alleged discrimination.\n[10] Secondly, the Association respectfully disagrees to the Complainant\u2019s allegation that any resolution of the collective bargaining table will have no effect on her issue. The Association contends that the parties may craft a resolution which will impact the Complainant and may have retroactive effect.\n[11] Finally, the Association advances that no party will suffer any prejudice by the proposed delay, and that in these circumstances, holding this file in abeyance is a reasonable and sensible means of addressing this issue.\nIII. Analysis [12] First, it is well established that this Tribunal is the master of its own procedures and that deciding on an adjournment of proceedings is very much within its discretion. I find the principles reasoned in Baltruweit, 2004 CHRT 14 (CanLII), to be applicable in this case:\n[15] It is well established that administrative tribunals are the masters of their own proceedings. As such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments. This principle was discussed in some detail by the Supreme Court of Canada in Prassad v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1989] 1. S.C.R. 560. In this case, the appellant sought an adjournment of her immigration inquiry pending a decision on her application to the Minister to permit her to remain in Canada. The adjudicator refused the adjournment.\n[16] In dealing with her appeal, the Supreme Court stated that administrative tribunals, in the absence of specific statutory rules or regulations, are masters of and control their own proceedings. But when tribunals exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, they must comply with the rules of natural justice. [See also Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers' International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (Ont. C.A.), Pierre v. Manpower and Immigration, [1978] 2 F.C. 849, 851 (FC.T.D.)].\n[13] That being said, the Tribunal, in pondering the request for a stay, must also give consideration to s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA, which states that \u201c[p]roceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d The exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice, and the regime of the Act. The Act requires the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint when requested by the Commission and also requires that the Tribunal give the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations. Section 2 of the Act expresses an overriding public interest in the elimination of discriminatory practices. Pursuant to section 2 of the Act, allegations of discrimination are to be dealt with expeditiously and in a timely fashion. See Blain v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2012 CHRT 13 paras. 12 and 14.\n[14] Moreover, I also adopt the Tribunal`s reasons enunciated in Marshall v. Cerescorp Co, at paras. 11-12:\nAccording to section 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian Railways (1999) C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para. 17). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party.\n(\u2026) In order for the Respondent to obtain an adjournment, it must establish that allowing the proceedings before the Tribunal to follow their normal course will result in a denial to the Respondent of natural justice. The Respondent has not persuaded me that any such prejudice would necessarily result if an adjournment were not granted.\n[15] Finally, when considering an adjournment to the Tribunal proceedings, given the quasi-constitutional nature of the CHRA and its purpose and the importance that access to justice and human rights have in our society, adjournments should be given only in exceptional cases and in accordance with the principles discussed in the above.\nIV. Ruling [16] In light of the above and after consideration, the Association, who made the request for an adjournment, has not demonstrated that it will be denied procedural fairness or natural justice or a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations if it is not granted an adjournment of the proceedings. Without having the benefit of all the information before me it is a possibility that some issues could be narrowed and or addressed in the collective bargaining agreement that would address the complaints or part of the complaints. However, it is also likely that the collective bargaining agreement will not address all the issues before the Tribunal and more importantly, there is no guarantee that parties will arrive to a settlement solely on the fact that the bargaining is completed. Placing the file on abeyance will create unnecessary delays in this file.\n[17] Accordingly, the Association's request for an adjournment of the hearing process is denied.\n[18] Parties will be receiving a letter shortly where dates for exchange of disclosure and filing of their statement of particulars will be set.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 18, 2014\n",

Background. 1\nII........... The law.. 4\nIII......... Conclusion. 7\nI. Background [1] The Complainant, Leslie Palm, filed discrimination complaints against the Respondents, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, local 500 (I.L.W.U.); Richard Wilkinson; and Cliff Willicome (the Respondents), under sections 3, 3.1, 7, 9 and 10, and, in a very recent amendment, she made a retaliation complaint under sections 14.1 and 65 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] The Complainant primarily alleges that the Respondents discriminated against her and treated her differentially, namely, by establishing or pursuing a discriminatory policy, which deprived her of certain opportunities in her employment. She also alleges that she was harassed by the Respondents on the basis of her sex.\n[3] As stated above, the Complainant filed an Amended Statement of Particulars in order to include in it a retaliation complaint against the Respondents.\n[4] In a motion dated September 11, 2013, the Respondents asked the Tribunal to add Antonio Pantusa in his personal capacity as a respondent in this file with regard to the retaliation allegations brought against the I.L.W.U.\n[5] Thus, Respondent I.L.W.U. alleges that the majority of the retaliation allegations in support of the Complainant's Amended Statement of Particulars concern the actions of Mr. Pantusa.\n[6] Respondent I.L.W.U. referred to a decision of the Vice-Chairperson of the Tribunal, Susheel Gupta, which states that the Complainant's retaliation allegations are directly related to the actions of Mr. Pantusa (a former Union Executive Officer and Despatch Coordinator).\n[7] Also, in its motion, I.L.W.U. stated that the Union's constitution does not govern the conduct of its members in their employment.\n[8] In addition, Respondent I.L.W.U. stated that the Union is responsible for the conduct of its officers who are acting within their authority as union officers. However, the Union is not responsible for the personal actions of its members at their workplace or elsewhere.\n[9] Incidentally, Respondent I.L.W.U. referred to the fact that Mr. Pantusa's actions, when he is working, is a matter for his employer, British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA) (which is an association representing companies involved in stevedoring operations on Canada's west coast) and that, ultimately, the employers are responsible for supervising and disciplining their employees for inappropriate conduct.\n[10] In addition, Respondent I.L.W.U. alleges that Mr. Pantusa must answer for his personal actions, which cannot be sanctioned by the Union.\n[11] Respondent I.L.W.U. also alleges that, if Mr. Pantusa is not a party as a respondent to the proceedings instituted by the complainant, she would have no recourse to apply the sanctions she is seeking for Mr. Pantusa's conduct.\n[12] Respondent I.L.W.U. further alleges that Mr. Pantusa acted outside the limits of his authority as a union officer when he treated Ms. Palm in a vexatious manner as alleged in the Complainant's amended submissions.\n[13] Respondent I.L.W.U. alleges that, even though Mr. Pantusa acted as an Union officer, the Union would be exculpated from the actions of Mr. Pantusa under the provisions of subsection 65(2) of the Act, which reads as follows:\n65. (1) Subject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\n(2) An act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[14] Finally, I.L.W.U. categorically denies any responsibility with regard to retaliatory actions alleged to have been taken by Mr. Pantusa and alleges that if Mr. Pantusa is not added to these proceedings as a respondent, the Complainant will have no remedy regarding Mr. Pantusa's conduct.\n[15] With regard to the motion filed by Respondent I.L.W.U. in order to add Mr. Pantusa as a respondent, the Canadian Human Rights Commission did not present a formal objection.\n[16] However, the Complainant categorically objects to adding Mr. Pantusa as a respondent.\n[17] Thus, in her Reply dated December 1, 2013, with regard to the motion of Respondent I.L.W.U. to add Mr. Pantusa, the Complainant stated that her Amended Statement of Particulars dated August 20, 2013, specifically refers to the Union's actions through its representative, Mr. Pantusa, for his actions while he was an officer of local 500 of I.L.W.U.\n[18] In her Amended Statement of Particulars, the Complainant also indicated that Mr. Pantusa had abused his authority as a union officer in order to target the Complainant specifically and to deny her employment opportunities. Accordingly, taking into account that she had already filed complaints under this Act against I.L.W.U., the retaliation complaint under section 14.1 of the Act is aimed directly at Respondent I.L.W.U.\n[19] In addition, the Complainant alleges the following in her Amended Statement of Particulars (Amended Statement of Particulars of the Complainant, August 20, 2013, page 13, paragraph 67):\nThe ongoing retaliation occurred with either the direct or implied consent of the Union (Local 500) or the Union Executive. Alternatively, the Union was aware or ought to have been aware of the incidents, and it turned a blind eye or acquiesced in the retaliatory conduct of others acting on the Union\u2019s behalf.\n[20] In addition, the complainant alleges the following in her Reply regarding the Respondent's motion (Reply of the Complainant, December 1, 2013, page 8, paragraph 40):\nThe Complainant reiterates that the Union has held multiple positions with regard to Mr. Pantusa\u2019s behavior; the issue that remains is the Unions lack of initiative to quash this type of abusive conduct from existing within its ranks. The Union continues to shirk the responsibility it owes its membership, by having allowed the misconduct to occur and reoccur time and time again.\n[21] A little further in her Reply, she also alleges the following (Reply of the Complainant, December 1, 2013, page 9, paragraphs 44 and 45):\nThe events suffered by Ms. Palm at the hand of her Union occurred with either the direct or implied consent of the Union (Local 500) or the Union Executive. Alternatively, the Union was aware or ought to have been aware of the incidents, and it turned a blind eye or acquiesced in the retaliatory conduct of others acting on the Union\u2019s behalf.\nIn effect, the Union supported and condoned the behavior by failing to take any immediate action to prevent or correct the individual\u2019s conduct. The Union supported and condoned the retaliatory conduct by failing to take action and mitigate discipline.\nII. The law [22] After reviewing the parties' Statements of Particulars as well as the Amended Statements of Particulars provided, examining the parties' submissions regarding the motion of Respondent I.L.W.U. to add Mr. Pantusa as a respondent and consulting the case law in this case, the Tribunal concluded that it would dismiss the Respondent\u2019s motion to add Mr. Pantusa as a respondent for the reasons outlined below.\n[23] The Tribunal would like to refer the parties to the provisions in section 14.1 of the Act, which reads as follows:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[24] The motion filed by I.L.W.U. refers to a retaliation complaint filed by the Complainant against the Union as it appears on the first page of the Respondent's motion, which indicates that it would like to add Mr. Pantusa as a respondent in his personal capacity following the retaliation complaint against the Respondent.\n[25] As stated in section 14.1 of the Act regarding retaliation, a complainant has two options for filing such a complaint. Thus, a complaint may be filed regarding a discriminatory practice against \"a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint\".\n[26] Therefore, the textual argument of the Act leaves the Tribunal very little choice.\n[27] Thus, the first part of section 14.1 of the Act refers to a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III. It is evident that this person is the Respondent in this case, namely, I.L.W.U., local 500.\n[28] No complaint was filed against Mr. Pantusa in his personal capacity when the original pleadings were filed by the Complainant, and therefore Mr. Pantusa is not a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III.\n[29] The textual argument appears to be fatal for the purposes of the Respondent's motion.\n[30] In addition, it appears, until proven otherwise, that at the time of the facts alleged by the Complainant against the Respondent, Mr. Pantusa acted on behalf of the Respondent, namely, I.L.W.U., local 500.\n[31] The Tribunal took note of the arguments in support of the Respondent's motion, namely, that the Respondent never authorized the actions alleged by the Complainant against Mr. Pantusa and also of the fact that the Respondent would be exculpated from Mr. Pantusa's actions under subsection 65(2) of the Act because the Respondent had apparently not consented to the actions alleged by the Complainant and because it had allegedly exercised all due diligence to prevent the actions and to mitigate their effect.\n[32] Even if we assume that the exculpation clause of section 65(2) applies in this case as claimed by the Respondent regarding the acts committed or possibly committed by Mr. Pantusa against the Complainant, this would, for all intents and purposes, add Mr. Pantusa in his personal capacity under the first part of section 14.1 of the Act, which cannot be done in this case, considering that Mr. Pantusa is not a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III as shown in the Court record.\n[33] It is useful to keep in mind that, in both the Complainant's Amended Statement of Particulars and her Reply to the Respondent's motion to add Mr. Pantusa as a respondent, the Complainant reiterates that the retaliation complaint is addressed directly at the Union, not at Mr. Pantusa personally.\n[34] Accordingly, the textual argument in section 14.1 of the Act leaves the Tribunal no alternative: it is outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to interpret this provision differently from the way Parliament had done in drafting it. (See Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (Mowat) at paragraphs 33 and 62:\n[33] The question is one of statutory interpretation and the object is to seek the intent of Parliament by reading the words of the provision in their entire context and according to their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, quoted in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). In approaching this task in relation to human rights legislation, one must be mindful that it expresses fundamental values and pursues fundamental goals. It must therefore be interpreted liberally and purposively so that the rights enunciated are given their full recognition and effect: see, e.g., R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 497-500. However, what is required is nonetheless an interpretation of the text of the statute which respects the words chosen by Parliament. [Emphasis added.]\n. . .\n[62] As we noted earlier, the CHRA has been described as quasi-constitutional and deserves a broad, liberal, and purposive interpretation befitting of this special status. However, a liberal and purposive interpretation cannot supplant a textual and contextual analysis simply in order to give effect to a policy decision different from the one made by Parliament: Bell Canada v. Bell Aliant Regional Communications, 2009 SCC 40, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 764, at paras. 49-50, per Abella J.; Gould, at para. 50, per La Forest J., concurring.\n(See also \u201cCommission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse c. Restaurant Marchand 2002 Lt\u00e9e.\u201d, 2002 CanLII 61234 (Qc T.D.P.), where a broader interpretation seems possible taking into account section 82 of the Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms, which uses the words \"any person\" unlike section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.)\nIII. Conclusion [35] Accordingly, Mr. Pantusa cannot be added as a respondent to these proceedings instituted by the Complainant in accordance with the Complainant's Amended Statement of Particulars and the Respondent's motion with respect to the Complainant's Amended Statement of Particulars regarding retaliation under section 14.1 of the Act.\n[36] The motion of Respondent I.L.W.U., local 500 is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 24, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Palm v.

Conclusion. 55\nI. Background A. Position of the complainant [1] The complainant, Chris Hughes, maintains that the respondent, Transport Canada, discriminated against him contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) on the basis of certain disabilities that he has, discrimination that allegedly occurred in the course of four competitions that he participated in to obtain a position with Transport Canada.\n[2] Furthermore, the complainant claims that the respondent retaliated against him contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act given that he filed complaints against the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n[3] As part of his initial application for a marine security analyst (PM-04) position bearing number 05MOT-OC-VAN-005187, he submits that he demonstrated to the selection board his past performance assessment as an employee of the federal public service in a clear and positive manner.\n[4] In his application for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position, the complainant states that he told the selection board that he was discriminated and retaliated against in his previous jobs with the CRA and the CBSA.\n[5] In fact, he filed a complaint against the CRA and the CBSA for those alleged discriminatory practices. As a result of the alleged abuse by his former employers, he suffered from stress and depression. The complainant states that his application for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position was rejected even though he demonstrated that he had the essential qualifications for that desired position.\n[6] The complainant also states that the respondent rejected his application for the following other three positions: regional security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition, selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005467); regional transportation security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition, selection process 06-MOT-OC-VAN-008455); transportation security inspector (TI-06 competition, selection process 07-MOT-EA-VAN-60712).\n[7] It is in the course of those four competitions that the complainant claims to have been discriminated against under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act and retaliated against contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act on the basis of prior complaints that he filed against the above-mentioned agencies.\n[8] For a better understanding of the applicable legal provisions, the Tribunal refers to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which reads as follows:\nSection 7: It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 14.1: It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nB. Position of the respondent [9] In its arguments, the respondent tells the Tribunal that there was no discrimination in any of the competitions that the complainant participated in.\n[10] In that respect, the respondent states that each competition that the complainant participated in had specific requirements and, depending on the particularities of each competition and the complainant\u2019s knowledge and experience, the complainant\u2019s applications were rejected. The respondent claims the complainant\u2019s applications were rejected essentially because he was unable to show that he had the required experience for the positions in issue.\n[11] Similarly, the respondent states that it was up to the complainant to show or prove that he had the required skills to be able to obtain one of the desired positions.\n[12] That evidence had to be submitted by means of written tests, interviews and references, which were required for the positions.\n[13] Thus, the respondent maintains that the complainant did not have the required qualifications for any of the competitions that he had applied for.\nC. Position of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [14] At the very beginning of her presentation, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) representative stated that the Commission\u2019s participation is directly related to the aspect of the retaliation and to the interpretation of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act within the context of the federal public service.\n[15] More specifically, the Commission argues that it would be useful to know whether section 14.1 of the Act protects individuals who have filed discrimination complaints against a Crown agency and would protect those individuals from retaliation by other Crown agencies. In other words, the Commission is asking whether section 14.1 of the Act must be read as covering retaliation by other Crown agencies that are not party to the complaint currently under review.\n[16] In this case, if the response to the above question is yes, did the respondent deny the complainant a job opportunity because of his previous complaints against the CBSA or the CRA? That is the Commission\u2019s alternate question to the Tribunal.\n[17] Finally, the Commission contends that the respondent did not provide arguments with respect to the first above-mentioned question and as a result, it asks the Tribunal to adopt its position for the facts in this case.\n[18] In reply, the respondent argues that there is no evidence to support a finding of retaliation by other government agencies or by the respondent against the complainant.\nII. The facts A. Evidence of the complainant [19] To establish the evidence, counsel for the complainant first referred the Tribunal to a complaint summary dated January 27, 2008 (Exhibit C-3, Tab 128), and had the complainant testify at the hearing; the complainant referred to his first application for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position, which he submitted in 2005.\n[20] As part of that competition, the complainant had an interview with the selection board, which was chaired by John Lavers and included two other members, that is, Sonya Wood and Ron Perkio.\n[21] The complainant stated that he passed the interview phase for that competition and that, subsequently, his application proceeded to the next phase in which the board checks his references.\n[22] In his testimony, the complainant told the Tribunal, while reviewing his curriculum vitae, that he had been a collection contact officer\/compliance officer, PM-1, from February 1, 1995, to December 4, 1999, and then from May 1, 2000, to September 14, 2001.\n[23] He was then a customs inspector, PM-2, from May 6, 2002, to October 14, 2002, and from April 28, 2003, to September 26, 2003.\n[24] Finally, he was a business window agent (PM-1) for the following periods: December 5, 1999, to April 30, 2000; November 28, 2001, to May 5, 2002; October 15, 2002, to April 25, 2003; and September 19, 2003, up until the time he created the curriculum vitae provided at the hearing (Exhibit C-4, Tab 1).\n[25] The complainant stated that he then worked in various positions for short periods of time as an inspector, both in the private and public sectors. In July 2011, he was hired by Elections British Columbia to assist the chief electoral officer for a short period of five or six weeks. He was unemployed starting in September 2011.\n[26] As previously mentioned, for the purposes of the complainant\u2019s application to the respondent, a selection board of three members, specifically, John Lavers, Sonya Wood and Ron Perkio, was formed to determine eligible candidates for that position.\n[27] In his testimony, the complainant stated that first he passed the written exam and then he was called to participate in an interview with the board members.\n[28] The complainant stated that his oral interview went well and as a result, the third phase of his application was the reference check.\n[29] The complainant stated in his testimony that he did not immediately provide references to the selection board because he knew that questions about his previous complaints against the CRA and the CBSA would be asked and\/or could influence the scoring of his interview for the PM-04 position. Consequently, he waited to be contacted again for the references.\n[30] He told the Tribunal that he went on stress leave in 2001 after a stressful incident at work.\n[31] Similarly, he stated that, in 2005, he suffered from depression, which also originated from circumstances in his previous job.\n[32] In fact, the complainant told the Tribunal that he had stopped an illegal act allegedly committed by the CRA in 2000 and that he was then retaliated against and was refused several promotions by the CRA.\n[33] He also stated that that stressful situation caused him to become depressed in 2005 and that he was then unable to work for some periods of time in 2005. He stated that that was because of stress (stress leave).\n[34] Thus, the complainant stated in his testimony that he was contacted in the beginning of February 2006 by the board\u2019s chair, John Lavers, for three references in support of his application.\n[35] In that respect, the complainant received a call from Mr. Lavers on February 1, 2006.\n[36] After that call, the complainant sent Mr. Lavers a few references by email on February 1, 2006 (Exhibit C-1, Tab 26).\n[37] Given that the complainant was asked to provide references in support of his application, he contacted some of his former employers for assistance with providing references in support of his file.\n[38] The complainant then told the Tribunal that he had difficulty obtaining such references, which he informed John Lavers of, as shown in the various email exchanges in the record (Exhibit C-1, Tab 28, more specifically).\n[39] In one of the emails from the complainant to John Lavers, more specifically, in an email dated February 6, 2006, the complainant informed the selection board chair of problems he had obtaining the necessary references. In particular, the complainant told Mr. Lavers that some references could be evasive or refuse to be a reference for him.\n[40] Similarly, he told Mr. Lavers that their refusal to be references had nothing to do with his performance or reliability at work or his personality. He told Mr. Lavers that there had been a court settlement with the CBSA and the CRA on December 19, 2005. He stated in that same email that those two agencies, that is, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), had originally been part of one organization called the CCRA.\n[41] In the same email, the complainant told Mr. Lavers that he was working at that time for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), which had hired him without hesitation, and that if Mr. Lavers so desired, ICBC could provide a reference in respect of him.\n[42] In his evidence, the complainant also referred to an email from John Lavers to the two other board members, that is, Sonya Wood and Ron Perkio, dated February 6, 2006, in which Mr. Lavers referred to the fact that there were apparently outstanding issues with respect to his references. Mr. Lavers then asked Mr. Perkio if he had any comments in that respect (Exhibit C-1, Tab 28, page 137).\n[43] The next day, on February 7, 2006, Sonya Wood sent an email to John Lavers and Ron Perkio, which reads as follows:\nHi John, it\u2019s not an uncommon situation. I\u2019ve previously encountered supervisors declining to provide references, reasons can vary, e.g. some Employers\/Departments have specific policies prohibiting or limiting the release of employee information; or some supervisors aren\u2019t comfortable providing reference as didn\u2019t supervise the employee for long enough period to gauge performance; and so on.\nWhen\/if a can candidate\u2019s Reference Contact declines to provide a Reference check, there are other options\/tools which the Selection Board can (& should) utilize to assess Personal Suitability...e.g. Board can ask the candidate to provide copies of any Letters of Reference or Performance Evaluations that the candidate may have, and can ask the candidate to provide alternate\/additional Reference Contacts.\nIn the e-mails below Chris has included what seem to be \u201cquotes\u201d from Performance Evaluation Reports & prior Reference checks, from his previous employment. You could ask Chris for copies of those documents.\n(See Exhibit C-1, Tab 28.)\n[44] Given that email exchange that mentions additional reference requests, the complainant then provided a series of documents, which appear in Exhibit C-1, Tab 30, Sub-tabs A to T, that would assist the selection board in obtaining additional information on his past performance.\n[45] In his testimony, the complainant stated that after he provided those documents and the above-mentioned list of references to Mr. Lavers, Mr. Lavers told the complainant, on February 27, 2006, that none of the persons mentioned were available to be references in respect of him.\n[46] In his evidence, the complainant referred to John Lavers\u2019 handwritten notes (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 36), which show the essence of the communication between him and Mr. Lavers.\n[47] More specifically, they show that the complainant apparently stated that he was concerned about retaliation by his former employers and about his civil action against the CCRA, which resulted in him being awarded $51,000.00 in compensation in December 2005.\n[48] In his testimony, the complainant also stated that, after his discussion with Mr. Lavers on February 27, 2006, he did not have any other discussions with him. It was not until May 6, 2006, that he got initial feedback further to that discussion with Mr. Lavers, and it was then that he learned that his application had not been accepted for the desired position.\n[49] In that regard, at the hearing, it was clarified that a letter dated March 21, 2006, from John Lavers to the complainant stated that his application had not been accepted for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position (Exhibit C-1, Tab 51).\n[50] In his testimony, the complainant stated that he again tried to contact Mr. Lavers for information on why his application for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position had been rejected because he had also applied for another position, that is, a TI-06 competition, and wanted to get Mr. Lavers\u2019 impression so that he could make improvements for the other competitions in which he wanted to participate, if necessary.\n[51] Also in his testimony, given that Mr. Lavers told him that none of the references submitted agreed to be a reference for the complainant, the complainant stressed in his testimony that he did inform Mr. Lavers of the difficulties that he had experienced in his former positions with the CRA and CBSA and that he was forced to resign in December 2005 with $51,000 in compensation.\n[52] He also stated in his testimony that he told Mr. Lavers that he was worried about possible retaliation given his past actions (illegal garnishee issue and filing human rights complaints against the CRA and the CBSA).\n[53] As part of his questions to Mr. Lavers as to why his application had been rejected, the complainant told the Tribunal that, sometime around May 15, 2006, he contacted Mr. Lavers, and it was at that point that Mr. Lavers told him that he had not met the detail-oriented criterion and, more specifically, that were no references from supervisors confirming that he was detail-oriented.\n[54] During that same telephone discussion, Mr. Lavers allegedly stated that only one person, Bill DiGuistini, had actually agreed to be a reference, but that he purportedly had not provided any negative or positive feedback with respect to Mr. Hughes.\n[55] Consequently, the complainant stated that Mr. Lavers had told him that Bill DiGuistini had actually responded, but that no one else had agreed to be a reference.\n[56] Similarly, Mr. Lavers apparently told the complainant that he had primarily been seeking references from the complainant\u2019s former supervisors to confirm his qualities and abilities, specifically those related to whether he was detail-oriented.\n[57] In his testimony, the complainant also confirmed that, subsequent to that first marine security analyst (PM-04) competition, another competition for the same type of job, that is, a PM-04 position, was opened and that it no longer included the detail-oriented criterion.\n[58] Later in his testimony, the complainant stated that he had also applied for another position, that is, for a regional transportation security and emergency preparedness inspector position with a closing date of October 3, 2005. It was actually an application for a similar position as described above, but for a TI-06 qualification.\n[59] In the same manner as his application for the PM-04 position, the complainant stated that he had to pass a written test to qualify. However, the complainant\u2019s application was rejected because he received a mark of 60% on the test and the passing score was 70%.\n[60] In this testimony, the complainant expressed disappointment that he was not given a standardized test, which is typical in federal government employment competitions, but a different test, a WCT345 test, for the position.\n[61] In his testimony, the complainant also referred to a letter by Sonya Wood dated June 26, 2006, regarding the TI-06 position referred to above (Exhibit C-2, Tab 74). Ms. Wood apparently told him that he had indeed obtained a result of 60% on Written Communication Test 345, and that the passing score for that test was 70%.\n[62] In his testimony, the complainant stated that he told Transport Canada about his concerns regarding that issue.\n[63] Similarly, he apparently also had discussions with Sonya Wood and\/or Debbie Guinn and told them that his hand had cramped up when writing the test. The complainant stated that Ms. Wood or Ms. Guinn did not specifically comment on the fact that he complained about having a hand cramp when writing his test.\n[64] The complainant believes that the hand cramp certainly affected his final score in that test.\n[65] Then, the complainant stated that he applied for a second regional transportation security and emergency preparedness inspector position at the TI-06 level.\n[66] The closing date for that competition was August 3, 2006.\n[67] According to the complainant, that second application was for an equivalent TI-06 position with the same classification as those in the first TI-06 position.\n[68] Once again, after learning that his application had been accepted, it was subsequently rejected because, according to Transport Canada, the complainant did not have sufficient experience in conducting investigations.\n[69] That information was communicated to the complainant in an email dated October 12, 2006, at Exhibit C-2, Tab 96.\n[70] Nonetheless, the complainant stressed in his testimony that both jobs were exactly the same according to him.\n[71] Regarding his second application for a TI-06 position, the complainant stated that, in his application, he clearly referred to his experience in conducting investigations.\n[72] Given his disagreement with the decision regarding the second TI-06 position, the complainant wrote to Transport Canada to express his disagreement and requested that his application be readmitted.\n[73] However, he stated that he was never sent a response regarding his request and he consequently filed a formal complaint with the Public Service Commission (see Exhibit C-2, Tab 100).\n[74] Finally, in his testimony, the complainant stated that he submitted a third application, once again for position at the TI-06 level, this time for a transportation security inspector position with a closing date of April 2, 2007.\n[75] In that regard, the complainant referred to the level of experience required for that type of position, that is, experience in conducting extensive investigations.\n[76] Regarding the third application for a TI-06 position, the complainant then modified his curriculum vitae to contain more specific information on his past experience in his various positions, but also his personal experience as follows: \u201cextensive investigation into how I was harassed, black listed and retaliated against by a number of Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) employees\u201d (Exhibit C-3, Tab 105).\n[77] In that additional summary of his personal experience with respect to his most recent investigations, the complainant referred to the incidents he was involved in at the CRA and the CBSA.\n[78] In his testimony, he told the Tribunal that the third application was rejected and more specifically, he drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to page 609 of the exhibits submitted (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 107) that states that his application was not accepted because his experience was as follows: \u201cnot extensive, not work related, personal issues\u201d.\n[79] Also, he told the Tribunal that he filed a third complaint with the Public Service Commission and that an investigation was conducted.\n[80] Subsequently, the witness draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to various email exchanges (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 120), with Paul Martin, a human resources consultant at Transport Canada, Pacific Region, as an attempt at mediation to resolve his complaints.\n[81] In particular, he drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to an email to Paul Martin dated June 14, 2007, referring to the various qualifications he stated in his application for the PM-04 position, and also the various pieces of written information he had sent to Mr. Lavers, that is, the documentation shown in Exhibit C-1, Tab 30.\n[82] In that email, the complainant stated that his health had greatly deteriorated, but that he still maintained his position that he had met the detail-oriented criterion.\n[83] After learning of the various notebooks kept by the board members who had evaluated him for the PM-04 position, the complainant stated that, for him, the situation had become more of a human rights issue than the staffing problem as he had originally thought. Consequently, he decided to abandon his three staffing-related complaints and proceed directly with human rights complaints (see the email in Exhibit C-3, Tab 124, page 710 and see also Exhibit C-3, Tab 125, page 712).\n[84] Furthermore, the complainant stated that, on September 21, 2010, in a letter to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, he decided to amend his human rights complaint and include an allegation of retaliation (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 129).\n[85] Before finishing his examination in chief, the complainant told the Tribunal about the difficulties he had in finding a job and the financial hardship he had experienced. He told the Tribunal that the whole situation had caused him great stress and had made him depressed. He also told the Tribunal that he had been unable to provide financial assistance to his father, who had Parkinson\u2019s disease and had experienced many problems in the last six years.\n[86] Similarly, he told the Tribunal that his marriage had fallen apart and that he had been insolvent five to six times over the past few years. He told the Tribunal that he was very depressed because he was told that he did not pass the various tests required for the competitions he participated in, more specifically, because he did not obtain adequate responses.\n[87] Finally, he told the Tribunal that the last six years have been a nightmare for him.\n[88] In her cross-examination of the complainant, the Canadian Human Rights Commission representative told the Tribunal that she would focus particularly on section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act regarding retaliation.\n[89] First, she drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the various comments in the evaluations made by the selection board for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position (see Exhibit C-1, Tabs 39, 40, and 41).\n[90] Regarding Exhibit C-1, Tab 40, dated March 2, 2006, which was signed by John Lavers, she drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to page 231, question 14, regarding the detail-oriented criterion.\n[91] She asked the complainant about a possible score that would be reflective of the comment \u201cvery good example\u201d at page 231.\n[92] The complainant told the Tribunal that the comment would have surely resulted in a score of between 16 and 18 on the evaluation grid at page 236 of the same tab.\n[93] However, the complainant told the Tribunal that a score of 12 was attributed to him with the following comment: \u201cfailed\u201d.\n[94] Subsequently, she drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Exhibit C-1, Tab 41, more specifically to page 247, where the following comment appears: \u201cvery good on his interview question\u201d. The complainant told the Tribunal that the same score, 16 to 18, should have been given and not a score of 12 as shown on page 238.\n[95] Finally, counsel drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Tab 39, page 215, where the following comment appears: \u201cnicely handled - he was thorough\u201d. The complainant told the Tribunal that once again, he should have been given a score of 18 to 16 instead of a score of 12, which was given to him at the very beginning of the tab at page 206.\n[96] The complainant told the Tribunal that he had adequately satisfied the detail-oriented criterion.\n[97] In the cross-examination by the respondent, the complainant reiterated his past difficulties for which he acted as a whistle-blower.\n[98] More specifically, he stated that the fact that he had reported an illegal activity had created animosity toward him by people who worked for the same agency.\n[99] In particular, he stated that he was able to obtain the reference summaries for the customs officer and collections enforcement officer positions that he held around the end of the year 2000. He then uncovered the very harsh language and the negative comments that appeared in those reports.\n[100] The complainant stated that as a result of those negative references, he went on a period of stress leave in 2001, which developed into a state of anxiety and then finally in 2005, the medical situation turned into depression.\n[101] Regarding the problems he experienced in and around the year 2000, as mentioned above, the complainant stated that he sought, through mediation, to resolve the cases and find employment. However, he stated that after receiving some inaccurate information and threats, he was forced to resign. As a result, he received compensation in the amount of fifty-one thousand dollars ($51,000.00) on December 7, 2005, but was unable to find a job within the CRA. Also in his examination, he stated that the CBSA had been included in his settlement and was bound by the same conditions.\n[102] In addition, he told the Tribunal that as part of his settlement, the parties agreed that Brian Currie would be a reference to allow the complainant to find a new job.\n[103] Later in the cross-examination by the respondent\u2019s representative, the representative asked the complainant whether Mr. Lavers had actually retaliated against him and the complainant stated the following:\nQ Is it your position that Mr Lavers was retaliating against you?\nA Yes, because I explained to him why the references were not providing references and that there had been previous human rights complaints and I provided him with performance reviews from those individuals that were refusing to give references that showed I was a good employee. So he \u2013yes, he was a party to retaliation under 14.1 by failing me in a pretextual manner, yes.\nQ A party with who?\nA Well, CRA and CBSA should have been providing references, in my opinion.\nQ But they\u2019re not a party to this action; correct?\nA Correct.\n(See the testimony excerpt dated March 20, 2013, page 14, lines 7 to 22.)\n[104] In his testimony, the complainant reviewed the various comments shown in Exhibit C-1, Tab 30, and told the Tribunal that he adequately met the conditions for the detail-oriented criterion.\n[105] In his cross-examination, the complainant also reviewed why his applications had not been accepted for the three TI-06 positions.\n[106] As such, regarding his first application for the TI-06 position, he stated that his hand had cramped up, which had prevented him from adequately completing the required written test. In cross-examination, counsel stressed that his hand cramp problem had not been mentioned in the complaint that he had filed in support of this case.\n[107] Regarding his second application for a TI-06 position, the complainant maintained that he had the necessary and required skills in the area of conducting investigations. Finally, regarding his application for a third TI-06 position, with respect to the requirement of conducting extensive or more complex investigations, he told the Tribunal that even if the comments he made in his application do not relate directly to a position, the personal experience indicates that he conducted an extensive investigation and as a result, he also qualified for that third TI-06 position.\n[108] He also stated that in contrast to the urgency of the situation to recruit staff for TI-06 positions, given his skills, which he believes that he demonstrated, he was discriminated against because his application was not readmitted like those of the other candidates.\n[109] In his testimony, the complainant also stated that, because he told Mr. Lavers about his prior psychological problems, he believes that, during the TI-06 competitions, which apparently took place at the same time as his application for the PM-04 position, Mr. Lavers had personal discussions with human resources staff about the complainant\u2019s concerns and had certainly communicated his account of what happened with the CRA and the CBSA. Consequently, the complainant maintains that the information that he provided to Mr. Lavers was disseminated throughout all of Transport Canada.\n[110] Furthermore, the complainant stated that he was retaliated against because Mr. Lavers did not, as part of the reference check, communicate with Brian Currie, even though he was unavailable.\n[111] Again in his re-examination, counsel drew the complainant\u2019s attention to a number of applications, shown in Exhibit C-3, Tab 102, Sub-tabs A to H, from other candidates for the same competitions for which the complainant applied (TI-06 positions).\n[112] Similarly, in the re-examination, counsel reviewed Exhibit C-3, Tab 108, Sub-tabs A to H, which also contain other applications and which were compared with the complainant\u2019s application for the transportation security inspector (TI-06) position. In that regard, the complainant stated that his qualifications were better or similar to those of the other candidates.\n[113] In his testimony, the complainant reviewed the various comments shown in Exhibit C-1, Tab 30 and told the Tribunal that he adequately met the conditions under the detail-oriented criterion.\nB. Evidence of the respondent [114] As previously stated, counsel for the respondent told the Tribunal that, regarding the four applications submitted by the complainant to Transport Canada, there was not a discrimination problem, but a staffing problem.\n[115] The respondent called Brian Savelieff as the first witness. Mr. Savelieff was in charge of the human resources program and also helped management with recruitment and with staff performance evaluations at Transport Canada.\n[116] According to Mr. Savelieff, the detail-oriented criterion was established to find candidates who were able to pay attention to detail and be precise in their work.\n[117] In his testimony, he told the Tribunal that, according to the criteria established in the rating guide for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position, the detail-oriented criterion was a strict criterion that the candidate either met or did not meet.\n[118] In cross-examination, the witness stated that he was not the supervisor of the selection board chair, John Lavers, and that he had not worked as advisor for the PM-04 program or for the TI-06 positions.\n[119] Consequently, Mr. Savelieff\u2019s testimony essentially involved general administrative knowledge of the hiring program at Transport Canada.\n[120] In cross-examination, to clarify the detail-oriented criterion, the witness told the Tribunal the following about that qualification:\nYou do pass qualifications. You are found qualified or unqualified against each qualification or merit criteria.\n(See testimony excerpt dated March 21, 2013, page 18, lines 4 to 6.)\n[121] He also told the Tribunal that the detail-oriented criterion was an essential qualification and that it was characterized as non-compensatory.\n[122] The witness added the following: \u201c[I]t must be passed unto itself. A candidate must be found qualified or not qualified in that particular area in order to be found qualified overall and potentially be put into an eligibility list or pool. To be hired one must be found qualified against this particular qualification.\u201d (Testimony excerpt dated March 21, 2013, page 36, lines 8 to 21.)\n[123] In finishing the cross-examination of the respondent\u2019s representative, counsel asked the following question about the qualification of the employer, Transport Canada: page 100, testimony excerpt dated March 21, 2013, line 8:\nQ So, although the federal government has departments, legally they are not the employer correct?\nA Correct. Treasury board is the employer.\nQ And in fact it\u2019s Her Majesty in Right of Canada as represented by Treasury Board is?\nA Yes.\nThank you.\n[124] Subsequently, the witness added the following:\nThe Chairperson: Not the agency. Treasury Board is the employer. Again, it\u2019s a simple question?\nThe witness: That\u2019s fair. Treasury board is the employer, yes. We are all departments of the public service. The way it\u2019s always been described to me as Treasury Board is the employer.\n(Testimony excerpt dated March 21, 2013, page 100, lines 16 to 22.)\n[125] The respondent called another witness, William Keenlyside, who was, at the time of his testimony, the regional manager marine security officer.\n[126] He told the Tribunal that he has worked in the marine security operation centre since July 1, 2004.\n[127] During his testimony, the witness, Keenlyside, referred to the fact that he was involved in the second TI-06 application. More specifically, he testified with respect to the criterion on having experience in conducting investigations.\n[128] The witness told the Tribunal that that criterion refers to investigations that originated from situations with respect to law enforcement.\n[129] According to him, the complainant\u2019s experience was very limited in his ability to conduct investigations under the \u201cexperience in conducting investigations\u201d criterion. Consequently, the complainant\u2019s application was rejected.\n[130] According to the witness, the complainant was unable to confirm his qualifications for the position\u2019s required experience. There was a lack of validation in that respect by the complainant.\n[131] He told the Tribunal that as part of his duties in other agencies, such as the CBSA and Transport Canada, he has participated in various selection boards some 40 times.\n[132] The respondent called Michael Fu, who was particularly involved in the third TI-06 position, as the third witness.\n[133] Mr. Fu was one of the three selection board members for that position.\n[134] At the beginning of his testimony, Mr. Fu reviewed the criteria for the position (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 103), which consisted of three kinds of experience, one of which was that of conducting extensive investigations.\n[135] In his testimony, Mr. Fu reviewed the complainant\u2019s application for the third TI-06 position and told the Tribunal that that was the first time that he had seen a candidate describe his personal experience as the required experience for such a position (TI-06).\n[136] Namely, he referred to the experience the complainant had listed regarding an investigation into impaired driving. He considered that experience insufficient. Also, given the experience stated by the complainant in his application regarding his problems with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), he concluded that that experience was as follows: \u201cnot extensive, not work related, personal issue\u201d.\n[137] He once again told the Tribunal that a simple investigation into impaired driving was not sufficient for the criteria sought in the third TI-06 position.\n[138] He also told the Tribunal that, given the inadequate experience provided in the complainant\u2019s application, the complainant\u2019s application could therefore not be accepted and he had written \u201cOUT\u201d (see top right of page 594, Exhibit C-3, Tab 105).\n[139] In the cross-examination by counsel for the complainant, in response to a question on whether he knew about Mr. Hughes\u2019 complaints against the other departments where Mr. Hughes had previously worked while he was a member of the board for the third TI-06 application, the witness told the Tribunal that he had heard about such complaints, which he considered \u201cmanagers talking\u201d. That information had originated from Brian Bramah and not from Sonya Wood or John Lavers.\n[140] He also told the Tribunal that there were no discussions with Ms. Wood or Mr. Lavers regarding Mr. Hughes\u2019 complaints in the other departments where he had worked. Furthermore, he stated that no discussion with Ron Perkio regarding the complainant ever took place.\n[141] Again in the cross-examination by counsel for the complainant, the witness told the Tribunal that regarding the personal investigation experience the complainant referred to in his application (see pages 595 and 596, Exhibit C-3, Tab 105), he considered that \u201ca hobby\u201d on personal time.\n[142] He stated that even if that statement was serious, it was strictly private in nature. He believed that that information could not be considered as an extensive investigation as part of the third TI-06 application.\n[143] Thus, he told the Tribunal that he was unable to measure the complainant\u2019s understanding of the law. Similarly, he had no basis from which to judge the complainant\u2019s knowledge of the law.\n[144] Finally, in the cross-examination by counsel for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, on his knowledge of the complainant\u2019s former complaints that he found out about in a discussion with Brian Bramah, the witness told the Tribunal that he had only heard the complainant\u2019s name and that he had filed human rights complaints, nothing else.\n[145] As another witness in support of its evidence, the respondent called Sonya Wood, one of the three members of the selection board for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position.\n[146] In her testimony, Ms. Wood told the Tribunal that she did not check the references provided by the complainant. However, in her testimony, she referred to an email dated February 20, 2006, that followed an email sent to her by John Lavers on February 15, 2006, where Mr. Lavers stated that the references provided by Mr. Hughes raised \u201csome interesting questions\u201d (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 33).\n[147] Moreover, two responses to Mr. Lavers\u2019 email appear in that tab. First, Ron Perkio replied the following to Mr. Lavers\u2019 email:\nNot a good sign. Sonya to you for the department policy on this one.\nRon\n[148] Subsequently, Sonya Wood replied to the emails from Mr. Lavers and Mr. Perkio on February 20, 2006, as follows:\nHi, as discussed at my telecon, with John this a.m., if a Selection Board is unable to obtain or to complete verbal reference checks for a candidate (and or if Referees decline to provide verbal info\/feedback) the selection board should still proceed with assessing the candidate\u2019s Personal Suitability qualifications, using whatever information\/tools the Board has access to.\ni.e., in this case I recommended to John that he ask Mr Hughes for copies of any Performance Evaluations and Letters of Reference\/Recommendation that he may have. I understand John as obtained some PER\u2019s written info from Mr Hughes, so in our capacity of Selection Board we\u2019ll need to review & consider all the info contained in the PER\u2019s has well as any\/all info we\u2019ve compiled through the interview process, and finalize our assessment of Mr Hughes in each of the Personal Suitability sub-factors.\nSonya\n(See Exhibit C-1, Tab 33, page 188.)\n[149] Then, Ms. Wood reviewed the documents provided by Chris Hughes (see R-4) as part of the information Mr. Lavers required to complete the assessment of the references that he could obtain and any other document as described above in Ms. Wood\u2019s email dated February 20, 2006.\n[150] Generally, Ms. Wood believed that the documents did not make it possible to establish that the complainant has qualities showing that he is detail-oriented and, in some cases, the comments in that respect were very limited.\n[151] Ms. Wood also told the Tribunal that the detail-oriented criterion had to be assessed based on consensus among all of the board members. She told the Tribunal that checking Mr. Hughes\u2019 references was not possible given that only Bill DiGuistini had responded.\n[152] She told the Tribunal that even if Mr. Hughes\u2019 interview was adequate, if Mr. Hughes did not provide any references, there was a lack of information. She therefore confirmed that the overall assessment was done in that manner and thus, a score of 12\/20 was attributed to Mr. Hughes for that reason.\n[153] Again in the cross-examination by counsel for the complainant, he reviewed with the witness, Sonya Wood, the documents shown in Exhibit R-4.\n[154] Overall, Ms. Wood claims that the information provided on the detail-oriented criterion was not essentially negative, but did not present sufficient information to be able to characterize the complainant as being detail-oriented.\n[155] Finally, counsel for the complainant also reviewed other applications with Ms. Wood and compared them with the complainant\u2019s application.\n[156] In a question related to Exhibit C-1, Tab 41, that is, an evaluation report signed by the selection board members, counsel referred to the fact that some written comments that had appeared in the other evaluation reports had been erased in that of the complainant (see Tabs 39, 40, 41, in particular page 222 of Tab 40).\n[157] In fact, in his cross-examination, counsel referred to the fact that the letters VG (for \u201cvery good\u201d) had been erased from the evaluation pages in the complainant\u2019s report.\n[158] The witness replied that she could not understand why the said handwritten comments had been erased.\n[159] As the last witness in support of the evidence, the respondent called John Lavers.\n[160] In his testimony, Mr. Lavers stated that he had been responsible for finding candidates for the marine security analyst position, a highly sensitive position.\n[161] He told the Tribunal that he was the one who had created the requirements shown in Exhibit C-1, Tab 5, for the marine security analyst (PM-04) competition.\n[162] Similarly, in his testimony, he referred to the qualifications for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position, which appear in Exhibit C-1, Tab 6, and indicated that some of the requirements had an asterisk, which meant they were non-compensatory qualifications.\n[163] Similarly, he stated that \u201ccandidates must achieve the minimum established pass mark for each non-compensatory qualification in order to receive further consideration\u201d (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 6, page 23).\n[164] He stated that, regarding the definition of \u201cdetail-oriented\u201d, it involved finding people who paid attention to detail and demonstrated due diligence to details.\n[165] In his testimony, Mr. Lavers stated that, at the references stage, all of the references provided by the complainant had refused to participate, except for one person, Bill DiGuistini. He reviewed the answers to a questionnaire (Exhibit C-1, Tab 37) in which Mr. Lavers noted Mr. DiGuistini\u2019s answers regarding the complainant\u2019s qualifications.\n[166] Similarly, he drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to page 197 (Exhibit C-1, Tab 37) of questionnaire P.S.3 on the detail-oriented criterion, where Mr. DiGuistini\u2019s answers had been noted by Mr. Lavers with a score of 12\/20.\n[167] When asked about the evaluation form shown in Exhibit C-1, Tab 40, which bears his signature, he stated that, to question 14 (page 231) on the detail-oriented criterion, his comment to the effect that there had been insufficient cooperation had affected the complainant\u2019s overall evaluation.\n[168] Following this poor answer, regarding the lack of cooperation from the references provided by the complainant, Mr. Lavers therefore gave a score of 12\/20 for the detail-oriented criterion.\n[169] He also mentioned that with respect to the detail-oriented question for which the complainant did not receive a passing grade, there apparently was a consensus by the board in that regard (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 41).\n[170] In cross-examination, Mr. Lavers mentioned that the search for candidates for the marine security analyst position was conducted in the context of a national security policy established in 2004 with a view to protecting the domain of Canada.\n[171] Consequently, the selection board was looking for high-calibre candidates.\n[172] In that regard, the bar was set high at that point in seeking quality candidates for the marine security analyst PM-04 position and he mentioned that he apparently raised the evaluation charter for said position.\n[173] He indicated to the Tribunal that in the search for candidates, there was no favouritism, exception or exemption and that there was a need to verify the candidates\u2019 references. There was no deviation for any candidate in the assessment of candidates.\n[174] Because the complainant failed to qualify during his interview with the board, and since the reference check was part of the interview in the assessment process, it was essential to obtain references from the complainant and to verify said references.\n[175] Thus, in correspondence with the complainant at the very beginning of February 2006, the complainant provided Mr. Lavers with a series of names of either previous supervisors, validators, or co-workers.\n[176] He told the Tribunal that he sought to obtain references from persons in authority or persons in supervisory positions in relation to the complainant.\n[177] Specifically, the witness stated that he relied on the instructions of Human Resources to validate each of the candidates\u2019 references from supervisors.\n[178] He also told the Tribunal that this was in that context that he had email exchanges with the complainant, which appear in Exhibit C-1, Tab 28, and in respect of which he sought the opinion of Sonya Wood.\n[179] Thus, the complainant provided him with the exhibits that appear in Document R-4. In reviewing the information regarding the references provided by the complainant in said Exhibit R-4, Mr. Lavers found that none of the references provided agreed to act as references for the complainant except for Bill DiGuistini. As far as Mr. DiGuistini was concerned, Mr. Lavers stated that he did not answer the detail-oriented question, and that no pertinent information was provided (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 37, page 197).\n[180] With respect to all the references that were allegedly provided by the complainant, Mr. Lavers referred to a document appearing in Exhibit C-1, Tab 32, which indicates his notations about each of the references he contacted.\n[181] In response to a question posed by counsel for the complainant regarding the requirement to obtain answers from a superior to the detail-oriented question, and in respect of which no mention was made in the evaluation form regarding this requirement (see Exhibit C-1, Tab 40, page 231), Mr. Lavers replied \u201cgood question for HR\u201d.\n[182] Finally, Mr. Lavers acknowledged that based on Bill DiGuistini\u2019s answers, which were neither positive nor negative, in relation to the detail-oriented criterion for the complainant, he consequently determined that the complainant did not meet the detail-oriented criteria and that he was not detail-oriented.\n[183] In response to another question posed by counsel for the complainant as to whether Mr. Lavers wondered why all the contacts provided by the complainant refused to act as references for him, Mr. Lavers replied that it was a big question for him and that he had asked himself that same question but was unable to come up with a specific answer.\n[184] In addition, Mr. Lavers stated \u201cobviously there is a consistency or a pattern\u201d (see cross-examination of Mr. Lavers, September 11, 2013), indicating that many people refused to provide references, specifically Bill DiGuistini and Kathryn Pringle.\n[185] On cross-examination by counsel for Canadian Human Rights Commission, Mr. Lavers was asked why he had not called the complainant\u2019s employer when the complainant was working for ICBC.\n[186] In that respect, counsel drew the witness\u2019 attention to an email dated February 6, 2006, addressed by the complainant to Mr. Lavers containing a notation that the complainant was hired by ICBC without reservation and in that regard, the complainant allegedly offered to provide a reference from ICBC if it were necessary for the selection board.\n[187] John Lavers answered this question by indicating that in the interview document, there was no reference to ICBC and no telephone number suggested by the complainant in his email of February 6, 2006.\n[188] He added that there was no name, title or telephone number provided by the complainant in that respect. Also, in response to another question posed by counsel for the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Mr. Lavers indicated that he did not remember asking the complainant for a name for reference purposes from his employer at the time, that is, ICBC.\n[189] In addition, he mentioned that references are provided to the board by each of the candidates and that in the complainant\u2019s case, all the references provided were related to the CRA and the CBSA and not to ICBC.\n[190] Still during the same cross-examination, Mr. Lavers indicated that he did not contact any of the complainant\u2019s co-workers considering that he only contacted the complainant\u2019s supervisors.\n[191] Moreover, he noted in his cross-examination by the Canadian Human Rights Commission representative that the document pertaining to the reference check, particularly the one he had prepared by contacting Bill DiGuistini (Exhibit C-1, Tab 37), required responses from supervisors of all candidates based on the drafting of the reference check document.\n[192] Mr. Lavers also indicated that he had to speak with someone directly and not simply refer to documents that may have been provided by the candidates.\n[193] In response to a question regarding emails sent by Sonya Wood dated February 7, 2006, (7:55 a.m.) (Exhibit C-1, Tab 28) and February 20, 2006 (8:49 a.m.) (Exhibit C-1, Tab 33) about Ms. Wood\u2019s recommendations for obtaining letters or candidate assessment reports from the candidates, and seeking additional or alternative references from various contacts, Mr. Lavers reiterated that he was unaware of all Human Resources policies applicable at the time, and that he only directly sought out the persons suggested as references required to assess the candidates\u2019 abilities.\n[194] Consequently, in the case of the complainant Chris Hughes, he contacted persons who were provided by the complainant.\n[195] Other questions were posed to him by the representative of the Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding the documents provided by the complainant under Exhibit R-4 which include various assessments as well as potential references, including Kathryn Pringle.\n[196] Mr. Lavers indicated that in the case of Ms. Pringle, she refused to act as a reference, but that he did not ask her specifically why she refused to act as a reference for the complainant.\nIII. Law [197] In support of their submissions, the parties provided the Tribunal with their written arguments, which were also presented at the hearing.\n[198] Was the complainant discriminated against under section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act?\n[199] First, I will address this first issue for all the applications the complainant submitted.\n[200] Thus, it is useful to recall that the provisions of sections 2 and 3 of the Act with respect to the purpose of the Act and the prohibited grounds of discrimination now refer to prohibited grounds of discrimination involving a complainant with a disability.\n[201] Also, the provisions of section 25 of the Act indicate as follows with respect to the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d:\n\u201cdisability\u201d means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[202] The legal principles underlying the application of the Canadian Human Rights Act are now well known. It is for the complainant to establish on a prima facie basis a case of discrimination or at least one of the alleged grounds.\n[203] In that respect, the threshold required to establish a case of discrimination is extremely low. Thus, the Supreme Court of Canada indicates that \u201c[a] prima facie case. . . is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536, at page 558). This answer or explanation from the respondent must be credible.\n[204] Also, the response or explanation must be sufficient and not a pretext (Basi v. Canadian National Railway (No. 1), (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T), at paragraph 38474).\n[205] Once the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the complainant is thus entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 SCR 202, at pages 202 to 208).\n[206] To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the complainant must establish that he was subject to differential treatment on the basis of his disability, contrary to the provisions of section 7 of the Act. In that regard, the complainant need not show that the discrimination was unintentional. (Bhinder v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1985] 2 SCR 561).\n[207] Once the prima facie case is established, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent to demonstrate that the alleged discrimination either did not occur or that the behaviour appeared to be non-discriminatory or justified. It is useful to note that the respondent may establish this proof on a balance of probabilities.\n[208] In Premakumar v. Air Canada, (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.), the matter concerned the application of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in the employment context.\n[209] Thus, I would like to point out the following passage from the decision of the Chairperson, Anne Mactavish:\n[75] In the employment context, a prima facie case has been described as requiring proof of the following elements:\na) that the complainant was qualified for the particular employment;\nb) that the complainant was not hired; and\nc) that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (i.e.: race, colour etc.) subsequently obtained the position. (Shakes v. Rex Pak Limited, (1989), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (1982), at paragraph D\/1002.)\n[210] Furthermore, Chairperson Mactavish adds the following:\n[76] This multi-part test has been modified to address situations where the complainant is not hired and the respondent continues to look for suitable candidates. In such cases, the establishment of a prima facie case requires proof:\na) that the complainant belongs to one of the groups which are subject to discrimination under the Act, e.g. religious, handicapped or racial groups;\nb) that the complainant applied and was qualified for a job that the employer wished to fill;\nc) that, although qualified, the complainant was rejected; and\nd) that, thereafter, the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant's qualifications.(Israeli v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission, (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616, at page 1618.)\n[211] Moreover, it is useful to read paragraph 79 of the decision:\nThe jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi:\nDiscrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly, in fact, there are rarely cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced. (Basi v. Canadian National Railway (No. 1), (1998), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, at para. 38474 (C.H.R.T.)\nRather, it is the task of the Tribunal to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists what was described in the Basi case as the \u2018subtle scent of discrimination\u2019.\n[212] Finally, at paragraph 82 of the decision, she indicates that\n[i]t is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if Mr. Premakumar's race, his color or his national or ethnic origin were factors in the decision not to hire him. (Holden v. Canadian National Railway, (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, at page D\/15.)\n[213] In addition, as in most cases of discrimination, direct evidence is rarely available. In this context, the case law has developed a test applicable to the submission of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.\n[214] Thus, in Basi, noted above, it is stated:\nI am persuaded by the logic employed by B. Vizkelety in her recent book: Proven Discrimination in Canada, (1987) Carswell, where she states at page 142:\n\u201cit is suggested that the Kennedy (v. Mohawk College) Standard reflects a criminal as opposed to a civil standard of proof and that, as such, it is too rigid. There is indeed, virtual unanimity that the usual standard of proof in discrimination cases is a civil standard of preponderance. The appropriate test in matters involving circumstantial evidence, which should be consistent with this standard, may therefore be formulated in this manner: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses.\u201d (Page 11 of the decision.)\n[215] In formulating my decisions with respect to each application by the complainant in his evidence, I will, therefore, proceed in the same order. Accordingly, each application will be reviewed in the following order:\na. Marine security analyst (PM-04 competition \u2013 reference number 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005187);\nb. Regional security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005467);\nc. Regional transportation security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 06-MOT-OC-VAN-008455);\nd. Transportation security inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 07-MOT-EA-VAN-60712).\nA. Marine security analyst (PM-04 competition \u2013 reference number 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005187) [216] In applying the various jurisprudential tests established earlier, with respect to the complainant\u2019s first application for this application, I conclude that in fact the complainant\u2019s evidence meets the Premakumar criteria based on Shakes, as mentioned above.\n[217] Indeed, I find that the evidence showed that the complainant was qualified for the particular employment, and\nb. that the complainant was not hired; and\nc. that someone no better qualified but lacking the distinguishing feature which is the gravamen of the human rights complaint (the complainant\u2019s alleged disability) subsequently obtained the position.\n[218] As for the criteria mentioned above, I find that a prima facie case was made by the complainant.\n[219] Thus, criteria \u201cB and C\u201d and the fact that the employer continued to seek applicants with the complainant's qualifications were proven. At least, I will discuss more particularly the first criterion: whether the complainant was qualified for the particular employment, and specifically, the issue of the detail-oriented criterion for which the complainant did not receive a passing grade from the selection board.\n[220] In that regard, a number of troubling factors have led the Tribunal to conclude that the subtle scent of discrimination existed with respect to the first application by the complainant for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position.\n[221] Indeed, the evidence showed that first, when the complainant disclosed his references to John Lavers, he also mentioned his previous disabilities in relation to his various employers (CRA and CBSA), as well as the difficulties he encountered in obtaining references in support of his application.\n[222] Although not overtly admitted, the various persons referred to by the complainant to provide references for him systematically refused support his application despite the fact that the evidence also indicated that some of them had previously agreed to act as references for the complainant.\n[223] Considering that said knowledge was acquired by the chair of the selection board, John Lavers, it appear doubtful that the complainant could not have obtained an adequate passing grade, especially in the absence of positive or negative feedback provided by Bill DiGuistini, which in essence Mr. Lavers relied on to negatively annotate the detail-oriented criterion for the complainant.\n[224] Also, various documents provided by the complainant (R-4) were provided to the selection board and should have been considered to the complainant\u2019s benefit with respect to his abilities regarding the detail-oriented criterion, not to his detriment. (See R-4, pages 182, 188, 195, 198, 199, 209 and 211.)\n[225] The evidence showed that Mr. Lavers expressed his preference to communicate with persons directly rather than to refer to the documents provided to him. The Tribunal has difficulty understanding such an attitude on Mr. Lavers\u2019 part when the various emails between him and Sonya Wood, then responsible for human resources in support of the selection board, clearly established that the selection board had to rely on all useful and relevant information, including the documentation provided by the complainant.\n[226] Nor can the Tribunal accept the testimony of Sonya Wood that the documents provided were insufficient or incomplete as far as she was concerned. Faced with the abundance of documentation provided by the complainant for the purposes of the selection board, in the absence of positive feedback sought by Mr. Lavers and taking into account the complainant\u2019s particular circumstances, which were disclosed to Mr. Lavers by the complainant, the selection board should have taken a more liberal approach to the complainant\u2019s circumstances.\n[227] Without discussing reprisals directly, the Tribunal notes that the selection board was significantly influenced by the lack of references and, in particular, by the rather neutral comments of Bill DiGuistini about the complainant.\n[228] However, how is it that some of the references in question agreed to provide positive feedback in the past for the complainant, whereas suddenly, in the context of the application under review, none of them agreed to act as a reference for the complainant?\n[229] In that regard, the Tribunal certainly noted the response of Mr. Lavers, who indicated \u201ca consistency or a pattern\u201d with respect to the refusal to obtain positive feedback by said persons in favour of the complainant.\n[230] Either directly or indirectly, the lack of positive feedback in the complainant\u2019s case should have undoubtedly been offset by the amount of positive documentation showing on a balance of probabilities that the complainant met the detail-oriented criteria.\n[231] However, the evidence also showed that other candidates who had applied for the same position received positive comments qualifying them for the detail-oriented criteria, whereas a careful review of their application indicates that their answers were certainly no better than those of the complainant (see Exhibits C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, and C-10).\n[232] The Tribunal notes that with respect to the various applications of other candidates, the comments regarding the detail-oriented question at the reference check stage appear to be in some cases comparable or inferior to those of the complainant.\n[233] Based on this comparative analysis of the other candidates\u2019 applications with that of the complainant, it is difficult to understand why the complainant\u2019s application was not accepted. Mr. Lavers indicated that the analysis of the references provided by a candidate was instrumental in confirming a candidate\u2019s interview and thus adequately score the detail-oriented criteria for each candidate.\n[234] Indeed, with respect to the complainant\u2019s application, Mr. Lavers considered that the only reference available, that is, that of Bill DiGuistini, was the basis for the final score of 12\/20 that the complainant received from the selection board.\n[235] However, the evidence showed that Mr. DiGuistini did not provide sufficient information as to Mr. Hughes\u2019 application and that, at the very least, the information provided by Mr. Hughes could be characterized as neutral.\n[236] The Tribunal finds that the score of 12\/20 that was granted to the complainant was very severe given that the complainant had provided the selection board with written information that the complainant possessed some aspects of the detail-oriented criterion.\n[237] In this regard, considering the emails sent by Sonya Wood to the other members of the selection board, as previously indicated in the facts section of this case, the Tribunal finds that based on the information held by the board, a different mark could have been given to the complainant.\n[238] Moreover, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that all the board members were aware of the complainant\u2019s problems with other agencies, which were disclosed to them in the context of the evidence previously revealed.\n[239] Based strictly on the information provided in Exhibit R-4, in comparison with the other candidates\u2019 applications and the comments therein, the Tribunal finds that the complainant was discriminated against.\n[240] As additional circumstantial evidence, the Tribunal noted that certain VG (for \u201cvery good\u201d) comments were erased from the candidate\u2019s application and that no explanation was provided by any of the members of the selection board. The Tribunal found this situation as being troubling with respect to the facts of the case.\n[241] Again, the Tribunal has difficulty explaining the selection board\u2019s behaviour, particularly after Sonya Wood in an email dated February 7, 2006 (Exhibit C-1, Tab 33) indicated that the selection board had to and should use all other options or tools to allow the selection board to reach a conclusion in the context of an application.\n[242] Consequently, and considering the emails of Ms. Wood to the other members of the selection board to the same effect, the Tribunal finds that said selection board\u2019 attitude toward the complainant in the analysis of his case was severe.\n[243] Also, the Tribunal must point out that the lack of references certainly was a factor weighing against the complainant, as indicated by Mr. Lavers, and a more detailed analysis of the information provided in Exhibit R-4 by the complainant should have been considered more positively by the selection board.\n[244] Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the complainant has discharged his burden of proof and has therefore established a prima facie case as a necessary condition for indicating a violation of section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[245] Has the respondent now discharged its burden of proof in relation to that prima facie evidence?\n[246] I do not think so.\n[247] Indeed, on an extensive analysis of the evidence and most certainly based on the information contained above regarding the prima facie evidence adduced by the complainant, I conclude that the selection board offered no credible response with respect to its decision to screen out the complainant\u2019s application.\n[248] Based on the answers provided by Ms. Wood and Mr. Lavers in their testimony, the Tribunal notes that their answers appeared within permissible limits with respect to their intervention in their analysis of the complainant\u2019s application.\n[249] The Tribunal finds that Ms. Wood brushed aside all the documents provided by the complainant in Exhibit R-4 with the various comments of the complainant demonstrating some aspects of the detail-oriented criterion.\n[250] Thus, she indicated that some passages were interesting or assumed that the complainant met the detail-oriented criterion qualification, but nothing more. Hence, the Tribunal was not satisfied and did not find Ms. Wood\u2019s answers regarding her analysis of the documents in Exhibit R-4 credible.\n[251] As for Mr. Lavers, the Tribunal finds that he did not conduct a comprehensive and careful analysis of all the documentation provided by the complainant (Exhibit R-4) allowing him to understand that the complainant did meet the detail-oriented criterion. In that regard, the Tribunal finds that at the time of the analysis of the complainant\u2019s file Mr. Lavers could have most certainly done more and have been more receptive to the documentation provided by the complainant.\n[252] Again, compared with the other applicants\u2019 files that were provided at the hearing, the Tribunal finds that the complainant should have received a score that was at the very least equivalent to the other files and thus obtained the required score to meet the detail-oriented criterion.\n[253] By acting in this manner, the Tribunal finds that, albeit indirectly or unintentionally, the case for discrimination was established and therefore, the respondent\u2019s reasons for screening out the complainant\u2019s appear non-credible and as noted in the case law, the tribunal finds that it was a pretext to screen out his application.\n[254] Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the complainant\u2019s complaint is substantiated with respect to the provisions of section 7(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act in relation to his complaint regarding his marine security analyst (PM-04) application.\nB. Regional security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005467) [255] With respect to this application, the same question must be reviewed regarding the conditions required by the case law to determine whether a prima facie case was indeed established by the complainant.\n[256] In that regard, there is an issue as to whether the complainant was qualified for the particular employment.\n[257] First, the Tribunal referred to a document dated May 17, 2006, which provides the results obtained by the various candidates on the written tests (Written Communication Test 345) (See Exhibit C-2, Tab 72). Contained in the document is the fact that complainant Chris Hughes did not pass said test.\n[258] For the purposes of this application, the selection board consisted of Ron Perkio and Sonya Wood, who were part of the first selection board for the marine security analyst (PM-04) position, and William Keenlyside.\n[259] In his arguments, the complainant\u2019s representative indicates that the requirements of the written test were substantially the same as those of the PM-04 position test that the complainant passed.\n[260] The complainant\u2019s representative questions whether different written tests were used for the PM-04 and TI-06 applications. The Tribunal notes that these types of administrative constraints do not suffice to establish elements of discrimination against the complainant directly.\n[261] Indeed, the same criteria were applied for all the candidates, without distinction.\n[262] Consequently, the Tribunal cannot accept the complainant\u2019s argument on that point.\n[263] However, in his testimony, the complainant indicated with respect to his complaint dated January 27, 2008, regarding his application for the first TI-06 position, that he received a mark of 60% and that he was not pleased with the test administered at the time.\n[264] As for the mark of 60% that the complainant received on the written test, and the reference in his complaint (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 128, page 721, 3rd paragraph \u201cafter T.C. knew about my health issues they set the pass mark at 70% sometime in April 2006\u201d (Testimony excerpt dated March 19, 2013, pages 99-100)), the complainant indicates in a question posed by his counsel that he previously misread the dates in the emails prior to completing his complaint.\n[265] Also, in response to a question posed by his counsel in re-examination (Testimony excerpt March 20, 2013 pages 76-77), counsel for the complainant sought the following clarification:\nBut I note that in the second to last sentence of this paragraph you say: this was no reason for T.C. to use the WCT over a local test.\nCounsel for the complainant later asks: Is that still a part of your complaint?\nA No.\n[266] And in response to a subsequent question of the undersigned to the complainant, the complainant states the following:\nIt is no longer part of the complaint? Is that what you just mentioned Mr. Hughes?\nThe witness\u2019 response was as follows:\nWell, I would have preferred they use a local test, but I don\u2019t think there was a prohibited (sic) reason why they used it, if that makes sense\n(Testimony excerpt of March 20, 2013, page 77, line 4.)\n[267] In light of these excerpts from the testimony, the respondent\u2019s representative indicates that the complainant dropped these allegations in respect of his first application for the TI-06 position. The Tribunal indeed notes that through this allegation the complainant did not intend to pursue his complaint regarding the first TI-06 position.\n[268] Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the prima facie case with respect to the establishment of the first criterion established by the case law, that is, whether the complainant was qualified for the particular employment, was not satisfied and, therefore, the complainant\u2019s complaint regarding the first TI-06 position cannot be upheld.\nC. Regional transportation security and emergency preparedness inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 06-MOT-OC-VAN-008455) [269] Again, did the complainant discharge his burden of proof of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination based on the tests described above?\n[270] More specifically, regarding the first question, was the complainant qualified for the particular employment?\n[271] The evidence showed that the complainant\u2019s application was screened out because the complainant did not demonstrate that he met the experience in conducting investigations criterion. In that regard, it is useful to consult the email of Carole Stidwill dated October 12, 2006, addressed to the complainant (see Exhibit C-2, Tab 96).\n[272] In his complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (R-1), the complainant maintains that he was discriminated against, considering that he demonstrated the experience requirements of the application. It is again useful to note that said requirement was mandatory.\n[273] In his argument, counsel for the complainant indicates that the complainant possessed the experience required for the first TI-06 application and, therefore, he certainly had the qualifications required for the second TI-06 position in terms of the experience required in conducting investigations.\n[274] In reply, the respondent\u2019s representative indicates that the complainant\u2019s application was rejected because the selection board stated that the complainant did not have the qualifications required to qualify for the experience in conducting investigations criteria.\n[275] Strictly in regards to the specific question that the Tribunal consider whether the complainant did, indeed, possess the required qualifications for the \u201cexperience in conducting investigations\u201d criteria, it is difficult for the Tribunal to address and review the criteria applied to this specific question by the selection board.\n[276] In that regard, the respondent called William Keenlyside to adequately answer the question of whether the complainant did, indeed, possess the required experience for said position.\n[277] On cross-examination by counsel for the complainant, counsel asked the witness whether he was able to assess the complainant\u2019s performance as a customs inspector. In that regard, the witness replied that if experience was not indicated in the candidate\u2019s application he could not read between the lines and subjectively make a positive or negative judgment considering that this would be unfair for the other candidates.\n[278] In that regard, Mr. Keenlyside indicated that the experience mentioned by the complainant in support of his application with respect to his experience in conducting investigations was lacking in details (Testimony excerpt dated March 21, 2013, page 131).\n[279] This last assertion by Mr. Keenlyside corroborated what was written in a report prepared by the selection board with respect to the results obtained by the various candidates which indicated that the complainant received the comment \u201cinsufficient invest\u201d (Exhibit C-2, Tab 88, page 501).\n[280] While the Tribunal can accept that the complainant did discharge his burden of establishing that a prima facie case that he was qualified for this particular employment, the explanation provided by the respondent\u2019s representative does not indicate that the exclusion of the application was based on a pretext. In that regard, although the analysis of this question is subject to the selection board and the criteria considered, based on the evidence presented before the Tribunal, I cannot find that said explanation was not credible or that it was a pretext.\n[281] In that regard, the board certainly had all the latitude required to apply the pertinent and necessary criteria in assessing the applications submitted and the Tribunal is not in a position to review such criteria in the absence of evidence that the board allegedly acted unreasonably or on the basis of pretext. I do not find that the evidence revealed such aspects.\n[282] Consequently, I find that the explanations provided by the respondent appear credible and the reasons alleged to screen out the complainant\u2019s application are maintained. The complainant\u2019s complaint regarding the second application does not, therefore, appear to be founded.\nD. Transportation security inspector (TI-06 competition \u2013 selection process 07-MOT-EA-VAN-60712) [283] As indicated in the memorandum provided by the respondent\u2019s representative, it is stated that the complainant\u2019s application with respect to this third TI-06 application was rejected because the complainant did not demonstrate that he had extensive experience in conducting investigations.\n[284] Again, the respondent submits that said criterion was a mandatory requirement, as appears in the explanatory pamphlet of this third application (Exhibit C- 3, Tab 103).\n[285] Again, the Tribunal must consider whether the complainant established a prima facie case that he was qualified for the particular employment in accordance with the provisions of Premakumar, supra.\n[286] In his written submissions, the complainant\u2019s representative indicates that the requirements and required experience with respect to this third TI-06 position were modified and that it would be even more difficult to find suitable candidates.\n[287] Thus, the evidence shows that in this third application the complainant modified his application to include different notations regarding his suitability and, in particular, he noted past experiences including the complaints filed against the CRA and the CBSA (Exhibit C-3, Tab 105, pages 595 and 596).\n[288] According to the written information provided by the complainant in support of his application for this third TI-06 position, a simple reading of said information leads the Tribunal to conclude that the complainant did, indeed, discharge his prima facie burden of proof of establishing that he had the essential qualifications for this third application, and more particularly, whether he possessed extensive experience in conducting investigations.\n[289] Accordingly, is the explanation provided by the respondent to reject the complainant\u2019s application credible or merely a pretext?\n[290] As noted above, it is not for the Tribunal to determine whether the criteria applied by the selection board to select candidates is adequate. The issue for the Tribunal is whether in making the decision which led to the selection board rejecting the complainant\u2019s application, did the selection board acted in a biased manner or whether it applied criteria, even unintentionally, that would prove that said selection board engaged in a discriminatory practice in the rejection of the complainant\u2019s application. Such are the issues for the Tribunal to determine.\n[291] In presenting its evidence, the respondent called Michael Fu as a witness who was one of the members of the selection board with respect to this third application.\n[292] Thus, in his testimony, Mr. Fu referred to his notes dated June 20, 2007, in which Mr. Hughes\u2019 application was rejected with the note \u201cnot extensive, not work-related, personal issue\u201d (Exhibit C-3, Tab 107, page 609).\n[293] In his testimony, Mr. Fu indicated that this was the first time he noted that a candidate had included his personal experience outside of work to demonstrate an experience qualification as being extensive investigation.\n[294] Mr. Fu characterized what the complainant included as his personal complaints against the CRA and the CBSA as being \u201cpersonal issues\u201d. He indicated that he considered these responses to be a hobby and, speaking of the complainant, he stated: \u201cI read the legislation at home and I am now knowledgeable about that same legislation\u201d. According to Mr. Fu, even if one becomes conversant with that legislation, this is not sufficient to obtain the required qualifications.\n[295] He therefore considered that what the complainant referred to was not \u201cextensive\u201d and, as a result, he made the decision to reject the complainant\u2019s application for that reason.\n[296] On cross-examination, Mr. Fu added that he did not know how the complainant had approached this question. More particularly, he indicated that he did not know what the complainant\u2019s understanding of the applicable legislation was. He indicated that there was no basis for assessing such knowledge from the information provided by the complainant (see Testimony excerpt dated March 22, 2013, page 38, lines 1 to 12).\n[297] In response to a question posed by counsel for the complainant, as to whether there was an indication in the job advertisement with respect to extensive experience in conducting investigations that said experience necessarily had to be worked-related, the witness stated that there was no mention of that in the job advertisement.\n[298] However, it appears to the Tribunal that the answer to this last question becomes more subjective with respect to the criteria appearing in the job advertisement in issue and that the selection board had the necessary latitude to verify whether a candidate did, indeed, possess the experience sought for the purposes of this application.\n[299] I therefore find that the explanation provided by the respondent regarding the rejection of the complainant\u2019s third application for a TI-06 position appears to be credible and reasonable in light of all the circumstances of this case.\n[300] Accordingly, the complainant\u2019s complaint as to the third application also does not appear be founded.\nE. The provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act [301] In its arguments, the Canadian Human Rights Commission asks the Tribunal to rule on the provisions of section 14.1 of the Act and addresses its questions as follows:\n8. With respect to the allegations of retaliation, this complaint raises the following issues:\na) Whether section 14.1 of the Act protects individuals who have filed discrimination complaints against one department\/agency of the Crown from retaliatory actions of another department or agency of the Crown. In another word, whether this section should be read as covering incidents of retaliation of another department or agency of the Crown which is not the entity against which the complaint has been filed.\nb) If the answer to a) is affirmative, did the Respondent deny Mr. Hughes\u2019 employment because of his complaints against CBSA and CRA?\n[302] In her written submissions, the Canadian Human Rights Commission representative notes that the respondent did not answer the first question mentioned above and consequently, she indicates that the Tribunal should adopt the Commission\u2019s position, which is not in dispute.\n[303] Upon verification of the documentation provided by the respondent with regard to the Commission\u2019s submissions on the provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the respondent states that the complainant specifically named Transport Canada in his complaint and no other department or agency.\n[304] The respondent submits that if the complainant had decided to file a complaint against the other federal government departments, he would have then named the Attorney General of Canada as respondent. Also, the respondent submits that if the complainant had intended to file a complaint against the CBSA or the CRA, he would have had to have named those agencies directly as respondents, which the complainant did not do.\n[305] Subsequently, the respondent indicates that the employer of the respondent, Transport Canada, is the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, and that the CRA\u2019s employer is the CRA and that the CBSA\u2019s employer is the CBSA, as set out in the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in section 2 of the Public Service Employment Act.\n[306] The respondent also submits that there is no evidence in the record to support a finding of retaliation against any other government department or by Transport Canada. In that regard, the respondent argues that while references were provided using individuals from other government agencies such as the CRA or the CBSA, no negative inference can be drawn from their refusal to act as references for the complainant.\n[307] Consequently, the respondent submits that there is no evidence before the Tribunal to support the allegation of retaliation.\n[308] As for the complainant\u2019s position on this issue, the complainant\u2019s representative did not express any disagreement with the Commission\u2019s position.\n[309] To properly answer the questions posed by the Commission, the Tribunal must consider the specific provisions of section 14.1 of the Act, which read as follows:\n14.1. It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[310] Thus, the text of section 14.1 implies that a discriminatory practice can take place at two levels, namely:\nBy a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III; or\nAny person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[311] The Tribunal will therefore examine each of these two aspects of section 14.1 of the Act with respect to the facts of this case.\na) a person against whom a complaint has been filed\n[312] Did the respondent retaliate against the complainant pursuant to the provisions of section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act by means of this part of section 14.1 of the CHRA, namely: \u201ca person against whom a complaint has been filed\u201d?\n[313] In its memorandum, the Commission refers to Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, (2001), T.D. 06\/01. Pursuant to that decision of the Tribunal, retaliation may be proven without a party having to prove the intent of the respondent to do so.\n[314] Furthermore, the Tribunal may infer that retaliation did occur within the meaning of section 14.1 of the Act through circumstantial evidence established on the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities (see reference cited at paragraph 212 above).\n[315] Thus, all the criteria established by the case law with respect to the level of evidence required for the complainant remain applicable, that is to say that, the complainant must establish a prima facie case that the respondent retaliated against him pursuant to the provisions of section 14.1 of the Act (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at page 558, Basi v. Canadian National Railway (No.1), (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (Can.Trib.)).\n[316] But whom exactly is being referred to when section 14.1 of the Act states: \u201ca person against whom a complaint has been filed\u201d?\n[317] Is it the respondent or the CRA and\/or the CBSA?\n[318] The evidence showed that the complaints made by complainant under Part III were against the CRA and the CBSA and not against the respondent.\n[319] Indeed, the complainant clearly established in his complaint and testimony that he had disclosed the existence of his previous problems with the CRA and the CBSA to John Lavers in February 2006 when he provide him with his references. No mention was made of complaints made under Part III against the respondent at the time.\n[320] Also, upon rereading the Commission\u2019s memorandum on this issue, the Commission asks the Tribunal to address the provisions of section 14.1 based on the position of the respondent, who allegedly acted as an agent. Furthermore, upon rereading the reasons for the decision it rendered (see Exhibit C-3, Tab 131, page 727), the Commission only mentions this last aspect.\n[321] For the reasons expressed below, the respondent cannot be found liable under the pretence that it allegedly acted as an agent for the CRA and \/or the CBSA.\n[322] Could have the respondent retaliated on its own initiative, without being the agent of the CRA and \/or the CBSA? That is the question to be answered.\n[323] An analysis of the text of this part of section 14.1 of the Act (\u201ca person against whom a complaint has been made\u201d) does not make it possible to make a positive finding that the respondent may be held liable.\n[324] Indeed, a careful reading of this statutory text supports a clear inference that a restrictive interpretation must be applied as to the identification of the \u201cperson\u201d sought in this case. In fact, the persons named in the complaints made by the complainant under Part III are the CRA and the CBSA, and not the respondent, based on the evidence heard.\n[325] The Tribunal must however admit that it questioned, based on the facts of this case, whether or not Mr. Lavers (or the selection board) did retaliate, albeit indirectly or unintentionally, by the decision that was made to reject the complainant\u2019s application, by adopting an attitude that I characterized as severe earlier in the first part of this decision.\n[326] The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the complaints made under Part III by the complainant does not allow me to go any further in the interpretation of this provision of section 14.1 of the Act. In that regard, the Tribunal cites the following passages from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Mowat, Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471 (Mowat):\n[33] The question is one of statutory interpretation and the object is to seek the intent of Parliament by reading the words of the provision in their entire context and according to their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, quoted in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). In approaching this task in relation to human rights legislation, one must be mindful that it expresses fundamental values and pursues fundamental goals. It must therefore be interpreted liberally and purposively so that the rights enunciated are given their full recognition and effect: see, e.g., R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 497-500. However, what is required is nonetheless an interpretation of the text of the statute which respects the words chosen by Parliament. (Emphasis added)\n. . .\n[62] As we noted earlier, the CHRA has been described as quasi-constitutional and deserves a broad, liberal, and purposive interpretation befitting of this special status. However, a liberal and purposive interpretation cannot supplant a textual and contextual analysis simply in order to give effect to a policy decision different from the one made by Parliament: Bell Canada v. Bell Aliant Regional Communications, 2009 SCC 40, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 764, at paras. 49-50, per Abella J.; Gould, at para. 50, per La Forest J., concurring. (Emphasis added.)\n[327] Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the respondent is not the person \u201cagainst whom a complaint has been made\u201d pursuant to the provisions of section 14.1 of the Act and the complainant\u2019s complaint against the respondent in this regard cannot be upheld.\nb) or any other person acting on their behalf\n[328] Initially, the complaint filed by the complainant is addressed directly to the respondent, that is, Transport Canada, and to no other agency\/department of the Crown. Also, the appellant did not consider in a broader sense including the Attorney General of Canada either as a respondent or as a third party and no motion to amend was filed with the Tribunal to add the Attorney General of Canada either as a respondent or as a third party.\n[329] As a result, the Tribunal is bound to hear the complainant\u2019s complaint as formulated, and in response to the first question mentioned with respect to section 14.1 of the Act, namely, who is the \u201cperson against whom a complaint has been filed\u201d, the answer is Transport Canada and no other person.\n[330] In its arguments, the respondent argues that Transport Canada\u2019s employer was the Treasury Board and that the CRA\u2019s employer was the CRA and that the CBSA\u2019s employer was the CBSA, as set out in the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in section 2 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)\n[331] Thus, section 4(2) of the PSEA that establishes the CRA, that is, the Canada Revenue Agency Act, S.C. 1999, c. 17, establishes that:\n4. (1) The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is continued as a body corporate under the name of the Canada Revenue Agency.\n(2) The Agency is for all purposes an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.\n. . .\n[332] Also, section 3 of the Act establishing the CBSA, that is, the Canada Border Services Agency Act, S.C. 2005, c. 38, states the following:\n3. (1) The Canada Border Services Agency is established as a body corporate.\n(2) The Agency is for all purposes an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada.\n[333] Thus, prior to his complaint against Transport Canada, the complainant filed complaints against the CRA and the CBSA, pursuant to section 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C.1985, c. C-50 [CLPA], as agents of \u201cHer Majesty in right of Canada\u201d and not against the Attorney General of Canada.\n[334] Also, it is useful to set out the provisions of section 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C.1985, c. C-50 (hereinafter the CLPA),which reads as follows:\n23. (1) Proceedings against the Crown may be taken in the name of the Attorney General of Canada or, in the case of an agency of the Crown against which proceedings are by an Act of Parliament authorized to be taken in the name of the agency, in the name of that agency. (Emphasis added.)\n[335] Also, in Carter v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2014 CHRT 3, the Tribunal interpreted as follows the provisions of section 23(1) CLPA:\n[87] Section 23(1), CLPA deals with proceedings, and provide the mechanism for proceeding against the Crown. Such proceedings may be taken in the name of the Attorney General of Canada, unless there is an Act of Parliament which authorizes the Crown entity to be named in proceedings. (Emphasis added.)\n[88] Therefore, to obtain a remedy against the federal departments who are of the Crown, which in turn is Her Majesty in right of Canada, in accordance with section 66(1) of the Human Right Act, one names the Attorney General of Canada as respondent, in accordance with section 23(1) of the CLPA.\n[336] In a complementary manner, the Tribunal also refers to the aforementioned paragraphs 33 and 62 of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471 (Mowat) (see paragraph 323 of this decision).\n[337] Accordingly, the analysis of that case law and the provisions of section 23(1) of the CLPA indicate to me that one cannot substitute the CRA and the CBSA for Transport Canada and that the converse is equally true, that is, that Transport Canada cannot be substituted for the CRA and the CBSA for actions they did not commit unless an appropriate entity or third party is named to add the CRA or the CBSA directly in these proceedings, which was not done here.\n[338] A fortiori, the evidence in the record did not indicate to me that there was either a relationship of subordination, or an agency relationship, between the CRA or the CBSA and Transport Canada, with respect to the facts of this case, particularly regarding the allegation of retaliation the complainant made in his complaint.\n[339] Although contact occurred among the members of Transport Canada\u2019s selection board for purposes of the various applications, the evidence did not show direct communication between the representatives of the CRA or the CBSA and the selection board so as to establish an agency relationship between these parties, and establish that Transport Canada could have acted on behalf of the CRA or the CBSA in the alleged retaliation.\n[340] Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find that the evidence indicates that either agency, that is, the CRA or the CBSA, could have influenced the respondent Transport Canada in not hiring the complainant (Smith v. Canadian National Railway, 2005 CHRT 23).\n[341] In conclusion, I therefore infer that, based on this part of section 14.1 of the Act, Transport Canada did not act on behalf of other entities or departments, that is, the CRA or the CBSA.\nIV. Conclusion [342] For the reasons I expressed earlier, the Tribunal finds that:\n(a) The complainant\u2019s complaint with respect to the first marine security analyst (PM-04) application is upheld under the provisions of section 7(a) of the CHRA;\n(b) All the complainant\u2019s complaints are dismissed with respect to the TI-06 positions;\n(c) All the complainant\u2019s complaints under the provisions of section 14.1 of the Act are also dismissed.\n[343] Given the desire of the parties to first obtain a decision from the Tribunal as to the merits of the complaints made by complainant, I will thus refrain from making any other findings at this stage. I therefore retain jurisdiction concerning the issue of applicable remedies and await to hear from the parties about their intention in that regard.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 9, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1656\/01111\nStyle of Cause: Chris Hughes v.

Context [1] The Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (the Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN) have filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amount to discrimination on the basis of race and national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c H-6 (the Act).\n[2] On July 10, 2012, a Panel composed of Members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer, was appointed to hear this case (2012 CHRT 16).\nII. Relevant Facts [3] On September 26, 2012, the Tribunal held an in-person case management conference (CMC) to canvass parties\u2019 availabilities to schedule dates for the hearing on the merits. In agreement with the parties, the Tribunal set hearing dates for the week of February 25 to March 1, 2013, and set the remaining hearing dates starting in April 2013. The Tribunal also set, with the parties\u2019 consent, a timeline for ongoing filing of disclosure materials, including revised witness lists. The Respondent was to file three sets of disclosure on the following dates: October 31, 2012; December 28, 2012; and February 25, 2013 for its third and final set of disclosure.\n[4] On February 19, 2013, the Tribunal held a case management conference call (CMCC) with the parties to discuss a number of outstanding matters prior to the beginning of the hearing. The Commission stated that regarding the filing of exhibits, it was their understanding that there would be no requirement to authenticate documents but that parties could decide to bring objections regarding their relevancy. The Commission expressed that its intent was to file a Book of Documents with the Tribunal and that each of the tabs would be addressed separately as the hearing progressed. Tabs that were not filed or found inadmissible would be removed at the end of the hearing. The Respondent agreed to this proposal.\n[5] On February 20, 2013, the Tribunal provided parties with a summary of the CMCC. Paragraph i) of the summary pertained to the filing of exhibits. It read:\nEach binder submitted by the parties will be filed as exhibits and marked accordingly (C for Complainant, HR for the CHRC, R for Respondent, CO for Chiefs of Ontario). Tabs that are not referred to or objected and ruled on during the hearing will be removed from the binder and not form part of the official record.\n[6] The hearing began on February 25, 2013. The Tribunal heard the testimony of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of Caring Society, from February 25 to March 1, 2013. On February 26, 2013, the Respondent raised several objections during Dr. Blackstock\u2019s examination in chief. The Respondent expressed concerns that, throughout her testimony so far, Dr. Blackstock had tendered out of court statements for the truth of their contents. The Respondent submitted that these statements constituted hearsay evidence and were inadmissible.\n[7] Having heard the parties submissions on the objection, the Panel rendered the following ruling orally:\nThe panel understands and acknowledges the question and concerns raised by the respondent regarding evidence being tendered in absence of supporting documents and sworn testimony. However, this issue must be balanced with the tribunal proceeding in an orderly and expeditious fashion and in accordance with this tribunal\u2019s general practice to receive hearsay evidence subject to giving it the appropriate weight.\nGiven the fact that in the instance objected to, we have not seen the letters, it will be given limited amount of weight. This is how we intend to proceed in the future with evidence of this nature.\n[8] The testimony of Dr. Blackstock, was followed by another five days of hearing, April 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9, 2013, during which the Tribunal heard the testimonies of Mr. Jonathan Thompson, Director of Health and Social Development of the AFN, Dr. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9, Director of the Centre for Research on Children and Families at McGill University and Mr. Derald Dubois, Executive Director of the Touchwood Child and Family Services in Saskatchewan.\n[9] On May 7, 2013, the Respondent advised parties and the Tribunal that it had just received notice from its client that over fifty thousand additional documents had been identified as potentially relevant as well as an unspecified number of email documents, which the client was in the process of gathering, and remained to be disclosed. Shortly thereafter, the Respondent filed a motion seeking an adjournment of the hearing dates until November 2013, so that it could complete its disclosure obligations.\n[10] The Caring Society opposed the Respondent\u2019s motion and on May 21, 2013, filed its own motion to, notably, compel the Respondent to produce the documents relevant to the complaint. The Caring Society took the position that the impact of the Respondent\u2019s late disclosure remained speculative and did not justify the adjournment of nine weeks of hearings. Any fairness concerns arising as a result of witnesses testifying prior to full disclosure could be remedied by allowing the recalling of witnesses. The Caring Society argued that, when weighed against the concrete prejudice to the Complainants caused by further delays, these speculative future breaches of fairness did not warrant the adjournment sought by the Respondent.\n[11] Mindful of its duty to provide parties with a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations, and also seeking to balance this duty with that of proceeding in an expeditious manner, the Tribunal opted for a middle ground solution, vacating the hearing dates originally scheduled in June of 2013 and setting aside additional hearing dates starting in July until January 2014 (2013 CHRT 16). The Tribunal specified that parties would have the right to recall witnesses, if needed and with the Tribunal\u2019s approval, determined on a case-by-case basis.\n[12] On November 20, 2013, the Caring Society requested the issuance of a subpoena to recall Dr. Blackstock as a witness. The Tribunal issued the subpoena on November 25, 2013.\n[13] On December 9, 2013, the Commission recalled Dr. Cindy Blackstock to the stand. At the beginning of her testimony, Dr. Blackstock noted that the last time she had testified before the Tribunal, in February 2013, she had only benefited from approximately 8% of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. Counsel for the Commission specified that over one hundred thousand documents were disclosed by the Respondent following Dr. Blackstock\u2019s initial testimony.\n[14] The Commission proceeded to lead Dr. Blackstock to the Commission\u2019s Book of Documents, HR-13, Tab 275. Dr. Blackstock testified that she had become aware of the document, a service agreement between the province of British Columbia and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) entitled \u201cService Agreement Regarding the Funding of Child Protection Services of First Nations Children Ordinarily Resident on Reserve\u201d through the Respondent\u2019s disclosure.\n[15] The Respondent filed an objection, stating for the record that while the witness could identify the document as one that she had received through the disclosure, it was their view that the document could not be admitted into evidence simply on this basis. The Respondent expressed that Dr. Blackstock was neither the author nor the recipient of the document and as such, the document could not be admitted in the manner proposed by the Commission. Furthermore, the Respondent stated that Dr. Blackstock lacked sufficient knowledge to provide commentary on the document and that her testimony would merely constitute opinion evidence. The Respondent noted that it anticipated that this would be a common theme with the other documents that the Commission wished to put to Dr. Blackstock.\n[16] The Respondent added that the Commission had decided not to call a witness from the province of British Columbia, a witness which could have been in a better position to comment on the service agreement between this province and INAC. In the Respondent\u2019s view, recalling Dr. Blackstock now so that she could speak to this document constituted an unfair and improper use of the right to recall a witness. A witness should not be recalled to enable the Commission and the Complainants to polish or fill a gap in their case.\n[17] The Commission replied that in its view, the document was admissible as it formed part of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. The Commission clarified that the purpose of recalling Dr. Blackstock was to enable her to provide her opinion on the significance of some of the newly disclosed documents, on the basis of her professional experience and involvement in this case, as well as to allow her to explain the manner in which these documents impacted her previous testimony. The Commission noted that it had no intention of revisiting documents that were disclosed prior to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s initial testimony.\n[18] The Caring Society supported the Commission\u2019s view, noting that the purpose of the recall was, in the interest of fairness, to place the witness in the same position she would have been in had the Respondent completed its disclosure prior to the start of the hearing. Nevertheless, the Caring Society stated that in its view, since the majority of the documents that were disclosed are government records, they are prima facie admissible.\n[19] The Tribunal briefly adjourned the proceedings to consider the objection. The Tribunal advised the parties that, in light of the Commission\u2019s intention to put a number of other newly-disclosed documents to Dr. Blackstock in a similar manner, the Tribunal felt that it would be best to decide the issue of document admissibility now, rather than wait until the end of the hearing as had been initially agreed upon by the parties.\n[20] The Caring Society advised the Tribunal that it would therefore file a motion regarding document admissibility with the Tribunal the following day, or soon thereafter. The Caring Society provided the Tribunal and parties with a Notice of Motion, entitled: Motion for an Order Admitting Documents as Evidence for the Truth of their Contents.\nIII. The Caring Society\u2019s Motion [21] It is this motion that is the subject of the present ruling. With this motion, the Caring Society seeks:\n\u201can Order that all documents contained in HR Binders 1 to 13 which were obtained from the Respondent through the Access to Information Act, Privacy Act, or disclosure in these proceedings are hereby admissible as evidence for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not the author or recipient of the document is called as a witness, and whether or not they are put to any other witness\u201d.\n[22] The Caring Society lists the following grounds in support of its motion:\n1. The Canadian Human Rights Commission and the Complainants have obtained a very large volume of documents from the Respondent through disclosure in this proceeding as well as requests pursuant to the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act;\n2. The Canadian Human Rights Commission has introduced many of these documents as exhibits in this proceeding on a preliminary basis, and these documents are contained in HR Binders 1 to 13;\n3. There is no dispute between the parties about the authenticity or relevance of these documents;\n4. All Government documents in the Commission\u2019s binders are admissible for the truth of their contents without the necessity of calling the author or recipient on any or all of the following exceptions to the traditional hearsay rule:\na. The principled exception to the hearsay rule authorizes the admission of government documents for the truth of their contents;\nb. The documents contain declarations made in the course of business duty, and therefore are admissible pursuant to that exception; and\nc. Many of the documents contain statements that are admissions against the interest of the Respondent, and therefore are admissible as admissions;\n5. The Respondent is not prejudiced by having its own documents admitted as evidence, as it still has the right to call witnesses to clarify or rebut the information contained in the documents;\n6. Given the volume, scope and governmental source of the documents, the interests of justice will be served by admitting the documents as evidence without the necessity of calling government officials to identify them as it would be highly impractical, costly, and would significantly delay the proceedings to require the Commission or the complainants to call witnesses for every document in question;\n7. While the Complainant\u2019s position is that the documents are admissible in a Court of law in accordance with the previously noted exceptions to the hearsay rule, the Tribunal has the authority to accept documents as evidence whether or not they may be admissible in a Court; and\n8. Rules 1(1), 3, 9(4), of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure and section 50(3)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[23] In a CMC in the afternoon of December 9, 2013, the parties agreed to argue the Motion on December 10, 2013. The parties also agreed to argue the question of the parameters of the recall of witnesses, as raised by the Respondent.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Submissions A. The Caring Society\u2019s Position [24] The Caring Society submits that the rules of evidence are to facilitate truth-seeking, judicial efficiency and fairness in the adversarial process. While there is a presumptive exclusionary rule of hearsay evidence, there are many exceptions to this rule. The exclusionary rule of hearsay is not as strict as it once was.\n[25] The Supreme Court of Canada broadened the exceptions to the hearsay rule in Ares v. Venner, [1970] S.C.R. 608, where the Court found that nurses\u2019 notes could be admitted for the truth of their contents without the necessity of the original makers of the notes being called as witnesses. The Court made a list of factors that should be considered in determining the admissibility of this type of evidence: the material convenience of calling the witnesses, the expense to the litigants of calling these witnesses, the cost to the public in length and time, and the likelihood that the record, made in the course of the witness\u2019 duties, was impartial and trustworthy. Following this decision, a number of evidence acts were amended and some of these exceptions to hearsay became codified.\n[26] R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531 [Khan] and R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915 [Smith] further clarified and simplified the law of hearsay by creating the principled exception to the hearsay rule. Pursuant to this stand alone exception, hearsay evidence became admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence, and its necessity. As such, if the trier of fact is satisfied that the documents are reliable and necessary and the probative value outweighs any prejudicial affect to the opposing party, the documents can be admitted despite hearsay.\n[27] The Caring Society submits that the principled exception to hearsay is applicable in the present case. The Caring Society relies, in this regard, on the \u00c9thier v. Canada (RCMP Commissioner) (C.A.), [1993] 2 F.C. 659 [\u00c9thier], the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), [2005] O.J. No. 5775 [PIPS], and the Ault v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] O.J. No. 4924 [Ault] decisions, which have applied the principled exception to hearsay.\n[28] In PIPS, Panet J. stated the following in regard to the criteria of reliability and necessity:\nAs to the criterion of reliability, it is evident that these documents were prepared by senior or knowledgeable officials within departments or agencies of the federal government. They describe or explain the operation of the Superannuation Plans and these accounts. In many cases, they were for the purpose of conveying information to Ministers and senior government officials or other departments of government. In my view, it is reasonable to expect that a high premium would be placed on their accuracy. There is also the expectation of candor, given the circumstances and the fact that there was no litigation existing at the time. This evidence has the \u201ccircumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness\u201d.\n[\u2026]\nIn the present circumstances, given the range of the documents and the lengthy period over which they were created it may be difficult, or indeed impossible, for the Plaintiffs to locate all of the authors of the documents. In such event, those documents or some of them might never be made available at the trial of these actions. In some cases, even if the author was available, the attendance in court would be needless and a waste of the court\u2019s time where that person\u2019s evidence would be simply to give evidence on a matter that could reasonably be confirmed by hearsay evidence.\nThere is therefore the advantage of efficiency and expediency with respect to the proposed evidence.\nFurther, in all cases, these are Crown documents that were prepared contemporaneously and at times when the Plaintiffs were not present. It would be somewhat unfair to require the Plaintiff to call witnesses to tender in evidence these documents prepared by them, who it may be expected, might be witnesses adverse to the position of the Plaintiffs. It is open to the Defendant to call the authors of the documents or other officials to explain the statements made in these documents.\nPIPS at paras. 70, 73-75\n[29] The Caring Society submits that in the present case, the documents satisfy the principled exception test as detailed in PIPS. As was the case in \u00c9thier and PIPS, the majority of the documents at issue in the present case are government documents, which are inherently reliable and can be admitted for the truth of their contents. In terms of necessity, the documents in the present case originate from all parts of the country and cover a lengthy period of time. In addition, not all of the documents clearly indicate the names of their authors. Combined with the fact that these witnesses would be testifying against their employer and may be hostile, the Caring Society is of the view it would be difficult and onerous to require that the Complainants call them. Furthermore, calling the numerous authors of these documents simply so that they can reiterate what the documents contain would be highly inefficient and risk unnecessarily prolonging these proceedings.\n[30] The Caring Society notes that these documents are the government\u2019s own documents and as such, they are in the best position to provide explanations, clarifications and to rebut this evidence by calling witnesses to do so if needed. In light of the Respondent\u2019s ability to provide this defence, the Caring Society is of the view that the admission of these documents in the manner proposed causes no unfairness or prejudice to the Respondent.\n[31] In addition to the principled exception to the hearsay rule, the Caring Society also relies on the common law exception relating to declarations made in the course of business duty. Pursuant to this exception, declarations of this kind are admissible in evidence: Ault at paras. 24-25. The Caring Society submits that many of the documents at hand contain declarations that have been made by public servants in the course of their duty and which fall under this exception.\n[32] Finally, the Caring Society relies on the common law exception of admissions made against interest: Ault at paras. 27-28. The Caring Society contends that many of the documents at issue in the present case contain admissions on the part of the government to some of the key issues before the Tribunal: namely, that children on reserve do not receive the same services as children off reserve. In light of this, the Caring Society submits that these documents fall under this exception and should be admitted.\n[33] Pursuant section 50(3)(c) of the Act, the Tribunal possesses a wide discretion to admit evidence regardless of whether or not it is admissible in a court of law. The Tribunal is master of its procedure and, provided there is no real unfairness to the Respondent, the Caring Society submits that the documents should be prima facie admissible for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not they were put to a witness. Like any other evidence, they would then be subject to weight. The Caring Society is mindful that, in bringing into evidence a document for the truth of its contents in this manner, it runs the risk that the Respondent bring forward contradictory evidence and that the Tribunal weigh the evidence without the benefit of viva voce testimony supporting the Caring Society\u2019s position. The Caring Society is aware that this approach runs contrary to Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and requests an exception to the Tribunal\u2019s usual procedure in this regard.\n[34] As to the question of the recall of Dr. Blackstock, the Caring Society reiterates its position that she should be placed in the same position that she was in when she was called in February 2013. This means that she should be able to address the documents that were subsequently disclosed and any issues arising as a result. The Caring Society is of the view that this causes no prejudice to the Respondent.\nB. The Commission\u2019s Position [35] The Commission supports the Caring Society\u2019s motion and is also of the view that these documents should be admitted.\n[36] The Commission agrees with the Caring Society\u2019s submission that there is an exception to the hearsay rule for business records. The Commission submits that this exception has received a broad interpretation (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Skomatchuk, 2006 FC 730) and that the newly-disclosed documents in the present case were created in the \u201cusual and ordinary course of business\u201d, as defined pursuant to section 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5, falling under this exception, and should therefore be admitted.\n[37] The Commission submits that admitting a document for the truth of its contents does not signify that it must be afforded absolute weight. Rather, this means that the document does not need to be authenticated by a witness. While this type of evidence may not respect the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d, this is a consideration that can be taken into account by the Tribunal at the weighing stage, once the documents are admitted: Canadian Federation of Students v. Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, 2008 FC 493 at para. 44.\n[38] Moreover, administrative tribunals are not bound by the strict rules of evidence to which courts must adhere. This was recognized by the Federal Court in Telus Communications Inc. v. T.W.U., 2005 FCA 262 [Telus] at paragraph 28, a case cited in this instance by the Respondent. Section 50(3) of the Act provides that the Tribunal can receive evidence in a multiple ways, including by admitting hearsay. The Commission submits that it is in the public interest that these documents be entered in the evidentiary record so that it can be as complete as possible. None of the parties are served if documents relevant to the case are not before the Tribunal.\n[39] The Commission wishes to distinguish the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Jeffers v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 25 [Jeffers], decided by Member Jensen, from the present case. In this decision, Member Jensen refused to admit a report into evidence as proof of the truth of the contents on the basis that it constituted hearsay evidence and did not satisfy the factors of reliability and necessity as per the Khan and Telus decisions. The Commission notes that at the time, Member Jensen did not have the benefit of the jurisprudence cited today by the Caring Society and that the Commission in this case had failed to indicate why it was necessary to introduce this evidence: Jeffers at para. 11. The Commission contends that in the present case, the Complainants have clearly indicated why the admission of the documents at issue meets the test for necessity.\n[40] Turning to the issue of witness recall, the Commission notes that it is not aware of any jurisprudence dealing with witness recall and that the only jurisprudence of relevance pertains to the re-opening of a case. As such, the Commission relies on Varco Canada Limited v. Pason Systems Corp, 2011 FC 467, where the Court establishes five factors to consider in deciding to reopen a trial: relevance, necessity, reliability, due diligence and prejudice. The Commission submits that these factors are applicable to the present case.\n[41] Looking at the issue of relevancy, the Commission contends that, since the documents are part of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, they have already recognized that they are potentially relevant. As such, it is difficult for them to now state that these same documents do not meet the test for relevancy. The Commission submits that the admission of the documents also meets the test for necessity. As this factor encompasses a practical component, the Commission contends that if it were to call a witness for every document, this would result in lengthy and unnecessary delays to the present proceedings. Since these documents emanate from the Respondent, the provinces or from other established sources, the Commission submits that they are inherently reliable. As for the due diligence factor, the Commission has made best efforts to review all of the documents since their disclosure. Finally, the Complainants would be prejudiced if Dr. Blackstock was not able to comment on these documents and indicate how they impact her testimony. These documents were not available to Dr. Blackstock when she first testified, through no fault of the Commission or the Caring Society.\n[42] The Commission also relies on R. v. G. (S.G.), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716 [S.G.G.], a criminal law case dealing with the reopening of evidence. In particular, the Commission notes the Court\u2019s finding that the ability to allow the reopening of a case \u201cbecomes narrower as the trial proceeds because of the increasing likelihood of prejudice to the accused\u2019s defence as the trial progresses\u201d. The Court states, however, that where the Crown has not yet closed its case, the discretion is quite broad: S.G.G. at p. 733. The Commission submits that in the present case the Complainants have not yet closed their case and the Tribunal therefore possesses a wide discretion to allow the recall of a witness so that she can testify to documents she did not previously have in her possession.\n[43] The Commission submits that the purpose of recalling Dr. Blackstock is have her testify to documents that she did not have the benefit of seeing previously, as well as to discuss the impact that these documents may have had on her testimony. As the main complainant in this case, Dr. Blackstock has a breadth of knowledge of the issues along with relevant wide-ranging professional experience. She possesses a unique understanding of the issues and how to interpret these documents and should be afforded the chance to speak to these documents.\n[44] In the Commission\u2019s view, she should be placed in the same position she would have been when she first took the stand. The Commission notes that, at this time, the only parameter to her testimony was that it be relevant to the complaint. This same parameter should apply now. However, if the Tribunal determines that additional parameters must be placed, then the Commission proposes that Dr. Blackstock\u2019s testimony should extend to anything that arises from the newly-disclosed documents and any issues arising from them. This would include subject-matter that she could not previously comment upon because the evidence was not present or insufficient. This would include, for example, evidence regarding the Yukon.\nC. The AFN\u2019s Position [45] The AFN supports the interventions by the Caring Society and the Commission and adopts their position.\n[46] Regarding the issue of witness recall, the AFN agrees with the Commission\u2019s submission that, pursuant to the S.G.G. decision, as the Complainants have not yet closed their case, the Tribunal has a wide discretion to allow re-opening the evidence particularly since it is still possible for the Respondent to respond. There is no prejudice to the Respondent as they may cross-examine Dr. Blackstock and bring forward other witnesses and documents in support of their position, should they desire. The AFN shares the Commission\u2019s view that Dr. Blackstock should testify to the newly-disclosed documents as if she had them in her possession when she first testified.\n[47] The AFN agrees with the Caring Society\u2019s interpretation of the Ault, PIPS and \u00c9thier decisions. At paragraph 22 of the Ault decision, the Court notes that public documents are a common law exception to the hearsay rule and, at paragraph 25, that they are deemed to be reliable. The Court later, citing the PIPS decision, highlights that the criterion of reliability includes consideration for the fact that the documents were prepared by senior officials of the federal government and, as a result, that it is reasonable to place a high premium on their accuracy particularly since there was no existing litigation at the time: Ault at para. 36. The Court also notes at paragraph 50 that since the documents were prepared by the Respondent, it is difficult to identify any prejudicial effect. The AFN submits that this is comparable to the case at bar and that it would be unrealistic to ask the Caring Society and the Commission to call witnesses to speak to every one of these documents to authenticate them. The AFN is in agreement with the position that many of these documents can be taken at face value and that in the end, the absence of authentication will go to weight.\n[48] The AFN concludes by stating that it would like this case to proceed as expeditiously as possible. An entire generation of children has already been impacted by the longevity of this case.\nD. The Respondent\u2019s Position [49] The Respondent notes that when it first raised its objection to Dr. Blackstock\u2019s testimony on December 9, 2013, it was with the belief that in light of time constraints, this objection would form part of their general outstanding objection to documents being admitted for the truth of their contents, an issue that parties had agreed to argue at the end of the proceedings.\n[50] The Respondent states that it does not take issue with the authenticity of the documents that come from the Respondent\u2019s disclosure, nor does it take the view that it is necessary for the Commission and the Caring Society to call all of the originators of the documents as witnesses. The Respondent has no objection to these documents being brought forward for the fact that they were created, that an opinion was expressed, or that, for example, an exchange took place between two public servants. The Respondent submits, however, that this is not the same as accepting these documents \u201cfor the truth of their contents\u201d as requested by the Caring Society. In the Respondent\u2019s view, to admit a document for the truth of its contents, the Tribunal must examine whether the document meets the twin components of reliability and necessity as set out in R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57 [Khelawon]. This modern approach to the hearsay exception is also the approach that was followed in the cases that the Caring Society and the Commission have relied on. The Respondent submits that following this approach supports the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate goal of truth-seeking and supports the Tribunal\u2019s method of admitting documents on a case-by-case basis as it has done until now in these proceedings.\n[51] In conducting this analysis, the Respondent is of the view that when documents are being introduced by a witness who has neither created nor received the document, this creates problems with regard to reliability and could, in this way, impact the admissibility of this evidence for the truth of its contents. This does not, however, prohibit the witness from providing his or her opinion on the evidence.\n[52] The Respondent objects to the Caring Society\u2019s request for a blanket ruling which would have all these documents admitted without having conducted this analysis. Not all of the documents emanate from the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. Without having seen the documents, the Tribunal cannot adequately determine whether they are all government documents and contain other elements, such as admissions, which would support their admission pursuant to exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n[53] The Respondent does not interpret the jurisprudence in the same manner as the Caring Society and the Commission. The Ault and PIPS cases were both actions before the Ontario Superior Court and as such, were decided pursuant to a different structure. In both of these decisions, the Court did not make a blanket ruling on the admissibility of the documents but rather, examined them individually in the context of the case and in light of the exceptions to the rule against hearsay. The Federal Court of Appeal also proceeded in this manner in the \u00c9thier decision. In other words, the Respondent is of the view that these decisions are in conformity with the principles set out in Khelawon and support an approach where documents are admitted on a case-by-case basis.\n[54] The Respondent further objects to the Caring Society\u2019s submission that a document should be admitted, for the truth of its contents, despite the fact that no witnesses had testified to it, contrary to Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. This would put the Respondent in an untenable position of not knowing the case that it needs to meet. If the Complainants do not indicate to the Panel and to the Respondent what parts of the documents they are relying on and on what basis, the Respondent cannot adequately respond and clarify any misinterpretations. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that if the Complainants only do this at the arguments stage, as suggests the Caring Society, this would raise issues of fairness as the Respondent would no longer be in a position to call evidence in its defence.\n[55] As to the issue of recall, the Respondent is of the view that the purpose of recalling witnesses is, out of procedural fairness, to provide a witness with the opportunity to clarify their testimony if they misspoke because they did not possess a certain document at the time. The purpose is not to enable the Complainants to polish their case. Dr. Blackstock\u2019s evidence last February dealt with her experience as a front line social worker and did not touch upon policy. The Commission originally expressed that it would call a witness from the province of British Columbia but did not do so in the end. The Respondent submits that to call Dr. Blackstock to speak to these issues instead is not an appropriate use of the recall.\n[56] The Respondent submits that the Tribunal possesses discretion in allowing the recall of a witness, but that this discretion is not unlimited and it must be exercised with fairness to all parties. Pursuant to the Telus decision, the Tribunal can allow hearsay evidence to be introduced through the testimony of Dr. Blackstock if it believes that this is the only way to admit it. The Respondent notes however, that this would expand the rule of recall.\nV. Point Form Decision [57] Concerned with the practical implications of a decision on the hearing and with the desire to provide the parties with greater certainty in moving forward with this case as quickly as possible, the Tribunal issued a point form decision in the form of a letter on January 6, 2014, with reasons to follow.\n[58] This point form decision reads as follows:\nOn December 9, 2013, the Caring Society filed a Notice of Motion indicating that they intended to file a motion to the Tribunal on December 10, 2013, or soon thereafter. The Notice of Motion is entitled: Motion for an Order Admitting Documents as Evidence for the Truth of their Contents. With this Motion, the Caring Society seeks:\n\u201can Order that all documents contained in HR Binders 1 to 13 which were obtained from the Respondent through the Access to Information Act, Privacy Act, or disclosure in these proceedings are hereby admissible as evidence for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not the author or recipient of the document is called as a witness, and whether or not they are put to any other witness\u201d.\nThe Caring Society made the motion before the Tribunal on December 10, 2013. Parties made submissions on the motion on this date. In seeking the admission of HR Binders 1 to 13, the Caring Society asks the Tribunal to declare Rule 9(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the Rules of Procedure) inapplicable during the present proceedings. Rule 9(4) of the Rules of Procedure reads:\nAdmission of documents from books of documents\n9(4) Except with the consent of the parties, a document in a book of documents does not become evidence until it is introduced at the hearing and accepted by the Panel.\nThe Commission made submissions in support of the Caring Society\u2019s Motion. The Respondent, on the other hand, opposes the Motion. The Respondent has also requested that the Tribunal take this opportunity to define the parameters of witness recall.\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions and the supporting evidence on both the Motion and the question of witness recall. Concerned with the practical implications of a decision on the present motion and with the desire to provide the parties with greater certainty in moving forward with this case as quickly as possible, the Tribunal issues the following decision with reasons to follow:\nConsidering that:\n\u2022 the Tribunal is master of its own procedure;\n\u2022 paragraph 50(3)(c) of the CHRA provides that the Panel may \u201creceive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law\u201d;\n\u2022 the Tribunal is not bound by traditional rules regarding the admissibility of hearsay evidence; and\n\u2022 paragraph 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides that \u201cProceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d;\nThe Tribunal determines the following:\na. Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure will continue to apply. As such, documents will continue to be admitted into evidence, on a case-by case basis, once they are introduced during the hearing and accepted by the Panel;\nb. There will be no need to call witnesses for the sole purpose of authenticating documentary evidence. Any issues raised relating to authentication will be considered by the Panel at the weighing stage;\nc. For the purposes of Rule 9(4), a document has not been fully \u201cintroduced\u201d at the hearing until counsel or a witness for the party tendering it has indicated:\ni. which portions of the document are being relied upon; and\nii. how these portions of the document relate to an issue in the case.\nd. Should a party wish to rely on evidence during its final argument that was not introduced according to the procedure above (either prior to or subsequent to this order), appropriate curative measures may be taken by the Panel, and in particular, the opposing party may be allotted additional time to adequately prepare a response, including calling additional witnesses and bringing forward additional documentary evidence, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness. This may result in an adjournment of the proceedings.\nWith regard to the recalling of witnesses, the Tribunal determines the following:\ne. In the circumstances of this case, the purpose of recalling a witness is to place him or her in the same position they would have been in, had they benefitted from the entirety of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. The witness will therefore be entitled to speak to the newly disclosed documents and to any issues arising as a result.\n[59] The reasons for this decision follow in the analysis below.\nVI. Clarification Decision [60] On January 14, 2014, the Commission recalled Dr. Blackstock. Dr. Blackstock testified that the documents that she intended to discuss in the following days consisted of documents emanating from the Respondent\u2019s disclosure which she did not possess at the time of her initial testimony, documents obtained via the Internet not available at the time of her initial testimony, as well as documents from the ATIA received on April 9, 2013. Dr. Blackstock testified that, unless she indicated otherwise, she was not the author of any of the documents emanating from the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. Counsel for the Commission then proceeded to lead Dr. Blackstock once again to the Commission\u2019s Book of Documents, HR-13, Tab 275.\n[61] The Respondent intervened, asking by way of clarification if, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, the Commission\u2019s intention was to rely on the entirety of the document or simply on the sections mentioned by Dr. Blackstock.\n[62] The Caring Society added to the Respondent\u2019s intervention, stating that they also required clarification regarding the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, particularly with regard to the meaning of the term \u201cportions\u201d found at paragraph c. of the point form decision. The Caring Society expressed that the degree of specificity required by the Tribunal, in terms of leading witnesses to the evidence, remained unclear. It also stated that, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, it would be in a position to provide the Respondent and the Panel with a comprehensive table indicating what portions of the documents they intended to rely on during final argument, prior to the beginning of the Respondent\u2019s case.\n[63] The Tribunal deliberated on the matter and following a brief adjournment, orally issued the following clarification decision:\n1. Portion means \u201ca part\u201d. The use of the term portion in the point form ruling means the part that the witness is testifying about or that Counsel directs the Panel to. For example, Dr. Blackstock testified to several portions of the BC service agreement found at tab 275;\n2. The Panel\u2019s intention is to ensure that the opposing party knows the case to be met in response to the party adducing evidence;\n3. In dispensing of the requirement to authenticate documents through a witness, the Tribunal did not intend to permit the party adducing evidence to rely on evidence during its final argument that wasn\u2019t introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing according to the procedure set out in paragraph c of the point form ruling without giving the opposing party an opportunity to adequately prepare a response, if need be;\n4. If a party intends in argument to rely on portions of documents that were not introduced during the hearing phase in accordance with paragraph c), it runs the risk of the Panel allowing the opposing party additional time to adequately prepare a response.\nThe Tribunal takes note of Mr. Champ\u2019s suggestion that prior to the Respondent commencing its case, he will provide a clear indication of portions of documents not introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing that he intends to rely on in argument.\nThis may help to allow the Respondent to prepare its own evidence during the hearing phase and may avoid the need for the Panel to provide the curative measures set out in paragraph d) of the point form decision.\nVII. Analysis and Decision [64] The parties in this instance provided the Tribunal, on very short notice, with a thorough overview of the law regarding the admissibility of hearsay evidence and it is worth noting their efforts in this regard. Having said this, the majority of the jurisprudence provided emanated from the civil and criminal law contexts which, particularly with respect to the rules of evidence, differ from the human rights context.\n[65] Parties agree, the Tribunal is master of its proceedings and possesses a wide discretion when it comes to determining the admissibility of evidence. This is explicitly stated at paragraph 50(3)(c) of the Act. This paragraph provides that, subject to subsections (4) and (5), the Panel may \u201creceive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law\u201d.\n[66] Pursuant to the contextual approach to statutory interpretation, adopted by the Supreme Court in Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 (S.C.C.), we are to \u201clook at the words in the legislation in light of their grammatical and ordinary sense, as construed in accordance with the scheme of the legislation, the object of the legislation, and the intention of the legislature\u201d. In light of this, it is useful to consider paragraph 50(3)(c) alongside subsections 50(4) and 50(5) of the Act, which read as follows:\nLimitation in relation to evidence\n(4) The member or panel may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence.\nConciliators as witnesses\n(5) A conciliator appointed to settle the complaint is not a competent or compellable witness at the hearing.\n[67] The legislature has, in these provisions, provided explicitly for the limitations to the Tribunal\u2019s ability to admit evidence and to compel witnesses. With the exception of these limitations, paragraph 50(3)(c) allows the Tribunal to \u201creceive and accept any evidence and other information\u201d which is limited only by the Tribunal overarching duty of procedural fairness pursuant to paragraphs 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act and the relevancy of the evidence: Dhanjal v. Air Canada, [1996] C.H.R.D. No. 4 at paras. 21-22; Warman v. Kouba, 2006 CHRT 50 at para. 124 [Warman].\n[68] As a creature of statute, the Tribunal derives its powers solely from its enabling legislation. In the context of the present motion, the jurisprudence has recognized that the wide discretion provided at paragraph 50(3)(c) allows the Tribunal to receive and accept hearsay evidence: Canada (Attorney General) v. Mills (F.C.A.), [1984] F.C.J. No. 917. The parties\u2019 submissions pertaining to the principled approach of reliability and necessity along with the common law exceptions to hearsay are of little help in this regard.\n[69] The Tribunal agrees with the Caring Society and the Commission that it would be onerous and unhelpful to require that they call the authors of the documents for the sole purpose of authenticating them. The parties agreed that this would not be a necessary step at the February 19, 2013, CMCC prior to the beginning of this hearing. The Tribunal\u2019s practice in this case so far has been to admit relevant documents, regardless of hearsay, on a case-by-case basis as the parties introduce them into evidence, and to consider any issues regarding their reliability at the weighing stage. This enables the Tribunal to clearly identify the record which will form the basis for its final decision. The Tribunal informed the parties that this is the approach that it would follow in its oral ruling of February 26, 2013. This approach is also supported by the jurisprudence: Canada (Attorney General) v. Brooks, 2006 FC 1244 at paras. 36 \u2013 38; Warman, supra, at para. 124. Contrary to the submissions of the Complainants and the Commission, the Tribunal is not of the view that the decisions in Ault, PIPS and \u00c9thier support the admission of documents in a blanket manner. The Tribunal sees no reason to now depart from its practice and admit at once \u201call documents contained in HR Binders 1 to 13 which were obtained from the Respondent through the Access to Information Act, Privacy Act, or disclosure in these proceedings\u201d, as requested in the Caring Society\u2019s motion.\n[70] The motion goes even further and as such, has highlighted the importance for the Tribunal to take this opportunity to further clarify its rules of procedure regarding the introduction of evidence. In its motion, in addition to seeking a blanket admission of the documents, the Caring Society requests that the documents be \u201cadmissible as evidence for the truth of their contents, regardless of whether or not they are put to a witness\u201d. It seeks, in this regard, an exception to the Rule 9(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 9(4), the Tribunal\u2019s usual practice at the end of a hearing is to remove from the Books of Documents any document which parties have not referred to during the proceedings. The Commission confirmed its understanding of this rule and its applicability in the February 19, 2013, CMCC and the Tribunal informed all parties of this procedure in the summary of this CMCC.\n[71] If the Tribunal were to allow this request, this would mean that documents which were never discussed by a witness during the hearing would be admitted into evidence and form part of the record. The Caring Society does not state that it would instead refer to these documents in final argument, although Counsel for the Caring Society expressed in oral argument that it was their intention to do so as much as possible. The result is that documents, never discussed at any point during the hearing, could conceivably form part of the evidence on which the Tribunal is to rely to render its final decision.\n[72] This request raises a number of issues. The Complainants have already tendered several hundred documents and recently reiterated their wish to reserve their right to introduce an unknown amount of additional documents as they complete their review of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. Allowing this request would put the Tribunal in the position of having to examine and even interpret potentially lengthy and even technical documents without the benefit of any viva voce evidence or oral argument. While the Tribunal recognizes that the amount of evidence introduced is significantly less than the hundred thousand plus documents that formed part of the disclosure that the parties had to review, this does not discharge the Complainants of the onus of making their case.\n[73] Moreover, to proceed in this manner also raises a serious issue of fairness for the Respondent. In both the point form decision and the clarification decision, the Tribunal expressed the necessity for a party to know the case that it needs to meet. In admitting documents without requiring that the Complainants specify their relevance to the case and the manner in which they support their position, the Tribunal may place the Respondent in a position where it is unable to adequately respond or rebut this evidence.\n[74] In light of this, as stated in the Tribunal\u2019s point form decision, the Tribunal denies the request for an exception to Rule 9(4) and will, at the end of the hearing, proceed with the removal of documents that have not been properly introduced and accepted by the Tribunal, which would have thereby completed their admission into evidence. The Tribunal clarified the necessary steps to follow to ensure the introduction of documents at paragraph c. of its point form decision. In doing so, the Tribunal has relaxed the application of Rule 9(4). This paragraph reads as follows:\nc. For the purposes of Rule 9(4), a document has not been fully \u201cintroduced\u201d at the hearing until counsel or a witness for the party tendering it has indicated:\ni. which portions of the document are being relied upon; and\nii. how these portions of the document relate to an issue in the case.\n[Emphasis ours]\n[75] The witnesses who have previously given evidence, to the extent that they testified with respect to portions of documents tendered in evidence and to their relevance to the issues in this case, have done so in a manner consistent with this paragraph of the Panel\u2019s point form ruling. The documents that will be removed at the end of the hearing will be all documents where no portion has been referred to by a witness in testimony or by Counsel during oral argument. In rendering its final decision, the Tribunal will be relying on the portions of documents tendered that have been referred to in this manner.\n[76] Counsel for the Commission and the Caring Society have indicated that it is their intention to lead the Panel in their closing submissions to portions of the documents tendered into evidence in this case that they feel are relevant to the proceedings. To the extent that they do so in respect to portions of documents not testified to by witnesses, this is a departure from normal practice and the Tribunal\u2019s usual procedure with regard to leading evidence. While, in light of its flexible Rules of Procedure, the Tribunal has allowed this request, this departure from usual practice requires that the Tribunal ensure the observance of natural justice principles.\n[77] .Parties are free to decide their strategy to present their case, however fairness dictates that parties must also know the case they have to meet and can adequately prepare a response. If the Complainants or any other party wishes to introduce during its final argument evidence which was not introduced during the evidence phase of the hearing, the Tribunal provided for a curative provision that may be invoked to remedy any unfairness caused to the opposing party. This is found at paragraph d. of the point form ruling which reads:\nd. Should a party wish to rely on evidence during its final argument that was not introduced according to the procedure above (either prior to or subsequent to this order), appropriate curative measures may be taken by the Panel, and in particular, the opposing party may be allotted additional time to adequately prepare a response, including calling additional witnesses and bringing forward additional documentary evidence, in accordance with the principles of procedural fairness. This may result in an adjournment of the proceedings.\n[78] The Complainants and the Commission have not yet closed their case and may still decide to call additional witnesses. The Complainants and for the Commission have also communicated their intent to provide the Tribunal and the Respondent with a chart in which they will detail the portions of the documents on which they will rely during final argument. They have indicated that they would provide this chart in advance of the beginning of the Respondent\u2019s case so as to allow the Respondent to adequately respond. In as much as the Respondent will receive this chart in advance of the beginning of the presentation of its case it may be helpful to the Respondent in presenting its case and avoid the need to invoke the curative provisions of paragraph d. of the point form ruling. This, of course, will depend on what the chart actually includes in describing the portions of relied on and the time that the Respondent will have to review the document in advance of having to present its case.\n[79] Finally, regarding the purpose of the recall of Dr. Blackstock, as stated in the point form decision, the Tribunal agrees with the Caring Society and the Commission that it is to place the witness in the same position that she would have been in, had she benefited from the entirety of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure. This is to remedy to any prejudice caused to the Complainants and the Commission as a result of the Respondent\u2019s late disclosure. Dr. Blackstock, and any other witnesses the Complainants wish to recall, will be entitled to speak to any documents disclosed after their initial testimony and to any issues arising as a result.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Complaints. 1\nII........... Request that Tribunal proceedings be adjourned. 1\nIII......... Law and Analysis. 2\nIV......... Ruling. 4\nI. Complaints [1] The Complainants allege that the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the basis of age, sex and\/or family status, contrary to s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \"CHRA\").\n[2] Specifically, two of the Complainants (Ms. Nacey and Mr. Rainville) allege that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice in its application of s. 6(1)(c.1) of the Indian Act requiring them or a sibling to have been born or adopted on or after September 4, 1951, in order for the Complainants to be eligible for registration under 6(2) of the Indian Act.\n[3] The third Complainant (Ms. Dennis) alleges that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice by applying legislation that provides better treatment for male children born to Indian fathers outside marriage before April 17, 1985, than it does for female children in otherwise identical circumstances.\n[4] On May 15 and June 5, 2014, pursuant to section 49 of the CHRA, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the complaints and requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) to institute inquiries in the matters. The Complainants\u2019 files are not joined for the purposes of a single hearing. However, given that the Commission made the same request in each of the 3 complaints and given the similarities of the subject matter of the complaints, the Commission\u2019s request will be dealt with in a single ruling.\nII. Request that Tribunal proceedings be adjourned [5] On June 16 and June 23, 2014, the Commission proposed that these complaints be adjourned pending the Federal Court\u2019s judicial review of the Tribunal decisions in Matson\/Andrews relating to similar complaints with respect to the Respondent\u2019s application of the registration provisions of the Indian Act.\n[6] In the Matson (2013 CHRT 13) and Andrews (2013 CHRT 21) decisions, the Tribunal dismissed the complaints, finding that the Complainants were challenging the registration provisions of the Indian Act, as opposed to any \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, offered by the Respondent. Applying the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7, the Tribunal found that attacks aimed at legislation, and nothing else, fall outside the scope of the CHRA.\n[7] All parties consent to adjourn these proceedings.\nIII. Law and Analysis [8] It is well established that this Tribunal is the master of its own procedure, and that it possesses significant discretion to adjourn its proceedings (See Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14).\n[9] That being said, the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice, as well as the regime of the CHRA. The CHRA requires the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into complaints when requested by the Commission and to give parties a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations (see ss. 49(2) and 50(1) of the CHRA). Section 2 of the CHRA also expresses an overriding public interest in the elimination of discriminatory practices. And, of particular significance, s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides for proceedings before the Tribunal to be conducted as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian Railways (1999) C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15).\n[10] The complaints here resemble those that were at issue in the Matson and Andrews cases, insofar as they allege the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice when it applied the registration provisions of the Indian Act. If the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning from the Matson and Andrews decisions were to be applied to the complaints here, the result would presumably be the same: the complaints would be dismissed. As mentioned above, the Tribunal dismissed those complaints because it found they were challenging the registration provisions of the Indian Act, as opposed to any \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, offered by the Respondent. The Tribunal found that attacks aimed at legislation, and nothing else, fall outside the scope of the CHRA.\n[11] In the present cases, the Commission argues the CHRA allows for complaints that directly challenge a government department\u2019s application of mandatory legislation. The Respondent contends that type of complaint falls outside the jurisdiction of CHRA. The Tribunal provided its views on the issue in Matson and Andrews. The issue has now been brought to the Federal Court on judicial review. Therefore, given the fact that the same question is currently before the Federal Court, hearing the complaints at this time would not provide a full answer to the issues they raise. Rather, in my view, in terms of efficiency and fairness, the parties and the Tribunal would benefit from further clarification of these issues by the Federal Court.\n[12] The Tribunal has already taken this approach with another set of complaints that raise similar allegations regarding Veterans Affairs Canada\u2019s application of the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re\u00adestablishment and Compensation Act (Tribunal Files T1898\/12812 to T1901\/13112). On consent of all parties, those complaints have been adjourned pending the resolution of the Matson judicial review.\n[13] Similar to the cases cited above, the Complainants in the present matters have provided their consent to an adjournment.\n[14] In addition, the Tribunal has recently adjourned another group of complaints in Renaud, Sutton and Morigeau v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, which sought, as in the present cases, to challenge the registration provisions of the Indian Act. The Tribunal, at Para. 23, stated the following, that I find applicable in the present matters:\nI recognize that every case has its own particularities since we are dealing with unique individuals and with different facts and issues. I also recognize the significant role that elders play in our society and the importance of their right to be heard in exercising this role. I also carefully considered the impacts on the Complainants in adjourning their cases. However, I find those considerations are outweighed by the potential additional delays and complexities that would be created if the Tribunal were to proceed with these complaints without further clarification from the Federal Court. (para. 23)\n[15] Having considered the various interests and needs of the parties and the Tribunal, I grant the Commission\u2019s request to adjourn these proceedings.\nIV. Ruling [16] For the reasons above, Tribunal files T2020\/2114, T2021\/2214 and T2023\/2414 are adjourned sine die with the following conditions:\n(1) The Commission shall keep the Tribunal apprised of the status of judicial review applications\/appeals in the Matson\/Andrews matters, including any Reasons for Judgment;\n(2) The issue of any further adjournment\/abeyance can be revisited and dealt with after the Federal Court decision in the Matson\/Andrews judicial review application is rendered.\n(3) Any party or the Tribunal may request the holding of a Case Management Conference Call after the release of Reasons for Judgment in any of the judicial reviews\/appeals referred to in clause (1) in order to re-assess the adjournment\/abeyance status herein.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 23, 2014\n",

Complaint & Motion to Dismiss [1] The Complainant alleges the Respondent has engaged in discriminatory practices, on the grounds of sex and marital status, pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. She also claims the Respondent has retaliated against her for having filed her first complaint, pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act.\n[2] Prior to the hearing of this matter, the Respondent brings a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of the former section 67 of the Act, which provided as follows:\nNothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\n[3] Although section 67 was repealed by An Act to Amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 2008, c. 30, the provision was still in force when the complaint was filed on May 21, 2008.\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is the subject of the present ruling.\nII. Ruling [5] At the Complainant and Commission\u2019s request, and in order to avoid unnecessary costs to the parties, I have carefully reviewed the submissions of the parties and supporting case law in an attempt to rule on this motion prior to the hearing. However, at this time, I find I do not have sufficient information to make a determination on the application of section 67 to the allegations in this case.\n[6] While the Tribunal has the power to consider motions to dismiss complaints brought in advance of a full hearing on the merits, and dismiss the complaint if appropriate, that power needs to be exercised cautiously and only in the clearest of cases (see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445, at para. 140). That is because the Tribunal must be fair to each party and, as stated in section 50(1) of the Act, provide each of the parties a full and ample opportunity to appear before the Tribunal, present evidence and make representations.\n[7] In my view, in order to properly make a determination on the connection between the impugned decisions and actions alleged in the complaint and the provisions of the Indian Act requiring or permitting those impugned decisions or actions, I will need to hear evidence and make findings of fact. I believe this is best achieved by proceeding with a full hearing of the merits of the complaint.\n[8] Proceeding to a hearing and determining the section 67 motion afterwards is the same approach the Tribunal took in Malec v. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2009 CHRT 9. Moreover, I am unaware of a decision by the Tribunal where section 67 was applied to dismiss a complaint prior to a hearing on the merits.\n[9] Therefore, pursuant to Rule 3(2)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), I will wait to make a decision on the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss until after the hearing.\n[10] As part of the hearing, the parties can bring evidence in support of the motion. The parties can then provide arguments on the motion as part of their final arguments. I would then render a decision on the motion as part of the final decision in this matter.\n[11] Prior to tomorrow\u2019s case management conference call, the parties are asked to seek instructions from their clients on any issues that may arise from this ruling in terms of moving forward with the hearing.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 23, 2014\n",

Decision. 22\nI. Complaint & Motions for Disclosure [1] The Complainant is a Muslim Canadian of African descent and describes himself as having brown skin colour. Pursuant to section 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), he alleges he was treated in an adverse differential manner in the provision of a service offered by the Respondent. In summary, he claims the Respondent air carrier subjected him to enhanced security screening, because of his race, national or ethnic origin, colour and religion, on six different occasions from March to June 2010. The Respondent maintains it has not discriminated against the Complainant and that it was simply following American as well as Canadian aviation security requirements, including each country\u2019s \u201cNo-Fly Lists\u201d, in its interactions with the Complainant.\n[2] In preparing for the hearing of this case, each party brought a motion for the disclosure of information. These motions are the subject of the present ruling.\nII. Principles of Disclosure [3] Pursuant to section 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, it should be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42 [Guay]; Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 28; and, Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18, at para. 6).\n[4] However, the request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \"fishing expedition\". The documents requested should be identified with reasonable particularity. That is, the request should not subject a party or a stranger to the litigation to an onerous and far-ranging search for the documents (see Guay, at para. 43).\n[5] It should also be noted that the disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that this information will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process (see Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28, at para. 4).\nIII. Respondent\u2019s Motion for Disclosure [6] The Respondent seeks the disclosure of the Complainant\u2019s medical records and human resources file, along with his income tax returns and notices of assessment. From the Commission, it also seeks the disclosure of information pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s complaint against the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA).\nA. Medical records [7] The Respondent\u2019s request for medical records is as follows:\na) that the Complainant produce a list of the health care professionals, including physicians, psychologists, social workers or counsellors he has attended for reason of symptoms or treatment for anxiety, depression, insomnia or any other health conditions, from January 2006 to date; and,\nb) that the Complainant produce to the parties any medical documentation in his possession from the following individuals\/organizations and that the Complainant provide an authorization that the Respondent may obtain the complete files from the following individuals\/organizations from January 2006 to date regarding treatments received by the Complainant or obtain such documentation himself:\n(i) North End Community Health Centre;\n(ii) Mr. Glen Campbell;\n(iii) Mr. Gerald Hann;\n(iv) Ms. Rose; and,\n(v) Dr. Woods.\n[8] The Respondent states that as a result of the alleged discriminatory practice, the Complainant claims to have suffered damages, including personal injuries such as depression, anxiety, insomnia and diminished self-esteem, for which he seeks compensation for pain and suffering. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Complainant has directly called into issue his medical history prior to and subsequent to the alleged incidents. As such, the Respondent submits that the medical documentation requested is necessary in order for it to appropriately defend against the allegations raised by the Complainant.\n[9] Also, the Respondent states it has made repeated requests to the Complainant regarding his medical records; however, the Complainant has provided limited medical documentation thus far, which mainly comprise of reporting letters wherein it appears medical professionals have been specifically asked to comment only on issues requested by the Complainant. According to the Respondent, none of the records produced include consultation notes, clinical notes and records, or a summary of the examinations conducted in light of the Complainant\u2019s alleged injuries.\n[10] The Complainant believes the request for his medical information is too broad, goes beyond the scope of the case and infringes on his privacy. He claims to have already submitted documents that are linked directly to how his allegations have affected him. The Complainant contends he did not create those documents, but rather they are testimonies of medical and health practitioners.\n[11] The Commission echoes the Complainant\u2019s submissions. According to the Commission, the Complainant does not allege that the actions in question exacerbated an existing condition that predated the alleged incidents; but that the alleged actions caused him distress, anxiety, stress, lack of sleep and chronic apprehension at the airport. Accordingly, the Commission states the Complainant\u2019s entire medical file dating back to 2006, as well as the files of the 6 (six) named individuals, far exceed what is relevant to the facts and issues in this case. In the Commission\u2019s view, should the Tribunal grant the Respondent\u2019s request for medical records, it should be limited to the pain and suffering alleged and should not pre-date the period of time at issue.\n[12] The Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to his or her medical records (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 CanLII 61851 (CHRT), at para. 7 [Beaudry]; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (CHRT), at para. 3 [McAvinn]). However, that right to privacy and confidentiality may cease when that person puts his or her health in issue (see McAvinn, at para. 4; Guay, at para. 45; Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 9, at paras. 9-11; see also Frenette v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., [1992] 1 SCR 647; and M. (A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 SCR 157 [M. (A.)]). That said, \u201cthe need to get at the truth and avoid injustice does not automatically negate the possibility of protection from full disclosure\u201d (M. (A.), at para. 33). In cases where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has usually put conditions on the disclosure to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information, such as restricting who may see and copy them (see for example Guay, at para. 48; McAvinn, at paras. 19-20; Beaudry, at paras. 7 and 9; Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al., 2012 CHRT 11, at para. 19; and Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 37).\n[13] The Complainant has put his health in issue by stating that he sought treatment for depression, anxiety, insomnia and diminished self-esteem as a result of the alleged discrimination. In this regard, he also claims damages for pain and suffering. As a result, I am of the view that the Complainant\u2019s medical records related to treatment for depression, anxiety, insomnia or diminished self-esteem are arguably relevant to this complaint to allow the Respondent to properly respond to the allegations regarding the effects of the alleged discrimination on the Complainant. This also necessitates the Complainant disclosing a list of the health care professionals, including physicians, psychologists, social workers or counsellors he has attended for treatment of depression, anxiety, insomnia or diminished self-esteem.\n[14] The Respondent requests medical records going back to 2006. There is no indication why this specific time period was requested. However, it is reasonable for the Respondent to be able to assess whether any of the symptoms experienced by the Complainant in 2010 and thereafter had any connection to a pre-existing medical condition or to a prior traumatic experience. The period beginning in 2006, however, may be too far-reaching. Therefore, the above mentioned medical records should be disclosed from the period beginning January 2008 to present.\n[15] In order to protect the Complainant\u2019s right to the confidentiality of his medical records, the documents shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondent and Commission only, and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to the Complainant. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry. If the Complainant is of the view that any of these records are personal and not arguably relevant, I will give him the option of sharing such records with me in advance and I will determine whether or not they should be disclosed. If the Complainant avails himself of this opportunity, notice of my review of such records will be given to the other parties.\nB. Human resources file [16] For the human resources file, the Respondent requests:\n(a) that the Complainant produce to the parties or provide an authorization to obtain the complete human resources file from his employer.\n[17] The Respondent\u2019s request for the Complainant\u2019s human resources file is based on the following statements found in the complaint form and the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars:\nI have been affected in my work and among my colleagues as I am often anxious about perceptions and stigma.\nI have used my vacation days from my work to pursue healing. I have taken more than average sick days at my work since this ordeal started...\n[18] The Respondent argues that it can only ascertain the veracity of these allegations if it is afforded the opportunity to review the Complainant\u2019s human resources file. It would then be able compare the vacation dates to the dates on which the Complainant sought treatment and explore whether the Complainant has truly been affected at work.\n[19] The Complainant contends he is willing to ask his Director for a comparison of his sick leave to a general statistical representation of the sick leave of other people with similar jobs in his department, from March 2010. He also suggests that, should the complaint go to hearing, his Director could also be called as a witness.\n[20] The Commission submits that the disclosure of the Complainant\u2019s entire human resources file far exceeds what is relevant to the facts and issues in this case. According to the Commission, the employment issues associated with the Complainant\u2019s claim for the pain and suffering relate to his attendance being adversely impacted. He does not allege that the actions in question exacerbated pre-existing problems at work or that his work performance has suffered. Therefore, in the Commission\u2019s view, the most the Respondent is entitled to are those employment records since the alleged incidents at issue. For comparative purposes, the Commission also adds that the Respondent may also be entitled to some records for the immediate period predating March 2010 when the first alleged incident occurred. However, the Commission submits that any disclosure of employment records should be limited to attendance, as this is the only area the Complainant claims his employment was impacted as a result of the alleged discrimination.\n[21] I am of the view that the Complainant\u2019s human resources file is arguably relevant to his claim of having been affected at work by the alleged discrimination. The Respondent requests the Complainant\u2019s complete human resources file. While the Complainant is not specific about how his work has been affected, he does allege that it has. Therefore, I think it is reasonable for the Complainant to disclose his entire human resources file in order for the Respondent to be able to assess a reasonable period before and after the alleged discriminatory behaviour. The human resources file should be complete and should provide all information for the period of January 2007 to December 2013. It should also include an account of the Complainant\u2019s sick leave for the same period as it is arguably relevant for comparative purposes. Furthermore, given the Complainant\u2019s claim that he used vacation days to pursue healing, I believe it is arguably relevant for the Complainant to disclose the dates on which he has taken vacation since March 2010, that being the period of the first alleged incident.\nC. Income tax returns & notices of assessment [22] As a result of the alleged discrimination, the Complainant states:\nI have cancelled and or missed many opportunities to travel to places for my own benefit and that of my family and therefore suffered serious losses to my well being and those of my family.\n[23] According to the Respondent, the Complainant has not provided particulars regarding what he deems to be missed opportunities or how said opportunities would have been to his or his family\u2019s benefit. Nor has the Complainant indicated whether these missed opportunities have resulted in a financial loss. Therefore, the Respondent seeks:\n(a) that the Complainant produce to the parties his income tax returns and notices of assessment from 2006 to date;\n[24] The Respondent requests the production of these documents in order to ascertain whether the Complainant has suffered any losses of a financial nature as a result of the alleged incidents.\n[25] Both the Complainant and the Commission submit that the income tax records are irrelevant to the issues in this case. The Commission points out that the Complainant\u2019s requested remedial compensation is limited to pain and suffering and wilful and reckless discrimination; there is no request for compensation for lost wages, nor does the Complainant allege that he lost income as a result of the alleged discrimination. Therefore, according to the Commission, the Respondent\u2019s request for income tax returns and notices of assessment should be denied.\n[26] I do not see the arguable relevance of the Complainant\u2019s income tax returns and notices of assessment as this claim does not include a claim for lost wages or income as a result of the alleged discriminatory behaviour. If it did include such claims, then I believe the income tax records would be arguably relevant. As the claim presently does not include such claims, the Respondent\u2019s request for the Complainant\u2019s income tax returns and notices of assessment is denied.\nD. Complaint against CATSA [27] The Respondent claims the disclosure it has received so far included numerous documents that made reference to another complaint made by the Complainant against CATSA. In the documentation it has received, the Respondent says the Complainant has confirmed that the allegations against CATSA occurred between or during the check-in and security processes prior to boarding an aircraft on at least two of the same dates as the incidents alleged in the present complaint. Furthermore, the Respondent contends the disclosure package included a memorandum to file indicating that CATSA had provided particulars or documentation implicating the Respondent in the alleged incidents. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the allegations in both complaints are inextricably linked as they occurred contemporaneously and a significant part of the present complaint is related to secondary screening conducted by CATSA.\n[28] Therefore, the Respondent submits the information contained in the CATSA file would not only shed light on the factual circumstances giving rise to the present complaint, but it would also give the Respondent the opportunity to review and address all implications made against it. The Respondent adds that, given the circumstances of both complaints are similar, it would also like to ascertain whether the Complainant seeks to recover damages from both CATSA and the Respondent for the same alleged injuries. If that is the case, the Respondent submits it cannot be found liable for any damages for which CATSA may be or has already been found liable.\n[29] As a result, the Respondent re quests the following documents from the Commission:\n(a) that the Commission produce the complete file pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s complaint against the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (\u201cCATSA\u201d) for the same travel dates that are the object of this present complaint; or,\n(b) in the alternative, that the Commission provide particulars of the allegations made against CATSA by the Complainant for the same travel dates that are the object of this present complaint and the status of the complaint against CATSA.\n[30] The Respondent asserts it has requested the consent of both the Complainant and CATSA with respect to the production of the CATSA file. According to the Respondent, CATSA has advised that it will consent to the disclosure provided it is given the opportunity to review the documentation to ascertain whether it includes any security-sensitive information and possibly propose measures to protect such information.\n[31] The Commission submits that its file in the complaint against CATSA is not relevant to the present complaint. According to the Commission, the allegations in the present complaint are entirely against the Respondent\u2019s agents. While the Complainant does make several references to CATSA in his materials, the Commission says they are almost entirely with respect to allegations that the Respondent flagged him for secondary screening by CATSA. Moreover, the Commission argues the remedies sought by the Complainant are entirely against and with respect to the actions of the Respondent. The Commission also notes that the complaints against CATSA and the Respondent were treated as separate files, were investigated separately, and that the complaint against CATSA was ultimately dismissed.\n[32] The Commission adds that if the Respondent obtains the consent of CATSA and the Complainant to release the file information, the information will be provided.\n[33] While the Commission objects to the disclosure of the CATSA complaint materials on the basis of relevance, it is still prepared to provide the information under the consent of CATSA and the Complainant. CATSA has consented. Therefore, the only barrier to the disclosure of this information is the Complainant. In his response to the Respondent\u2019s motion, the Complainant did not indicate why he objects to the disclosure of this information. In any event, I am satisfied that it is arguably relevant.\n[34] The security procedures from airport check-in, conducted by the Respondent, to security screening, performed by CATSA, are sequential and there appear to be linkages to the separate procedures. Considering the Respondent\u2019s position in response to this complaint, that it was simply following Canadian and American security regulations in its alleged treatment of the Complainant, I believe it would be arguably relevant to understand CATSA\u2019s viewpoint on the circumstances of this case, including how it perceives the Respondent\u2019s role in the alleged treatment of the Complainant. Given the Respondent\u2019s claim that the allegations in both complaints appear to be similar, I also think the information contained in the CATSA file may be arguably relevant to better understanding the factual circumstances giving rise to the present complaint. Furthermore, as there is suggestion that CATSA has implicated some wrongdoing on the part of the Respondent, it is only fair that the Respondent also be aware of such implications. Therefore, I am of the view that the Commission\u2019s file information on the Complainant\u2019s complaint against CATSA should be disclosed.\nIV. Complainant\u2019s Motion for Disclosure [35] The Complainant requests four types of documents from the Respondent. Two of the requests can be categorized as information regarding training provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees. The Complainant also seeks documents showing the Respondent\u2019s stance on human rights and information on any complaints made against the Respondent that are similar to the present one.\nA. Information regarding training provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees [36] The full wording of the Complainant\u2019s requests under this heading are as follows:\n1. All relevant resources for the development of organization capacity in Diversity and Cultural Competence, including, but not limited to, strategies, training curricula, policies, position statements on Diversity Inclusion and Cultural Competence and any reviews.\n2. All records of training on Cultural Sensitivity, Cultural Competence, attended by the staff and individuals who dealt with me at the airport and the contents of such curriculum.\n[37] Similarly, the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure also requests the following:\nd. Information regarding the training provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees on how to deal with handling complaints from passengers subject to enhanced questioning and\/or enhanced security screening or barred from flying due to alleged security concerns.\ne. Information regarding the training provided to Air Canada employees on human rights and\/or sensitivity training provided by Air Canada to its employees who deal directly or indirectly with security screening of passengers.\n[38] According to the Complainant, an organization\u2019s position and approach to cultural sensitivity has direct implications on the attitudes and behaviour of its staff. The Complainant speaks of an atmosphere of fear of Muslims following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and, therefore, the Complainant believes it is important to know what the Respondent has been doing to ensure its employees are culturally sensitive. If cultural sensitivity training is indeed provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees, the Complainant would also like to know whether the staff involved in the alleged incidents in this case took the training and when.\n[39] For its part, the Commission asks that the Respondent provide all the requested training materials or confirm in writing that no such materials exist. In the Commission\u2019s view, this information is arguably relevant because the allegations, in part, go directly to the Complainant\u2019s interactions with the Respondent\u2019s staff applying additional security measures or answering questions by the Complainant concerning such measures.\n[40] Furthermore, the Commission views the complaint as one raising a number of indicators that systemic matters are likely at issue. First, the Commission asserts the Respondent argues that it was simply applying American as well as Canadian regulatory and statutory requirements in its treatment of the Complainant. Therefore, according to the Commission, the Respondent was operating pursuant to a policy or practice, which it applied to the Complainant, and which likely has systemic implications. In the Commission\u2019s view, this is reinforced by: the repetitive nature of the Complainant being subjected to additional security screening; the fact that, during the same period of time at issue, the Complainant traveled with another air carrier, yet was not subjected to any additional security measures; and the fact that the Respondent has been the subject of complaints by other individuals raising the same allegations as the present complaint. The Commission argues that systemic issues are likely at issue in this complaint and therefore reasons that having knowledge of the training provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees will assist the Tribunal in determining whether inferences of discrimination may be drawn with respect to the conduct of these employees or agents and in deciding what public interest remedies are appropriate if the complaint is substantiated.\n[41] In terms of humans rights and\/or cultural sensitivity training, the Respondent argues that neither the Complainant, nor the Commission, have proffered any proof so as to establish differential treatment on the basis of race or religion. As such, the Respondent contends the relevance of the requested training materials on \u201ccultural sensitivity and cultural competence\u201d have no bearing on the primary issue of whether the Complainant was subjected to differential treatment or whether his experiences were the result of standard protocol. Therefore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the requested documentation would be irrelevant until a rational connection is established so as to warrant disclosure.\n[42] With regard to other training materials, the Respondent maintains that it does not conduct security screening of passengers. Rather, it is required to screen each passenger based on procedures set forth by the Canadian and United States governments. The Respondent describes this procedure as follows:\nWhen a passenger\u2019s name is a close match to any name on the U.S. or Canadian No-Fly List or Selectee List, an automatic prompt will appear on the agent\u2019s screen stating that the passenger is \u201cDeemed High Profile\u201d (\u201cDHP\u201d). The agent is then required to contact a division within the Respondent\u2019s Corporate Security Department called the Operation Security Centre (\u201cOSC\u201d). The OSC agent would then request additional information pertaining to the passenger, which will often lead to an airport agent asking questions to said passenger for identification purposes. The OSC may require confirmation from the government authority responsible for the relevant list, following which, the OSC will dictate whether a boarding pass will be issued without limitation, whether it will be issued with a secondary screening requirement or whether it will not be issued at all. The airport agent and the air carrier would not be privy to discussions between the OSC and government agencies. Furthermore, it would not partake in any decision or the carrying out of any additional security measures that may be necessitated.\n[43] In this regard, the Respondent maintains that it has already provided all arguably relevant information, including a document entitled \u201cSecurity Clearance for Deemed High Profile Edits \u2013 Policy and Conditions\u201d and its Corporation Policy and Guidelines on Business Conduct.\n[44] The request for training materials by the Complainant and Commission are similar and can be dealt with together. The Respondent argues that neither the Complainant, nor the Commission, have proffered any proof so as to establish differential treatment on the basis of race or religion. Therefore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, any training materials on human rights or cultural sensitivity are irrelevant. However, at the disclosure stage, it is not necessary for the Complainant or the Commission to prove or substantiate their allegations in order to be entitled to disclosure from the Respondent. The only requirement for disclosure, as discussed above, is that the information be arguably relevant.\n[45] In this regard, I believe the training materials requested by the Complainant and Commission are arguably relevant because some of the Complainant\u2019s allegations deal with the actions and statements of the Respondent\u2019s employees. Plus, this information is arguably relevant to the allegations of systemic discrimination outlined by the Commission and, if the complaint is substantiated, the remedy thereof.\n[46] While the Respondent claims to have already disclosed arguably relevant information in this regard, it is unclear from its response whether or not its employees actually receive training on dealing with passengers in relation to security procedures and\/or training on human rights and\/or cultural sensitivity. The Respondent\u2019s answers to the requests did not specifically indicate whether or not such training exists. Accordingly, one might assume from the Respondent\u2019s answers that no such training is provided to the Respondent\u2019s employees in question. However, I think it would be more appropriate if the Respondent were to confirm if the training exists or not, and if it does provide such training, to disclose the arguably relevant information to the other parties.\n[47] Therefore, to satisfy the requests of both the Complainant and Commission, I would direct the Respondent to: (1) confirm whether or not it provides training to its front-line airport employees, such as the ones who dealt with the Complainant, on how to deal with handling complaints from passengers subject to enhanced questioning and\/or enhanced security screening or barred from flying due to alleged security concerns; and, if it does provide such training, to disclose those training materials; and, (2) confirm whether or not it provides training to its front-line airport employees, such as the ones who dealt with the Complainant, on human rights and\/or cultural sensitivity; and, if it does provide such training, to disclose those training materials.\nB. Documents showing the Respondent\u2019s stance on human rights [48] The Complainant requests:\nAll documents, electronic or otherwise, showing the respondent\u2019s stance on Human Rights or \u201cserious\u201d expression of concern about Human Rights violations, during the negotiations, communications or meetings between the respondent and authorities concerned with security, here and abroad, that led to the introduction of the so-called security measures, which are cited as premise for the way I was and others were treated.\n[49] The Complainant\u2019s rational for this request is as follows:\nAir Canada is responsible for ensuring that its negotiations to undertake any operations do not include direct or indirect violations of Canadian laws. In the course of this case, the respondent has consistently made its case for responsibility for security and its so-called measures. What we have not heard much about is the balancing act of responsibility for Human Rights in that process or the efforts that were made by Air Canada to preserve Human Rights. It is essential to know at which stage, if at all, did Air Canada show serious concerns and took clear stance for Human Rights during the above process. Are there documents, public statements etc., to prove this? If so, what parts of such documents can be shared. What concerns, if any, would there be for not sharing all or part of such document?\n[50] The Respondent contends the Complainant\u2019s request is unclear and that it has received limited information to aid it in deciphering exactly what is being requested. As such, the Respondent argues it has not been given the opportunity to appropriately consider the Complainant\u2019s request and ascertain its position with respect to whether or not the requested documentation would be arguably relevant to the issues in this case.\n[51] I am also unclear as to what the Complainant is requesting here. As such, I must deny the request at this time. However, the Complainant is free to clarify his request and resubmit it to the Respondent or by way of Notice of Motion. The Respondent would then be given the opportunity to consider the request and provide submissions if need be.\nC. Information on similar complaints made against the Respondent [52] More specifically, the Complainant requests:\nAll complaints made against the respondent for alleged discrimination on the basis of Islam\/Muslim and also other religions, ethnicity, race or other protected characteristics, from September 11, 2001 to 2013, inclusive, and a similar period in length before September 11, 2001.\n[53] The Commission\u2019s motion also contains a similar request for the disclosure of complaints:\nInformation re complaints by passengers regarding matters related to Air Canada\u2019s application of government imposed security lists such as references to enhanced questioning or security screening and passengers barred from flying due to alleged security concerns as well as information concerning any and all systemic resolutions and outcomes for any such complaint.\n[54] The Complainant submits that a serious question raised by his complaint is whether the alleged treatment he received was an isolated incident or a pattern of systemic discrimination. Therefore, in his view, information regarding other complaints similar to his own would be arguably relevant to establishing whether this pattern of systemic discrimination indeed exists.\n[55] For the Commission, as mentioned above at paragraph 40, it views this complaint as one raising a number of indicators that systemic matters are very likely at issue in this complaint. If systemic issues do exist, the Commission submits that the disclosure of past complaints that raise the same or similar allegations as the present case would assist in better understanding the extent of the problem: that is, whether the Respondent\u2019s policies and practices have a disproportionate adverse impact on persons identified by the prohibited grounds cited in the complaint. Also, should the complaint be substantiated, the Commission says this type of information will be important to the Tribunal in crafting a remedy, as it will need to consider the system as a whole.\n[56] To respect the privacy of the parties who made the complaints, neither the Complainant, nor the Commission, seek to know their names or their personal information.\n[57] Again, the Respondent argues that no evidence has been provided to suggest the Respondent\u2019s involvement in security screening or its prejudicial treatment of the Complainant was on the basis of race and religion. According to the Respondent, until the Commission or the Complainant substantiates the material facts with respect to the Respondent\u2019s involvement in this regard, their motions for disclosure of similar complaints are premature. Absent any such valid basis, the Respondent believes the disclosure request would be equivalent to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d, which does not warrant disclosure.\n[58] Even if the similar complaints were relevant to the issues at hand, the Respondent argues the Complainant\u2019s request is overly broad insofar as he requests documentation covering over a decade in time and provides no additional information with respect to the context of the similar complaints made. Furthermore, the Respondent claims it is not permitted to disclose the information as it would contain private and confidential information pertaining to uninvolved third parties, which cannot be severed from the records.\n[59] Again, at the disclosure stage, it is not necessary for the Complainant or Commission to prove or substantiate their allegations in order to be entitled to receive disclosure from the Respondent. The only requirement is that the information be arguably relevant.\n[60] I agree that past complaints against the Respondent that raise the same or similar allegations as the present case, including their outcomes, are arguably relevant to the issue of systemic discrimination. However, I am concerned that the request as it is presently worded, in terms of time and specificity, is overly broad. In my view, to be arguably relevant to this complaint, the past complaints must have alleged discrimination, on one or more of the same grounds as the Complainant (race, national or ethnic origin, colour and\/or religion), and must have emanated from the Respondent\u2019s application of government-imposed security lists.\n[61] In terms of time period, I note the following from the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars:\n48. In 2007 Canada and the United States entered into a bilateral treaty to address, among other things, aviation security. [...] Article 14 of the treaty specifically addressed aviation security issues, including sub-articles 3 and 4:\n[...]\n4) Each Party agrees that its operators of aircraft may be required to observe the aviation security provisions required by the other Party for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Party. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to inspect passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading. Each Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat. [Emphasis added]\n[62] With regard to Canada\u2019s own \u201cNo-Fly List\u201d, the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars indicates:\n6. The Government of Canada has established a list of persons of interest under the Passenger Protect Program (the \u201cCanadian List\u201d). The Passenger Protect Program identifies individuals who may pose a threat to aviation security and disrupts their ability to cause harm by taking action, such as preventing them from boarding an aircraft.\n[...]\n50. Implementation of the Canadian List has been effected through the Aeronautics Act and the Identity Screening Regulations. Section 3(1) of the Identity Screening Regulations requires:\nAn air carrier shall, before issuing a boarding pass to any person who appears to be 18 years of age or older, screen the person by comparing his or her name with the names of persons specified to the air carrier by the Minister under paragraph 4.81(1)(b) of the Act.\n[63] The Identify Screening Regulations were registered on April 26, 2007 (Identity Screening Regulations, SOR\/2007-82, available on the Department of Justice\u2019s website at: http:\/\/laws-lois.justice.gc.ca\/eng\/regulations\/SOR-2007-82\/page-1.html).\n[64] Therefore, given that the Respondent\u2019s obligation to apply the government-imposed security lists seems to have commenced in 2007, I believe this is a reasonable time limitation for disclosing similar complaints.\n[65] As a result, I would direct the Respondent to disclose past passenger complaints made against it, from March 2007 to present, alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour and\/or religion, and emanating from the Respondent\u2019s application of government-imposed security lists. If the Respondent has information regarding the outcome of those complaints, that information would be arguably relevant as well. To protect the identity and personal information of the parties involved in those complaints, the Respondent should redact any personal information from the disclosed materials.\nV. Commission\u2019s Motion for Disclosure [66] Apart from the requests which have already been analyzed above, the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure also requests information requiring the Respondent to subject some passengers who are on the \u201cSpecified Passengers Lists\u201d to additional security screening and information\/agreement between the Respondent (or airlines more generally) and various governments to no longer require the Respondent to subject certain passengers to enhanced security screening.\nA. Information requiring the Respondent to subject some passengers who are on the \u201cSpecified Passengers Lists\u201d to additional security screening [67] The Commission contends it has not received from the Respondent all of the relevant American and Canadian legislative and\/or regulatory sources that mandate it to conduct the type of passenger security screening at issue in this case. The Commission argues that this information is arguably relevant because the Respondent maintains that it was simply following American as well as Canadian requirements in its interactions with the Complainant. The Commission submits that it is entitled to know the full regulatory and legislative requirements that the Respondent claims were in place at the time of the alleged incidents as well as what changes, if any, have subsequently been made to the security regime.\n[68] In its motion, the Commission identifies what it believes to be some of the relevant Canadian and American sources for the Respondent\u2019s conduct; however, the Commission is seeking disclosure of the laws, regulations and rules that the Respondent understood to apply to it at the time of the Complainant\u2019s allegations, as well as the Respondent\u2019s understanding of how those laws, regulations and rules have since changed. The Commission asks that it be provided with the relevant portions of these items, in addition to any other relevant Canadian and American statues and\/or regulations.\n[69] The Respondent submits that this request has already been satisfied. In its response to the motion, it lists the legislation it claims it has cited and provided to the Commission. Furthermore, the Respondent argues it produced a letter from the Transportation Security Administration of the United States Department of Homeland Security, which further describes the nature of the \u201cNo-Fly List\u201d and \u201cSelectee List\u201d and an air carrier\u2019s responsibility to verify all passengers against said lists. According to the Respondent, this letter further identifies relevant American legislation. The Respondent adds that it is unaware of any case law that would assert that legislation, although publicly available to all parties from numerous sources, must be produced by one party.\n[70] In my view, it is not incumbent upon parties to produce copies of the legislation they are relying on. While parties are required to disclose and produce documents in their possession (see Rules 6(1)(d) and 6(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)), I do not believe legislation that is publicly available can properly be characterized as a document in the possession of a party. The same can be said for relying on and citing case law. It may be a different story if the legislation or legal authority is not publicly available, but that is not what is being argued in this case.\n[71] That said, Rule 6(1)(b) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) requires each party to set out in its Statement of Particulars its position on the legal issues raised by the case. Pursuant to this Rule, I would expect the Respondent to have outlined and cited in its Statement of Particulars all of the American and Canadian legislative and\/or regulatory sources that it believes mandate it to conduct the type of passenger security screening at issue in this case. In response to the Commission\u2019s motion, the Respondent claims it has. This is sufficient to ensure the Commission knows the case it is up against. Therefore, I see no reason to grant the Commission\u2019s request.\n[72] However, the Respondent is reminded that a party who does not raise an issue under Rule 6 shall not raise that issue at the hearing (see Rule 9(3)(a) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)). If there are indeed other American and Canadian legislative and\/or regulatory sources that the Respondent argues mandate it to conduct the type of passenger security screening at issue in this case, they should be disclosed prior to the hearing.\nB. Information\/agreement between the Respondent (or airlines more generally) and various governments to no longer require the Respondent to subject certain passengers to enhanced security screening [73] Similar to its argument for the disclosure of the previous item, the Commission submits that it is entitled to know the full framework under which the Respondent is mandated to carry out certain security screening procedures, as it goes directly to the facts and issues raised in the present complaint. For this particular request, the Commission understands that the framework mandating the Respondent to conduct certain security screening operations has changed on a number of occasions in the last decade. The Commission also understands that there were certain exceptions for Canadian and Mexican airlines carrying out domestic flights that overfly the continental United States, as well as changes to the requirements surrounding international flights. Therefore, the Commission submits its request goes to changes in the regulatory and legislative frameworks in the United States and Canada rather than agreements between those governments and airlines. However, if there are any such agreements, special exceptions or arrangements made for the Respondent concerning its role in security screening, then the Commission contends any such information would also be arguably relevant.\n[74] The Respondent maintains that all relevant legislation, including changes to the regulatory and legislative frameworks, has already been provided. According to the Respondent, this includes certain items in Schedule \u201cA\u201d of its Statement of Particulars, which pertain to the \u201cSecure Flight Program\u201d and additional changes implemented in 2011 pertaining to screening electronic manifests.\n[75] Again, pursuant to Rule 6(1)(b) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), I would expect the Respondent to have outlined and cited in its Statement of Particulars the full legal framework under which the Respondent argues it is mandated to carry out certain security screening procedures, including any changes to that framework since the incidents alleged in the complaint. The Respondent claims it has. Therefore, I again see no reason to grant the Commission\u2019s request. However, I repeat that a party who does not raise an issue under Rule 6 shall not raise that issue at the hearing (see Rule 9(3)(a) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)).\nVI. Decision [76] Pursuant the reasons above, the Tribunal directs as follows:\n(1) The Complainant shall produce a list containing the names and addresses of all health care professionals he has attended, including physicians, psychologists, social workers or counsellors, for reason of symptoms or treatment for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and\/or diminished self-esteem since January 2008.\n(2) The Complainant shall obtain and produce, or authorize the Respondent to obtain and produce, any medical documents, whether in hard copy or electronic format, from the health care professionals listed in direction (1) above, that relate to any symptoms of or treatment for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and\/or diminished self-esteem since January 2008.\n(3) To protect the Complainant\u2019s right to confidentiality of his medical records, they shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondent and the Commission only and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to the Complainant. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry. If the Complainant is of the view that any of these records are personal and not arguably relevant, I will give him the option of sharing such records with me in advance and I will determine whether or not they should be disclosed. If the Complainant avails himself of this opportunity, notice of my review of such records will be given to the other parties.\n(4) The Complainant shall obtain and produce his entire human resources file from his employer for the period of January 2007 to December 2013. It should also include an account of the Complainant\u2019s sick leave for the same period and disclose the dates on which he has taken vacation since March 2010, that being the period of the first alleged incident, to present.\n(5) The Commission shall produce its file pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s complaint against CATSA for the same travel dates that are the object of this present complaint.\n(6) The Respondent shall: (1) confirm whether or not it provides training to its front-line airport employees, such as the ones who dealt with the Complainant, on how to deal with handling complaints from passengers subject to enhanced questioning and\/or enhanced security screening or barred from flying due to alleged security concerns; and, if it does provide such training, to disclose those training materials; and, (2) confirm whether or not it provides training to its front-line airport employees, such as the ones who dealt with the Complainant, on human rights and\/or cultural sensitivity; and, if it does provide such training, to disclose those training materials.\n(7) The Respondent shall disclose past complaints made against it, from 2007 to present, alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour and\/or religion, and emanating from the Respondent\u2019s application of government-imposed security lists. If the Respondent has information regarding the outcome of those complaints, that information shall be disclosed as well.\n(8) To protect the identity and personal information of the parties involved in the past complaints that may be disclosed under direction (7) above, the Respondent shall redact any personal information from the disclosed materials.\nSigned by\nDavid Thomas\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 8, 2014\n",

Background\n[1] On July 31, 2012, pursuant to subsection 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cHuman Rights Act\u201d), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) asked the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Acting Chairperson to institute an inquiry into the complaint of Brian William Carter (\u201cComplainant\u201d) against Fisheries and Oceans Canada as respondent (\u201cDFO\u201d).\n[2] The grounds of the Complaint are that DFO discriminated against the Complainant because it failed and\/or refused to accommodate his disability; treated him in an adverse, differential manner by engaging in a discriminatory policy or practice, and thereby denied him an employment opportunity, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[3] On February 6, 2014, the Tribunal issued a Ruling ordering that the Attorney General of Canada (\u201cAGC\u201d) be substituted for DFO as the Respondent, and that the Respondent in the style of cause read: \u201cThe Attorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Public Service Commission of Canada).\u201d\n[4] The Commission was participating in the hearing and filed its Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d). On June 20, 2014, the Commission advised that it was no longer participating in the hearing.\n[5] The Complainant has made a Motion for an Order for confidentiality concerning certain documents (\u201cConfidentiality Motion\u201d or \u201cMotion\u201d). The Respondent and the Commission filed Responses to the Motion.\nA. Appendix 2 of Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars\n[6] Appendix 2 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP is headed \u201cMEDICAL-IN-CONFIDENCE\u201d, and under that heading, the title \u201cAppendix 2 \u2013 Medical Documents\u201d. There follows a list of documents comprising 24 pages. The Complainant claimed privilege for these documents which he submits are related to his medical condition (\u201cthe Appendix 2 Documents\u201d).\nII. The Confidentiality Motion\n[7] The Complainant\u2019s Motion for Confidentiality Order seeks the following orders:\nthe Appendix 2 Documents shall be disclosed only to counsel and paralegals for the Parties;\nthe Appendix 2 Documents shall not be copied and shall not be transferred in any way whatsoever, including by fax and email, by any Party or individual to any other Party or individual;\nif a Party\u2019s counsel seeks additional disclosure of the Appendix 2 documents to anyone else, counsel must take all the steps from a) to f) below beforehand:\nseek the Tribunal\u2019s prior permission;\ngive the Complainant prior notice;\nprovide the name of the person the party proposes to view any such document;\njustify why that person needs to view the document;\nrestrict the additional disclosure to that person to viewing only;\nobtain a signed undertaking from the proposed additional viewer acknowledging that the existence and contents of the document are strictly confidential and must not be disclosed or discussed with anyone else unless the Tribunal specifically authorizes such further disclosure or discussion;\nall counsel must safeguard the Appendix 2 Documents as confidential and store them in authorized storage arrangements in accordance with Government of Canada security regulations;\nat the end of the inquiry, all counsel must certify to the Tribunal and the Complainant that the Appendix 2 Documents have been destroyed in accordance with Government of Canada security regulations, or alternatively, return them to the Complainant;\nall information pertaining to the Complainant which the Respondent has already obtained under the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, C-P21 (\u201cPrivacy Act\u201d) is to be subject to any order the Tribunal makes pursuant to this Confidentiality Motion;\ndeviations from any order the Tribunal makes pursuant to this Motion which have already occurred are to be reported to the Tribunal and the Complainant so that the risks arising from the deviations can be assessed and addressed.\n[8] The Complainant relies on the following grounds:\nthe highly personal, very sensitive and confidential nature of the Appendix 2 Documents;\ndisclosure of the Appendix 2 Documents into the public domain would be highly prejudicial to the Complainant\u2019s reputation and health; that is why he claimed privilege for those documents;\nthe order the Complainant seeks complies with Rule 152 of the Rules of the Federal Courts of Canada, SOR\/98-106 (\u201cFederal Courts Rules\u201d);\nLeslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2013 CHRT 19, paras. 40 and 45 (\u201cPalm #3\u201d);\nthe following cases, which contain one or more the confidentiality provisions he seeks:Harjinder Kaur Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, para. 37 (\u201cRai\u201d);Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para 48 (\u201cGuay\u201d);Montreuil v. Canadian Forces, 2005 CHRT 45, para 12 (\u201cMontreuil\u201d);PSAC v. Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2004 CHRT 38, paras 19, 20 & 21 (\u201cCanadian Museum\u201d); Day v. DND and Robert Hortie, 2003 CHRT 3, paras. 3 & 4 (\u201cDay\u201d); Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42, para 35 (\u201cGaucher\u201d);\nalthough the Respondent is governed by the Privacy Act, the gap in that Act lessens its confidentiality protections and is further evidence of the need for the confidentiality order the Complainant seeks;\nthe Respondent counsel\u2019s search for documents to disclose has been so wide that it constitutes a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d, and is contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution Act, 1982, c.11 (U.K.), Schedule B, Part 1(\u201cCharter\u201d) in that it constitutes an unreasonable search.\nIII. Fundamental Issue\n[9] The ultimate issue in this Motion is whether the Tribunal should grant the Complainant\u2019s Confidentiality Motion.\n[10] The Ruling will address other matters the parties have raised:\nwhether the Appendix 2 Documents are privileged;\nwhether the Appendix 2 Documents are confidential;\nwhether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to control and monitor the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process;\nthe role of the Privacy Act in the inquiry;\nif the Tribunal does make a confidentiality order, the terms that should be in it.\nIV. Law and Tribunal Rules of Procedure\n[11] Section 52 of the Human Rights Act states:\n52. (1) An inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\na. there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed;\nb. there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\nc. there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or\nd. there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n(2) If the member or panel considers it appropriate, the member or panel may take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a hearing held in respect of an application under subsection (1).\nA. Tribunal Rules of Procedure\n[12] Rule 6(1) of The Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cTribunal Rules\u201d) requires parties to a complaint to provide each other with a Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) containing, among other things,\nd. a list of all documents the party possesses for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under Rule 6;\ne. a list of all documents the party possesses for which privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\nf. a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses, together with a summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness.\n[13] Rule 6(4) provides that when a party has identified a document for which no privilege is claimed, it shall provide a copy of the document to all the other parties.\n[14] Rule 6(5) essentially provides that disclosure is an ongoing obligation and that a party must rectify any inaccurate or incomplete compliance with Rule 6.\nB. Brief Analysis of Rule 6 (1), d., e., and f\n[15] To comply with Rules 6(1) d., e., and f, parties may be obliged to do all or some of the following:\nsearch through all their documents for those which they think may relate to the complaint;\nselect and decide which of the documents that they find are in fact related to a fact, issue or form of relief sought by the complaint and identified by other parties (i.e. decide if any such document is \u201carguably relevant\u201d to the complaint \u2013 this phrase is discussed further, below;\ndecide which of those documents are not privileged and can be immediately disclosed to the other party;\ndecide which are privileged and why;\nsearch for witnesses, likely speak with them, and decide which witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses;\ndraft a summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness the party intends to call (\u201cwill-say\u201d).\n[16] Compliance with Rule 6 involves not only searching for documents and witnesses, but also deciding which documents to use and disclose; which witnesses to call and disclose; and which documents and witnesses not to use, and therefore, not disclose. The Rule engenders not only a search, but also a decision-making and strategy process, in preparation for the litigation that constitutes an inquiry.\n[17] For the above reasons, in this Ruling, I will call the process arising from Rule 6 the \u201cPre-Disclosure Search\/Process\u201d.\nV. Issue: The standard for documentary disclosure pursuant to Rule 6\n[18] In complying with Rule 6 above, parties must decide, among other things, which documents they must disclose and which documents to list as privileged.\nA. Commission\u2019s Position\n[19] The Complainant has put in issue the health condition which he states is a disability under the Act.\n[20] Given that the Complainant waived his right to claim an award for pain and suffering, arguably relevant disclosure should be limited to only the medical information about the disability which required accommodation during the job competition referred to in the Complaint.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[21] The second and third paragraphs of the Complainant\u2019s Motion for Confidentiality state:\nthe Complainant \u201cacknowledges that all Parties and the Tribunal must be necessarily privy to the Complainant\u2019s personal medical information in sufficient detail\u2026to determine\u201d whether he had a disability under the Act and its consequences regarding function and accommodation in a DFO job competition;\nthe medical information the Complainant holds is \u201carguably relevant\u201d to his Complaint;\nin the last paragraph, page 1 of the Motion for Confidentiality, the Complainant further states that he views the medical information for which he claimed privilege (i.e., the Appendix 2 Documents) \u201c\u2026as arguably relevant\u201d.\nC. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[22] The Respondent states that to respond to the Complaint \u201c\u2026on behalf of the PSC and DFO\u2026\u201d it \u201c\u2026must gather and review all documents within the federal government\u2019s control which may be arguably relevant to the complaint. Relevant documents include those which may contain information regarding the Complainant\u2019s disability and any related medical conditions;\u201d (Response to Motion, para. 30).\nD. Analysis: The standard for documentary disclosure pursuant to Rule 6\n[23] Subsection 50(1) of the Act requires that all parties to an inquiry be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case.\n\u201cTherefore, for fairness reasons and in the search for truth, it is in the public interest to ensure that all arguably relevant evidence is disclosed between the parties appearing before the Tribunal\u201d (Rai, supra, para.28).\n[24] As set out in Rai, supra, and Gaucher, supra, the accepted standard for the disclosure of evidence, including documents, pursuant to Rule 6, is that the evidence be arguably relevant.\n[25] For a document to be arguably relevant, there needs to be \u201c\u2026a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by the parties\u2026\u201d(Rai, supra, at para.28, citing Guay, supra at para.42, and Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28, at para.4).\n\u201cThe threshold for arguable relevance is low and the tendency is now towards more, not less disclosure.\u201d (Gaucher, supra, para. 11)\n[26] Applying the above principles to this Complaint, first, all the parties agree that the Complainant has put his health in issue by stating that he has a disability within the meaning of the Act.\n[27] All the parties also agree that the standard for documentary disclosure under Rule 6, Tribunal Rules, is that a document be \u201carguably relevant\u201d.\n[28] There is no dispute among the parties that the Appendix 2 Documents are arguably relevant.\n[29] I have not seen the texts of the Appendix 2 Documents. However, for each document, Appendix 2 lists its date, a brief description of its contents, its author and to whom it was sent. Paragraph 6 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP enunciates what he thinks the Appendix 2 Documents will establish regarding the medical condition he claims as a disability.\n[30] I find that the Appendix 2 Documents may be arguably relevant to facts, issues and forms of relief the Complainant has claimed.\nVI. Issue: Privilege\n[31] The Complainant has claimed privilege for the Appendix 2 Documents. Neither his SOP nor his Motion materials specify what type of privilege he claims.\n[32] Section 50(4) of the Act states:\n\u201cLimitation in relation to evidence \u2013 The member or panel may not admit or accept as evidence anything that would be inadmissible in a court by reason of any privilege under the law of evidence.\u201d\n[33] Subsection 50(4) therefore renders inadmissible at the Tribunal information which is privileged at law.\n[34] Even though the Appendix 2 Documents are arguably relevant, it must be determined whether the Complainant\u2019s claim of privilege over them prevents their disclosure.\nA. Analysis: Privilege\n[35] I note the following:\nin the Complainant\u2019s SOP, at paragraph 6, he states that the Appendix 2 Documents for which he has claimed privilege prove that he \u201c\u2026had a disability, indicate the severity of the disability (initially and about the time accommodation was requested)\u2026.\u201d and then \u201crequests that the Tribunal protect these documents from disclosure in accordance with the Canadian Human Rights Act\u201d. This is followed by footnote number 2, which recites section 52 of the Act, supra;.\nin the Complainant\u2019s Motion for Confidentiality Order, he states he is \u201c\u2026still willing to disclosure [sic] the already identified privileged medical information\u201d [i.e. Appendix 2 Documents \u2013 my note].\n[36] The Complainant\u2019s claim of privilege communicated his position that the Appendix 2 Documents should remain confidential, notwithstanding his acknowledgment that they were arguably relevant.\n[37] The Complainant himself has offered to disclose the Appendix 2 Documents, subject to this condition: that the Tribunal place confidentiality protection around the disclosure of these documents, pursuant to section 52 of the Act.\n[38] Consequently, I conclude that he has given a conditional waiver of privilege.\n[39] This Ruling is about pre-hearing disclosure of evidence, not its admissibility at the hearing. Since the Complainant has conditionally waived his claim of privilege, it is not necessary, for the purposes of this Motion, to determine whether the Appendix 2 Documents are in fact privileged at law.\nVII. Issue: Confidentiality\nA. Commission\u2019s Position\nThe Medical Information is delicate and sensitive and justifies a confidentiality order over it.\nThe confidentiality orders in Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al, 2013 CHRT 1 (\u201cPalm #2\u201d) and Palm #3 can be the basis of an order balancing the need for the confidentiality of the Appendix 2 Documents with the need for their disclosure to the Respondent to prepare its case.\nThe Commission submits specific terms for the proposed confidentiality order.\nB. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n[40] The Respondent\u2019s reasons for its position that the Tribunal has no grounds to grant a confidentiality order on the Complainant\u2019s terms are set out below.\nThe Appendix 2 Documents are not inherently confidential simply because they contain medical information.\nThe Complainant has \u201ctacitly\u201d waived his right to confidentiality of the Medical Information because he has placed his health in issue.\nThe test for confidentiality is that materials must be confidential both objectively and subjectively, as set out in Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. [1993] F.C.J. No. 1117 (\u201cApotex\u201d) and AB Hassle v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare [1998] F.C.J. No.497 (\u201cAB Hassle\u201d).\nThe subjective opinion of a complainant that such an order is warranted is not sufficient. The Motion does not reveal an objective need for confidentiality.\nSome information about the nature of the Complainant\u2019s health condition is already in the Tribunal\u2019s recordsThe Respondent already has some of the documents in Appendix 2, because those documents have always been in the control of the federal government departments to which the Complainant submitted them.\nPart of the order the Complainant seeks would prevent the Respondent from consulting with any federal government employee about documents within the Respondent\u2019s control and also prevent the Respondent from using such documents to consult with third parties such as experts and other potential witnesses.\nThe Respondent submits that if the Tribunal does grant a confidentiality order governing the Appendix 2 Documents, the order should only apply to those documents \u201cwhen they are handed over to the other parties during the course of the disclosure process provided by Rule 6(4) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure\u201d. [Respondent\u2019s underlining]\nIf the Tribunal finds that the Appendix 2 Documents are confidential, the Respondent agrees with most of the Commission\u2019s specified terms.\nC. Analysis: Confidentiality\n[41] In the cases the Respondent cites as supporting its submission that there must be both a subjective and objective test for material to be found confidential, the interests involved are commercial property, such as patents and proprietary interests in intellectual property. The contemplated harm if these are disclosed is commercial, monetary harm.\n[42] It is reasonable that in civil Court cases involving commercial and property rights, the Courts will apply different standards to assess if those rights require confidentiality protection than the standards applicable to human rights cases. This is particularly so at the administrative tribunal level, where the constituting legislation \u2013 the Human Rights Act \u2013 contains those standards.\n[43] It is the standard for confidentiality in section 52 of the Human Rights Act, supra, which applies to this Motion.\n[44] Even where sensitive personal information is deemed to be arguably relevant for the purposes of disclosure, section 52 of the Act gives the Tribunal the authority to protect such information, provided the criteria in subsection 52(1)c) or 52(1)(d) are met.\n[45] The Complainant did not waive confidentiality, either tacitly or explicitly. He waived privilege, as set out above, but on the condition that the Appendix 2 Documents be kept confidential pursuant to section 52 of the Act.\n[46] Although the Complainant no longer works in the DFO, he does work in a federal government department. I conclude from assessment of the Appendix 2 Documents, as set out above, that they contain personal medical information which is private and sensitive. If it were in the public domain, without confidentiality protections, it is reasonable to conclude that it could cause the Complainant harm at work, negatively impact him professionally, and negatively impact his personal life. Putting the Appendix 2 Documents in the public domain would therefore cause him undue hardship.\n[47] It is not necessary that every detail of the Complainant\u2019s relevant medical condition, and medical details not related to that condition be in the public domain in order for the conduct and result of this inquiry to remain accessible and understandable to the public.\n[48] As well, the fact that the Respondent or its clients or other federal departments possess some of the Appendix 2 Documents does not derogate from their personal, sensitive, private and confidential nature.\n[49] As the Tribunal stated in Rai, supra, \u201c\u2026where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has usually put conditions on the disclosure to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information\u201d (Rai, para. 30).\n[50] I am satisfied that for all of the above reasons, in accordance with subsection 52(1)(c) of the Act, that if the Appendix 2 Documents were made public during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of those documents containing the Complainant\u2019s personal medical information would cause undue hardship to him, such that the need to prevent that disclosure other than on the conditions in the order below outweighs the societal interest that they be disclosed to the public.\n[51] As the Appendix 2 Documents contain information that may be arguably relevant for the purposes of disclosure, the other parties are entitled to see them in order to have the full and ample opportunity to present their cases mandated by section 50(1) of the Act.\n[52] In requiring the Complainant to disclose the Appendix 2 Documents to the other parties, such disclosure will be subject to and in accordance with the conditions in this Ruling which are designed to protect their confidentiality.\n[53] In Palm #3, supra, the Tribunal expanded the confidentiality order in Palm #2, supra, by permitting the complainant\u2019s medical records to be viewed by a respondent\u2019s president and the two individual respondents, to the extent required for counsel to obtain informed instructions and provide advice.\n[54] At this stage of this inquiry, it is not productive to order that a party bring a motion or have to request further directions from the Tribunal when the time comes for counsel to discuss the Appendix 2 Documents with instructing clients. That time will surely come, and as in Palm #3, supra, the Tribunal can deal with that inevitable process in this Ruling. The same applies to medical experts who Respondent counsel or the Complainant may consult. The Decision below reflects this finding.\nD. Related Medical Information\n[55] In paragraph 30 of the Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, the Respondent submits that in order to respond to the Complaint, the AG must \u201c\u2026gather and review all documents within the federal government\u2019s control which may be arguably relevant to the complaint. Relevant documents include those which may contain information regarding the Complainant\u2019s disability and any related medical conditions;\u201d [my italics].\n[56] In the interests of protecting the confidentiality of the Complainant\u2019s medical information during this inquiry in accordance with section 52(1)(c) of the Act, if there is arguably relevant medical information regarding the Complainant\u2019s disability and any related medical conditions other than in the Appendix 2 Documents (\u201cRelated Medical Information\u201d) which the Respondent or any other party will disclose, this Ruling and the orders in it shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Related Medical Information.\nE. Electronic Transmission of Documents\n[57] The transmission of and communications about the Appendix 2 Documents and any Related Medical Information between the Respondent and its clients and other federal government departments involved in this Complaint, and between the Commission and those same entities are communications between federal institutions within the Government of Canada. They are internal communications of the Government of Canada which are governed by and subject to the Privacy Act.\n[58] There are also government security regulations, procedures, and protocols which govern and are required for electronic transmissions, including email, from and to the entities above, including the Respondent and the Commission \u2013 for example, encryption, passwords, designations of \u201cProtected A\u201d and \u201cProtected B\u201d, confidentiality designations and other protocols.\n[59] To prohibit the Respondent and Commission from using electronic transmissions in the present-day working environment when its use is ubiquitous and when security protection is available and required would be an unreasonable impediment to the Respondent\u2019s ability to prepare its defence, and for the Commission to do any work it considers necessary to assist in the inquiry.\n[60] Nevertheless, the confidentiality of the Appendix 2 Documents and any Related Medical Information are to be respected in all electronic communications (and other communications) among the above entities, and between the Respondent, and the Commission, and between them and permitted third parties by ensuring that all required protocols and security regulations and procedures are used in all electronic transmissions regarding the Appendix 2 Documents and any Related Medical Information.\n[61] However, facsimile transmissions of the Appendix 2 Documents and any Related Medical Information are permitted only if:\nthey are transmitted from a facsimile application in a computer to a facsimile in a computer;\nall applicable security regulations, procedures and protocols governing the Respondent or the Commission, as applicable, are used in such facsimile transmission;\nit is written on the cover page that the documents are governed by the Privacy Act and are the subject of a Tribunal order for confidentiality.\n[62] The requirements above for facsimile transmissions recognize that if facsimile transmissions are sent to a stand-alone facsimile machine, unless the designated recipient is right there to retrieve it, the facsimile can be picked up by anyone in the recipient department or office.\nVIII. Issue: Section 52 Confidentiality Order and the Privacy Act\n[63] In the Complainant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s and Commission\u2019s Responses to Motion, he submits that there is a gap in the Privacy Act, specifically, that it \u201c\u2026contains few specific confidentiality measures or process that must be followed\u201d, and that the Tribunal should keep this in mind in any confidentiality order.\n[64] The Complainant attached three documents from the Office of Canada\u2019s Privacy Commissioner to support these submissions. These documents are:\nFactum of the Intervener, Privacy Commissioner of Canada (\u201cFactum\u201d) in Bernard v. Attorney General of Canada and PIPSC and various Interveners, SCC File No. 34819 (\u201cBernard\u201d);\nGuidance Document: Electronic Disclosure of Personal Information in the Decisions of Administrative Tribunals, February, 2010 (\u201cPCC Guidance\u201d); and\nRemarks of Chantal Bernier, Assistant Privacy Commissioner of Canada at the First Forum on Court Technology, September 22, 2010 (\u201cACC Remarks\u201d).\n[65] I have read these attachments. The gaps I surmised from the documents are:\nan individual who feels a government institution has breached the Privacy Act by improperly collecting, using or disclosing his personal information has no recourse to a court;\nthe Privacy Act contains no regime for monetary compensation for damages arising from any such breach or monetary penalties for any such breach;\nthe Privacy Act does not govern federal public sector unions;\nsome administrative tribunals have clear policies restricting disclosure of personal information in their decisions published online, and some do not. For those that do not, there is a risk that an individual\u2019s sensitive and personal information which may be irrelevant to the purpose of publishing the decision is nevertheless easily accessible to the public.\n[66] The Respondent\u2019s and Commission\u2019s Responses to Motion did not address the Privacy Act.\nA. Analysis: Section 52 Confidentiality Order and the Privacy Act\n[67] This Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to remedy breaches of the Privacy Act. Section 29 of the Privacy Act provides the procedure to file a complaint for a breach.\n[68] Any confidentiality order the Tribunal makes must be based on whether the circumstances of the particular situation fall within the requirements of section 52 of the Human Rights Act. To address any perceived gaps in the Privacy Act, a Tribunal confidentiality order must still meet section 52 requirements for confidentiality.\n[69] The submissions of the Privacy Commissioner that the Privacy Act contains no judicial recourse or monetary compensation for breaches of its provisions for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information are not relevant to the requirements of section 52 of the Human Rights Act, nor can the Tribunal provide a remedy.\n[70] No federal public sector union is a party to this Complaint.\n[71] The privacy issue around online publication of decisions is not presently relevant to this Motion. This Ruling will not be published online until the issue of anonymization of the Complaint is decided. That issue arose previously, and it was decided that the Commission could address it at the end of the hearing. Although the Commission is no longer appearing at the hearing, anonymization remains a live issue.\nB. Analysis: Rule 152, Federal Courts Rules\n[72] Generally, Federal Court Rules do not bind the Tribunal unless they are incorporated by reference into the Tribunal Rules. The only Tribunal Rule which incorporates a Federal Court Rule by reference is Tribunal Rule 9(7), which incorporates section 57 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.F-7 (\u201cFederal Courts Act\u201d) and form 69 of the Federal Court Rules. Therefore, Federal Court Rule 152 does not bind the Tribunal.\n[73] However, if the Tribunal decides that any part of Federal Court Rule 152 is reasonable to include in this Ruling, because it is independently authorized under section 52 of the Human Rights Act, and in the circumstances, then the Ruling will do so.\nC. Analysis: The Charter\n[74] The Complainant submits that in conducting its Pre-Disclosure Search Process, the Respondent has gone on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d which also amounts to an unreasonable search, contrary to section 8 of the Charter. That section states:\n\u201cEveryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\u201d\n[75] The Respondent is the AGC. I assume for the purpose of this Ruling that the Respondent has had notice of the Complainant\u2019s Charter submission, in compliance with Rule 9(7) of the Tribunal Rules.\n[76] The Complainant has provided no other submission and no case law on this issue. The Respondent and Commission did not address the issue.\n[77] There is no evidence to substantiate the Complainant\u2019s Charter submission. I am unable to conclude that the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process constitutes a breach of the Complainant\u2019s section 8 Charter rights.\nIX. Analysis: The Request for a Retroactive Remedy\n[78] One of the remedies the Complainant requested was that any previously occurring deviations from any order arising from this Motion be reported to him and the Tribunal in order to assess and address the risks arising from them.\n[79] Respondent counsel has stated in its Motion materials and during the February 27, 2014 CMCC that it obtained some of the Appendix 2 Documents during its Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process with its federal government department clients. The clients possessed many of the Appendix 2 Documents because the Complainant had submitted those documents to them during time periods ostensibly relevant to the Complaint.\n[80] Respondent counsel also stated in its Motion materials and during the above-mentioned CMCC that once the Tribunal ordered the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process temporarily frozen, Respondent counsel complied with all orders.\n[81] Although the Tribunal was obliged in this Motion to look at some matters retrospectively, it cannot make an order to formally retrospectively inquire into or assess whether a prior \u201cdeviation\u201d from the order below has occurred. Doing so would infringe on litigation privilege, which concept will be discussed in more detail below. It would mean intruding on the Respondent\u2019s \u201czone of privacy\u201d in preparing its case. The Respondent cannot be forced to offer that information. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot make a finding on any such pre-existing deviation or craft a remedy.\nX. Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction to Control and Monitor the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process\n[82] This Ruling arises from the Complainant\u2019s Motion for Confidentiality.\n[83] Additionally, the Complainant is concerned that in conducting its Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process, the Respondent has gone on an uncontrolled \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for the Complainant\u2019s medical information, including the Appendix 2 Documents. He feels this significantly jeopardizes its confidentiality by permitting an untold number of unidentified individuals in federal government departments, including unidentified individuals in the departments who are the Respondent\u2019s clients in this Complaint, to access, handle, use and disseminate this information and the fact that Respondent is searching for it, to others, without restriction, because adequate safeguards are not in place.\nA. February 27, 2014 Case Management Conference Call\n[84] The February 27, 2014 Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) was held to discuss the Complainant\u2019s continuing concerns.\n[85] During that CMCC, the Complainant said that he had heard from two individuals in the government department or departments which the Respondent represents in this Complaint that these individuals either knew about or had \u201cheard\u201d that people were looking for information about the Complainant. He also said that he might not be able to prove this. He did not provide these individuals\u2019 names. This allegation is not in the Motion materials.\n[86] The Respondent and the Commission made no submissions on this allegation during the CMCC.\n[87] There is insufficient evidence before me to conclude that this allegation is established.\n[88] It was conveyed to the Complainant that the Privacy Act governs his medical information, including the Appendix 2 Documents, and also those federal government departments who hold it, including during the Pre-Disclosure Search Process. Any individuals who may have communicated the above information to the Complainant breached the Privacy Act by doing so. I will discuss the Privacy Act in more detail below.\n[89] The Complainant nevertheless wished to have the Tribunal order that anyone who a party communicates with during the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process about the Appendix 2 Documents and the Complainant\u2019s medical condition be controlled, identified to the other parties and be restricted in what they do with that medical information in order to protect the Complainant\u2019s medical information during the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process.\nB. Respondent\u2019s Position\nThe Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over documents that are in the possession or control of the federal government \u201cbefore their disclosure to the other parties pursuant to Rule 6(4), even if they contain medical information.\u201d\nSection 52 of the Act authorizes the Tribunal to \u201cmake any order it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry\u201d [Respondent\u2019s underlining]. Documents under a party\u2019s control only become part of the inquiry when they are disclosed to the other parties or filed in evidence \u201cbefore the Tribunal\u201d. Therefore, section 52 does not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to order confidentiality for documents that are \u201cnot disclosed to the other parties or filed as evidence.\u201d Specifically, the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to \u201c\u2026restrict the manner in which the Attorney General collects, review, and\/or relies upon documents that are currently within the federal government\u2019s control.\u201d\nAn order so restricting the Respondent would breach its litigation privilege.\nC. Analysis: Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction to control and monitor the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process\na. Analysis: The Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process and the Privacy Act\n[90] The Respondent, the DFO, the PSC, the DND, and VAC (also called Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs) and the Commission are all \u201cgovernment institutions\u201d within the meaning of section 3 of the Privacy Act [1] , which therefore applies to them.\n[91] Within the meaning of section 3 of the Privacy Act, the Complainant is an \u201cidentifiable individual\u201d and the Appendix 2 Documents constitute \u201cpersonal information\u201d. [2]\n[92] Also within the meaning of section 3 of the Privacy Act, this inquiry is a \u201cdecision making process that directly affects\u201d the Complainant. [3] The parties therefore wish to use the Appendix 2 Documents for an \u201cadministrative purpose\u201d, as defined in section 3. [4]\n[93] I find that the Appendix 2 Documents and their transmission from the applicable government departments to the Respondent during the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process, and vice-versa, are governed by the Privacy Act, as are the Respondent and the departments which it represents in this inquiry, as well as the Commission. I also conclude that the Appendix 2 Documents and all requests for and handling of them cannot be dealt with during the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process except in accordance with the Privacy Act.\n[94] Therefore, any individual federal government employee or representative of any federal government department involved in the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process cannot disclose the personal information of any individual, including the Complainant, except in accordance with the Privacy Act, and anyone who fails to do so is in breach of the Privacy Act.\n[95] Breaches of the Privacy Act can result in stand-alone liability, and are subject to investigation by the Privacy Commissioner, pursuant to section 29. [5]\n[96] If the Respondent conducts any further Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process in any federal government department governed by the Privacy Act, for the purpose of seeking out Related Medical Information and any witnesses with respect thereto, I direct that Respondent counsel and paralegal shall inform each and every individual with whom Respondent counsel and paralegal communicate that:\nthe Privacy Act governs the information sought, and its disclosure, use, dissemination, storage and handling; and\nthat the information sought is confidential and subject to this Ruling; and\nthat such individual is not to discuss or otherwise communicate in any way whatsoever about the information with any other individual, except in accordance with the Privacy Act, including, without limitation, that there has been a request for such information;\nthat there is liability that accrues under the Privacy Act to the individual and\/or federal government department for any breach thereof, including, without limitation, any breach of sections 7 and 8. [6]\nb. Analysis: The Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process and Litigation Privilege\n[97] The Tribunal does not have an unlimited power to monitor, control and regulate all preparatory actions taken by a party in relation to the inquiry.\n[98] This is because the Respondent (i.e., the AGC and its client departments in this Complaint) and the Complainant are both entitled to the benefits of \u201clitigation privilege\u201d.\n[99] Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2006 SCC 39 (\u201cBlank SCC\u201d) involved the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 and litigation privilege. The Supreme Court of Canada found litigation privilege to be a separate and distinct concept.\n[100] The Court defined litigation privilege as a branch of solicitor\/client privilege (Blank, supra, at para.28, and repeated at para.40 that:\n\u201cLitigation privilege is based upon the need for a protected area to facilitate investigation and preparation of a case for trial by the adversarial advocate.\u201d\n[101] The Court stated at para.34:\n\u201cThe purpose of the litigation privilege, I repeat, is to create a \u201czone of privacy\u201d in relation to pending or apprehended litigation.\u201d\n[102] Unrepresented parties are also entitled to litigation privilege.\n[103] Requiring a party to reveal its preparations and strategy to its adversary in a litigation, including to whom that party speaks, the manner in which it compiles its documents and decides on its documents and witnesses would breach that party\u2019s litigation privilege.\n[104] Further, any unfettered attempts to monitor, control and regulate a party\u2019s pre-hearing preparation would impinge on subsection 50(4) of the Human Rights Act, supra.\n[105] As well, subsection 50(1) of the Act requires that all parties to an inquiry shall be given \u201c\u2026a full and ample opportunity... to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations\u201d. Intrusive attempts to monitor, control and regulate a party\u2019s pre-hearing preparation are not only breaches of litigation privilege, they are contrary to 50(1).\n[106] This Tribunal must balance a party\u2019s right to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information which may be relevant to the case, with the other parties\u2019 rights to be able to fully prepare its case, in accordance with subsection 50(1) of the Act, and protected by litigation privilege.\n[107] For all of the reasons set out above, the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process is protected by litigation privilege, and pursuant to it, the Respondent and counsel are not required to disclose the identity of any individual to whom Respondent counsel speaks during the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process, or the topic of discussion.\nXI. Temporary Freeze Terminated\n[108] This Ruling will terminate the temporary freeze on the Pre-Disclosure Search\/Process which was ordered during the February 27, 2014 CMCC and which was continued during the April 3, 2014 CMCC.\n[109] A CMCC is scheduled for August 19, 2014.

Order 8\nI. Introduction [1] The complaint filed by Leslie Hicks against Human Resources and Skills Development Canada was heard by the Tribunal and a decision rendered on September 18, 2013 (see Hicks v. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 20 [Hicks]).\n[2] The decision of the Tribunal was favourable to the Complainant. In sum, the Tribunal found the Respondent\u2019s interpretation and application of its Relocation Directive to the denial of the Complainant\u2019s claim for Temporary Dual Residence Assistance (\u201cTDRA\u201d) to be discriminatory on the basis of family status pursuant to section 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. The Tribunal granted various remedies to the Complainant, but deferred deciding the issue of the quantum of the claim for TDRA in the hope the parties could resolve the matter between themselves (see Hicks at paras. 89-91). The parties were unable to reach an agreement within the three (3) month delay fixed by the Tribunal.\n[3] The parties have now asked the Tribunal to establish the quantum of the TDRA claim. The Complainant submitted his written position on November 22, 2013; the Respondent, its response on December 13, 2013; and, the Complainant his reply on December 20, 2013.\n[4] Both parties recognized that the Relocation Directive applicable to the Complainant\u2019s claim is the \u201cRelocation Directive Effective until March 31, 2003 (Archived)\u201d, which came into effect in March 1993. The Relocation Directive, including the TDRA, is deemed part of the collective agreement governing the Complainant\u2019s terms and conditions of employment.\n[5] The Complainant seeks $19,406.62 as compensation for his TDRA claim. This request for TDRA includes various expenses claimed for travel and housing, and the Complainant provided evidence in support of those claims. The Respondent only takes issue with two of the expenses claimed by the Complainant: the cost of the lease liability for the rental of a second home in his new place of duty in Ottawa; and, the cost of three trips.\nII. Period of claim: 9 or 12 months? [6] Before getting into the issues above, I would like to clarify the period covered by the Complainant\u2019s claim for TDRA. The Complainant asks that his claim for TDRA cover a period of 12 months. It should be noted that the Complainant\u2019s period of maintaining dual residences lasted even longer than the 12 months he claims for.\n[7] Section 2.18.2 of the Relocation Directive establishes that the duration of TDRA is typically for 9 months. However, an exception can be found in section 2.18.4, which specifies that in cases of exceptional circumstances, the 9 month period can be extended to 12 months:\n2.18.4 In exceptional circumstances, if, as a result of factors outside the employee\u2019s control, the two residences must be maintained beyond the nine months, the deputy head or a senior delegated officer may approve a further maximum period of three months of assistance.\n[8] The Respondent, at paragraph 5 of its submissions on the present issue, says the Complainant had neither requested, nor did the Respondent agree to, an extension of the period of assistance from 9 to 12 months. However, later in its submissions at paragraph 17, the Respondent calculates the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to TDRA based on the assumption that it would have extended the TDRA period from 9 to 12 months; an assumption the Respondent describes as \u201c\u2026based on a retrospective and hypothetical assessment of whether HRSDC would have extended the assistance period if requested by the Complainant\u201d.\n[9] Despite these statements, the Respondent does not argue that the Complainant was ineligible for an extension under section 2.18.4 or that it would have refused such an extension. In fact, as mentioned above, the Respondent calculates the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to TDRA based on the assumption that it would have extended the TDRA period from 9 to 12 months. Furthermore, the Respondent states at paragraph 12 of its submissions that it only \u201c\u2026takes issue with two expenses claimed by the Complainant in respect of his travel and housing entitlements\u201d. The period of the claim is not one of the issues the Respondent says it takes issue with.\n[10] Therefore, I am satisfied that the period of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim should be calculated over 12 months, pursuant to section 2.18.4 of the Relocation Directive.\nIII. The cost of the lease liability [11] At the hearing, photocopies of the face of 13 cheques were filed by the Complainant as evidence of the payment of his rent for maintaining a second home in his new place of duty in Ottawa. The back of the cheques was not submitted. The first cheque, dated September 22, 2002, was for $900.00 with the memo \u201cOct. rent & last month\u201d. The twelve other cheques, dated the first of each month from November 1, 2002 to September 1, 2003, are for $450.00. The Respondent did not attack the probative value of said cheques.\n[12] According to the Respondent, the Complainant\u2019s housing entitlement includes, among other things, rent for a furnished bachelor apartment within the medium cost range in the new place of duty (section 2.12.5(a) of the Relocation Directive). Therefore, the Respondent says the Complainant is entitled to be reimbursed his rental expenses at a rate of $450 per month for twelve months.\n[13] However, the Complainant claims an additional $450 as the cost of his lease liability. He argues that his first cheque, in the amount of $900, included $450 to cover the rent for the first month (Oct. 2002) and $450 to cover for the rent of the last month, as mentioned at the bottom of the cheque. If for some reason, the Complainant needed to end his lease earlier than the term he had agreed to, the $450 deposit for last month\u2019s rent would have been kept by his landlord. The Complainant relies on section 2.12.5(d) of the Relocation Directive as authority for his entitlement to be reimbursed for this amount:\n(d) the costs of subletting or lease liability, when the employee was obliged to sign a lease for temporary accommodation. (These costs should be approved by management prior to the employee\u2019s signing the lease)\n[14] The Respondent objects to the reimbursement of this amount of $450 because it would be redundant (paragraph 17 of its response) since this amount would simply have been applied to cover the rent for the final month of the Complainant\u2019s tenancy.\n[15] It should be noted that the lease was not filed as evidence. During the hearing, it was not indicated if the lease was oral or written. The Respondent did not raise any objection regarding this matter. The Complainant speaks in the hypothetical at paragraph 11 of his reply submissions:\nPursuant to his lease agreement, if for some reason Mr. Hicks needed to end his lease earlier than the term that he had agreed to, he would have to pay $450 by way of forfeiture of his last month\u2019s rent deposit.\nBut during the hearing, the Complainant testified that the $450 deposited as a lease liability had been cashed, because the lease had been terminated earlier than agreed upon.\n[16] The Complainant also argues that the Respondent failed to provide guidance and assistance regarding the Relocation Directive and, therefore, the Tribunal should find the Complainant\u2019s interpretation of the Relocation Directive to be reasonable.\n[17] I therefore grant the Complainant\u2019s claim of $450 for the cost of the lease liability.\nIV. The cost of three trips [18] In total, the Complainant claims the cost of six trips: his initial move from home to Ottawa; two trips by his wife to come visit him; two trips to visit home; and, one final trip home to finalize his move. The cost of three of those trips is in dispute between the parties: the two trips by the Complainant\u2019s wife to visit him on November 7 to 10, 2002 ($717.85) and February 7 to 10, 2003 ($931.75); and, the Complainant\u2019s second trip home on April 17 to 21, 2003 ($939.70).\nThe Complainant cites section 2.13.2(c), (d) and (e) of the Relocation Directive as authority for his travel entitlements:\n2.13.2 Employees who are separated from dependants, and who are maintaining two households, shall be entitled to:\n[\u2026]\n(c) when the period of occupancy of the temporary second residence is longer than one month, for transportation expenses, including ground transportation, for one return trip to the former place of duty, to visit dependants living in the principal residence, on a weekend of the employee's choice during this interim period, work schedules permitting;\n(d) another trip may be authorized at the termination of this period, on an as-needed basis, to finalize selling or moving arrangements. In this latter case, the employee shall be required to use leave provisions for this travel when it cannot be arranged to correspond with days of rest;\n(e) a return trip to the former place of duty, in the event of emergency situations at home (e.g. illness) when, in the opinion of the employer or the attending physician, the employee should return home.\n[19] According to the Respondent, these provisions cover neither dependants\u2019 travel expenses nor claimants\u2019 travel expenses for more than one trip to visit dependants, subject to the exception in section 2.13.2(e). Therefore, the two trips taken by the Complainant\u2019s wife and the Complainant\u2019s second trip home are not covered by the TDRA.\n[20] The TDRA, specifically section 2.13.2, has no provision for the reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by the Complainant\u2019s wife. However, the Complainant points to the 2002 National Joint Council Travel Directive, which provisions address situations where an employee is on travel status. The Travel Directive outlines alternatives for claiming travel expenses, including travel by employees\u2019 dependants. According to the Complainant, this demonstrates that the claims for his wife could be permissible. He adds, the claim reflects a reasonable view of the expenses he was entitled to in the absence of guidance and information from the employer.\n[21] Again, the aim in making an order under subsection 53(2) of the Act is not to punish the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, but to eliminate - as much as possible - the discriminatory effects of the practice (see Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13). There is no ambiguity in section 2.13.2 of the Relocation Directive regarding travel by dependants requiring interpretation through other policies. Travel by the Complainant\u2019s spouse was not an expense that he was entitled to claim. To award the Complainant compensation for these expenses would result in the Complainant being put in a better position than he would have been in had the discrimination not occurred. Therefore, his claim for the two trips by his wife to visit him on November 7 to 10, 2002 ($717.85) and February 7 to 10, 2003 ($931.75) are rejected.\n[22] As for the Complainant\u2019s second trip home, at paragraph 14 of his reply, the Complainant indicated he considered section 2.13.2(c) allowed him to travel home once a month to be with his family. For its part, the Respondent says the section is limited to a total of one trip for the entire TDRA period, subject to sections 2.13.2(d) and (e).\n[23] To clarify this situation, I find it useful to read sections 2.13.2(c) and (d) together.\n[24] Section 2.13.2(c) mentions: \u201cWhen the period of occupancy of the temporary second residence is longer than one month...for one return trip\u201d. Section 2.13.2(d) mentions: \u201canother trip may be authorized at the termination of this period\u201d.\n[25] The reading of these two sections together illustrates that only one return trip is covered for the whole period of time when the employee has to maintain two households. The \u201cone month\u201d reference only establishes the eligibility criteria for being able to claim that one return trip. The reference to \u201canother trip\u201d in section 2.13.2(d) means that there cannot be more than one previous trip. Consequently, I do not interpret section 2.13.2(c) of the Relocation Directive as authorizing monthly trips home for the Complainant.\n[26] The Complainant says this interpretation is unreasonably narrow and unfair to employees who have been relocated, and is inconsistent with the letter and spirit of this provision, as demonstrated not only in the Relocation Directive but in other similar policies. For example, section 5.11.2(c) of the Relocation Directive provides for a return trip home every third weekend for employees on short-term relocations. The 2002 National Joint Council Travel Directive authorizes a trip every third weekend for employees on travel status for periods longer than one month. Also, according to the Complainant, the current Relocation Directive would authorize these trips.\n[27] Again, there is no ambiguity in section 2.13.2(c) of the Relocation Directive regarding the Complainant\u2019s entitlement to claim expenses for travel home. Pursuant to section 2.13.2(c) of the Relocation Directive, the Complainant was not entitled to claim the expense of more than one return trip home, unless the exceptions in sections 2.13.2(c) and (d) were applicable. The Relocation Directive makes a distinction between the entitlements of employees on TDRA and those on short-term relocations. The 2002 National Joint Council Travel Directive also provides for different entitlements for employees on travel status. However, in determining the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA, it is not for the Tribunal to question these differences in entitlements. Furthermore, while the current Relocation Directive may provide for different entitlements than its previous version, it is not the policy that was applicable to the Complainant in the circumstances of this case. Therefore, in my view, to award the Complainant compensation for his second trip home on April 17 to 21, 2003 would result in the Complainant being put in a better position than he would have been in had the discrimination not occurred.\n[28] As a result, the Complainant\u2019s claim for the two trips by his wife to visit him on November 7 to 10, 2002 ($717.85) and February 7 to 10, 2003 ($931.75); and, the Complainant\u2019s second trip home on April 17 to 21, 2003 ($939.70), are denied.\nV. Interest [29] At paragraph 112 of Hicks, the Tribunal awarded interest on the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim:\nIn working out the details of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim as directed above, the parties should also factor in an award of interest pursuant to the instructions in paragraph 111 above.\n[30] Paragraph 111 of Hicks provides:\nAs a result, I award interest on the compensation granted under paragraph 53(2)(e) and subsection 53(3) above. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank of Canada Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada; and, shall accrue from November 23, 2004, the date the Complainant\u2019s application for TDRA was denied, until the date of payment of the award of compensation.\n[31] Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019s order with regard to the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim shall include an award of interest from November 23, 2004 until the date the award is paid.\nVI. Order [32] As the Tribunal has denied the Complainant\u2019s claim for the cost three trips ($2,589.30), those amounts shall be deducted from the $19,406.62 the Complainant seeks as compensation for his TDRA claim. Therefore, the Tribunal calculates the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim to be $16,817.32.\n[33] As a result, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n(1) Pursuant to the reasons above, the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Hicks, and section 53(2)(c) of the Act, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay $16,817.32 to the Complainant as compensation for the TDRA expenses he incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(2) Pursuant to the reasons above, the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Hicks, and section 53(3) of the Act, order (1) above shall include an award of interest. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank of Canada Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada; and, shall accrue from November 23, 2004, the date the Complainant\u2019s application for TDRA was denied, until the date of payment of the award of compensation.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 22, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1751\/10611\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Hicks v.

Background [1] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) is faced with a motion by the respondent, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 (hereinafter I.L.W.U.), in which the respondent is seeking the dismissal of the complaints of the complainant, Leslie Palm, in the above-noted files.\n[2] In its motion, the respondent submits that the complainant\u2019s complaints against the respondent and the other respondents, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, would, in its opinion, constitute an abuse of process.\n[3] Moreover, the respondent alleges in its motion that the complainant allegedly altered and withheld certain documents which it believes demonstrated a pre-existing condition of depression.\n[4] The respondent alleges that, in so doing, the complainant allegedly committed fraud by altering said documents prior to submitting them. Furthermore, she deliberately withheld information and these documents. Thus, the complainant\u2019s negligent conduct misled the respondents and the Tribunal about her lost wages claim, which is entirely unsupported by the existing medical evidence.\n[5] The respondent also submits that the complainant\u2019s complaints must be dismissed without a hearing on the merits of the evidence, as said hearing would involve unnecessary and unjustified costs. The respondent claims that there is no disagreement in respect of the material facts of this case. In that regard, it argues that the complainant\u2019s complaints cannot be allowed legally.\n[6] Also in that regard, the respondent argues that the Federal Court of Appeal should have affirmed the authority of the Tribunal to dismiss complaints that would constitute an abuse of process, in which there is no dispute over the material aspect of the facts, and which would only involve questions of law.\n[7] In the summary of its motion, which contains approximately 181 paragraphs, the respondent states the following:\n\u00ab 178. In 2009, Ms. Palm filed separate complaints against each of the three remaining respondents plus her two employers. After an investigator concluded that Ms. Palm\u2019s complaints should be dismissed, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred all five complaints to the Tribunal. Since that time, however, the circumstances have fundamentally changed in the following ways.\na. Ms. Palm has entered into a binding settlement agreement with the employer and employer representative and has received very close to the maximum amount of compensation permitted by statute for pain and suffering from each. In addition to fulfilling the remedial purpose of the Code, this settlement has effectively precluded any finding of liability against the two employers. Because any finding of liability against the remaining respondents would necessarily entail a finding of liability against the employers \u2013 an impossibility in law- there can be no such finding.\nb. Even if a finding against the remaining respondents were legally possible, such a finding would be entirely unsupported by the facts. Neither the pleadings nor the extensive document disclosure process has revealed one scintilla of evidence that Ms. Palm suffered discrimination because of her gender \u2013 a fundamental prerequisite for a finding of liability under the Code.\nc. Ms. Palm has behaved in bad faith throughout the document disclosure process by withholding and fraudulently altering documents in an apparent effort to mislead the Tribunal and the Respondents about her pre-existing medical condition.\nd. Ms. Palm has repeatedly abused the Tribunal\u2019s processes in an effort to add to the expense and delay suffered by the Respondents.\n[8] It also adds as follows:\n179. The Respondents ask that the Tribunal dismiss Ms. Palm\u2019s three remaining complaints on the ground that their continued litigation constitute an abuse of process.\n180. In light of Ms. Palm\u2019s bad faith and abuse of process in the conduct of these complaints, the Respondents also ask that the Tribunal make an award of costs against Ms. Palm.\n181. The Respondents request an in-person hearing before the Tribunal for the purpose of making submissions.\nII. Response of the complainant [9] On March 3, 2014, the complainant submitted the following arguments against the respondent\u2019s motion.\n[10] The complainant argued that the respondents did not provide detailed and dated evidence that the complaints she filed were allegedly made in bad faith or on unwarranted grounds. The complainant indicates that she is of the opinion that detailed evidence in support of her complaints, along with the introduction of witnesses, would provide a better assessment of the events at issue.\n[11] The complainant also indicates that the respondents\u2019 arguments are untruthful and contain discrepancies and changes in the facts presented in their defence.\n[12] The complaints that the complainant filed arise from the fact that the respondent allegedly supported male employees who are the subject of these complaints in maintaining a known campaign of altering her hours of work in the course of obtaining additional work on weekends.\n[13] The complainant reiterated the fact that she had allegedly been the victim of harassment, intimidation, isolation and discrimination, and these reprehensible acts allegedly had an adverse effect on her. She refers the Tribunal to the investigation report issued by the \u201cBritish Columbia Maritime Employers Association\u201d (BCMEA) on the harassment investigation into those actions.\n[14] She also notes a discrepancy in the arguments presented by the respondent with respect to the hours worked contrary to the submissions made by the respondent.\n[15] She also made reference to the fact that Mr. Wilkinson had allegedly intentionally and fraudulently altered her hours of work. In that regard, her male co-workers allegedly continued to benefit financially from that fraud contrary to the provisions of section 9(1) and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[16] She categorically denies that Mr. Wilkinson was subjected to disciplinary sanctions for his conduct against her.\n[17] She submits that from the beginning of this case, she filed five separate complaints against the respondents and that a settlement agreement was reached in two of them.\n[18] The complainant alleges that the settlement agreements are not relevant in this case and she submits that said settlement agreements do not affect the liability of the other respondents for their conduct against her.\n[19] The complainant also categorically denies that she fraudulently altered certain documents she submitted and submits that the medical documents she produced contain information that she considers relevant.\n[20] She also submits that the allegation that there is no other valid remedy with respect to the other respondents on the basis of her current complaints would constitute an insult to the integrity of the Tribunal and she categorically denies the following proposition put forward by the respondent: \u201cthe employer is the only party that can provide any other meaningful remedies\u201d (see page 4 of the complainant\u2019s argument).\n[21] The complainant strongly disagrees with the respondents\u2019 proposition that the union is not able to control the conduct of the members in the workplace and she claims that she is aware of certain current and past contradictions in that statement.\n[22] The complainant denies that the amendments to the retaliation complaint she filed would constitute an abuse of process and she indicates that the Tribunal allowed her retaliation complaints based on the facts and submissions she provided.\n[23] Thus, the complainant claims that the amendments to the retaliation complaint constitute a separate complaint from the original complaints she previously filed, and that, therefore, any motion that may be allowed to dismiss her original complaints should not affect the retaliation complaints she filed.\n[24] With regard to some of the statements made by Mark Keserich, longshoreman and President of ILWU, Local 500, particularly with respect to the fact that the union allegedly took measures within its powers to identify and rectify situations involving a woman working in a male-controlled physical environment like that of longshoremen, the complainant indicates that no such measures were taken.\n[25] She submits that appropriate and reasonable measures could have been applied long before by the respondents to prevent complaints such as the ones she filed.\n[26] Finally, the complainant refers to page 8, paragraph 30 of the respondent\u2019s motion and submits that this is a clear harassment and intimidation tactic on the part of the respondents. She once again argues that it is a clear indication of the paucity of measures adequately implemented by the union to rectify the status quo and the mentality she described as being \u201cthe good old boys club\u201d.\nIII. Position of the Human Rights Commission (the Commission) [27] The Commission submits that the Tribunal may summarily dismiss a complaint if the Tribunal considers that the hearing of a complaint would constitute an abuse of process.\n[28] The Commission alleges that the Tribunal would error in law and would exceed its jurisdiction if it were to summarily dismiss a complaint that does not constitute an abuse of process. In that regard, the Commission cites Cremasco[1].\n[29] The Commission submits that in the federal human rights system, the jurisdiction to dismiss on a preliminary basis a complaint, which does not have a reasonable chance of success, rests with the Canadian Human Rights Commission and not the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, as shown in Harkin[2].\n[30] Based on the statutory provisions creating the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, the Tribunal does not have any inherent power to dismiss a complaint without a full hearing to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n[31] This situation would be different from the situation in British Columbia, where the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has the statutory authority to dismiss a complaint without a hearing if such a complaint is unlikely to have a reasonable chance of success (section 27(1)(c) of the British Columbia Human Rights Code).\n[32] The Commission refers to the provisions of section 41 of the Act, which states that the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that the complaint is trivial, frivolous, and vexatious or made in bad faith.\n[33] Similarly, under the provisions of section 49 of the Act, when a complaint is referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, it is because the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, a complaint is warranted.\n[34] Thus, from the moment the Commission refers a complaint to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is subject to a process that guarantees the hearing of a complaint on the merits.\n[35] When a motion to dismiss a complaint for abuse of process is filed with the Tribunal as a preliminary motion, the Tribunal must use its power to dismiss a complaint on such a motion with extreme caution and only in the clearest of cases (see the case law submitted by the Commission in that regard).[3]\nIV. Response of the respondent I.L.W.U. in respect of the responses of the complainant and the Commission [36] In its reply, the respondent reviewed the complainant\u2019s argument in respect of the complainant\u2019s response to its motion to dismiss.\n[37] It indicates that the complainant did not provide sufficient explanations regarding the allegations she made in her complaints against the respondents.\n[38] It maintains that the allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s complaints are not based on credible evidence and that the allegations remain vague despite the numerous opportunities she was given to clarify those allegations.\n[39] Moreover, the respondent maintains that the complainant did not provide sufficient explanations regarding the fact that she did not withhold or alter certain medical documents. The respondent submits that the complainant\u2019s conduct was deceitful. In addition, the complainant allegedly engaged in fraud, which required answers from the complainant about her conduct.\n[40] The respondent submits that the complainant allegedly misled and made false statements in her reply to the respondent\u2019s motion.\n[41] Furthermore, the respondent replied to the complainant\u2019s contentions regarding the Tribunal\u2019s confidentiality orders in respect of the disclosure of her medical reports, and also replied to the complainant\u2019s contentions regarding the privileged nature of the settlement agreement allegedly entered into by other respondents and the Commission. In that regard, the respondent submits that the discussions pertaining to that settlement agreement are not relevant to the proceedings currently pending in this case.\n[42] With respect to the allegations set out in the response of the Commission, the respondent referred to the provisions set out in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), [2012] FC 445 (\u201cFirst Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada) (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada)\u201d), where the decision of the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish was upheld by the Court of Appeal (2013 FCA 75).\n[43] Particularly, the respondent relied on the provisions set out in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, cited above, in which certain provisions of Cremasco and Harkin, cited above, were upheld (see paras. 138, 139 and 140 of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada).\n[44] Also in its rebuttal argument, the respondent referred to the fact that the authorities on abuse of process are applicable in cases where there is no dispute as to the facts and where the underlying issue is a pure question of law (para. 143 of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada).\n[45] In that regard, the respondent submits that the facts of this case are not in dispute, or that there is no conflict in the evidence, and that there is therefore a clear abuse of the process currently underway.\n[46] More specifically, the respondent notes that the complainant did not present any clear evidence of the discrimination alleged by the complainant on the basis of sex and in that respect, the complainant\u2019s allegations are too vague, unparticularized and unsupported by the allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s complaints. It also continues to maintain that the complainant altered and withheld certain documents and that by so doing she attempted to mislead the Tribunal.\n[47] In conclusion, the respondent submits that after six years of proceedings in this case, the complainant has not provided sufficient details and that this constitutes non-compliance with the Act. Also, the conduct of this case has shown that there is insufficient evidence to support the complainant\u2019s allegations and that, once again, the complainant has abused the process currently underway before the Tribunal and the parties\u2019 resources.\nV. The law [48] The Tribunal properly reviewed the motion to dismiss of the respondent, the response of the complainant and the Commission, and the reply of the respondent, as described in the first part of this decision.\n[49] However, after analyzing the relevant statutory provisions and the applicable case law, the Tribunal arrived at the decision not to allow the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for the reasons set out below.\n[50] In a recent decision of the Federal Court, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, the Federal Court had occasion to specifically address the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide issues that could result in the dismissal of a complaint without conducting a full hearing on the merits of the complaint that provides the parties with an opportunity to adduce viva voce evidence.\n[51] In that application for judicial review, the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish of the Federal Court reviewed the underlying principles applicable to such an issue.\n[52] In particular, Justice Mactavish addressed the question referred to her by the Commission that stated that the Act and the jurisprudence only allowed the Tribunal to dismiss a complaint without a full hearing on the merits in limited circumstances: that is, where there had been an abuse of process, including an undue delay in the process.\n[53] After reviewing the applicable provisions, namely, sections 48.9(1), 48.9(2), 49(1), 53(1), 50(1), 50(3)(c), 50(3)(e) of the Act, in her analysis, the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish refers to the fact that administrative tribunals are \u201cmasters of their own procedure\u201d (see para. 129 of the decision).\n[54] She also cites Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 560, where, at paragraph 16, the Supreme Court states:\n[16] In order to arrive at the correct interpretation of statutory provisions that are susceptible of different meanings, they must be examined in the setting in which they appear. We are dealing here with the powers of an administrative tribunal in relation to its procedures. As a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters in their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice. Adjournment of their proceedings is very much in their discretion.\n[55] The Tribunal enacted its own rules of procedure on May 3, 2004, which implies a distinction with respect to Prassad, noted above.\n[56] However, the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish states, with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s power as defined in the Act:\n[132] Nor is there anything in the Act or the Tribunal's Rules that would preclude the Tribunal from deciding such a motion, as long as it provides the parties with a \"full and ample opportunity\" to adduce the evidence necessary to decide the issue and to make submissions. The process followed by the Tribunal in relation to the hearing of the motion must also be fair, and the rules of natural justice must be respected.\n[133] The applicants say that the jurisprudence has established that the Tribunal may only dismiss a complaint on a preliminary motion in the clearest of cases, and then only where proceeding with the case would amount to an abuse of process. (Emphasis added.)\n[57] In emphasizing certain passages from Cremasco, decision written by the Honourable Mr. Justice von Finckenstein, she refers to the fact that, according to that decision, the Tribunal is not obliged to hold a full hearing in relation to every complaint that the Commission refers to it.\n[58] The Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish also cited certain passages from Harkin and Terry Buffett v. Canadian Forces (Buffet), particularly Buffet:\n[140] I do, however, understand the Government to agree with the statement in Buffet that the Tribunal's power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits should be exercised cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases: above at para. 39. I also agree with this statement. (Emphasis added.)\n[141] Most human rights cases are highly dependent on their individual facts and those facts are often hotly contested. As a result, many cases involve serious issues of credibility. While it is open to the Tribunal to receive evidence by way of affidavit, the more contested the facts and the greater the issues of credibility, the less appropriate this will be. Such cases may well require a full hearing on their merits, including viva voce evidence in chief and cross-examinations held in the presence of a Tribunal member. (Emphasis added.)\n[142] Similarly, where the issues of fact and law are complex and intermingled, it may well be more efficient to await the full hearing before ruling on the preliminary issue: see Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) v. Newfoundland (Department of Health), [1998] CanLII 18107 (NL CA), (1998), 164 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 251, 13 Admin. L.R. (3d) 142 at para. 21.\n[59] As indicated in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, the Tribunal \u201cwill have to consider the facts and issues raised by the complaint before it, and will have to identify the appropriate procedure to be followed so as to secure as informal and expeditious a hearing process as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d (see para. 148 of the decision).\n[60] Also, the Tribunal notes the words of the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish at paragraph 149 where she states:\n[149] However, the process adopted by the Tribunal will have to be fair, and will always have to afford each of the parties \"a full and ample opportunity to appear[,] ... present evidence and make representations\" in relation to the matter in dispute.\n[61] In light of the case law submitted, the Tribunal would also like to refer to the case law of the Supreme Court of Canada in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission) (Blencoe), [2000] S.C.J. No. 43.\n[62] In Blencoe, where the Supreme Court of Canada considered the abuse of process, it is stated:\n[120] In order to find an abuse of process, the court must be satisfied that, \"the damage to the public interest in the fairness of the administrative process should the proceeding go ahead would exceed the harm to the public interest in the enforcement of the legislation if the proceedings were halted\" (Brown and Evans, supra, at p. 9-68). According to L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. in Power, supra, at p. 616, \"abuse of process\" has been characterized in the jurisprudence as a process tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest of cases. In my opinion, this would apply equally to abuse of process in administrative proceedings. For there to be abuse of process, the proceedings must, in the words of L'Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J., be \"unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice\" (p. 616). \"Cases of this nature will be extremely rare\" (Power, supra, at p. 616). In the administrative context, there may be abuse of process where conduct is equally oppressive. (Emphasis added.)\n[63] In the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the respondent\u2019s motion, the parties present had the opportunity to submit their written arguments.\n[64] In this respect, the parties had an opportunity to express their views, and the Tribunal is of the opinion that the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness with respect to the respondent\u2019s motion were complied with. The Tribunal does not consider that a viva voce hearing is necessary to dispose of the respondent\u2019s motion for the following reasons.\n[65] The Tribunal also reviewed the complainant\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars, which contains the facts alleged by both parties, as well as a related amendment to add a reprisal complaint under the provisions of section 14.1 of the Act.\n[66] The Tribunal noted that there is a significant discrepancy between the allegations in the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss and those in the response of the complainant in respect of the facts underlying and relating to the complaints filed by the complainant against the respondents.\n[67] As such, there is no consensus between the parties regarding the facts alleged by both sides, and therefore, I do not find that this is one of the clearest of cases as suggested by the case law to dismiss a complaint on a preliminary motion, such as the one of the respondent (see paragraphs 58 and 62 above).\n[68] Without limiting the seriousness of the allegations and criticisms contained in the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss in order to conclude, according to the respondent\u2019s submissions, that there is an abuse of process, the Tribunal finds that to dispose of this case based on this motion without giving the complainant an opportunity to fully and completely present her evidence with respect to the complaints she filed against the respondents would be significantly detrimental to the complainant\u2019s rights in this case.\n[69] Indeed, the respondent\u2019s very detailed motion alleges a series of facts that are far from being admitted by the complainant, as evidenced by the response of the complainant in that regard.\n[70] In light of the foregoing, and having regard to the fact that the Tribunal is the master of its own procedure as set out in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, noted above, the Tribunal is of the view that a hearing on the merits would provide better compliance with the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness with respect to the complaints made by the complainant and would certainly better serve the interests of justice.\n[71] Indeed, given the complexity of the respondent\u2019s motion and the responses of the other parties as mentioned in the first part of this decision and the parties\u2019 amended Statements of Particulars, these proceedings indicate to the Tribunal that they are certainly not proceedings that would be unfair \u201cto the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice\u201d (see Blencoe, supra, para. 120).\n[72] A fortiori, I adopt the comments of the Honourable Madam Justice Mactavish in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, where she states at paragraph 141 that \u201cthe more contested the facts and the greater the issues of credibility, the less appropriate this will be. Such cases may well require a full hearing on their merits, including viva voce evidence in chief and cross-examinations held in the presence of a Tribunal member\u201d.\n[73] It is therefore this attitude that I plan to adopt in this case and if, in light of the evidence presented by the complainant to establish a prima facie case for its complaints against the respondents, said evidence was not established, in the respondents\u2019 view, it will be up to the respondents to resubmit its motion for dismissal or non-suit, at which time, the Tribunal will dispose of the new motion, but within a framework which will most certainly allow all parties to clearly establish the necessary evidence with respect to their submissions in accordance with the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[74] Consequently, I find that the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is premature, having regard to all the circumstances of this case, and it is therefore dismissed for all legal purposes.\nVI. Conclusion [75] For the reasons given above, the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the complainant\u2019s complaints is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 25, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210 and T1627\/17310\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Palm v.

Background 1\nII. Facts 1\nIII. Applicant\u2019s position 4\nIV. Respondent\u2019s position 6\nV. Decision 7\nVI. Conclusion 12\nI. Background\n[1] In a motion dated January 16, 2013, to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal), by way of a letter, the representative of the complainant, Marie Mache\u2011Rameau, asked the Tribunal to convene the parties to determine a question of narrow interpretation on the application of the memorandum of understanding reached between the parties, that is, the complainant, Marie Mache\u2011Rameau and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), as well as the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission), in an agreement signed on November 29, 2006.\n[2] The Tribunal held a hearing on the motion made by Marie Mache-Rameau\u2019s representative on August 8, 2014, to the Tribunal in Ottawa, but in the absence of the Commission, which informed the parties on June 10, 2014, that it would not make any submissions in relation to the complainant\u2019s motion.\nII. Facts\n[3] On August 1, 2003, the complainant, Marie Mache-Rameau, filed a complaint with the Commission, a complaint alleging discriminatory practice in an employment situation and workplace harassment within CIDA, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act).\n[4] As stipulated in the Tribunal\u2019s internal procedures, the Tribunal then proposed, if agreed to by all parties, that the parties work towards a settlement through mediation.\n[5] A first mediation session was therefore held between the parties on September 6, 2006, before a member of the Tribunal, and said mediation session was scheduled to resume on November 29, 2006.\n[6] At that time, a settlement was reached in the mediation process and the proceedings in the case were adjourned indeterminately (see the letter dated December 8, 2006, by the Registry Operations Manager, Gwen Zappa).\n[7] On January 16, 2007, a letter from the Commission addressed to the Tribunal registry officer was sent to the Tribunal stating that the memorandum of understanding pertaining to above\u2011mentioned file [translation] \u201chad been approved by the Commission under subsection 48(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\u201d\n[8] The Tribunal was then required to issue a notice of discontinuance in the case (see the Commission\u2019s letter dated January 16, 2007).\n[9] On January 17, 2007, the Tribunal\u2019s Director of Registry Operations, Guy Gr\u00e9goire, further to the letter from Ikram Warsame dated January 16, 2007, informed counsel for the Commission that he was stopping the proceedings and closing the file in the matter.\n[10] On June 23, 2010, in a letter signed by Fran\u00e7ois Lumbu, a lawyer with the Commission, the Commission made a request to the Tribunal for the services of a Tribunal member to chair a mediation session in this case.\n[11] The request in question made reference to the fact that the parties did not agree on the interpretation of article 6 of the memorandum of understanding.\n[12] Said letter also made reference to the fact that by article 16 of the memorandum, the parties were committed to return to mediation to renegotiate the issues (see the letter dated June 23, 2010, 3rd paragraph).\n[13] As evidenced by said letter, the Commission was not requesting that the Tribunal file be reopened. Instead, the Commission was stating that they were prepared to discuss the terms in order to benefit from the Tribunal\u2019s services, complimentary or not, to proceed with mediation in the case.\n[14] On September 24, 2010, the Tribunal\u2019s Director of Registry Operations responded that the Tribunal was not willing to offer the required service. More specifically, the Tribunal reported the following situation:\n[translation]\nWe find that the file was closed on January 17, 2007, that the Member (Member Hadjis) who attended the prior mediation in the file completed his term with the Tribunal and that the Commission approved a settlement in the matter under section 48 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Consequently, we find that it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to participate in the mediation considering the above-mentioned circumstances. (See the letter dated September 24, 2010.)\n[15] Additionally, in a letter dated October 24, 2010, the respondent herein, that is, CIDA, stated that it was still in agreement with using a mediator to define the application of article 6 of the signed memorandum of understanding between the parties dated November 29, 2006.\n[16] At the hearing of the motion, the parties admitted that additional mediation was held between the parties, but it was unsuccessful in respect of deciding the interpretation of the relevant article 6.\n[17] On May 29, 2012, an order was issued by the Honourable Justice Yvon Pinard of the Federal Court, and it reads as follows:\n[translation]\nThe settlement between Marie Mache-Rameau and the Canadian International Development Agency approved by the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated November 29, 2006, is made an order of the Federal Court.\n[18] On November 2, 2012, another decision of the Federal Court was rendered by the Honourable Justice Richard Boivin regarding a motion filed by the applicant, Marie Mache\u2011Rameau, under section 466 of the Federal Courts Rules to make a show cause order against the President of CIDA on the basis that the President was allegedly in contempt of court.\n[19] In that regard, it is helpful to reproduce paragraph 19 of said decision, which reads as follows:\nHaving heard the parties, the Court must observe that a difference in interpretation was raised and that it is therefore not clear what the parties must do to comply. In a similar scenario, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that \u201c[i]t must be clear on the face of the order what is required for compliance\u201d (Telecommunications Workers Union v Telus Mobility, 2004 FCA 59 at paragraph 4, [2004] FCJ no 273 (QL)), which is not the case here. Moreover, Justice Hansen of this Court has noted that \u201cthe fact that the Order is ambiguous precludes a finding of contempt . . .\u201d and that an alleged contemnor \u201cis entitled to the most favourable interpretation\u201d (Sherman v Canada (Customs and Revenue Agency), 2006 FC 1121 at paragraphs 29 and 14, [2006] FCJ no 1413 (QL)).\n[20] Consequently, the Honourable Justice Boivin found that the complainant did not discharge her burden of making a prima facie case, and the complainant\u2019s motion was therefore dismissed.\n[21] Following that judgment, the complainant proceeded with the present motion, that is, a letter from her counsel dated January 16, 2013, for the Tribunal to reconsider this case to rule on an issue of interpretation that arose in the context of interpreting article 6 of the memorandum, which was not completed or approved by the Commission according to the complainant.\nIII. Applicant\u2019s position\n[22] In her written arguments dated May 26, 2014, reproduced at the hearing on August 8, the complainant raised three main arguments that apparently define the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to reconsider the interpretation of the memorandum of understanding based on three alleged reasons:\n(1) There is a statutory presumption in the circumstances of this case that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on the question in this case;\n(2) The challenge to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by the respondent is unjust and inequitable and must fail;\n(3) The memorandum of understanding and its approval by the Commission triggers public interest, which requires the intervention of the Tribunal and triggers the statutory prerequisites to the exercise of its jurisdiction (see para 1, written arguments of the applicant).\n[23] At the hearing, the complainant\u2019s representative stated that the Tribunal is not functus officio, and then the complainant\u2019s representative asked the Tribunal to define its jurisdiction under the Act to decide the issue.\n[24] The complainant\u2019s representative also reproduced parts of the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Berberi (Attorney General of Canada and the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Detra Berberi, 2013 FC 921), rendered by the Honourable Justice O\u2019Keefe.\n[25] That decision was an application for judicial review of a remedy decision, relating to an earlier decision of the Tribunal, in which it had been decided that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to convene a hearing regarding the implementation of a remedial offer referred to in an earlier decision.\n[26] In that decision by the Tribunal, rendered on December 29, 2011, (Attorney General of Canada and the Canadian Human Rights Commission and Detra Berberi, (2011 CHRT 2) (Berberi)), by Tribunal Chairperson Shirish P. Chotalia, counsel drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to paragraph 21 of said decision, which reads as follows:\nThe application of the functus officio principle to administrative tribunals must be flexible and not overly formalistic (see Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848 at para 21).\n[27] Thus, relying on that principle as stated in the Tribunal\u2019s decision, the complainant\u2019s representative stated that flexibility is necessary given that the Tribunal is an administrative tribunal.\n[28] Also, in reference to the Federal Court\u2019s decision dated August 30, 2013, by the Honourable Justice O\u2019Keefe, Berberi, counsel for the complainant reiterated the argument set out in paragraph 21 of that decision that the doctrine of functus officio protects the principle of finality in judicial and administrative decision making.\n[29] Regarding the second point, that is, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Act to deal with this matter, counsel for the complainant stated that the parties attempted to resume mediation under article 16 of the agreement, which allowed for that process, but that mediation failed, and that thereafter, the respondent refused to continue said mediation.\n[30] In his arguments, counsel for the complainant stated that the Tribunal has a residual power to intervene in this case and that the origin of that residual power can be found in part in the Tribunal\u2019s decision to which I referred above, that is, the decision dated December 29, 2011, by Shirish P. Chotalia, the Tribunal Chairperson at the time (2011 CHRT 23).\n[31] Finally, counsel for the complainant submitted that the interests of justice justify the intervention of the Tribunal given that should it fail to do so and if the Tribunal is the only avenue for settling the matter, the complainant would be without recourse, resulting in her having to start the whole process over again, which would be contrary to the overall scheme of the Act.\nIV. Respondent\u2019s position\n[32] In his arguments, counsel for the respondent told the Tribunal that the functus officio doctrine does not apply in this case.\n[33] He also stated that the signed agreement between the parties dated November 29, 2006, does not allow the Tribunal to reconsider this case.\n[34] In this regard, he referred to article 11 of the agreement, which states that the settlement between the parties was reached without prejudice to either party and without an admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the respondent with respect to the allegations made in the complaint of the complainant.\n[35] Similarly, he stated that the Tribunal did not render a decision in this case and that in this regard, in reference to the functus officio doctrine, the absence of a decision by the Tribunal means that the functus officio doctrine cannot apply.\n[36] Regarding the origin of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, counsel for the respondent reproduced paragraph 23 of Bell Canada v. CTEA [2003] 1 S.C.R. 884 (Bell), in which the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following:\nThe main function of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission.\n[37] In addition, counsel for the respondent referred to a decision by the Tribunal dated July 29, 2009, in Pawal Kowalski and Canadian Human Rights Commission (Kowalski) and Ryder Integrated Logistics (2009 CHRT 22), a decision by Member Athanasios D. Hadjis, where the following is stated in paragraph 7:\n7. The Tribunal's jurisdiction to conduct inquiries into complaints is derived from s. 49 of the Act, pursuant to which the Tribunal Chairperson must institute an inquiry into a complaint upon receipt of a request from the Commission (s. 49(2)). The scope of Tribunal inquiries is thus limited to the matters arising from the complaints accompanying such requests.\n[38] In his arguments, counsel for the respondent found that there is no such complaint before the Tribunal at this time, and that there is no remedy to reinterpret like there was in the Federal Court decision in Berberi, supra.\n[39] Furthermore, counsel for the respondent reiterated the decision in Powell v. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (2008 CHRT 43), where the same member, that is, Member Athanasios D. Hadjis, dismissed a motion by respondent UPS to confirm an alleged settlement bringing the case before the Tribunal to a close.\n[40] In that decision, given that the human rights complaint hearing had not yet commenced and given the absence of Commission approval of an alleged settlement, the complaint could not be said to have been settled.\n[41] In this case, the parties confirmed the definitive nature of the signed agreement between them because it was approved by the Commission and also, the signed agreement between the parties dated November 29, 2006, in this case was also made an order of the Federal Court (see article 15 of the agreement).\n[42] Consequently, counsel for the respondent is asking the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over the motion filed by the complainant.\nV. Decision\n[43] The Tribunal has properly reviewed this file and has taken into account the written and verbal submissions of the parties and has come to the conclusion that it cannot allow the complainant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this case.\n[44] Consequently, the Tribunal will dismiss the complainant\u2019s motion for the following reasons.\n[45] For a better understanding of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, I will refer to the following provisions of the Act, the first being the following:\nSection 44. (3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission\n(a) may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry under section 49 into the complaint to which the report relates if the Commission is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and\n(ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subsection (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e); or\n(b) shall dismiss the complaint to which the report relates if it is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted, or\n(ii) that the complaint should be dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e).\n[46] Similarly, I cite the provisions of section 48 of the Act regarding a settlement in a case:\nSection 48. (1) When, at any stage after the filing of a complaint and before the commencement of a hearing before a Human Rights Tribunal in respect thereof, a settlement is agreed on by the parties, the terms of the settlement shall be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection.\n(2) If the Commission approves or rejects the terms of a settlement referred to in subsection (1), it shall so certify and notify the parties.\n(3) A settlement approved under this section may, for the purpose of enforcement, be made an order of the Federal Court on application to that Court by the Commission or a party to the settlement.\n[47] As well, it is helpful to reproduce section 49 of the Act with respect to inquiries into complaints:\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint, but the Chairperson may assign a panel of three members if he or she considers that the complexity of the complaint requires the inquiry to be conducted by three members.\n[48] With deference to the opinion expressed by counsel for the complainant, the Tribunal is effectively functus officio in this case.\n[49] Thus, the Tribunal finds that no relevant decision was rendered on the merits of the complaint made by the complainant.\n[50] More specifically, there was a settlement between the parties and said settlement was approved by the Commission on November 19, 2006, which the Commission then informed the Tribunal of. Subsequently, the Tribunal closed its file on January 17, 2007.\n[51] Following the settlement in this case and the subsequent closing of the file by the Tribunal, the Commission did not request that such file be reopened before the Tribunal (see the letter dated June 23, 2010).\n[52] As stated above in reference to the arguments by the respondent\u2019s representative at the hearing on August 8, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction derives from complaints that are referred to it by the Commission (see Bell Canada, supra). Similarly, I also refer to the passage that I noted in Kowalski, also supra, which itself refers to inquiries into complaints as stated in section 49 of the Act.\n[53] At the time when the complainant brought her motion as well as when the parties\u2019 arguments were heard on August 8, 2014, the Tribunal did not have any such complaint before it from the Commission.\n[54] That argument alone seems to me to be fatal to the continuation of the complainant\u2019s motion for the Tribunal to reconsider the complainant\u2019s file pursuant to the motion that she filed on January 16, 2013.\n[55] But there is more. The Tribunal notes that in the signed memorandum of understanding between the parties dated November 29, 2006, a memorandum of understanding subsequently approved by the Commission, no provision maintained the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case in any manner.\n[56] To the contrary, the reference to the fact that the parties agreed that the settlement be made an order of the Federal Court in accordance with subsection 48(3) of the Act clearly suggests to me that the Tribunal became functus officio and that any subsequent decision belongs to the Federal Court for the resolution of any disagreement concerning that agreement.\n[57] Similarly, at article 16 of the memorandum of understanding, the same provisions are reiterated with regards to the possibility of a disagreement giving rise to the need to resume mediation to renegotiate the issues. Thus, that provision indicates that the parties agreed that any modification would be submitted for approval to the Commission in accordance with section 48 of the Act and would be binding in Federal Court according to the same terms of the initial settlement.\n[58] I have no choice but to interpret that provision as definitively barring any jurisdiction of the Tribunal with respect to that memorandum of understanding, which identified the Federal Court as being the new applicable legal forum for resolving any disagreement regarding the signed memorandum of understanding between the parties.\n[59] Consequently, the letter by the registry operations manager dated January 17, 2007, that confirmed the end of the proceedings and the closing of the Tribunal\u2019s file in this case, and also the signed memorandum of understanding between the parties dated November 29, 2006, which became an order of the Federal Court, does not allow for any possibility of the Tribunal retaining any jurisdiction over the resolution of any disagreement on the interpretation of the memorandum of understanding.\n[60] Considering the relevant statutory provisions, and more specifically subsection 48(1) and section 49 of the Act, to which I referred above, the absence of a current complaint before the Tribunal, as well as the absence of relevant provisions in the memorandum of understanding enabling the Tribunal to retain its jurisdiction, I do not find that the Tribunal may intervene further to the request made by the complainant for the resolution of all differences pertaining to the agreement entered into by the parties on November 29, 2006.\n[61] As stated above, the parties designated the Federal Court as the appropriate legal forum for resolving any disagreements that may arise from the memorandum of understanding by stating in that same memorandum of understanding that the settlement would be made an order of the Federal Court in accordance with subsection 48(3) of the Act.\n[62] Regarding the argument that it is in public interest that the Tribunal intervene again, I find that counsel for the complainant did not provide any relevant authority to support that argument in the context of this case, where there is no complaint that could be brought before the Tribunal, contrary to all of the decisions that he referred to in his arguments.\n[63] Furthermore, I find that the Commission, normally guarantor of public interest, did not intervene in the debates to make such argument.\n[64] In my opinion, the above-stated legal provisions are sufficient to respond to that argument in the context of Parliament\u2019s intention to define the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, I reiterate and adopt the passage from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Bell, which I cited in paragraph 36, above, as well as that from the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Kowalski, at paragraph 37 of this decision.\n[65] Consequently, and in light of the foregoing, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to reconsider the signed memorandum of understanding between the parties dated November 29, 2006.\nVI. Conclusion\n[66] For all of these reasons, the complainant\u2019s motion is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 26, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT1148\/3006\nStyle of Cause:\nMarie Mache-Rameau c.

Ulyatt\nDate: August 29, 2014\nCitation: 2014 CHRT 27\n[1] The Complainant, John Francis Zieger, filed a complaint against the Respondent, Osborne Trucking Ltd., on January 12, 2012, alleging discrimination by the Respondent, his employer, under Section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cthe CHRA\u201d).\n[2] The Complainant was not represented by counsel throughout these proceedings, and specifically not represented at the hearing which took place in Regina, Saskatchewan on January 20, 2014 and January 21, 2014.\n[3] The Respondent, who was initially self-represented, produced Wayne Osborne, the principal of the corporation, at the hearing. However, the Respondent thereafter retained the law firm of McDougall Gauley LLP as its lawyers, who in fact prepared the Statement of Particulars and attended at the hearing.\n[4] At the outset of the hearing, the Complainant failed to produce the documentation that he had been advised was required to be filed with the Tribunal. The Tribunal adjourned the matter for a number of hours in order to allow the Complainant to attend at his residence to obtain the requisite documentation.\n[5] At the commencement of the hearing, it became apparent that the Complainant was unfocused and having extreme difficulty in presenting his evidence. It was agreed that the Complainant\u2019s wife, Bobbie Zieger, who was initially scheduled to be a witness, would act as his advocate, would conduct direct examination of the Complainant and cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s witness, and present closing arguments. The Tribunal was quite clear in its advice to the Complainant and Mrs. Zieger that, since Mrs. Zieger was playing such an active role, she could not then be a witness.\n[6] The hearing adjourned briefly and, upon return, the Complainant and Mrs. Zieger agreed to proceed on the understanding that Mrs. Zieger would not give evidence.\n[7] The Complainant alleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of a medical disability caused during the course of his employment with the Respondent. The disability complained of was a soft tissue injury of the lower back.\n[8] The Respondent is a small trucking company located in White City, Saskatchewan. The Respondent employs approximately five other drivers and operates principally in Saskatchewan, although it does make periodic deliveries outside the Province.\n[9] The Complainant had previously been employed by the Respondent in October and November of 2010. However, he had resigned his position and was rehired on February 20, 2011 as a Class 1A Truck Driver.\n[10] The Respondent\u2019s principal contract is with Sysco Foods Ltd., which contracts with the Respondent for the delivery of food products to various locations in Regina and Saskatoon, as well as to other sites in Saskatchewan and, on occasion, outside the Province.\n[11] The Complainant testified that on June 14, 2011, he \u201cwrenched\u201d his back while unloading pallets off the truck. His evidence was that he attended immediately to the hospital in Moose Jaw due to muscle spasms, at which time he received treatment. The Complainant sent text messages to the Respondent on June 14, 2011, one at 6:20:06 a.m., stating \u201cThanks Wayne, my back is fucked. I\u2019m at the hospital\u201d.\n[12] A number of texts were sent from the Respondent to the Complainant, none of which made inquiries as to the Complainant\u2019s condition. However, on June 14, 2011 at 7:48:50 a.m., the Complainant responded to a request as to his location by stating, \u201cStill at the hospital. It takes forever\u201d.\n[13] On June 14, 2011 at 7:34:29 p.m., the Complainant texted the Respondent the following message, \u201cSorry the Doc gave me a shot and I have been sleeping ever since. He said that I had a torn muscle, and laid me on my ass for five days\u201d.\n[14] The next text produced was from the Respondent to the Complainant on June 20, 2011, 4:35:39 p.m. stating, \u201cI need you to work tomorrow. To go to Saskatoon and drop trailer then back home.\u201d\n[15] The medical evidence, being the Physician\u2019s Initial Report dated June 14, 2011 (Exhibit C-4), identifies the injury as muscle spasms and states:\n\u201cEffects of the injury may affect activity for 5 days\u201d.\n[16] The evidence discloses that the Complainant\u2019s return to employment with the Respondent in February 2011 was marred by disagreements between himself and Wayne Osborne. The Complainant felt he did not receive the support from his employer in a number of ways, including not being provided an assistant, always being assigned routes designed for one driver and the Respondent not providing modified duties.\n[17] There was also evidence that, on one occasion, the Complainant hired his son as a helper and paid him out of his own pocket. The Respondent contradicted this allegation by showing that he had in fact paid the Complainant directly for his son\u2019s wages.\n[18] The Complainant also claims that Sysco, the Respondent\u2019s principal client, had sabotaged his loads in an effort to discredit him and cause him further discomfort.\n[19] The evidence is unclear as to when the Complainant returned to work. In his complaint, the Complainant states that the Respondent\u2019s \u201c\u2026text message is telling me I need to work Thursday, June 16, 2011\u201d. The text message in the evidence dated June 20, 2011, 4:35 p.m. reads, \u201cI need you to work tomorrow to go to Saskatoon and drop\u201d.\n[20] The Complainant alleges that he was off work until June 24, 2011; the Respondent alleges he returned to work on June 17, 2011; and the medical report of Dr. Sanderson (Exhibit C-4) indicates that the Complainant advised that he had returned to work on June 23, 2011.\n[21] Wayne Osborne maintained his own time log on a calendar, with the following entries relating to the Complainant:\nTuesday, June 14, 2011, \u201cJohn drop said he hurt his back\u201d;\nWednesday, June 15, 2011, \u201cJohn off\u201d;\nThursday, June 16, 2011, \u201cJohn Off\u201d;\nFriday, June 17, 2011, \u201cJohn ROC\u201d;\nSaturday, June 18, 2011, No entries re: John;\nSunday, June 19, 2011, No entries re: John;\nMonday, June 20, 2011, \u201cJohn no show off\u201d;\nTuesday, June 21, 2011, \u201cJohn SK00N\u201d;\nWednesday, June 22, 2011, \u201cJohn ROC\u201d;\nThursday, June 23, 2011, \u201cJohn ASS\u201d;\nFriday, June 24, 2011, \u201cJohn off & quit\u201d.\n[22] Issues with the Complainant and the Respondent escalated on June 24, 2011 when the Respondent advised the Complainant that there was a delay of payment by its principal client, Sysco, and as a result the payroll for June 24, 2011 would be delayed until Monday, June 27, 2011.\n[23] The Complainant had tried cashing his cheques twice, and a series of emails between the parties evidenced heightened tension. The Respondent had contacted the Complainant by text indicating that he should cash his cheque. On June 24, 2011, matters came to a head between the Complainant, the Respondent and the Complainant\u2019s wife. The Complainant was of the opinion that he was being picked on for having been injured and the Respondent had expressed a culmination of frustrations with the Complainant. The Complainant asserts that he was fired by the Respondent and the Respondent asserts that the Complainant quit.\n[24] The Respondent has provided pay stubs for the pay period of June 18, 2011 to July 1, 2011, evidencing payment for three days. This would coincide with payment for June 21, 22, and 23 in the employer\u2019s log.\n[25] On examination, dealing with the issue of the Respondent\u2019s knowledge of the Complainant\u2019s injury, Wayne Osborne testified, \u201cI was not aware that he (John) was unable to work\u2026He did all job duties.\u201d\n[26] The Complainant argues that his position that he was terminated is substantiated by the decision of the HRSDC Labour Program that awarded him pay in lieu of Notice (Exhibit C-12). The Respondent dismisses same as he did not pay attention to the procedure.\n[27] The Complainant throughout the hearing made it quite clear that he was not seeking any lost wages or reimbursement for expenses, but simply wanted an apology and that the Respondent be held responsible for his actions. The Complainant argued that he was \u201crobbed of his life\u201d and went from a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d to a \u201cdisabled person\u201d.\n[28] The Complainant is seeking damages under Section 53(2) of the Act.\n[29] The Respondent\u2019s counsel submitted a brief on law dealing with the issues of voluntary resignation, repudiation of the employment agreement and a failure to mitigate.\n[30] The Tribunal does not have to address the issue of failure to mitigate as the Complainant has not claimed lost wages. The Complainant did ultimately receive Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits.\n[31] In the present circumstances, in view of the failure of the Respondent to pay the Complainant as required, and in light of the HRSDC Labour Program\u2019s Decision, the Tribunal would find that the Respondent had terminated the Complainant\u2019s employment.\n[32] The principal issue in the present case is the issue of disability and the Respondent\u2019s knowledge of same.\n[33] The issue of disability is a key criterion that the Complainant must satisfy. In order to be successful under Section 7(a) of the CHRA, the Complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In Chaudhary v. Smoother Movers, (2013) CHRT 15 (CanLII), the Tribunal at paragraph 33 stated as follows:\n(33) The Complainant in proceedings before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\u201d\n(Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons Sears, (1985) CanLII 18 (SCC), (1985) 2 SCR 536 at para.28).\n(35) Paragraph 7(a) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In complaints under subsection 7(a), the Complainant must establish a link between a prohibited ground of discrimination and the employer\u2019s decision to refuse to employ or continue to employ him or her. (see Roopnarine v. Bank of Montreal, (2010) CHRT 5 (CanLII), 2010 CHRT 5 at para.49). That said, discrimination does not need to be the only reason for the decision. It is sufficient that discrimination be one factor in the decision.(See Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., (1990) F.C.J. No. 419 (F.C.A.) (Q.L.); and Khiamal v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), (2009) FC 495 (CanLII), 2009 FC 495 at para. 61).\n[34] In the present case, the alleged prohibited ground is disability. The question of what constitutes a disability was canvassed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Desormeaux v. Ottawa (City), (2005) FCA 311 at paragraph 15, wherein the Court stated:\nAs the Supreme Court established in Granovsky v. Canada, (2000) SCC 29 (CanLII) (2000) 1 S.C.R. 703 at para.34 and in City of Montreal (supra) at para. 71, disability in a legal sense consists of physical or mental impairment which results in a functional limitation or is associated with a perception of impairment.\n[35] To be successful, the Complainant must first establish on a prima facie basis:\n(1) that he suffered from a disability; and\n(2) that his disability played a role in the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate his employment, contrary to Section 7(a) of the CHRA.\n[36] In the present case, the Complainant has established that he suffered from a disability. However, he has failed to establish that the Respondent was aware of his disability and that it was based in part or played a role in his termination.\n[37] The text message of June 14, 2011 from the Complainant to the Respondent indicated that he was to be off work for five days. This evidence was corroborated by the medical report, dated June 14, 2011, that the injury may affect activity for five days.\n[38] The Respondent\u2019s time logs and pay stubs indicate that the Complainant was paid for three days in the pay period of June 18, 2011 to July 1, 2011. This in fact corresponds with the Respondent\u2019s time log. Furthermore, the medical report signed by Dr. Sanderson states \u201cHe took a few days off and then went back to work on 23\/6.\u201d\n[39] The Complainant\u2019s evidence before the Tribunal was inadequate. The Complainant failed to produce any evidence that the Respondent knew or ought to have known that he was disabled on June 24, 2011. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary.\n[40] The Respondent\u2019s counsel demonstrated a willingness to allow Mrs. Zieger and the Complainant to go beyond what normally would be allowed at a hearing and in argument.\n[41] In the present circumstances, the Complainant has failed to establish that his termination was based upon a discriminatory ground pursuant to Section 7 CHRA.\nORDER [42] For the foregoing reasons, I hereby order that the complaint be dismissed.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Complaint & Motion [1] The Complainant, Mr. Clayton Starblanket, is a federal prisoner in the custody of Correctional Services Canada (\u201cCSC\u201d), the Respondent in this complaint. The Complainant alleges he suffers from multiple mental disabilities. He claims the Respondent has pursued policies or practices that are discriminatory to prisoners with mental disabilities and that it does not adequately accommodate their needs. On this basis, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint on March 19, 2010, alleging the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the CHRA], on the basis of his disability.\n[2] On December 1, 2011, pursuant to section 49 of the CHRA, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry. The Commission is participating at the hearing representing the public interest and alleges the Respondent has engaged in systemic discrimination towards prisoners with mental disabilities.\n[3] On May 30, 2014, the Commission filed a motion to determine the scope of the complaint before the Tribunal as it is a contentious issue between the parties. It also requests further disclosure from the Respondent.\n[4] In support of its motion, on September 12, 2014, the Commission also sought leave to file a public fatality inquiry report related to the death of an inmate, as an additional exhibit to its motion.\n[5] The Commission\u2019s motion, and its corresponding request for leave to file an additional exhibit to this motion, is the subject of the present ruling.\nII. Analysis [6] The Commission\u2019s motion asks the Respondent to disclose certain documents from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present. In the same vein, it requests that the Tribunal affirm that the period at issue in the complaint is from November 1998 to present: the entire period of the Complainant\u2019s federal incarcerations.\n[7] In addition, the Commission requests the disclosure of:\n\u2022 additional materials mentioned in documents already disclosed, but which have not been disclosed;\n\u2022 unredacted versions of certain documents already disclosed;\n\u2022 complete and legible versions of certain documents already disclosed; and,\n\u2022 statistical information on segregated inmates throughout the period at issue.\n[8] Finally, the Commission requests an order requiring the Respondent to provide electronic versions of all disclosure materials.\n[9] The Complainant supports the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure and adopts all the arguments it has put forth.\nA. Scope of the complaint & documents from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present [10] According to the Commission, the Complainant is presently serving his second federal sentence. The first occurred from November 1998 to June 2002. His current federal incarceration began in July 2003 and is ongoing. The Commission submits that, while the complaint focuses on allegations related to the Complainant\u2019s incarceration during early 2010, an examination of the materials disclosed so far indicates that the issues complained of also occurred during his first federal incarceration and continue to this day. According to the Commission, the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration also included incidents of self-harm and attempted suicide by the Complainant; the use of segregation by the Respondent towards the Complainant; and, the transfer of the Complainant between penitentiaries and treatment centres.\n[11] The Commission also takes the position that the facts related to this complaint raise ongoing issues of systemic discrimination regarding inmates who suffer from mental disabilities. The systemic allegations the Commission will focus on relate to: (1) the appropriate placement of inmates with mental disabilities (i.e. treatment\/psychiatric centres versus penitentiaries; (2) the placement of inmates with mental disabilities in segregation; (3) the treatment and accommodation of chronic self harming inmates; and (4) access to programming for inmates with mental disabilities.\n[12] According to the Commission, limiting the examination of the present complaint to a three month period in 2010 would artificially sever the examination of allegations that occurred before and after this period. Therefore, in order to fully hear and assess the evidence related to the allegations raised in the complaint, both individual and systemic, the Commission requests that the Tribunal affirm that the period at issue is from November 1998 to present. Given the Respondent has already disclosed materials regarding the Complainant\u2019s incarceration from 2007 to the end of 2012, the Commission also requests the following information for the periods of 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present:\n(1) Records indentifying institutions the Complainant has been housed in throughout the periods of incarceration with CSC, and transfers within and between institutions.\n(2) Records identifying the types and conditions of confinement throughout the periods of incarceration with CSC (including access to and completion of programming as part of the Complainant's correctional plan, as well as every instance he was placed in formal segregation and placed on segregation or isolation status, including the exact periods of such placements).\n(3) Records identifying every incident of self harm or suicide attempt on record in addition to related psychological reports.\n[13] The Commission claims it may be possible for the Respondent to provide this information in a simplified format through its Offender Management System (\u201cOMS\u201d). In this regard, the Commission has sought leave to file an additional exhibit to its motion: a public fatality inquiry report related to the death of an inmate. According to the Commission, the report provides a useful definition to assist the Tribunal and the parties to better understand what the OMS is and its relevance to disclosure matters.\n[14] For its part, the Respondent submits it has already provided the Complainant\u2019s OMS information for the relevant period of the complaint. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal\u2019s role is to adjudicate the facts in dispute between the parties, and the facts in dispute between the parties must be set out in the pleadings. In this case, the Respondent contends the Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) of both the Commission and the Complainant contain no facts whatsoever dealing with any specific incident prior to 2009. If the scope of the complaint now includes incidents prior to 2009, the Respondent claims it would be prejudiced because it does not know the case it must meet. The Respondent argues it would also be prejudiced by the passage of time (faded memories, forgotten details and the unavailability of witnesses).\n[15] The Respondent also argues that, prior to 2007, the Complainant was at other institutions in other provinces. Therefore, the Respondent would have to locate witnesses in those other provinces, which it claims will unduly and unnecessarily complicate the process. The Respondent adds that potentially the Tribunal and witnesses might want to view the facilities and finally, that there would be tens of thousands of additional documents to disclose. In the Respondent\u2019s view, these factors will add considerable practical difficulties to this case.\n[16] In addition, the Respondent claims that expanding the complaint at this stage to include years that were not in the original complaint, not part of the Commission\u2019s investigation and not part of the referral to the Tribunal, runs contrary to the complaint resolution process set out in the CHRA, including the expeditious processing of complaints. The Respondent adds that human rights complaints should not be conducted like a commission of inquiry.\n[17] Finally, with regard to the Commission\u2019s request to file the public fatality inquiry report, the Respondent objects to this document\u2019s admissibility for the purposes of this motion. In its view, there is no issue as to what the OMS is. Even if there was an issue, there is an explanation of the OMS on the Respondent\u2019s website. Rather, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the Commission is attempting to file evidence of an inmate who committed suicide while in the Respondent\u2019s custody in order to cast the Respondent in a negative light. As a result, the Respondent views the report, without any facts or context, as highly prejudicial and as raising privacy concerns as it deals with another inmate \u2013 not the Complainant.\n(i) Request to file the public fatality inquiry report [18] In its September 12, 2014 request for leave to file the public fatality inquiry report, the Commission actually forwarded the document to the Tribunal. In a subsequent email dated September 25, 2014, the Commission explained that the report was intended for the parties only and apologized for the error in sending it to the Tribunal as well. However, at that point, the Tribunal had already seen the report. Apart from the aspect of the report that discusses the OMS, the contents of the report are irrelevant for the purposes of this motion. In this regard, I agree with the Respondent that the manner in which the report came before the Tribunal was prejudicial to it. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s request to file the public fatality inquiry report as part of the current motion is denied.\n[19] The public fatality inquiry report was not considered in deciding this motion.\n(ii) Scope of the complaint [20] The Commission relies on the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Desmarais v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2014 CHRT 5 [Desmarais], as an authority for its proposition that the scope of this complaint should be from 1998 to present. In that case, allegations of discrimination are again made against the Respondent with regard to its treatment of inmates with mental disabilities. Mr. Desmarais alleges that this discrimination occurred, on a continuing basis, during two different federal sentences served from 2001 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2007. In addition, Mr. Desmarais alleges the discrimination he endured is a reflection of systemic issues. The Respondent brought a motion to strike the systemic discrimination aspects of the inquiry or, in the alternative, limit their scope to Mr. Desmarais\u2019 periods of incarceration, i.e. from 2001 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2006.\n[21] The Tribunal found the allegations of systemic discrimination could only be determined following the presentation of evidence at the hearing. There was no reason to dismiss these allegations on a preliminary basis. Furthermore, the Tribunal found no reason to limit the scope of the systemic allegations to the periods of incarceration. Relying on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 [Moore], the Tribunal reasoned that \u201cevidence of systemic discrimination against intellectually disabled inmates by the Respondent both during and outside of Mr. Desmarais\u2019 period of incarceration may support the Complainant\u2019s individual complaint of discrimination\u201d (Desmarais, at para. 102).\n[22] The question the Tribunal had to answer in Desmarais is similar to the current one and, likewise, I see no reason to limit the scope of this inquiry to the Complainant\u2019s second period of incarceration. While the material facts alleged in the complaint form and in the SOPs of both the Complainant and the Commission focus on events that occurred during the second period of incarceration in 2009-2010, the Complainant\u2019s prior incarceration experience is raised as relevant context to his treatment during his second period of incarceration. In fact, the Complainant and the Commission suggest that the Complainant\u2019s treatment during his first incarceration mirrors his treatment during the second period.\n[23] The current motion does not seek to amend the complaint or have new consequences or liability attached to events occurring during the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration period. Rather, my understanding of the Commission\u2019s motion is that it is asking the Tribunal to confirm that events prior to and following the period of 2009-2010 be considered in the determination of what consequences, if any, should be attached to the events forming the subject matter of the complaint (2009-2010).\n[24] In my view, to consider events prior to and following the period of 2009-2010 in the determination of this complaint is supported by the Tribunal\u2019s need to fully understand the context in which the Complainant entered the correctional system and how he navigated through it. In its SOP, the Respondent refers to the Complainant as a dangerous offender with a history of violent behaviours (see Statement of Particulars of the Respondent, September 19, 2012, at paras. 3 and 23). Focusing on the period of 2009-2010 and basing a hearing only on that time frame would leave out potentially relevant context for all parties. In the end, this could also lead to an unjust outcome, whether the complaint is substantiated or not. The Complainant came into the correctional system in 1998 and came back again in 2003, and is currently still in that system; surely, his criminal and medical history as a whole is paramount to these proceedings and must be viewed as such. Focusing simply on one portion of the Complainant\u2019s incarceration would lack context and could lead to inaccurate findings. I note that the Respondent made a similar argument regarding context and facts with regard to the Commission\u2019s request to introduce the public fatality inquiry report.\n[25] I also distinguish these proceedings from a complainant filing a complaint and constantly adding new allegations to the complaint, making it a moving target and therefore impossible for the Respondent to know the case it has to meet. In these proceedings, this is not the case; the allegations, including the sections of the CHRA and the prohibited grounds of discrimination alleged, remain the same. The Commission\u2019s scope request does not create a \u201csubstantially new complaint\u201d (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313; Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1; and, Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHRT)).\n[26] In its submissions on this motion, the Commission argues that it was during the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration (1998-2002) that he was identified as having a history of self harm and of being suicidal (see Written Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (motion on the scope of disclosure and of the complaint), May 29, 2014, at para. 8). During this period, the Commission alleges the Complainant self harmed on 25 occasions and attempted suicide 4 times.\n[27] In its SOP, the Respondent also refers to the Complainant\u2019s psychological, medical and criminal history, especially during his first incarceration period, to give context and background to its actions during the second period of incarceration. The Respondent also reproduced extracts of criminal profile reports as early as 1993 in its SOP to provide context. Furthermore, the following extracts from the Respondent\u2019s SOP are particularly relevant:\n3. This is a complaint by an inmate with a lengthy history of violence, numerous criminal convictions and a history of engaging in serious self-harm. The Complainant's volatile behavior presents a difficult challenge for CSC to reasonably accommodate without undue hardship.\n4. CSC denies any discrimination and says that Mr. Starblanket's constant threats and acts of violence pose a serious risk to safety of staff, other inmates and Mr. Starblanket himself. Violence and serious harm cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.\n15. [...] In other words, while the Complaint deals with 2009-2010, the very same behavior can be observed in the years before this period.\n23. Mr. Starblanket's criminal history is very lengthy and is relevant to this Complaint.\n30. In 2007 however, after seven years in the Prairies, his behavior escalated to the point that he was involuntarily transferred to the Special Handling Unit (\"SHU\") in Quebec, which is classified as a super-maximum institution.\n(Statement of Particulars of the Respondent, September 19, 2012, at paras. 3-4, 15, 23 and 30)\n[28] The original complaint and the Complainant\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s SOPs also allege an ongoing systemic failure to accommodate prisoners with disabilities, including the Complainant. The Complainant and the Commission request remedies to address this alleged systemic discrimination. In order to properly remedy any alleged systemic discrimination, it is necessary for the Tribunal to understand not only what has caused the alleged systemic discrimination, but whether that cause still exists. In this regard, I would also note the Respondent\u2019s statement in Desmarais that \u201cthe Desmarais case was not as appropriate and as justified as the Starblanket case, also presently before the Tribunal, for a study of systemic discrimination regarding inmates with intellectual\/mental disability\u201d (Desmarais, at para. 110).\n[29] While it may not be necessary to prove that any alleged systemic discrimination existed over a long period of time, or is rooted in history, for the Complainant or the Commission to make their case, this information may give context and provide for a better understanding of the Complainant\u2019s current situation. In any event, it is up to the Complainant and the Commission to decide how they want to present their case and I see no reason at this stage to restrict the scope of the complaint to the second incarceration period.\n[30] Therefore, considering the parties\u2019 submissions to date and the nature of the complaint, I am of the view that the scope of this complaint can include argument and evidence related to the entire period of the Complainant\u2019s incarceration with the Respondent: from 1998 to present. This does not amend or enlarge the scope of the complaint, nor does it put the Tribunal in the position of a commission of inquiry. Rather, it confirms each party\u2019s ability to fully and amply present their case. Excluding the first incarceration period from the scope of the complaint or ignoring the Complainant\u2019s current circumstances could lead to an artificial fact-finding process. Seemingly important elements of the case, as argued by the Commission above, could be left out. As also mentioned above, it would seem that aspects of the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration period are of importance to the Respondent\u2019s case as well. Consequently, in the search for truth in this matter, I believe it is important for the Tribunal to properly understand the circumstances of the Complainant\u2019s incarceration as a whole.\n(iii) Disclosure of documents from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present [31] In the same vein, I find the information requested by Commission for the periods of 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present to be arguably relevant to the scope of the complaint. The Commission\u2019s request for records indentifying institutions the Complainant has been housed in throughout his periods of incarceration and transfers within and between those institutions and records identifying the types and conditions of confinement throughout the Complainant\u2019s periods of incarceration with the Respondent relate directly to the allegations of systemic discrimination, including the appropriate placement of inmates with mental disabilities and the use of segregation on inmates with mental disabilities. Moreover, as mentioned above, both the Complainant and the Commission seek systemic remedies in this case. Therefore, the records requested by the Commission amount to a reasonable and legitimate request for information related to the issues and remedies in this case. As a result, the Complainant\u2019s institutional and confinement records, as requested by the Commission, must be disclosed by the Respondent.\n[32] The records identifying every incident of self harm or suicide attempt on record, in addition to related psychological reports, from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present, are also potentially relevant in this case. As stated above, the Commission\u2019s submissions on this motion refer to the alleged fact that it was during the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration that he was identified as having a history of self harm and of being suicidal. In this regard, the Respondent also refers to the Complainant\u2019s psychological and medical history in its SOP, especially during his first incarceration period, to give context and background to its actions during the second period of incarceration. Therefore, in my view, records identifying every incident of self harm or suicide attempt on record, in addition to related psychological reports, from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present, are potentially relevant in this case.\n[33] If possible, the disclosure of documents from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present should be provided through the Respondent\u2019s OMS. The Respondent is directed to provide this disclosure by December 2, 2014.\n(iv) Addressing the potential prejudice to the Respondent [34] If the scope of the complaint is now to include incidents prior to 2009, the Respondent claims it would be prejudiced because it does not know the case it must meet. The Respondent submits it would also be prejudiced by the passage of time (faded memories, forgotten details and the unavailability of witnesses).\n[35] As stated above, the focus of the complaint thus far has been on the 2009-2010 period of the Complainant\u2019s second incarceration. Thus, I understand the Respondent raising a prejudice argument with regard to the scope of the complaint. However, as also mentioned above, the current motion does not seek to amend the complaint or have new consequences or liability attached to events occurring during the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration period. Rather, my understanding of the Commission\u2019s motion is that it is asking the Tribunal to confirm that events prior to and following the period of 2009-2010 be considered in the determination of what consequences, if any, should be attached to the events forming the subject matter of the complaint (2009-2010). Therefore, I believe the potential prejudice claimed by the Respondent can be addressed by the filing of amended Statements of Particulars. Therein, the Complainant and the Commission should detail the case they intend to present before the Tribunal, including what aspects of the Complainant\u2019s first incarceration period will be presented at the hearing of this matter. This will allow the Respondent to know the case it has to meet and to respond accordingly.\n[36] Furthermore, the Respondent\u2019s argument regarding the unavailability of witnesses and their recollection of events, and the other potential practical difficulties it raises with regard to scope, are best assessed after amended particulars have been submitted and, even more so, when the case is presented at the hearing. At that point, the Tribunal and the Respondent will be in a better position to assess whether witnesses are in fact available and, if so, their recollection of events. This approach is similar to the one taken by the Tribunal in Uzoaba v. Canada (Correctional Service), 1994 CanLII 1636 (CHRT), at pp. 4-7, where the Tribunal was dealing with a situation analogous to the present one.\n[37] The other potential practical difficulties, such as the potential for viewing facilities and the amount of documents to be disclosed, are speculative at this time. In this regard, I note that the Commission\u2019s disclosure request was limited to specific categories of documents (see for example paragraph 12) and was not in the nature of a fishing expedition. However, if such practical difficulties do arise, I encourage the Respondent to raise them as soon as possible.\n[38] I would also note that despite the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the scope of the complaint can include argument and evidence related to the entire period of the Complainant\u2019s incarceration, and the related disclosure of information in this regard, that does not necessarily mean that this information is admissible at the hearing or what weight, if any, this information will have on a final determination in this matter. Those questions are best addressed during and\/or after the hearing.\n[39] Therefore, I believe any potential prejudice to the Respondent can be addressed through the filing of amended Statements of Particulars and properly assessing the availability, admissibility and weight of the evidence presented at the hearing. A schedule for amended Statements of Particulars will be set following the disclosure of the additional documentation directed in this ruling.\nB. Additional materials mentioned in documents already disclosed [40] The Commission requests the disclosure of 75 additional items, the existence of which was revealed through a review of certain items already disclosed. Of the documents requested, 33 of the items relate to specific documents, while the other items ask for details related to an incident or period of time by way of documentation.\n[41] For many of the documents, the Respondent states the requests fall outside of the relevant date range pursuant to its submissions on the scope of the complaint above. For the other items asking for details related to an incident or period of time, the Respondent submits its obligation is to disclose documents, not details. In addition, it states that questions concerning additional details are better addressed through questions of witnesses at the hearing. For the remaining documents requested by the Commission, the Respondent agrees to either search for additional documentation or point to documents already disclosed.\n[42] As I have decided above that documents from 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present should be disclosed, any additional materials that relate to this request should now be disclosed. For the remaining documents, the Respondent has agreed to search for additional documentation or point to documents already disclosed. The Respondent is directed to respond to this request for additional documentation by November 2, 2014.\nC. Unredacted versions of certain documents already disclosed [43] The Commission has concerns with redactions in certain documents related to locations (within institutions, specific institutions generally, and even court houses), staff names and incidents involving staff, psychological matters and other issues that go to the heart of the issues raised in this matter. The Commission adds that this is especially the case when duplicate versions of redacted documents are not redacted or contain different redactions, thus indicating inconsistencies in the use of redactions. However, the Commission does recognize that the names of other inmates, informers or otherwise, is not required for the purposes of this matter and could therefore remain redacted. As a result, the Commission requests the disclosure of the unredacted versions of certain documents, with the exception of the names of other inmates.\n[44] The Respondent categorizes its response to the documents requested by the Commission into four groups: (1) irrelevant documents dealing with other inmates that were misfiled in the Complainant\u2019s files; (2) duplicate documents that were redacted differently by the Respondent; (3) documents where it will agree to remove or reduce redactions; and (4) documents where it asserts public interest immunity.\n[45] For the first category, the Respondent explains that it disclosed documents that were inadvertently misfiled in the Complainant\u2019s files, but which are irrelevant as they concern other inmates. According to the Respondent, the only reason they were listed is because it was not possible to have reviewed these documents before listing them given the volume of documents and the timeframe for disclosure. It claims it simply listed every document contained in the Complainant\u2019s files and then, before producing the documents, undertook the review and redacted that which needed to be redacted. So as to not disrupt the numbering of the documents by removing them from the list, the Respondent indicates that it decided to simply redact the entire document.\n[46] According to the Respondent, the second category of redacted materials are documents which are duplicated, but with fewer or no redactions. The Respondent explains that these documents were reviewed by separate employees and despite efforts to be consistent, redactions in some duplicate documents were inconsistent. The Respondent submits the Commission can simply rely on the version with less or no redactions.\n[47] In the third category of redacted documents, the Respondent agrees to remove or substantially reduce the redactions. It trusts that these changes will be satisfactory to the Commission; if not, then the Respondent takes the positions that further submissions may be necessary.\n[48] From the Respondent\u2019s perspective, it is the fourth category of redacted documents that is controversial with respect to redactions and for which it is unwilling to remove redactions. The Respondent submits that these seven documents generally deal with the identity and surrounding circumstances of informants and incompatibles. In its view, the law affords significant protection to informants in the criminal justice system, including an informer privilege. It has provided a written certification, pursuant to section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, that the information should not be disclosed on the grounds of public interest immunity. Section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act provides as follows:\n37. (1) Subject to sections 38 to 38.16, a Minister of the Crown in right of Canada or other official may object to the disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information by certifying orally or in writing to the court, person or body that the information should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest.\n(1.1) If an objection is made under subsection (1), the court, person or body shall ensure that the information is not disclosed other than in accordance with this Act.\n(2) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a superior court, that court may determine the objection.\n(3) If an objection to the disclosure of information is made before a court, person or body other than a superior court, the objection may be determined, on application, by\n(a) the Federal Court, in the case of a person or body vested with power to compel production by or under an Act of Parliament if the person or body is not a court established under a law of a province; or\n(b) the trial division or trial court of the superior court of the province within which the court, person or body exercises its jurisdiction, in any other case.\n[49] In the same vein, the Respondent also relies on section 58 of the CHRA, which provides :\n58. (1) Subject to subsection (2), if an investigator or a member or panel of the Tribunal requires the disclosure of any information and a minister of the Crown or any other interested person objects to its disclosure, the Commission may apply to the Federal Court for a determination of the matter and the Court may take any action that it considers appropriate.\n(2) An objection to disclosure shall be determined in accordance with the Canada Evidence Act if\n(a) under subsection (1), a minister of the Crown or other official objects to the disclosure in accordance with sections 37 to 37.3 or section 39 of that Act;\n(b) within 90 days after the day on which the Commission applies to the Federal Court, a minister of the Crown or other official objects to the disclosure in accordance with sections 37 to 37.3 or section 39 of that Act; or\n(c) at any time, an objection to the disclosure is made, or a certificate is issued, in accordance with sections 38 to 38.13 of that Act.\nAs the redacted documents engage section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act and section 58 of the CHRA, the Respondent argues it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to order the redactions be removed. Given these provisions, the Respondent submits it is the Federal Court, and not the Tribunal, that has jurisdiction with respect to the disclosure of information over which a section 37 Canada Evidence Act privilege is claimed.\n[50] Despite the Respondent\u2019s written certifications, the Commission challenges the privilege claimed. It argues the Tribunal has the authority to decide whether and to what extent specific privileges apply under the common law. As a result, it contends that it would be preferable to deal with the claimed privilege first under the common law, rather than further delay proceedings by invoking the process set out in the Canada Evidence Act. For this proposition, the Commission relies on the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Personnel for the Government of the Northwest Territories), 2000 CanLII 28887 (CHRT) [PSAC].\n[51] With regard to the first three categories of documents identified by the Respondent, the Respondent\u2019s explanations seem reasonable and acceptable. Should there still be any outstanding issues with these documents, the Complainant or the Commission can raise the matter at the next conference call.\n[52] For the fourth category of documents, the Respondent has certified in writing, under section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, that 7 documents should not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest. Having done so, in my view, section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act and section 58 of the CHRA are clear: the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the Commission\u2019s objections to the privilege claimed by the Respondent over these 7 documents. The proper recourse for the Commission, if it wishes to pursue the matter, is to make an application to the Federal Court.\n[53] While the Commission relies on the PSAC ruling for the proposition that the Tribunal should determine the privilege issue first, before recourse to the Federal Court, it should be noted that the PSAC ruling was set aside on judicial review (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Northwest Territories, 2000 CanLII 16337 (FC) [PSAC (FC)]; aff\u2019d on other grounds 2001 FCA 259). The Federal Court found the Tribunal had erred in law in its determination that it had authority to determine objections to production of government information on grounds of public interest immunity when claimed by the federal government or one of its agencies. According to the Federal Court, \u201cAn objection of that sort is to be dealt with pursuant to ss. 37 to 39 of the [Canada Evidence Act]...\u201d and, consequently, the Tribunal has no authority but to leave the determination to the Federal Court (PSAC (FC), at paras. 35 and 40). The Tribunal has also taken this approach in Warman v. Lemire, 2007 CHRT 21. Therefore, the Tribunal declines jurisdiction to deal with the Commission\u2019s objections regarding the section 37 Canada Evidence Act privilege the Respondent claims over 7 documents.\nD. Complete and legible versions of certain documents already disclosed [54] The Commission submits that Respondent counsel committed to resending these documents in March 2014; however, given the these materials have yet to be received and the longstanding and continued difficulties encountered on disclosure in this matter, the Commission requests that the Tribunal make an order that the items be disclosed.\n[55] The Respondent states it is working on getting better copies of documents where available, some of which it claims to have already provided.\n[56] Given the delay in providing legible copies of the documents requested by the Commission where available, the Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide the documents by, November 2, 2014.\nE. Statistical information on segregated inmates throughout the period at issue [57] According to the Commission, the placement of mentally disabled inmates is one of the central issues in this case, both in terms of individual and systemic allegations. Therefore, it submits that statistical information on segregated inmates throughout the period at issue relates directly to the dispute, and also goes towards demonstrating patterns of discrimination, both on an individual and a systemic basis.\n[58] To the extent that statistics are relevant to the issues raised, counsel for the Respondent has requested these statistics from the CSC and states he will forward them to all parties.\n[59] Given that this issue appears to be resolved, it will be discussed at the next conference call and, if statistics have not been provided by then, the Tribunal will set a deadline for their disclosure.\nF. Electronic versions of disclosure materials [60] According to the Commission, since the Tribunal\u2019s October 2013 ruling rejecting the Respondent\u2019s motion for electronic evidence at the hearing (Starblanket v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2013 CHRT 28 [Starblanket (e-hearing)], counsel for the Respondent has refused to provide any further disclosure in electronic format. The Commission adds that this is the case despite Respondent counsel already having electronic versions of the disclosure materials in his possession. In the Commission\u2019s view, procedural fairness dictates not only that disclosure be provided, but also that it be provided in a workable format that can be easily used for hearing preparations; That is, the format in which the evidence is presented at the actual hearing does not dictate the format in which materials are to be disclosed in the pre-hearing stage of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings.\n[61] The Commission claims the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide electronic disclosure will unnecessarily waste the Commission\u2019s human and financial resources because support staff will need to scan all of the non-electronic documents for both the Commission\u2019s records and for sharing with the Commission\u2019s expert. The Commission submits that this is unacceptable given its public interest mandate and reliance on limited public financial resources for its operations.\n[62] In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) [the Rules] do not require that disclosure be filed and served in any particular format; typically, disclosure is done in paper format absent some alternative agreement between the parties. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal determined that paper would be used at the hearing and it makes no sense to thereafter compel a party to disclose documents in a format other than paper. In the Respondent\u2019s view, doing so adds unnecessary costs and frustrates the expeditious and informal mandate of the Tribunal.\n[63] The Starblanket (e-hearing) ruling on the Respondent\u2019s motion to have an electronic hearing dealt with the presentation of evidence at the hearing, not with the format of documents at the disclosure stage. The distinction is important and therefore I cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s views on this issue. In examining the Tribunal\u2019s Rules, there is a clear distinction between the disclosure stage and the hearing stage of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings. Rule 6 deals with SOPs and the disclosure and production of documents. Rule 9 deals with the hearing process and the presentation of evidence. In particular, I note Rules 9(3)(c) and 9(4), which clarify and confirm the distinction between the disclosure and hearing stage:\n9(3) Except with leave of the Panel, which leave shall be granted on such terms and conditions as accord with the purposes set out in 1(1), and subject to a party\u2019s right to lead evidence in reply,\n[...]\nc. a party who does not disclose and produce a document under Rule 6 shall not introduce that document into evidence at the hearing;\n9(4) Except with the consent of the parties, a document in a book of documents does not become evidence until it is introduced at the hearing and accepted by the Panel.\n[64] While the Respondent is correct in mentioning the Rules do not specify the manner or form by which production is to take place, the Tribunal has found that \u201cthe purpose of the Rules and the principles of fairness in general dictate that the disclosure and production of documents be sufficient to allow each party the full and ample opportunity to be heard\u201d (Grand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v. Attorney General of Canada, 2013 CHRT 3, at para. 14). Electronic production would assist the Commission in this regard and the documents seem to be readily available to the Respondent in electronic format. While the Respondent claims that producing electronic documents will add unnecessary costs and frustrates the expeditious and informal mandate of the Tribunal, it does not explain why this is the case. Based on the Commission\u2019s arguments, it appears that it is the Commission who is suffering more prejudice on this issue.\n[65] Therefore, where documents are provided to the Respondent in electronic format or where the Respondent has converted documents into electronic format, the Respondent will produce those documents to the Complainant and the Commission in electronic format. This also applies to documents that have already been produced by the Respondent. The Respondent will have until November 2, 2014 to reproduce and provide those documents in electronic format.\nIII. Ruling [66] Pursuant to the reasons above, the Tribunal directs as follows:\n(1) The Respondent is to disclose the following information for the periods of 1998 to 2007 and from 2013 to present:\na. Records indentifying institutions the Complainant has been housed in throughout the periods of incarceration with the Respondent and transfers within and between institutions.\nb. Records identifying the types and conditions of confinement throughout the periods of incarceration with the Respondent (including access to and completion of programming as part of the Complainant's correctional plan, as well as every instance he was placed in formal segregation and placed on segregation or isolation status, including the exact periods of such placements).\nc. Records identifying every incident of self harm or suicide attempt on record in addition to related psychological reports.\n(2) If possible, the disclosure of documents in direction (1) above should be provided through the Respondent\u2019s OMS by December 2, 2014.\n(3) Where available, the Respondent is to disclose documents that respond to the Commission\u2019s request for 75 additional items, the existence of which was revealed through a review of certain items already disclosed. The Tribunal directs the Respondent to complete this disclosure by November 2, 2014.\n(4) Where available, the Respondent is to disclose legible copies of documents that have already disclosed (as requested by the Commission). The Tribunal directs the Respondent to provide the documents by November 2, 2014.\n(5) Where documents are provided to the Respondent in electronic format or where the Respondent has converted documents into electronic format, the Respondent is to produce those documents to the Complainant and the Commission in electronic format. This also applies to documents that have already been produced by the Respondent. The Respondent will have until, November 2, 2014 to reproduce those documents in electronic format.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nOctober 2, 2014\n",

Background\n[1] On June 3, 2011, Mr. Brian William Carter (\u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against Fisheries and Oceans Canada (\u201dDFO\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d), alleging that the Respondent discriminated against him by failing and\/or refusing to accommodate his disability, treating him in an adverse, differential manner by engaging in a discriminatory policy or practice, thereby denying him an employment opportunity, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cHuman Rights Act\u201d).\n[2] On July 31, 2012, by letter (\u201cReferral Letter\u201d), pursuant to subsection 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Commission asked the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry into the Complaint.\n[3] The Commission is participating in the proceedings.\n[4] The parties have filed their Statement of Particulars and applicable responding materials.\n[5] These reasons relate to a motion the Respondent has brought in respect of adding a party and naming of parties in this proceeding.\nII. Respondent\u2019s Motion\n[6] The Respondent\u2019s Notice of Motion is for an Order:\nadding the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d) as an additional Respondent; and\nthen substituting the Attorney General of Canada (\u201cAG\u201d) as the Respondent in the place of both the PSC and DFO.\n[7] The grounds for the Respondent\u2019s Motion are as follows:\n(a) the AG is the only appropriate legal representative of Her Majesty the Queen and Her Departments;\n(b) substituting the AG as Respondent will not prejudice the Complainant;\n(c) Section 50(3)(e) of the Act;\n(d) Section 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 (\u201cCLPA\u201d);\n(e) Rule 8 of Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (\u201cthe Rules\u201d).\nMotion Materials\n[8] In addition to the Respondent\u2019s Notice of Motion and supporting materials and the Complainant and Commission\u2019s Responses filed earlier, the parties also made some oral representations on the Motion during the December 20, 2013 Case Management Conference Call (\u201cDecember 20 CMCC\u201d). On January 3, 2014, the parties provided further written submissions on two cases which I felt were relevant to the Motion, pursuant to my request during the December 20 CMCC.\nIII. Portions of the Complaint relevant to this Motion\n[9] The allegations in the Complaint, which are relevant to this Motion, are set out below.\nThe Complainant has a medical condition which he states is a disability under the Act.\nIn June, 2008, he applied for a not-yet-established ENG-05 position with the DFO without self-identifying as disabled and without requesting accommodation.\nIn April, 2009, after completing the DFO assessment process, which included an interview, the DFO placed him in the pool of candidates qualified for the position.\nThe Complainant received information that his interview was just \u201cOK\u201d, and that once the position was established, the Respondent would not appoint him to it.\nThe Complainant decided to self identify as a person with a disability requiring accommodation. He did so in August, 2009, and in September, 2009, submitted an \u201cAccommodation Request\u201d form to DFO.\nDFO\u2019s accommodation offer was to reassess the Complainant after receiving information on specific appropriate accommodation modes from PSC.\nThe DFO asked the Complainant to attend at the PSC Psychology Centre so that PSC could assess and tell DFO the specific mode of accommodation the Complainant required.\nThe Complainant disagreed with the DFO\u2019s proposed accommodation and did not attend at the PSC Psychology Centre. He proposed to DFO that the correct accommodation was to appoint him to the ENG-5 position for the following reasons:\nhe was already in the pool of qualified candidates;\nthe \u201cright fit\u201d standard and practice the DFO used was inherently discriminatory against him and others with his disability; and\nhis proposed mode of accommodation would not cause DFO undue hardship.\nDFO refused the Complainant\u2019s proposal for accommodation.\nIn the materials I have before me, the Complainant filed his Complaint with the Commission on June 3, 2011 against the DFO as Respondent.\nIV. Issues\n[10] The Respondent submits that the issues in this Motion are the following:\nShould the Tribunal add the Public Service Commission as a Respondent?\nShould the Tribunal then substitute the Attorney General of Canada as Respondent, in the place of both DFO and PSC, given that both have an interest in the proceedings?\n[11] However, there is an issue underlying both of the above, and that is:\nWho can be a respondent in a complaint at the Tribunal?Put another way, are the Public Service Commission and Department of Fisheries and Oceans entities which can be named as respondents in a complaint at the Tribunal?This issue directly impacts on the question of whether or not the PSC can be added as a Respondent in its own right, and directly impacts whether or not the AG should be substituted as the Respondent in place of the DFO and PSC.\n[12] I note that throughout the Motion materials, the Respondent and PSC used various words and phrases such as \u201cRespondent\u201d, \u201cresponding party\u201d, \u201crespondent party\u201d. This was confusing, and at the December 20 CMCC, I asked Respondent counsel what they meant. He clarified that they should each should be read as \u201cRespondent\u201d.\nV. Law\nAdding Parties under the Canadian Human Rights Act at the Tribunal\n[13] Section 48.9(2)(b) of the Act provides in essence that the Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing practice and procedure before the Tribunal, including \u201c rules governing the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings;\u201d.\nTribunal Rules of Procedure\n[14] The specific rule in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cthe Rules\u201d) dealing with the addition of parties is Rule 8, which states:\n\u201cMotion for interested party status\nAnyone who is not a party, and who wishes to be recognized by the Panel as an interested party in respect of an inquiry, may bring a motion for an order granting interested party status.\nMotion to specify extent of participation\n(2) A motion under 8(1) shall comply with the requirements of Rule 3 and shall specify the extent of the desired participation in the inquiry.\nAddition of party on motion of another party\n(3) Where the Commission, a respondent or a complainant seeks to add a party to the inquiry, it may bring a motion for an order to this effect, which motion shall be served on the prospective party, and the prospective party shall be entitled to make submissions on the motion.\nAddition of party by its own motion\n(4) Anyone who is not a party, and who wishes to be added to the inquiry as a party, may bring a motion under Rule 3 for an order to this effect.\u201d\nLaw on Substituting the Attorney General of Canada as Respondent\n[15] Section 23(1) of the CLPA states:\n\u201cProceedings against the Crown may be taken in the name of the Attorney General of Canada or, in the case of an agency of the Crown against which the proceedings are by an Act of Parliament authorized to be taken in the name of the agency, in the name of that agency.\u201d\n[16] Section 66(1) of the Human Rights Act states that the Act \u201c\u2026is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada\u201d, except in matters respecting the Yukon Government or the Government of the Northwest Territories or Nunavut.\nVI. Who can be a Respondent in a Human Rights Complaint at the Tribunal?\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[17] With respect to who should be the ultimate [my emphasis] Respondent in this Complaint, the Respondent submits that both DFO and PSC are emanations of the Crown and are not legal entities. Therefore, neither can be respondents. There is case law supporting this \u2013 for example, Shelly Ann Gravel v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FC 832, at para.6 (\u201cGravel\u201d).\n[18] The Tribunal\u2019s practice of substituting the AG for federal departments or entities which have been named as respondents in human rights complaints also supports the fact that emanations of the Crown do not have legal identity. Examples are Plante v. RCMP, 2003 CHRT 28, at para.7 (\u201cPlante\u201d) and Tremblay v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Public Service Commission, the Treasury Board of Canada and the Transportation and Safety Board of Canada, 2004 CHRT 15 (\u201cTremblay\u201d).\nComplainant\u2019s Position\n[19] The Respondent has not complied with the procedure in the Rules in bringing his Motion.\n[20] Rule 1(3) of the Tribunal Rules states:\n(i) party, in respect of an inquiry, means the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the complainant, and the person against whom the complaint was made;\n(ii) respondent means the person against whom the complaint was made.\n[21] A respondent must therefore be a person. Neither DFO nor PSC are legal entities. Given Rule 1(3), the Respondent should be the former Deputy Minister (\u201cDM\u201d) of DFO, because she is a person; she was the DM when the relevant events occurred; she was the person against whom the Complainant made his original Complaint.\nHuman Rights Commission\u2019s Position\n[22] The Commission originally did not object to adding the PSC as a Respondent nor to then substituting the AG for both DFO and PSC, based on the understanding that any potential order arising from the hearing would be enforceable against both DFO and PSC, notwithstanding that the AG was the named Respondent.\n[23] The Commission\u2019s January 3, 2014 submissions deal further with the issue of substituting the AG as Respondent in relation to the interpretation of the CLPA and the Department of Justice Act, RSC 1985, c J-2. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s position is set out below under \u201cSubstituting the Attorney General of Canada as Respondent\u201d.\nAnalysis \u2013 Procedure\n[24] This is a Motion by the named Respondent, DFO, first, to add the PSC, as an additional Respondent. The Complainant submits that in bringing this Motion, the Respondent has not complied with the relevant Tribunal Rules.\n[25] Rule 8(3) of the Tribunal Rules applies to this part of the Motion. Rule 3(1) also applies.\n[26] The Respondent has brought its Notice of Motion. In its Motion Record and other motion materials, Respondent counsel has represented that he acts not only for DFO, but also for PSC. Further, the Respondent\u2019s written Motion materials and Respondent counsel\u2019s oral representations during the December 20, 2013 CMCC were stated to be on behalf of both the DFO and the PSC. The Tribunal can therefore assume that PSC, as the prospective party, has had notice of this Motion and that the Respondent has the mandate to present PSC\u2019s position. The fact that the written representations in the Respondent\u2019s materials are from PSC as well as DFO means that PSC has made submissions to the Tribunal on the Motion.\n[27] Therefore, the Respondent has complied with all the requirements of Rules 8(3) and 3(1).\nAnalysis \u2013 Who Can Be a Respondent at the Tribunal?\n[28] The Complaint is a human rights complaint under the Act, against an employer. The ostensible employer, DFO, is a part of the federal government. The Commission has referred the Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry. Therefore, the primary statute being administered in this Complaint is the Act. It is also the primary source for deciding who can be a respondent in a complaint at the Tribunal.\n[29] The Act does not require that a respondent be a corporate entity. Section 4 of the Act states that \u201c\u2026anyone [my emphasis] found to be engaging or to have engaged in a discriminatory practice may be made subject to an order as provided in section 53\u2026\u201d.\n[30] I also note the following sections of the Act, parts of which I have bolded for emphasis:\n1. Section 14.1 makes it a discriminatory practice \u201c\u2026for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate\u2026against the individual who filed the complaint\u2026\u201d.\n2. Subsection 40(1): \u201c \u2026any individual or group of individuals having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaging or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file with the Commission a complaint\u2026\u201d\n3. Subsection 50(1): (Conduct of inquiry), states in part that \u201cAfter due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made\u2026\u201d\n4. Subsection 53(2):\n\u201cIf at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may\u2026make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice\u2026and include in the order any of the following terms\u2026:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice\u2026\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice\u2026\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the wages\u2026\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the additional costs\u2026\n(e) that the person compensate the victim\u2026for any pain and suffering\u2026\u201d.\n5. Subsection 53(3): \u201cIn addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay\u2026\u201d.\n[31] As seen in the above sections and subsections of the Act, the concept of a respondent being a \u201cperson\u201d is used consistently throughout the Act \u2013 for example, \u201cperson against whom the complaint was filed\u201d; \u201cperson against whom the complaint was made\u201d; \u201cperson found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice\u201d.\n[32] Throughout the Act, the words \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cindividuals\u201d are used in various sections and subsections, to describe those whose right to equal opportunities it seeks to protect.\nSection 2 states in part that the Purpose of the Act \u201c\u2026is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect\u2026to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have\u2026\u201d (my emphasis).\nSubsection 5(a) states that it is a discriminatory practice to \u201c(a) deny or deny access to [any good, service, facility or accommodation customarily available to the general public] \u2026to any individual\u201d. Subsection 5(b) makes it a discriminatory practice \u201c\u2026to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d Subsections 6(a) and (b) deal with the denial of commercial premises or residential accommodation \u201cto any individual\u201d and adverse differential treatment \u201cin relation to any individual\u201d with respect to commercial premises or residential accommodation (my emphasis).\nSection 7 with respect to employment discrimination; Section 9 with respect to \u201cemployee organizations\u201d and both describe the target of discriminatory practices as being \u201cany individual\u201d; \u201can individual\u201d; \u201cthat individual\u201d (my emphasis).\nSection 10 states it is a discriminatory policy or practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization to have or pursue a policy or practice or enter into an agreement relating to employment or prospective employment \u201c\u2026that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination\u201d (my emphasis).\n[33] There are other sections and subsections of the Act which refer to the entity being discriminated against as \u201can individual\u201d or \u201cany individual\u201d, or \u201cclass of individuals\u201d. Therefore, under the Act, a potential complainant is \u201can individual\u201d or \u201cindividuals\u201d or \u201cclass of individuals\u201d - they are the aggrieved entities.\n[34] The Act therefore differentiates between a respondent, which it refers to as a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d, and a complainant, which it refers to as \u201can individual\u201d or \u201cindividuals\u201d or \u201cclass of individuals\u201d.\n[35] I conclude that Parliament deliberately included these different descriptions in the Act, in order to differentiate between who can be complainants and who can be respondents in a human rights complaint.\n[36] I further conclude that given those different descriptions, the Act requires a respondent to be a \u201cperson\u201d.\n[37] However, the Act does not define the word \u201cperson\u201d. I deal with that issue under \u201cSubstituting the AG as Respondent\u201d.\nVII. Is the Public Service Commission a \u201cperson\u201d in accordance with the Act?\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[38] Notwithstanding that this motion first seeks to add the PSC as a respondent, the Respondent\u2019s motion later submits that the PSC is a federal entity, not a legal entity. It is an emanation of the federal Crown, not a person. It is not a proper respondent in this matter.\nComplainant\u2019s Position\n[39] The Complainant agrees that neither the PSC nor the DFO are legal entities. However, all that is required to make them legal entities and therefore a proper respondent is to add \u201cDeputy Minister\u201d in front of Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\nCommission\u2019s Position\n[40] The Commission does not make any submissions on the issue of whether or not the PSC is a \u201cperson\u201d under the Act. However, it did submit in its January 3, 2014 additional submissions that one of the core issues in this Complaint is whether or not the structure and application of \u201cright fit\u201d discriminates against the Complainant and individuals who share his disability, contrary to the Act. The PSC has delegated authority regarding staffing to government departments, including to DFO. The DFO applies the \u201cright fit\u201d standard to its staffing procedures. The Commission therefore sees the PSC as an essential entity in this Complaint.\nAnalysis\n[41] The constituting statute of the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d) is the Public Service Employment Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss 12, 13 (\u201cPSEA\u201d).\n[42] Subsection 4(1) of the PSEA continues the existence of the PSC, which it describes as consisting of a President and at least two other Commissioners.\n[43] The PSEA does not characterize the PSC as an agency of the Crown against which proceedings are authorized to be taken in its own name. It is also not a Crown corporation.\n[44] Although not determinative of the issue, I note that the Financial Administration Act, 1985 R.S.C., c. F-11 (\u201cFinancial Administration Act\u201d) places the PSC into Schedule IV, part of the Core Public Administration.\n[45] Given that the PSC\u2019s constituting statute does not characterize it as an agency, and does not authorize it to take proceedings in its own name, the PSC is not a person. It is more akin to a department in the federal government.\n[46] In Gravel, the complainant brought a human rights complaint under the Act against the PSC. The Tribunal dismissed her complaint. She appealed to the Federal Court, naming the Tribunal, the PSC and the AG as respondents. The Federal Court held that \u201c\u2026government departments are not legal entities and cannot properly be named as parties\u2026\u201d (Gravel, supra, at para.6, citing Mahmood v. Canada (1998), 154 FTR 102 at para.14). The Federal Court therefore removed the PSC as respondent because it was held to be a government department.\n[47] In light of the PSC\u2019s constituting statute, the Federal Court decision in Gravel, supra, and the Respondent\u2019s acknowledgment that PSC is not a person and not a proper respondent, I conclude that the Public Service Commission is not a \u201cperson\u201d under the Act, and therefore cannot properly be named as a respondent in a complaint at the Tribunal.\n[48] Therefore, the first part of the Motion which seeks to add the PSC as a Respondent is dismissed.\nVIII. Is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans a \u201cperson\u201d in accordance with the Act?\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[49] The Respondent submits that the DFO is a department of the federal government, and therefore an emanation of the Crown, and not a legal entity.\nComplainant\u2019s Position\n[50] The Complainant submits that DFO is not a legal entity because it is a department of the federal government. All that is needed to make it a person for the purposes of the Complaint, is to add the name of the former Deputy Minister ahead of the DFO in the style of cause.\nCommission\u2019s Position\n[51] The Commission did not take a position regarding this specific issue.\nAnalysis\n[52] The DFO\u2019s constituting statute is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-15 (\u201cDFO Act\u201d). Its preamble states it is [\u201cA]n Act respecting the Department of Fisheries and Oceans\u201d.\n[53] Section 2(1) of the DFO Act states:\n\u201cThere is hereby established a department of the Government of Canada called the Department of Fisheries and Oceans over which the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans appointed by commission under the Great Seal shall preside\u201d.\n[54] Therefore, the Respondent DFO is a department of the Government of Canada.\n[55] The short, six-section DFO Act does not contain any section constituting DFO as an agency or as having the capacity to conduct or respond to litigation or claims in its own name.\n[56] The Complainant, the Respondent and the Commission agree that the DFO is a department of the Government of Canada.\n[57] Given the contents of the DFO\u2019s constituting statute, which makes it a department of the federal government, and not an agency or entity with the authority to take legal proceedings in its own name, and given Gravel, supra, in which the Federal Court clearly states that federal departments cannot be respondents, I conclude that the DFO is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and therefore cannot be the Respondent in this Complaint at the Tribunal.\n[58] DFO and PSC are however, intrinsically involved in this Complaint. Personnel from both departments will be witnesses at the inquiry. This is because the Complaint makes allegations of DFO\u2019s failure to accommodate the Complainant during a staffing procedure which used the standard and practice of \u201cright fit\u201d, and that the standard and practice of \u201cright fit\u201d used in that staffing procedure systemically discriminated against him personally and against the class of individuals who share his disability. \u201cRight fit\u201d is designed by PSC, which delegates its staffing authority to federal government departments, such as DFO.\n[59] This still leaves the issue of who in fact can be a respondent under the Act at the Tribunal when a federal government department is the alleged employer or prospective employer discriminator.\nIX. Substituting the Attorney General of Canada as Respondent\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[60] The Respondent\u2019s submissions are set out below.\nIn the context of the federal public service, the employer is Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, because section 2(1) of the PSEA defines \u201cemployer\u201d, for organizations named in Schedules I and IV of the Financial Administration Act, as being the Treasury Board. [DFO is named in Schedule I; PSC is named in Schedule IV \u2013 my note.]\nThe Treasury Board is in fact an emanation of the Crown.\nThe Queen cannot be impleaded.\nDFO and PSC are emanations of the Crown and are not legal entities. There is case law confirming this \u2013 for example, Gravel, supra, at para.6.\nTherefore, the AG is the proper party to be named as Respondent.\nThe Tribunal\u2019s practice has been to substitute the AG for federal departments or entities that have been named as respondents. An example is Plante v. RCMP, 2003 CHRT 28, at para.7 (\u201cPlante\u201d).\nFurther, section 23(1) of the CLPA mandates this substitution.\nThe Complainant will not be prejudiced by the substitution because:\nthe AG is not asking to file an additional Statement of Particulars, nor is the PSC;\nthe hearing will not be complicated by this substitution because there will be only one counsel for the Respondent;\nthere will be no delay in the hearing on account of this substitution.\nAny potential order would be enforceable against the Crown, with DFO and PSC having responsibility over the mechanisms to enforce the order and implement any remedies. The Respondent does not seek to blur or make unclear its responsibilities with respect to any potential Tribunal order.\nIn Lacroix v. Attorney General of Canada, 2009 CHRT 35 (\u201cLacroix\u201d), where the RCMP was alleged to have discriminated against the complainant, the Tribunal noted several previous cases involving the RCMP where the AG was named as Respondent, notwithstanding that the AG was not alleged to have been the discriminating party: Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48 (\u201cMaillet\u201d); Berberi v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 CHRT 21 (\u201cBerberi\u201d).\nIn Lacroix, supra, at para. 8, the Tribunal noted that the RCMP cannot be named in its own right as its constituting statute does not permit this.\nAs can be seen in the style of cause in Tremblay v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Public Service Commission, the Treasury Board of Canada and the Transportation and Safety Board of Canada , 2004 CHRT 15 (\u201cTremblay\u201d), the Tribunal followed the practice of the AG being the respondent when the respondents were emanations of the federal Crown.\nAttorney General of Canada v. Brown, 2008 FC 734 (\u201cBrown\u201d) is distinguishable on its facts from the present Complaint. (I will not set out further details of the Respondent\u2019s submissions re Brown, supra because in my view, it deals with the addition of parties to a complaint at the Tribunal. When I asked the parties to comment on the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Brown, I considered that decision as important to the then live issue of whether to add PSC as a respondent. However, adding the PSC, and therefore Brown, became moot due to my conclusion on the underlying issue.)\nThe Complainant\u2019s Position\n[61] The Complainant objects to the substitution of the Attorney General as Respondent in place of the DFO and the PSC, on the following grounds:\nThe Respondent\u2019s Motion does not comply with Rule 8.\nThe requested substitution would leave the DFO\u2019s and PSC\u2019s legal status unclear during the hearing.\nThe Respondent should be Claire Dansereau, the former Deputy Minister of the DFO, as this was the person against whom the Complainant filed his Complaint originally; all that is required is to insert her name ahead of the DFO in the style of cause.\nSection 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act (\u201cCLPA\u201d) does not mandate that only the AG can be named as respondent in proceedings against the federal government, because it uses the word \u201cmay\u201d. The naming of the AG as respondent is therefore discretionary, not mandatory.\nFurther, the CLPA refers only to court proceedings, and is silent regarding the Tribunal.\nIt is the Financial Administration Act, 1985 R.S.C., c. F-11 (\u201cFinancial Administration Act\u201d) and its Schedules and not the CLPA that determines which parts of the federal government can be legal persons in legal proceedings. Lacroix\u2019s finding on this issue is incorrect.\nThere is no practice in complaints at the Tribunal that the AG be substituted as the respondent when a federal government department is originally named as the respondent. In fact, the proposed substitution is highly irregular and totally illogical.\nThis part of the Motion is also too late, and the proposed substitution would prejudice the Complainant as he would not know what roles DFO and PSC would take at the hearing, nor the rules governing them at the hearing.\nThe Treasury Board Secretariat\u2019s Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification (\u201cTreasury Board Policy\u201d) provides how the CLPA is to be applied. Paragraph 8 of the Treasury Board Policy states the role and responsibilities of the Department of Justice. Nothing in that section or anything else in the Policy mandates the AG to be the substituted respondent for Tribunal cases or for the Department of Justice to represent the substituted AG in such cases.\nThe Commission\u2019s Position\n[62] In its August 27, 2013 response to the Motion, the Commission did not oppose the Motion, on the understanding that \u201c\u2026the replacement of the Attorney General of Canada will make any potential order enforceable against it as it would be against the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada\u201d.\n[63] In its Reply, the Respondent stated that the Commission\u2019s position reflected a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of what the Respondent requests in its Motion, without clarifying the misunderstanding. However, during the December 20, 2013 CMCC, he did so. Specifically, if the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s Motion, and the Complainant established his case at the hearing, if the Tribunal ordered the PSC and\/or the DFO to take any actions or make any monetary payments, the AG itself would not be required to internally take those same actions or make those payments. Respondent\u2019s counsel further clarified that the AG could and would ensure that the PSC and DFO complied with any such Tribunal order.\n[64] In its January 3, 2014 additional written submissions, the Commission stated that its understanding of the Respondent\u2019s Motion to replace the Respondent DFO with the AG also seeks to include the PSC, and any Tribunal order would be enforceable against the DFO and PSC, that is to say, against the Crown. It is on the specific circumstances of this Complaint and this Motion that in its August 27, 2013 response, the Commission did not object to the Respondent\u2019s Motion and still does not object to it.\n[65] The Commission also provided a 2-page list of Tribunal cases where the AG was the named Respondent without having been the discriminator. That list includes cases where the successful request to change the Respondent to the AG was made during the proceedings, and includes Lacroix.\n[66] Notwithstanding that the Commission does not object to the Respondent\u2019s Motion, the Commission makes the submissions set out below.\na) The CLPA does not in fact take a blanket approach in requiring all human rights complaints against federal government departments to name the AG as the respondent.\nb) The CLPA speaks to the litigation of torts. The Supreme Court of Canada held in Seneca College v. Bhaduria [1981] 2 S.C.R.181 (\u201cSeneca College\u201d) and in Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays (\u201cHonda Canada\u201d) that discrimination is not a tort. A complaint of discrimination must be dealt with by the statutorily-created human rights entities. In the federally-regulated employment and service sectors, the only recourse for human rights complaints is under the Act. Therefore because the Act creates the Commission and the Tribunal, a federal human rights complaint is not a \u201cproceeding\u201d under the CLPA.\nc) Section 21, CLPA refers to the Federal Court and provincial Superior Courts as the appropriate forums for claims brought against the Crown. The CLPA is silent regarding administrative proceedings, and complaints at the Tribunal are administrative proceedings.\nd) Although the Department of Justice Act, RSC 1985, c. J-2 (\u201cDept. of Justice Act\u201d) gives the AG \u201c\u2026the regulation and conduct of all litigation for or against the Crown or any department in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of Canada\u201d, it does not mandate that any such litigation against the Crown must name the AG as respondent or defendant.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Administration Act\n[67] The purpose of the Financial Administration Act is described above its section 1 as being: \u201c[A]n Act to provide for the financial administration of the Government of Canada, the establishment and maintenance of the accounts of Canada and the control of Crown corporations.\u201d\n[68] Its purpose is therefore financial and human resource governance, not judicial governance. It sets out Schedules classifying portions of the federal government as departments, agencies and Crown corporations, but that is for the overriding purpose of finances, financial organization and human resource governance. It does not speak to how legal proceedings are to be taken.\nTreasury Board Policy\n[69] The Treasury Board Policy gives guidance on how and when the Treasury Board will provide legal assistance to and indemnify Crown servants for legal costs and protect them from personal liability if they are subject to legal claims or actions. One of the purposes of the Treasury Board Policy is to \u201c\u2026protect the Crown\u2019s interest and its potential or actual liability arising from the acts or omissions of its Crown servants\u2026\u201d (Treasury Board Policy, section 5.1).\n[70] Notwithstanding that section 8.2\u2019s enumeration of the responsibilities of the Department of Justice does not include the AG as the substituted respondent whenever a federal department is sued or there are proceedings against it, that section must be seen in the context of the Treasury Board Policy\u2019s purpose, which is to protect the Crown\u2019s interests and its potential or actual liability, and one of the ways it does so is to set out this policy. Its purpose is not to set out or describe statutory legal concepts. It does not mention the CLPA.\n[71] Further, Treasury Board Policy is not a statute of Canada \u2013 it is not legislation. It is made pursuant to section 7 of the Financial Administration Act. It is a policy used for guidance and information. It does not have the authority of legislation or of decided case law.\n[72] The reasons the style of cause named the AG as respondent in Tremblay are not contained in that case. I therefore cannot give Tremblay much weight, except to note that the respondent is the AG.\nHuman Rights Act\n[73] The Human Rights Act itself does not define the word \u201cperson\u201d. Therefore, one has to see if that definition can be found by inquiring into Parliament\u2019s intent by reading the word and the provisions in which it is in, in context and in its plain and ordinary meaning, but together with the scheme and object of the Act (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General)), 2011 SCC 53. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada also stated that in interpreting human rights legislation, one has to \u201c\u2026be mindful that it expresses fundamental values and pursues fundamental goals\u201d (ibid). The Court further stated that human rights legislation must be interpreted liberally and purposively so that the rights set out are given their full recognition and effect.\n[74] The scheme of the Act shows that:\n(a) complaints are filed against a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d (s. 40(1);\n(b) the \u201cperson\u201d against whom the complaint is made has the right to participate at the Tribunal (s.50.1);\n(c) the Tribunal can make an order \u201cagainst the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice\u201d (ss.53(2), (3);\n(d) the Act binds Her Majesty in right of Canada (s.66(1).\n[75] Based on this scheme, \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the Act, includes Her Majesty in right of Canada. That enables the Tribunal to make orders against Her Majesty.\n[76] In looking at the purpose of the Act, the strong language of section 2 reveals that the Act\u2019s goal, in summary, is to promote the ability of every individual to achieve \u201cthe life he or she is able and wishes to have\u201d by providing each such individual an equal opportunity to do so, without being hindered by discrimination and discriminatory practices. It seeks both to remedy such discrimination should that discrimination be established, and to prevent it (CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission, [1987] 1 SCR 1114).\n[77] The Tribunal is part of the Act\u2019s scheme and objectives. The purpose of its adjudication is to ensure that the objects of the Act \u2013 remedying and preventing discrimination - are implemented. To do this, the Tribunal should interpret any ambiguity in the Act in a way that furthers, rather than frustrates, the Act\u2019s objectives (Bell Canada v. CTEA 2003 SCC 36, at para.26).\nCrown Liability and Proceedings Act (\u201cCLPA\u201d)\n[78] The CLPA\u2019s descriptive statement above its section 1 describes it as \u201c[A]n Act respecting the liability of the Crown and proceedings by or against the Crown\u201d.\n[79] Although it does not mention administrative proceedings specifically, and seems to restrict the subject of litigation against the Crown in Ontario to \u201ctorts\u201d, it contains no definition of \u201cproceedings\u201d. I find because it is described as an Act about the liability of the Crown and proceedings by or against the Crown, the provisions of the CLPA can be referred to and applied to further the section 2 objects of the Human Rights Act.\n[80] Section 2, CLPA defines the \u201cCrown\u201d as being \u201cHer Majesty the Queen in right of Canada or a province\u201d.\n[81] Section 2.1 defines person. \u201cFor the purposes of sections 3 to 5, \u201cperson\u201d means a natural person of full age and capacity, other than Her Majesty in right of Canada\u2026\u201d.\n[82] Sections 3 to 5 of the CLPA deal with the liability of the Crown.\n[83] Departments, commissions and other entities in the federal government are not legal \u201cpersons\u201d under the CLPA, and cannot bring or respond to legal proceedings in their own name unless their constituting statutes give them that authority. They are also not persons within the meaning of the Human Rights Act. They are emanations of the Crown, which in turn is Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada or a province. Much of the cited case law, particularly at the Tribunal, confirms this, as does Gravel in the Federal Court.\n[84] The Crown is therefore a single entity, because it is embodied in the person of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada. The non-person federal government departments, commissions and other institutions are parts of the Crown, which is the person of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada. The DFO and the PSC are parts of the single Crown.\n[85] However, section 2.1, CLPA, exempts the person of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada from liability. Section 66(1) of the Human Rights Act provides that the Act is binding on the Queen in right of Canada. Further, the Human Rights Act requires that a \u201cperson\u201d be the Respondent. These are seemingly conflicting provisions.\n[86] But the CLPA does not exempt the Crown itself from liability.\n[87] Section 23(1), CLPA deals with proceedings, and provides the mechanism for proceeding against the Crown. Such proceedings may be taken in the name of the Attorney General of Canada, unless there is an Act of Parliament which authorizes the Crown entity to be named in proceedings.\n[88] Therefore, to obtain a remedy against the federal departments who are part of the Crown, which in turn is Her Majesty in right of Canada, in accordance with section 66(1) of the Human Rights Act, one names the Attorney General of Canada as respondent, in accordance with section 23(1) of the CLPA.\n[89] That is the interplay between the Human Rights Act and the CLPA which furthers the scheme, values and objects of the Human Rights Act by naming the Attorney General of Canada as the Respondent in the Complaint.\n[90] The cited cases, including those appended to the Commission\u2019s January 3, 2014 additional submissions, confirm that for the last several years, the Tribunal practice has been to substitute the AG when federal government departments have originally been named as respondents.\n[91] The Lacroix decision (supra) decided that the named Respondent should be the AG, and no recital describing the entity represented by the AG should come after the AG\u2019s name in the style of cause. Notwithstanding Lacroix, in this Complaint, the DFO and PSC are the emanations of the Crown which are at the heart of the Complaint \u2013 the DFO because of the Complaint\u2019s allegations that it failed to accommodate his disability in a staffing process which used the \u201cright fit\u201d standard and practice, and the PSC because it is responsible for the design and implementation of the \u201cright fit\u201d standard and practice which it delegates to the DFO to apply, and which the Complaint alleges systemically discriminated and discriminates against both him and other individuals who share his disability.\n[92] Therefore, for all the above reasons, the Attorney General of Canada should be substituted as the Respondent, and the style of cause will also recite that the AG represents the emanations of the Crown which are the Public Service Commission of Canada and the DFO. This does not run counter to the fact that the AG is the named Respondent. Having the style of cause read in this manner is done for the sake of both the clarity and the transparency of the inquiry.\nX. Former Deputy Minister as a Respondent\nThe Complainant\u2019s Position\n[93] Although the Complainant has not made a motion on this issue, he has frequently submitted in his materials that the Respondent should be Claire Dansereau, who was Deputy Minister (\u201cDM\u201d) of DFO at the time of the incidents alleged in the Complaint.\n[94] In his Response to the Respondent\u2019s Motion, the Complainant added Ms. Dansereau\u2019s name to the style of cause, so that Respondent is shown as \u201cClaire Dansereau, FISHERIES AND OCEANS CANADA \u2013 Respondent (DFO)\u201d. In other parts of his Tribunal materials, he has stated that Ms. Dansereau should be added as a Respondent, and is the correct Respondent in law.\nHe bases his position on the following:\nthe Complaint originally specified her by name as the Respondent;\nshe is a \u201cperson\u201d in accordance with the Act and the Rules;\nshe was the person responsible for the DFO\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate the Complainant and for its implementation of the \u201cright fit\u201d policy;\nthe DFO is not a legal person;\nthe Complainant had informed Ms. Dansereau, among others, of his dissatisfaction with DFO\u2019s accommodation procedure;\nMs. Dansereau knew about the accommodation issue and the discrimination, and did not, as far as the Complainant knows, do anything to stop the latter; and\nShe was personally aware of and corporately responsible for the impugned conduct of DFO personnel, as set out in the Complaint.\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n[95] In its reply submissions on the motion, the Respondent objects to Ms. Dansereau being named as a party. The Respondent asserts that she was not acting outside her employment nor in any personal capacity in any matter related to the Complaint, but was only acting as an employee of the Crown. The AG represents the Crown, and therefore there is no need to add Ms. Dansereau as a party.\nCommission\u2019s Position\n[96] The Commission made no submissions on this issue.\nAnalysis\nProcedure\n[97] As set out above, Rule 8(3) applies to the procedure required when a complainant, respondent or the Commission wishes to add another party to the inquiry. Compliance with Rule 8(3), particularly that part of the Rule which requires service of the motion on the prospective party, giving that party notice of the proceeding, and the part of the Rule entitling the prospective party to make submissions on the motion, ensure that the prospective party has the opportunity to know what the matter is about and to speak to the issue of its being added - before the Tribunal decides whether or not the prospective party should be named as a party.\n[98] In other words, the prospective party is entitled to natural justice, which includes the opportunity to be heard before a decision is made that directly affects its interests. Being added as a respondent party in respect of a Human Rights Act inquiry can have significant consequences. It would be a breach of natural justice to simply name someone as a party to an inquiry, with all the obligations and consequences that entails, without first giving them proper notice of the order being sought, and then providing them with a full and ample opportunity to both know the issues facing them, and also make submissions to the Tribunal on the matter. This is especially so in the current circumstances, when the individual no longer occupies the DM position at DFO; she may not even be aware of this proceeding, including the Complainant\u2019s wish to add her as a party.\n[99] The Complainant has not served Ms. Dansereau with a Notice of Motion informing her of the fact that he wishes to add her as a respondent, which Notice would entail her being given the opportunity to make submissions to the Tribunal on the issue. The Complainant has therefore not complied with Rule 8(3) regarding his request to name Ms. Dansereau as a party.\n[100] Further, even though the Respondent made brief objections to adding Ms. Dansereau, I am not persuaded that these objections mean that Rules 8(3) and 3(1) were complied with. I am unable to infer from these objections that the Respondent notified Ms. Dansereau of the request, and that it has a mandate to make submissions on her behalf.\n[101] For the above reasons, I cannot in the present circumstances consider whether to add Claire Dansereau as a respondent to this Complaint.\nXI. Order\nThe Respondent in this Complaint shall be identified as: \u201cAttorney General of Canada (representing the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Public Service Commission of Canada)\u201d, effective immediately.\nIf the Complainant wishes to add Ms. Claire Dansereau or any other person as a party to the Complaint,\nhe shall comply with Rules 3(1) and 8(3);\nhe may use as his Notice of Motion a letter addressed to the prospective party, setting out the relief he seeks. In any event, the Notice of Motion shall clearly indicate the coordinates of the Registry Officer assigned to this case, to whom administrative enquiries bout the filing of materials may be addressed;\nhe shall attach to the Notice of Motion, a copy of this Ruling, the Complaint Form, all Statements of Particulars which have been filed, and any other material the Complainant wishes to include in his motion;\nhe shall serve the prospective party, the Respondent and the Commission with the items referred to in subparagraphs 2(b) and 2(c), and file them with the Tribunal, within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Ruling;\nthe prospective party, the Commission and the Respondent shall serve and file their Response to this Rule 8(3) motion within fourteen (14) days of the date on which they were served by the Complainant;\nthe Complainant shall serve and file his Reply, if any, on the Commission, the Respondent and the prospective party within seven (7) days of his receipt of the Responses referred to in subparagraph 2.e) above.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 6, 2014\n",

Introduction [1] The Complainant, Shelley Annette MacEachern (the \u201cComplainant\u201d), is an employee of Correctional Service Canada (the \u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cCSC\u201d) and describes herself as a diabetic. On May 7, 2012, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the \u201cAct\u201d], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCHRC\u201d) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into a complaint by the Complainant against CSC. The Complainant alleges discrimination in employment, pursuant to section 7 of the Act, on the basis of her disability, diabetes.\n[2] The Respondent brought a motion for disclosure of various records from the Complainant. The Complainant also sought to amend the list of remedies she is seeking in this matter. The following ruling is with regard to these motions.\nII. Background [3] The Complainant filed a complaint with the CHRC on July 6, 2010 alleging that on or around early January of 2010, CSC refused her employment as a Correctional Officer (a \u201cCX-1\u201d) in the Grande Cache Institution (\u201cGCI\u201d) as a result of her medical condition, diabetes.\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s position is that the decision not to offer the Complainant employment as a CX-1 was based on a report from Health Canada regarding the Complainant\u2019s fitness for employment as a CX-1 in the context of her diabetes. According to the Respondent, Health Canada found the Complainant able to work as a CX-1, but with restrictions on that work. On April 14, 2010, the Respondent says it provided the Complainant with a letter indicating it could not accommodate those restrictions and that she would therefore not be offered employment as a CX-1.\n[5] The Complainant\u2019s position before the Tribunal has been that the decision of the Respondent to rely on the Health Canada report and, in the alternative, the failure of the Respondent to accommodate her based on the restrictions set out in that report, constitutes discrimination under the Act.\n[6] The Complainant was, at the time of the Respondent\u2019s decision not to employ her as a CX-1, and has continued to be, employed by the Respondent in a CR-4 position at the GCI. For a period between October of 2012 and August of 2014 the Complainant was on disability from that position, allegedly for matters unrelated to her diabetes.\nIII. The Respondent\u2019s disclosure motion [7] On May 4, 2014, the Respondent filed a motion seeking production of various records it argues are relevant to this matter. In person submissions were made with respect to this motion on August 7, 2014 in Grand Cache, Alberta.\n[8] The records sought by the Respondent generally fall within four categories.\n[9] The first category is medical records relating to the supervision, management and treatment of, or making note or mention of, the Complainant\u2019s diabetes from the time period of 2006 up to and including the time the decision was made not to offer her employment as a CX-1. The Complainant\u2019s position is that the Respondent is not entitled to the records requested on the basis that they are not relevant to the matter and violate her privacy rights.\n[10] The second category of documents is medical records from the time period of 2010 up to and including present that include any information related to the supervision, management and treatment of, or making note or mention of, the Complainant\u2019s diabetes; and, any other medical records related to the Complainant\u2019s claim for damages, including reinstatement of leave credits and pain and suffering The Complainant\u2019s position is again that these records are not relevant as they deal with her health after the time the decision was made not to offer her the position as a CX-1.\n[11] The third category of records requested is the file or records related to the Complainant\u2019s disability claim and any medical records related to treatment associated with that disability claim. The Complaint\u2019s position is that these records are not relevant as her disability claim was unrelated to her diabetes.\n[12] The fourth category includes an updated Alberta Health Services Statement of Benefits Paid for the period of January 2013 to the present. The Complainant\u2019s position is that her health status after the decision not to employ her as a CX-1 is not relevant and therefore this category of records is not subject to production.\nIV. Ruling [13] Pursuant to section 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. To be given this opportunity, parties require, among other things, the disclosure of arguably relevant information in the possession or care of the opposing party prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing. For that reason, if there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, it should be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42 [Guay]; Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 28; and, Seeley v. Canadian National Railway, 2013 CHRT 18, at para. 6).\n[14] However, the request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \"fishing expedition\". The documents requested should be identified with reasonable particularity. That is, the request should not subject a party or a stranger to the litigation to an onerous and far-ranging search for the documents (see Guay, at para. 43).\n[15] The facts giving rise to this complaint, according to the Complainant, are that she has type 1 diabetes and applied for a position as a CX-1 in the fall of 2009. She completed training between September and December of 2009. During this time, she was also subjected to a medical assessment by Health Canada as to her medical fitness for the CX-1 position. As part of that assessment, Health Canada was provided with medical information from several of the Complainant\u2019s medical providers. The Complainant was cleared by Health Canada to work as a CX-1 but with restrictions. Health Canada provided a further amended report that again cleared the Complainant to work as a CX-1 but with remaining conditions, including that she was not to work alone or work night shifts.\n[16] The Complainant has put her health in issue in this matter. In particular, she has put in issue whether her diabetes can be argued to have restricted the scope of work she was able to do in 2009 and 2010 and is currently able to do. She takes issue with the Health Canada report and its restrictions on her ability to work as a CX-1, but she is also challenging the decision of CSC not to consider medical or other records, in addition to the report of Health Canada, in their review of her medical suitability for employment as a CX-1 in late 2009 and early 2010.\n[17] As a result, I find the first category of records relating to the supervision, management and treatment of, or making note or mention of, the Complainant\u2019s diabetes from the time period of 2006 to the time of the Health Canada assessment in April 2010 arguably relevant and subject to disclosure. The records are arguably relevant to the question of the Complainant\u2019s diabetic status prior to and at the time of the Health Canada assessment.\n[18] The records to be produced in this category also include records for any supervision, management and treatment of, or making note or mention of, the Complainant\u2019s diabetes by treatment providers not already listed by the Complainant, if any.\n[19] It should be noted that although the list of medical practitioners provided by the Complainant is extensive, the Complainant agreed in her response submissions to this motion that some of these records are arguably relevant. Several of the physicians listed appear to work from a single office and likely require production of only a single medical file.\n[20] While the first category of medical records deal primarily with the Complainant\u2019s historical health status, the second category deals with her health status after the alleged discrimination and on an ongoing basis. The Complainant has confirmed that the loss of income she is claiming is limited to the difference between the amounts that she would have earned as a CX-1 and the amounts she did earn as a CR-4, whether in disability payments or income. However, the Complainant is seeking both lost income and that she be placed in the CX-1 position. In argument, the Complainant has taken the position that her diabetes is not a bar to her ongoing employment as a CX-1 and that she continues to challenge the restrictions set out in the Health Canada report as it relates to her request for future employment as a CX-1. Her position is that she should be placed in a CX-1 position without restrictions, regardless of the directions in the Health Canada report; or, alternatively, that any such restrictions should be based on further assessment by CSC into her medical condition. The Complainant also seeks reinstatement of leave credits, including sick leave credits, and compensation for pain and suffering. Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s health status following the alleged discrimination and on an ongoing basis has also been placed in issue.\n[21] As a result, I am of the view that the second category of medical records from the time period of the April 2010 decision regarding the Complainant\u2019s employment as a CX-1 up to and including the present that include any information related to the supervision, management and treatment of, or making note or mention of, the Complainant\u2019s diabetes, along with any other medical records related to the Complainant\u2019s claim for damages, including reinstatement of leave credits and pain and suffering, are arguably relevant and subject to disclosure. These records include the records of those physicians already listed by the Complainant, from the time period of 2010 to the present, as well as the records of any treatment providers not already listed by the Complainant, if any.\n[22] The third category of records is the Complainant\u2019s disability claim file and medical records related thereto. The Complainant was on a disability leave from her position as a CR-4 from the period of October 2012 to August 2014. It is significant that the Complainant is not seeking to recover for loss of income for that period but instead for the difference between disability benefits she would have received as a CX-1 and that which she received as a CR-4. Nonetheless, while the Complainant states that her diabetes played no role in that disability claim, the Respondent is entitled to test that position. Further, the Complainant has been and continues to seek employment as a CX-1 without restriction and her ongoing health status is arguably relevant to that requested remedy.\n[23] As a result, I am of the view that the third category of records, including the Complainant\u2019s disability claim file and any medical records related to treatment associated with that disability claim, are arguably relevant and subject to disclosure.\n[24] The fourth category of documents for which the Respondent seeks production is an updated copy of the Complainant\u2019s Alberta Health Care Statement of Benefits Paid up to and including the present date. For the same reasons given above for the relevance of the Complainant\u2019s ongoing medical records, this fourth category of records is arguably relevant and subject to disclose and production.\nV. Directions related to the privacy of the medical and disability records [25] The obligation of the Complainant to disclose arguably relevant documents as set out above must, however, be balanced by her legitimate privacy concerns particularly as it relates to medical and disability records.\n[26] The Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to his or her medical records (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 CanLII 61851 (CHRT), at para. 7 [Beaudry]; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (CHRT), at para. 3 [McAvinn]). However, that right to privacy and confidentiality may cease when that person puts his or her health in issue (see McAvinn, at para. 4; Guay, at para. 45; Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 9, at paras. 9-11; see also Frenette v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1992 CanLII 85 (SCC); and M. (A.) v. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (SCC) [M. (A.)]). That said, \u201cthe need to get at the truth and avoid injustice does not automatically negate the possibility of protection from full disclosure\u201d (M. (A.), at para. 33). In cases where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has usually put conditions on the disclosure to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information, such as restricting who may see and copy them (see for example Guay, at para. 48; McAvinn, at paras. 19-20; Beaudry, at paras. 7 and 9; Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al., 2012 CHRT 11, at para. 19; Rai v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2013 CHRT 6, at para. 37; and, Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22, at para. 15).\n[27] Therefore all documents disclosed pursuant to this ruling are subject to the following restrictions:\n(1) The documents shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondent only, and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to the Complainant.\n(2) Counsel for CSC shall use the documents to prepare for the hearing of this matter and to communicate with his client to seek any instructions necessary. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry.\n(3) Any medical records unrelated to the monitoring, treatment or management of the Complainant\u2019s diabetes, or unrelated to her remedial claims (reinstatement of leave credits; pain and suffering, etc.), shall be redacted from the disclosed materials.\n[28] The Tribunal will schedule a case management conference call to discuss the process of gathering and disclosing the documents subject to this ruling.\nVI. Amendment of the remedies sought by the Complainant [29] In response to the present motion, the Complainant sought to amend the remedies she requests in this matter. The Respondent, at the hearing of this matter, did not take a position in opposition but raised only that some of the remedies sought may not be within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to grant and that the Respondent was in no way restricting its ability to make arguments regarding these remedies at the hearing of this matter. That is, the Respondent\u2019s willingness to allow the amendment of the remedies is in no way an admission as to the appropriateness of said remedies.\n[30] Given the submissions of the Complainant and the Respondent\u2019s reply, the Complainant\u2019s request to amend her list of remedies expressly to reflect those set out in her materials dated May 23, 2014 is granted.\nSigned by\nRicki Johnston\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 23, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1823\/5312\nStyle of Cause: Shelley Annette MacEachern v.

Motion to dismiss\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a Motion filed by the Respondent dated September 15, 2014, seeking an order dismissing the complaint. The Respondent\u2019s grounds for the motion are that the Complainant failed to comply with his disclosure obligations, that he repeatedly failed to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and that both the Tribunal and the Respondent have been frustrated in their efforts to move this case forward due to the conduct of the Complainant. The Respondent alleges it is an abuse of process to allow this complaint to proceed.\n[2] For the reasons given below, I grant the Respondent's motion and dismiss the complaint.\n[3] The complaint in this matter was filed with the Commission by the Complainant on September 29, 2010. On April 24, 2012, pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cCHRA\u201d), the Commission requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into the complaint. The Complainant alleges Westower Communications Ltd. discriminated against him on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and colour, by treating him in a different manner as compared to other employees and, ultimately, terminating his employment, contrary to sections 7 and 14 of the CHRA. Specifically, the complaint alleges that in the course of his employment with the Respondent, during the period of September 2007 to April 2010, he was subject to derogatory racial comments by co-workers. His complaint suggests he believes he was ultimately terminated because he complained to management about these comments.\n[4] Having been requested to institute an inquiry into the matter, on May 8, 2012, the Tribunal wrote to all parties inquiring whether they wished to participate in the alternative mediation process. A deadline to respond by May 30, 2012 was given. All parties confirmed in a timely manner that they wished to participate.\n[5] On June 20, 2012, the Tribunal emailed the parties, confirming that all parties agreed to proceed to mediation settlement conference. The Tribunal provided two deadlines to the parties:\nII. Background\n(a) By June 28, 2012, parties were required to confirm their availability; and\n(b) By July 29, 2012, parties were required to provide their mediation brief.\n[6] On June 26, 2012, the Commission provided its mediation brief and on June 27, 2012, the Commission advised the Tribunal of its available dates.\n[7] On June 27, 2012, Westower advised its available dates and submitted its mediation brief.\n[8] On June 28, 2012 Mr. Mattice advised the Tribunal of his available dates and advised that his mediation brief and applicable documents would be submitted shortly. Mr. Mattice did not submit his mediation brief by the deadline of July 29, 2012.\n[9] On September 10, 2012, the Tribunal sent an email to all parties confirming that mediation briefs had been received from the Respondent and the Commission, but not from the Complainant.\n[10] On November 27, 2012, the Tribunal sent an email to Mr. Mattice inquiring about his mediation brief, which had still not been submitted.\n[11] On December 5, 2012, Mr. Mattice advised the Tribunal that he would produce his mediation brief by December 28, 2012. He also informed the Tribunal that he had not received its earlier correspondence. Accordingly, the Tribunal then sent copies of documents and correspondence to Mr. Mattice by courier to ensure his records were complete.\n[12] December 28, 2012, arrived and Mr. Mattice had still not produced his mediation brief.\n[13] On January 23, 2013, Mr. Mattice contacted the Tribunal and advised that by February 5, 2013, he would produce his mediation brief.\n[14] February 5, 2013, arrived and Mr. Mattice had still not produced his mediation brief.\n[15] On April 25, 2013, the Tribunal informed the Commission and the Respondent that it had again spoken with Mr. Mattice, who agreed to produce his mediation brief the following day.\n[16] April 26, 2013, arrived and Mr. Mattice had still not produced his mediation brief.\n[17] On July 26, 2013, the Tribunal set a new deadline of August 12, 2013 for Mr. Mattice to produce his mediation brief, failing which, a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) would be scheduled.\n[18] August 12, 2013, arrived and Mr. Mattice had still not produced his mediation brief.\n[19] On November 15, 2013, the Tribunal advised the parties that Mr. Mattice had still not provided his mediation brief. The Tribunal sent a letter to the parties on November 26, 2013. Although a CMCC was set up for January 21, 2014, it did not proceed.\n[20] On January 17, 2014, the Tribunal informed the parties it had again spoken with Mr. Mattice, who had promised to provide his mediation brief that same day.\n[21] Mr. Mattice did provide a written statement about his situation as a visible minority on January 17, 2014.However, the Tribunal advised him this statement was inadequate to be used as a mediation brief and encouraged him to provide something more substantial.\n[22] On March 6, 2014, Mr. Mattice provided a very short brief for the mediation, about one paragraph in length.\n[23] The mediation settlement conference occurred on May 14, 2014 but was unsuccessful.Consequently, the complaint proceeded to the disclosure and Statement of Particulars stage of the Tribunal\u2019s process.\n[24] On May 15, 2014, the Tribunal wrote the parties, setting deadlines for the production of the Statements of Particulars and disclosure of documents. The Tribunal instructed Mr. Mattice to produce that documentation by June 23, 2014, and the Respondent was instructed to provide its Statement of Particulars in response by July 14, 2004.\n[25] June 23, 2014, arrived and Mr. Mattice had not produced a list of disclosure documents nor his Statement of Particulars.Prior to the deadline, he had not contacted the Tribunal or any other party to seek an extension of the deadline.\n[26] In a letter dated June 24, 2014, the Tribunal reminded Mr. Mattice of his disclosure obligations. Mr. Mattice did not respond to this letter.\n[27] On July 10, 2014, Westower wrote to the parties and requested that the Tribunal set a deadline for Mr. Mattice to produce his Statement of Particulars and to provide disclosure of documents. Westower also put the parties on notice that if Mr. Mattice continued to fail to meet the time lines set by the Tribunal, Westower would bring an application to dismiss the complaint for want of prosecution.\n[28] On July 17, 2014, the Tribunal set a new deadline of September 2, 2014, for Mr. Mattice to produce his Statement of Particulars and to provide disclosure of documents. The Tribunal also requested that all parties provide their availability for a CMCC by July 18, 2014.\n[29] On July 28, 2014, the Tribunal confirmed to all the parties that the CMCC would take place on August 26, 2014.\n[30] On August 21, 2014, the Tribunal Registry Officer spoke to Mr. Mattice and reminded him of the CMCC coming up the following week and of his obligation to complete his Statement of Particulars and document disclosure by September 2, 2014. Mr. Mattice indicated he would be in attendance for the CMCC and did not indicate any difficulty in meeting the September 2, 2014 deadline.\n[31] On August 26, 2014, the CMCC occurred as scheduled. However, Mr. Mattice failed to attend the CMCC without explanation. The Registry Officer attempted to contact him by telephone that morning. On one occasion, Mr. Mattice\u2019s phone rang for a long time without answer. A few minutes later, when the call was re-attempted, Mr. Mattice\u2019s phone rang twice and then was forwarded to its voicemail. Mr. Mattice had not provided prior notice that he would not be in attendance for the CMCC.\n[32] Mr. Mattice did not provide his Statement of Particulars or the disclosure of documents by the deadline of September 2, 2014.\n[33] On September 4, 2014, the Tribunal wrote the parties to inform them that it had spoken with Mr. Mattice, who agreed to produce his Statement of Particulars and to provide his disclosure of documents on that same day.\n[34] By the end of the day on September 4, 2014, Mr. Mattice had still not provided his Statement of Particulars or disclosure of his documents.\n[35] On September 5, 2014, the Tribunal confirmed to the other parties that Mr. Mattice had still not provided his Statement of Particulars and that he had not provided disclosure of documents.\n[36] On September 15, 2014, the Tribunal received a copy of the Motion of the Respondent for dismissal of the complaint for want of prosecution.\n[37] A copy of the Respondent\u2019s Motion for dismissal was sent to Mr. Mattice by email on September 15, 2014 at 4:45pm. The Registry Officer subsequently spoke to Mr. Mattice by telephone and advised him of the Motion and that it was imperative for him to respond to it.\n[38] In order to ensure that Mr. Mattice received a copy of the Motion for dismissal, a professional process service company was engaged by the Tribunal. On October 20, 2014, Mr. Mattice was served with a printed copy of the Motion for dismissal and a letter from the Tribunal dated October 6, 2014, advising him that he had 7 days from the date of service to reply to the enclosed Motion.\n[39] Mr. Mattice did not reply to the Motion for dismissal by October 27, 2014 or at any time thereafter.\n[40] The Respondent argues that Mr. Mattice has repeatedly failed to comply with his disclosure obligations and failed to comply with the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure. Westower alleges this is wilful and deliberate conduct on the part of Mr. Mattice and, therefore, it would be an abuse of process to allow his complaint to proceed.\n[41] The Tribunal is entitled to protect its process from abuse (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81at para. 15, aff'd Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363). In Labelle v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 CHRT 4, the Tribunal canvassed the principles applicable to a motion to dismiss for a failure to actively pursue the complaint (at paras. 73-88). The Tribunal may dismiss a complaint where the case has remained static for an unreasonable length of time, due to a \u201cwholesale disregard\u201d for the time limits set by the Tribunal, such that the delay constitutes an abuse of the Tribunal's process (see Tourangeau v. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation, 2008 CHRT 2 at para. 8; and, Johnston v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2007 CHRT 42 at paras. 29-34).\n[42] In my view, Mr. Mattice has shown a wholesale disregard for the time limits set by the Tribunal and has abused its process.\n[43] He failed to meet his deadline for filing a mediation brief five times. He did not request an extension of any of these deadlines and each passed without notice from him that they would not be met.\n[44] Mr. Mattice failed to submit his Statement of Particulars twice. Again, without a request for an extension or notice from him.\n[45] He also failed to participate in a CMCC organized primarily to address his noncompliance. Mr. Mattice had four weeks\u2019 notice of the CMCC and a telephone call reminder a few days prior.\n[46] Finally, despite being made aware of the Respondent\u2019s Motion to dismiss, Mr. Mattice did not avail himself of the opportunity to respond to the Motion.\n[47] Rule 1(5) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure provides that dates and time limits set by the Tribunal are mandatory:\nIII. Analysis\n1(5) Unless the Panel grants an extension or an adjournment, all time limits for complying with these Rules and all dates set for a hearing, a motion or a case conference are peremptory.\n[48] Mr. Mattice did not request adjournments or extensions of time for filing his mediation brief, attending the CMCC on August 26, 2014, or meeting the deadlines for his Statement of Particulars and disclosure of documents requirements. He did not even provide a response to this motion to dismiss his complaint.\n[49] In the normal course, a Tribunal file will proceed to mediation within 3-6 months of referral, based on the agreement and availability of all involved. Generally, barring preliminary issues, Statements of Particulars are exchanged and dates for a hearing are determined within a year of referral. This complaint goes far beyond the Tribunal\u2019s usual timeframe and there have not been any preliminary issues or other circumstances that have arisen. Nor has the Complainant provided any sort of explanation for his repeated failure to abide by timelines.\n[50] The complaint was referred to the Tribunal on April 24, 2012. From there, after failing to meet his deadline for filing a mediation brief five times, it took Mr. Mattice two years to get to mediation. Following an unsuccessful mediation, and despite the Tribunal\u2019s efforts, it has now been another six months since Mr. Mattice was asked to produce a Statement of Particulars and disclose his case for hearing. Approaching three years since the complaint was referred to the Tribunal, there is still no indication that it will proceed to a hearing anytime soon. In my view, this complaint has remained static for an unreasonable length of time due to the Complainant\u2019s disregard for the time limits set by the Tribunal and should be dismissed on this basis.\n[51] In addition, the Tribunal is mandated to conduct its proceedings informally and expeditiously, to allow for an efficient, fast and economical way for Canadians to access recourse under the CHRA (see s. 48.9(1)). The Canadian human rights system is designed toensure not only respect for the human rights of individual complainants, some of whom are the most vulnerable amongst us in society, but also to uphold some of the fundamental values of our society as a whole. In this regard, while the Tribunal gives due consideration to accommodating the needs of self-represented parties to allow them the full and ample opportunity to present their case, it will not do so to the detriment of the other parties or the Tribunal. While conducting its proceedings informally and expeditiously, at the same time, the Tribunal is obliged to respect the principles of natural justice. That is, the Tribunal owes a duty of fairness to all parties.\n[52] It would not be impossible to imagine a party to a complaint deliberately drawing out proceedings simply for the purpose of inflicting financial damage to the other party, with the knowledge that every delay or missed deadline simply adds to the cost of being named in the matter. Long, drawn out legal proceedings can be a costly affair for the parties. In particular, if a party to a complaint has retained outside legal counsel, for every delay, every missed deadline, every adjourned case management call, every time a matter must be addressed a second, third and fourth time, there is a real financial cost to the party. Along with delay and ensuring compliance with its procedure, the Tribunal must guard against this possible abuse of process as well.\n[53] As a result, the complaint is dismissed because Mr. Mattice has refused to actively pursue his complaint.\nIV.

Background\n[1] In a complaint filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) dated April 21, 2007, the complainants claim to be victims of discrimination based on their race. The Commission referred the complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) on August 19, 2008.\n[2] In their complaint, the complainants indicate that they are teachers at the Natashquan Reserve and that they feel they do not have the same benefits as some non\u2011Aboriginal teachers who work there.\n[3] They further submit in their complaint that in their profession, some individuals allegedly earn a better pay owing to the fact that they are non-Aboriginal, and yet, the complainants are performing the same work as they are.\n[4] They argue that this situation exists because the Conseil de bande des Montagnais (the respondent herein) is made up of men who are [Translation] \u201care paid generously and when they run out of money to pay themselves, it is common practice for them to dip into the education funds\u201d (see the complainants\u2019 complaint, page 1).\n[5] Specifically, the complainant accuses the respondent of engaging in differential treatment against them in favour of non-Aboriginal teachers who were hired by the respondent by granting certain isolated post allowances, annual trip allowances and housing allowances.\n[6] For its part, the respondent responds to the complainants\u2019 arguments by indicating that the allowance amounts mentioned above are based on the concept of residence and not on race.\n[7] Consequently, the respondent alleges that there is no prima facie evidence adduced by the complainants regarding their complaint and, accordingly, the respondent asks that it be dismissed.\n[8] Moreover, even if the Tribunal were to uphold the complaint on the basis of the criteria established by the case law, the respondent alleges that it would suffer undue hardship in light of its significant deficit for the years in question. Consequently, the complainants\u2019 complaint cannot succeed on that ground as well.\n[9] For the reasons expressed in this decision, it is my intention not to uphold the complainants\u2019 complaint.\nII. The facts\nA. Complainants\u2019 evidence\nRodrigue Wapistan\n[10] As first witness, the complainants called Rodrigue Wapistan, Chief of the Natashquan Aboriginal community since 2002.\n[11] Mr. Wapistan also stated that he was the community\u2019s Director General until 2004.\n[12] Mr. Wapistan informed the Tribunal that the community has 1,100 members on-reserve and close to 300 members living outside the boundaries of the same reserve.\n[13] In his testimony, Mr. Wapistan confirmed to the Tribunal that the Natashquan Aboriginal community receives grants from Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (Aboriginal Affairs) and that the community\u2019s financial situation is precarious. In that regard, he confirmed that a co-manager had to be appointed to help the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan to better manage its deficits.\n[14] He also confirmed to the Tribunal the squalid and deplorable housing conditions in the community. He indicated that there is overcrowding in terms of the availability of living space, which causes social problems for families and youth in the community. He confirmed that three to four families may be living under the same roof.\n[15] During his term as Director General, between 2002 and 2004, the complainants\u2019 file, relating to housing allowance issues, was entrusted to him. That is when the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan decided to transfer the file to their counsel.\n\u00c9velyne Malec\n[16] As first witness, the complainant, \u00c9velyne Malec, provided the Tribunal with her testimony.\n[17] She initially indicated to the Tribunal that she is a teacher at Uauitshitun School, which is located in the Innu community of Natashquan (for further reference, see document entitled [Translation] \u201cNutashquan and the Northern Plan\u201d dated March 2012 in Exhibit P-1, tab 1).\n[18] Ms. Malec holds a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Early Childhood Education and in Elementary Education as well as the following certifications:\n- Teacher\u2019s Certificate;\n- Specialized graduate degree in psychosocial intervention in an educational environment;\n- Certificate in Aboriginal Studies;\n- Certificate in American Indian Studies;\n- Diploma of Collegial Studies.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4.)\n[19] Ms. Malec lives in an area of Natashquan known and designated Pointe-Parent, a small community of 50 people. She does not live directly in the Natashquan community as she is married to a non-Aboriginal, Richard Boies, and also because there are very few housing unitswithin the community.\n[20] Ms. Malec has been teaching at the Uauitshitun School since 2001 and, prior to 2001, she worked at the Commission scolaire de la Moyenne-C\u00f4te-Nord where she allegedly obtained all required isolated post allowances and retention bonuses.\n[21] Ms. Malec testified that the she duly filed a complaint with the Commission owing to the fact that non-Aboriginal teachers had advantages over her, and that in this regard she felt devalued.\n[22] In her testimony, she reviewed the Human Resources policy for Uauitshitun School employees, as it was the subject of an agreement between the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan and the employees at the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan in June 2005 (see Exhibit P-1, tab 6, at page 314). In citing the Human Resources policy, the complainant referred to paragraph 10.7, which pertains to the isolated post allowances granted to non-resident teaching staff and professional employees, and to paragraph 10.8, which deals with allowances for annual trips granted to non-resident employees. She also referred to paragraph 10.9, which covers moving allowances for non-resident employees, and paragraph 10.10, which concerns housing allowances for non-resident employees. In all of these cases, the complainant indicates that she did not receive any of the amounts mentioned.\n[23] Similarly, the complainant referred, in her testimony, to the agreement between the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan and the employees at the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan (see Exhibit P-1, tab 7), which was signed in May 2005 by all teachers, including the complainant.\n[24] Again, the complainant indicated that she did not receive the isolated post allowances found in the said document.\n[25] Ms. Malec also referred to 2003-2004 when she was dismissed by the Conseil de bande de Natashquan, and filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code for unjust dismissal. That complaint was the subject of an arbitral award dated July 27, 2004 (see Exhibit I-1, tab 57).\n[26] In that arbitral award, the adjudicator concluded that the political and financial climate during the 2002-2003 school year had been challenging, at a time when the respondent was dealing with budget constraints.\n[27] The complainant was successful in that arbitral award and obtained a re-hiring order with the payment of certain employment income.\n[28] Following that order, the parties signed a release on August 19, 2004, which included a number of terms of payment and of reinstatement of the complainant in her teaching position at the Uauitshitun School (see ExhibitP-1, tab 11). The complainant indicated that the document was signed by Antoine Ishpatao and Gilles Auclair, co-manager for BDL, who was responsible for the recovery of the respondent\u2019s financial situation at the time.\n[29] Also, with respect to the $20,000, the complainant submitted that she did not receive the $1,000 per month, as specified in the release, for quite some time and that she had to pursue legal action in the Court of Qu\u00e9bec against the respondent to obtain said amounts (see Exhibit P-1, tab 12).\n[30] At the end of her examination, the complainant indicated that she wants to be recognized as a professional who works in a remote location in the same manner as all non-Aboriginal teachers.\n[31] Thus, she wants to receive payment of the isolated post allowances from 2001, with the exception of 2003-2004, to present.\n[32] She is also seeking moral damages for loss of self-esteem, considering that she did not feel valued by the respondent.\n[33] In cross-examination, the complainant, \u00c9velyne Malec, referred to the fact that she has been married to Richard Boies for 22 years. Mr. Boies is also a teacher at the Uauitshitun School.\n[34] When he was hired, Mr. Boies lived in L\u00e9vis, Quebec. Ms. Malec indicated in her testimony that Mr. Boies has been receiving isolated post and housing allowances since 2001. It was also in 2001, after posing questions to Mr. Boies, that the complainant found out that he was indeed receiving those allowances. She therefore contacted non-Aboriginal faculty members of the Uauitshitun School and realized that they were also entitled to the allowances as they resided in remote locations.\n[35] The complainant\u2019s sister, Anna Malec, also apparently told her that [Translation] \u201cin the good old days\u201d, i.e. in 1970-1980, there were isolated post allowances for Aboriginal teachers. This situation existed prior to the taking over of the education sector by the Aboriginal community, that is to say, the Conseil de bande.\n[36] Baffled by why she was unable to obtain payment of the two allowances, i.e. isolated post and housing, the complainant decided to file a complaint with the Commission.\n[37] It is worth noting that over the course of her cross-examination, the complainant admitted that there was a shortage of staff at the Uauitshitun School. She also indicated that when she was hired, she lived one or two kilometres from the Innu community of Natashquan, that is, in Pointe-Parent, near Natashquan.\nB. Cross-examination of the primary complainant\nThe other complainants\n[38] Following the complaint filed by complainant \u00c9velyne Malec on April 21, 2007, the complaint was also signed by other complainants, Sylvie Malec, Anne Bellefleur Tettaut, Estelle Kaltush, Marceline Kaltush, Anna Malec, Monique Ishpatao and Germaine M\u00e9t\u00e9nap\u00e9o. It should be noted that Ms. M\u00e9t\u00e9nap\u00e9o did not testify at the hearing.\n[39] Each complainant who testified before the Tribunal noted her particular circumstances with regard to her schooling and her years of service with the respondent.\n[40] I gather from those testimonies that none of them received the isolated post or housing allowance. All these individuals expressed to me an interest in obtaining payment of said isolated post and housing allowances, with moral damages considering the effect of the prohibited discrimination of which they were allegedly victims.\n[41] I also gather from their testimonies that allowances at issue were paid to the non\u2011Aboriginal teaching staff from outside the area, but not to faculty members living in the Natashquan Aboriginal community.\n[42] Thus, I take the liberty of summarizing the testimonies of the other complainants by limiting myself to their main characteristics.\nSylvie Malec\n[43] Sylvie Malec possesses the following academic credentials:\n- Teacher at the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan in Innu since 2002;\n- Secondary V and a DEC;\n- A second certificate in Aboriginal languages.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4)\n[44] It should be noted that Sylvie Malec has dependent children.\nAnne Bellefleur Tettaut\n[45] Anne Bellefleur Tettaut worked as a teacher in the Innu language and has been retired since 2007. She is originally from the Natashquan reserve and possesses the following academic credentials:\n- A certificate in education sciences and a teaching permit.\n(See ExhibitP-1, tab 4)\n[46] She also has three dependent children, and two other children who were placed in her care.\nEstelle Kaltush\n[47] Estelle Kaltush held the position of principal of Uauitshitun School for 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. Prior to that, she was a teacher and vice-principal and held the position of educational assistant in early 1985. Ms. Kaltush possesses the following academic credentials:\n- A bachelor\u2019s degree in education and a certificate in education sciences, and a teaching permit.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4)\n[48] Prior to the taking over of the education sector by the Conseil de bande in 1989-1990, Ms. Kaltush was under the jurisdiction of Aboriginal Affairs which supposedly paid her isolated post allowances. After the year 1990, she no longer received isolated post or housing allowances. She has always lived in the Natashquan Aboriginal community.\n[49] In the years during which she was a teacher, she had two dependent children.\n[50] Ms. Kaltush was questioned about a document dated February 21, 2007, addressed to Mr. Boies, the complainant \u00c9velyne Malec\u2019s spouse (see Exhibit P-1, tab 19).\n[51] Ms. Kaltush testified that she did not participate in the study conducted by the Conseil de bande that led to this document.\n[52] Today, as the school\u2019s principal, Ms. Kaltush is responsible for the administration of the allowances. She confirmed to the Tribunal that it is necessary to reside outside a radius of 50 kilometres from the reserve to obtain payment of the isolated post and housing allowances.\n[53] She also confirmed to the Tribunal that she participated in the recruitment of faculty and that it was not easy to recruit new faculty members given the resources available within the Aboriginal community, as well as the difficulties in understanding the Innu language.\nMarcelline Kaltush\n[54] Marcelline Kaltush has been a teacher at Uauitshitun School for 28 years and lives in the Innu community of Natashquan, that is, on the reserve.\n[55] Ms. Kaltush possesses the following academic credentials:\n- A certificate in education sciences;\n- A teaching certificate;\n- A teaching permit;\n- A bachelor\u2019s degree in education.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4)\n[56] She also confirmed to the Tribunal that she has had dependent children since the 1990s.\nAnna Malec\n[57] Anna Malec is a preschool teacher at the school who is a member of the Indian reserve of Natashquan. She has been teaching for close to 40 years.\n[58] She confirmed to the Tribunal that between 1973 and 1990, she worked for Aboriginal Affairs and was responsible for the education sector. She was receiving isolated post allowances at the time.\n[59] In 1990, upon the taking over of the education sector by the Conseil de bande, the isolated post allowances were cut. She confirmed to the Tribunal that she built her home on the Indian reserve of Natashquan.\n[60] In terms of education, Ms. Malec possesses the following academic credentials:\n- A certificate in education sciences;\n- A teaching permit;\n- A teaching certificate;\n- A bachelor\u2019s degree in education.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4)\n[61] Ms. Malec has had four dependent children since 1990.\nMonique Ishpatao\n[62] Monique Ishpatao is a teacher at Uauitshitun School on the reserve she is also originally from.\n[63] Ms. Ishpatao possesses the following academic credentials:\n- A certificate in education sciences;\n- A teaching permit;\n- A teaching certificate;\n- A bachelor\u2019s degree in education.\n(See Exhibit P-1, tab 4)\n[64] She has a dependent child who still lives with her.\n[65] The child was allegedly adopted the traditional way, that is to say, without any legal formalities.\n[66] As last witness, the complainants called Richard Boies, who is the spouse of \u00c9velyne Malec, the primary complainant in this case.\nRichard Boies\n[67] Richard Boies has been a teacher at Uauitshitun School since he came to this school in fall 1990.\n[68] He has been married to \u00c9velyne Malec for about ten years, and has been in a relationship with Ms. Malec since 1992.\n[69] He is originally from L\u00e9vis.\n[70] At the time of his hiring, he was paid in accordance with the standards and conditions provided for in his contract of employment, in addition to the isolated post and housing allowances since 1990.\n[71] His residence is located in Pointe-Parent, Quebec. It borders the land area of the Natashquan reserve.\n[72] Mr. Boies indicated that, in the past, he had had difficulties in dealing with the Conseil de bande which did not want to award him payment of his isolated post and housing allowances in light of the fact that he lived with an Aboriginal woman, Ms. Malec. He referred, in that regard, to a contract of employment (see Exhibit P-1, tab 21) that he was provided with for the 2007-2008 school year, but which he refused to sign because the contract did not include the allowances to which he claimed to be entitled.\n[73] Mr. Boies challenged the contract in Court, after which the isolated post and housing allowances were paid to him, payments which continue to present for he has an indeterminate contract.\n[74] However, based on the current administration of the allowances, Mr. Boies testified that he was going to lose those benefits because he is a resident of the Aboriginal community and is resides within a radius of 50 kilometres from the Natashquan reserve.\n[75] Considering that he lives in the same area as the complainants, that he performs the same work as them, he is of the view that complainants should be afforded the same benefits as non\u2011residents.\n[76] Mr. Boies testified that, based on his discussions with his colleagues, there has always been dissatisfaction on the part of staff members over the unfair distribution of the isolated post and housing allowances by the Conseil de bande. When he confronted the Conseil de bande about this dissatisfaction, he was allegedly told that there was not enough money and that it was impossible to pay such allowances to everybody.\n[77] According to Mr. Boies, there are recruitment problems within the Natashquan Aboriginal community and there are still positions to be filled. There are also apparently teachers who lack the requisite qualifications to teach.\nC. Respondent\u2019s evidence\nJacques Tanguay\n[78] Mr. Tanguay has lived in Natashquan since 1996. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in secondary education, teaching and administrative qualifications. He has also been assigned to Uauitshitun School.\n[79] Mr. Tanguay testified that there is salary disproportionality between the teachers of Roger-Martineau School (referred to as the [Translation] \u201cwhite school\u201d) in Natashquan and Uauitshitun School.\n[80] He confirmed to the Tribunal the difficulties in recruiting teachers at the Innu school by indicating that a number of them went to work at Roger-Martineau School.\n[81] He indicated to the Tribunal that there was a comprehensive contract for the payment of teachers\u2019 wages and that said comprehensive contract distinguished between residents and non\u2011residents. In that regard, there were isolated post and transportation allowances for trips and said allowances had often been the subject of discussions. As for the dissatisfaction among teachers not awarded allowances, he always referred to the Conseil de bande as it had the authority to make final decisions.\n[82] In his testimony, Mr. Tanguay confirmed that there were differences in treatment between residents and non-residents, but not between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Apart from salary issues, there were no differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.\nAndr\u00e9 Leclerc\nMr. Leclerc works as an education consultant in the municipality of Schefferville and at the Conseil des Atikamekw.\n[83] He was a teacher, then a counsellor in Sept-\u00celes, and he participated in an assessment of the Natashquan school in 2006-2007 (see Exhibit I-35).\n[84] He has always been very involved in the Aboriginal community. In 1985-1986, he took over the administrative management of Uauitshitun School as part of an acquisition of autonomy by Aboriginal communities and the implementation of the Ministry of Education\u2019s program.\n[85] With respect to Exhibit I-1, tab 35, which is the report on the assessment of educational services at Uauitshitun School in Natashquan, the assessment in question was conducted for purposes of accountability so as to determine whether services were properly performed. An analysis of the school\u2019s management appears on page 48 of the report. The report shows a high turnover rate of administration and high absenteeism of students, as well as a lack of standards and regulations of which there are various interpretations. Mr. Leclerc also confirmed that personnel files are mismanaged, which explains the frustration of teachers.\n[86] In September 2007, the school\u2019s administration was handed over to him.\n[87] He further confirmed that BDL was appointed third party manager of the reserve of the Aboriginal people of Natashquan.\n[88] Mr. Leclerc was questioned about a document entitled [Translation] \u201cHuman Resources Policy Management; Specific Clauses on Education\u201d, dated November 2007 (see Exhibit P-1, tab 24). In response to a question about clause 4.9 of the document and the definition of the term [Translation] \u201cresident\u201d, Mr. Leclerc stated that the isolated post and housing allowances existed for the purposes of recruiting new teachers who came from outside the Aboriginal reserve. He indicated that other Aboriginal communities had also adopted the same policies.\n[89] He explained to the Tribunal that BDL managed the entire program whereas he managed the staff on pedagogical matters with Estelle Kaltush. Thus, he also confirmed that the teachers\u2019 salary grid set forth in Appendix \u201c1\u201d of Exhibit P-1, tab 24 was prepared by BDL and adopted by the Conseil de bande de Natashquan.\n[90] In June 2008, he stepped down as school principal.\n[91] In cross-examination, in response to a question by the complainants\u2019 representative, the witness stated to the Tribunal that in the duties and working conditions portion of the report (see page 17 of the report in Exhibit I-1, tab 35), there was no distinction between an Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal teacher.\n[92] Also, in reference to the findings and recommendations found in Chapter 7.2 of the same report, the witness indicated to the Tribunal that he was unable to effect a change of direction, considering the lack of cooperation and the widespread frustration among school staff. He confirmed that there are significant deficiencies in many aspects of Uauitshitun school, and that in this regard [Translation] \u201cthe students are not receiving the educational services to which they are entitled\u201d (see section 7.2, first paragraph, at page 47 of Exhibit I-1, tab 35). In the face of Uauitshitun School\u2019s many challenges, he confirmed that exemptions were granted to allow teachers to teach even though they did not have all the requisite qualifications owing precisely to recruitment issues.\n[93] He confirmed that there was an intergenerational conflict, especially at the secondary school level, which helped to precipitate some of the issues that led to frustration, having regard to the salary cuts applied. In that regard, he confirmed the existence of interrelational problems between BDL and school staff, and the Conseil de bande. That was the situation in June 2007.\n[94] As regards the existing frustrations with the employer, the witness indicated to the Tribunal that there had been conflicts with certain employees and that those conflicts remained considering that certain employees opposed the planned salary cuts by the third party manager and the Conseil de bande.\n[95] Genevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit is a retired teacher. However, she taught in Aboriginal communities for almost 40 years.\n[96] She married an Aboriginal person in 1972 and therefore acquired Aboriginal status through marriage. She had been divorced for at least one year when she testified.\n[97] During the years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, she worked at Uauitshitun School. She was contacted at the time by Alice Kaltush as a teaching position had become available.\n[98] In her testimony she referred to Exhibit I-1, tab 20, which is a new employment form that she completed with her employer, the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan.\n[99] Subsequently, Ms. Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit was questioned about her indeterminate employment contract for 2006-2007 (see Exhibit I-1, tab 14).\n[100] At that point, she confirmed to the Tribunal her non-resident status within the Natashquan Aboriginal community, and that in that regard she was entitled to the isolated post, housing and trip allowances.\n[101] When questioned about the existence of isolated post allowances, Ms. Taschereau\u2011N\u00e9ashit confirmed that the same policy existed in other Aboriginal communities and that, in her view, this situation was absolutely normal.\nGenevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit\nJules Wapistan\n[102] Jules Wapistan has been the respondent\u2019s Human Resources Director since August 2014. He has been on the Conseil de bande since 1979 and has performed various administrative functions within the Aboriginal community.\n[103] In his testimony, Mr. Wapistan confirmed to the Tribunal that the Conseil de bande has a co-manager who was required by Aboriginal Affairs given the fragile financial situation of the Aboriginal community.\n[104] He stated that this situation had existed since 1995-1996 and that in 2006, a third party manager was appointed. Said appointment was made on the basis of ratios imposed by Aboriginal Affairs which indicated that the Aboriginal community\u2019s financial status was precarious.\n[105] Thus, BDL was appointed third party manager from 2006 to 2009 and made a number of proposals in bankruptcy to various suppliers to reduce their debts.\n[106] He also confirmed to the Tribunal that the third party manager\u2019s mandate came from Aboriginal Affairs, which managed the community\u2019s budget and had the final say on management decisions within the community.\n[107] In 2009, there was a change in co-manager. A new accounting firm, Malette, was appointed. It continued the work begun by BDL, which had developed management policies to help attain a balanced budget.\n[108] Also, Mr. Wapistan drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Exhibit I-1, tab 32, which identified a recovery plan that was accepted by Aboriginal Affairs on November 30, 2006.\n[109] On the same date, he confirmed that he was the coordinator for the implementation of the recovery plan and he indicated that the plan was implemented, referring to the resolutions appearing in tabs 36 to 39 of Exhibit I-1.\n[110] In response to the budget cuts to be imposed to achieve a balanced budget, the 50 kilometre rule was introduced in 2006 to determine who was a resident and a non-resident in granting isolated post and housing allowances against which the complainant filed complaints.\n[111] Said policy was reportedly suggested by the third party manager BDL, which, at the time was co\u2011manager with the respondent. For seven years, the same policy was continually applied. As for the respondent\u2019s financial situation as of the date of the hearing of these proceedings, Mr. Wapistan confirmed to the Tribunal that the budget for the last fiscal year as at March 31, 2014, is still running a deficit.\n[112] Between March 31, 2007, and March 31, 2014, there were only two years where surpluses were generated.\n[113] When also questioned about another document related to an assessment report of Uauitshitun School, dated April 2009, by an ad hoc committee (see Exhibit P-1, tab 25), Mr. Wapistan stated that some recommendations were adopted while others could not be. In that regard, their application was the responsibility of the Conseil de bande and a councilor, Nicolas Wapistan, was appointed in that respect.\n[114] More specifically, Recommendation No. 5 at page 12 of the document, with respect to a harmonization of the salary policy for the education sector with that of the region\u2019s provincial schools, without discrimination on the basis of race or origin, could not be applied (see Recommendation No. 5).\n[115] Consequently, Mr. Wapistan indicated to the Tribunal that he had heard about the complaints over the allowances when he and BDL came to Uauitshitun School in 2007. At that time, a meeting was held among Aboriginal teachers at which they sought the same benefits as non-Aboriginal teachers. At the end of his examination-in-chief, Mr. Wapistan confirmed that there had been benefit cuts for teachers who were no longer considered to be non-residents.\n[116] Finally, Mr. Wapistan confirmed his agreement pertaining to Exhibit P-1, tab 1, which is a document entitled [Translation] \u201cNutashquan and the Northern Plan\u201d and which takes stock of the Natashquan community\u2019s needs. The document is dated March 2012. In that regard, he confirmed the acute shortage of housing identified.\n[117] Also, he agreed with the portion of the document on education (see paragraph 2.1 of Exhibit P-1, tab 1), and considers that the ability of the community to pay is limited. Consequently, he confirmed the respondent\u2019s position [Translation] \u201cthat it cannot pay any more\u201d.\n[118] The complainants\u2019 representative submits that payment of the isolated post and housing allowances should be awarded to the complainants from 1989-1990 to present given the discrimination in the respondent\u2019s rules and policies.\n[119] In addition, the complainants\u2019 representative claims moral damages for all of the complainants considering the loss of self-esteem and injury to their dignity, and argues, once again, that the Tribunal ought to put an end to the discrimination alleged in the complaint.\n[120] As for \u00c9velyne Malec, the representative claims on her behalf full compensation for the isolated post and housing allowances for 1989-1990 until present.\n[121] As for the existence of allowances as such, the representative indicates to the Tribunal that prior to 1989, the allowances were paid to everyone, to Aboriginal people and non\u2011Aboriginal people in a lump-sum amount.\n[122] In 1989, when the Conseil de bande took over the education sector by, some changes occurred.\n[123] Between 1989 and 2007, the complainants' representative indicated that there were no allowances for Aboriginal people, which disappeared at the time, but that there were allowances for non-Aboriginal people.\n[124] He submits that over time, some non-Aboriginal people settled in the Natashquan community, but that they continued to keep their allowances whereas Aboriginal residents did not have any. Hence, the alleged discrimination.\n[125] In 2005, he noted a change with a third party manager in place, that is, BDL.\n[126] He noted that the releases that had been the subject of a settlement between the complainants and the Conseil de bande were cut and the allocation terminated.\n[127] Also, he confirmed a meeting with Mr. Wapistan and BDL, notice of which was issued to BDL.\n[128] In 2007, a new policy was developed.\n[129] To conclude, the complainants\u2019 representative indicates\nIII. Summary of the parties\u2019 arguments\nA. Complainants\u2019 arguments\n[Translation]\n- that the complainants feel discriminated against;\n- that there is no succession of teachers to educate the Natashquan Aboriginal nation;\n- that the complainants had to file complaints at various levels to obtain reimbursement of certain sums of money owing to them following contractual issues with the respondent;\n- that they wish to end salary discrimination by doing away with the isolated post and housing allowance policies.\nB. Respondent\u2019s arguments\n[130] The respondent\u2019s representative indicates to the Tribunal that the issue is whether there is discrimination regarding allowances, i.e. isolated post and housing allowances. He also indicated that I did not have to determine whether or not the salary policies adopted were justified.\n[131] Also, the respondent\u2019s representative submits that a prima facie case of discrimination, contrary to sections 3 and 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act), has not been established.\n[132] He submits that the policy at issue does not discriminate are the basis of race or ethnic origin. The distinction it creates is rather based on the scope of the definition of residence on the Indian reserve. In that regard, he referred to the various definitions in the documents in Exhibit P-1, at tabs 6, 7 and 24, regarding the various definitions of the terms [Translation] \u201cresident\u201d and [Translation] \u201cnon-resident\u201d.\n[133] Consequently, he submits that no prima facie case of discrimination has been established based on all of the evidence filed before the Tribunal.\n[134] However, if I were to conclude that such a prima facie case was established, he submits that there would be supporting evidence as to the presence of significant financial constraints in the Natashquan Aboriginal community. Thus, there would be adequate justification in reply to the alleged discrimination.\n[135] In that regard, he referred to the respondent\u2019s precarious financial situation that has existed since 2005-2006 and that persists today. In this sense, he contends that the same policy regarding the financial recovery process applied was adopted not only in the education sector, but also in the health sector of the Natashquan Aboriginal community. The same budgetary restrictions were also applied to the school\u2019s support staff, which also did not receive isolated post allowances (see Exhibit I-1, tab 30, at page 3).\n[136] Finally, the respondent asserted the existence of releases (see Exhibit P-1, tab 11) and, in this respect, the complainants allegedly waived their remedy for compensation. Consequently, he indicated that I cannot not go back prior to August 19, 2004, to seek compensation for the complainants.\n[137] Thus, if an order of relief is issued by the Tribunal, it would have to be retroactive to 2004-2005 or later, where applicable.\n[138] As a last resort, the respondent\u2019s representative indicates that I may limit the relief sought by the complainants even where there was no prescription with respect to their remedy.\n[139] He indicated that the complaints date back to 2007 and that some complainants did not complain, not even to their husbands, as the husbands could have been band chiefs. He therefore asked me to take into account the complainants\u2019 conduct in this case.\n[140] After having considered the evidence adduced by the parties in this case, and their arguments, I conclude that the complainants\u2019 complaint cannot be upheld for the following reasons.\n[141] Indeed, the complainants explained to the Tribunal that they consider themselves to be victims of discrimination by the respondent because they did not obtain, like some non\u2011Aboriginal teachers, payment of certain allowances, i.e. isolated post allowances, annual trip allowances and housing allowances.\n[142] In their written complaint, dated April 21, 2007, the primary complainant, \u00c9velyne Malec, stated in particular [Translation]: \u201cwhen I am working, I feel devalued because I am not entitled to the same benefits as non-Aboriginal teachers.\u201d\n[143] Indeed, the essence of the complainants\u2019 complaint, for which the hearing was held and in which all of the complainants made their claim to the Tribunal, is further defined as follows: the complainants want to obtain the same pay benefits as non-Aboriginal teachers who were recruited to teach at Uauitshitun School in the Natashquan Aboriginal community.\n[144] In support of their pay claim, the complainants allege that they were victims of discrimination owing to their race.\n[145] Thus, the Tribunal notes that the complainants are of the view that the provisions of section 3 of the Act were purportedly violated on the basis of race or national or ethnic origin.\n[146] In that regard, it is therefore useful to reproduce the provisions of section 3 of the Act, which reads as follows:\nIV. Analysis\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n(2) Where the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed to be on the ground of sex.\n[147] At the hearing, the parties did not refer to the other provisions of the Act in describing that certain other discriminatory acts were committed against them.\n[148] Upon analysis, it appears to the Tribunal that the provisions of section 7 pertain more specifically to the allegations made by the complainants. In that regard, the complainants stated to me that they felt disadvantaged over the course of their employment by certain provisions contained in the administrative policies adopted by the respondent.\n[149] Consequently, I restate the provisions of section 7 of the Act, which read as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[150] In their statement of particulars and remedies sought, dated January 30, 2009, the same allegations are made against the respondent. The complainants argue as follows:\n[Translation]\nthere is a long history of a state of affairs that has existed for years where Aboriginal women do not have the same pay benefits as non-Aboriginal people. This state of affairs is common knowledge and has always been a way to reduce expenses. Making pay conditions fair for all would have led to a significant increase in salary budget. Thus, there is greater tolerance of the situation even though it is unfair. It has therefore been a long-standing practice in the administration of our band to adopt a policy that upholds wage discrimination. Pay benefits are awarded to non-Aboriginal people but not Aboriginal people.\n(See paragraph 4, page 3 of the statement of particulars and remedies sought dated January 30, 2009.)\n[151] Such is therefore the essence of the complainants\u2019 complainant that was filed with the Commission and which the Tribunal must now consider.\n[152] In other words, are the administrative policies adopted by the respondent, which is purportedly the source of the differential treatment alleged by the complainants, covered by the provisions of sections 3 and 7 of the Act?\n[153] To provide a better understanding of the source of the differential treatment of which the complainants allege to be victims, the Tribunal must refer to the documents that are at the root of this differential treatment.\n[154] Thus, throughout the hearing of this case, three documents were cited to the Tribunal to determine the source of the alleged discrimination. It is therefore necessary to refer to the main provisions giving rise to the complainants\u2019 complaints against the respondent.\n[155] In the first document, entitled [Translation] \u201cHuman Resources Policy - Employees at Uauitshitun School\u201d and dated June 2004, reference is made to the fact that an agreement was allegedly entered into between the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan and the employees of Uauitshitun School in Natashquan in June 2005 (see Exhibit P-1, tab 6, page 314):\n[Translation]\n4.14 Place of residence\nResidence in the legal sense of the term at the time of hiring, insomuch as the residence is located in the province of Quebec.\n4.15 Resident\nAny person working for the Council whose ordinary and main place of residence and\/or that of his or her spouse is Nutashkuan or is less than 50 km from Nutashkuan shall be considered a resident within the meaning of the employment policy of the Council.\nThe employee's residence status may change during the course of employment and the Council reserves the right to reassess the residence status of its employees in the education sector yearly.\n(Section 55 of the Canada Elections Act defines place of ordinary residence as: \u201cThe place of ordinary residence of a person is the place that has always been, or that has been adopted as, his or her dwelling place, and to which the person intends to return when away from it.\u201d)\n10.7 Isolated post allowance for non-resident teaching staff and professional employees\na. The annual isolated post allowance is credited to the employee in 26 bi\u2011monthly payments at the pay period.\nb. The rate of the annual isolated post allowance is granted to the employee based on whether the employee has at least one dependent (dependent minor child) who resides permanently at the workplace residence or is considered without dependents.\nc. Rate of isolated post allowance:\nWith dependent child(ren): $6,000\nWithout dependent child: $3,000.\n10.7.1 If two employees are married or are common-law spouses, only one of the two may claim the isolated post allowance with a dependent child (if the conditions are met) and the other employee shall receive the allowance for an employee without a dependent child.\n10.8 Allowances for annual trips for non-resident employees\na. Three (3) annual trips at the following times or by special authorization from the school's administration:\n1st trip: Start date at the beginning of the year and departure for vacation.\n2nd trip: Christmas\n3rd trip: Easter or spring break.\nb. The allowance for annual trips is as follows, depending on the where the non-resident employee was hired and is for a return trip:\nMontr\u00e9al, $950; Qu\u00e9bec, $750 and Sept-\u00celes, $300.\nN.B.: Allowances for other locations, shall be pro-rated to adjust for the distance from the closest city indicated above.\nc. The payment will be made at least five working days before the effective date of the annual trip.\n10.9 Moving allowances for non-resident employees\na. The allowance is paid to the employee at the time of hiring and at the end of the employee\u2019s employment relationship with the Conseil des Innus de Nutashkuan. The employee\u2019s moving allowance at the end of the employee\u2019s employment relationship shall be paid on the condition that he or she has maintained at least six months of continuous and full-time employment at Uauitshitun School.\nb. The amount of the allowance varies according to city of residence at the time of the employee\u2019s hiring and the allowance for the other cities not mentioned (50 km outside of Nutashkuan) shall be prorated based on select cities:\nMontr\u00e9al, $1,500; Qu\u00e9bec, $1,000 and Sept-\u00celes, $700.\nc. Reimbursement shall be issued upon submission of supporting documentation of relocation accompanied by the duly completed form.\nd. When two employees are married or common-law spouses, the moving allowance is only granted to one of the members of the couple.\n10.10 Housing allowance for non-resident employees\n10.10.1 Monthly allowance\nThe Council grants a monthly housing allowance to non-resident employees on the following terms:\n10.10.2 Monthly allowance: $450\n10.10.3 When two non-resident employees are common-law spouses or married persons, they shall receive a single allowance of $450.00. The employee is responsible for his or her own rent and lease.\n10.10.4 When two employees live in the same residence, a single housing allowance is granted and half is paid to each member occupying the residence.\n10.10.5 When the Council rents one of its unheated and furnished units, the monthly rent is $200.\n[156] The second document, entitled [Translation] \u201cAgreement between the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan and Employees at the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan\u2014Mutual Agreement on the Treatment of Employees at the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan\u201d, dated June 2005 and signed bythe school\u2019s employees (see Exhibit P-1, tab 7, page 358), provides as follows:\n3.13 Place of permanent residence?\nResidence in the legal sense of the term at the time of hiring, insomuch as the residence is located in the province of Quebec.\n[\u2026]\n6.5 Isolated post allowance to teaching staff with at least a bachelor's degree and to professional employees with the same level of education.\n6.5.1 The annual isolated post allowance is credited to the employee in 26 bi\u2011monthly payments at the pay period.\n6.5.2 The rate of the annual isolated post allowance is granted to the employee based on whether the employee has a dependent (minor dependent child) residing permanently at the workplace residence or is considered without dependents.\n6.5.3 Rate of isolated post allowance:\nWith dependent child(ren): $6,000\nWithout dependent child: $3,000.\nN.B.: If two employees are married or are common-law spouses, only one of the two may claim the isolated post allowance with dependent child (if the conditions are met) and the other employee shall receive the allowance for an employee without a dependent child.\n[\u2026]\n8.4 Allowances for annual trips for employees hired outside a 50 km radius.\n8.4.1 Allowances are provided for three annual trips.\n8.4.2 Except by special authorization from the school's administration, the schedule for trips is:\n1st trip: Start date at the beginning of the year and vacation departure\n2nd trip: Christmas.\n3rd trip: Easter or spring break.\n8.4.3 Amount of allowance\n8.4.3.I The allowance for annual trips is as follows, according to the city of residence at the time the employee was hired, and is for a round trip:\nMontr\u00e9al, $950; Qu\u00e9bec, $750 and Sept-\u00celes, $300.\n8.4.4.II For other locations, the allowance is adjusted based on the three cities with set allowances under the preceding paragraph.\n8.4.4 Payments occur at least 5 working days before the effective date of the annual trip.\n8.5 Moving allowances for employees from outside\n8.5.1 The allowance is paid to the employee at the time of hiring and at the end of the employee\u2019s employment relationship with the Conseil des Innus de Nutashkuan.\n8.5.2 The employee\u2019s moving allowance at the end of the employee\u2019s employment relationship is paid on the condition that he or she has maintained at least three months of continuous and full-time employment at Uauitshitun School during the school year.\n8.5.3 Amount of allowance\nThe allowance is as follows: $800 for everyone.\n8.5.4 When two employees are married or common-law spouses, the moving allowance is only granted to one of the members of the couple.\n8.6 Housing allowance\n8.6.1 The council provides a monthly housing allowance to employees according to the following terms:\n8.6.2 Monthly allocation: $500.\n8.6.3 When two or more employees share a domestic residence, the sharing must be proportional\n[157] Finally, a third document, entitled [Translation] \u201cHuman Resources Policy Management\u2014Specific Clauses on Education\u2014of the Conseil des Innus de Nutashkuan, November 2007\u201d (see Exhibit P-1, tab 24), provides as follows:\n4.9 Resident\nAny person working for the Council whose ordinary and main place of residence and\/or that of his or her spouse is located within 50 km of Nutashkuan, shall be considered a resident within the meaning of the employment policy of the Council.\nThe employee's residence status may change during the course of employment and the Council reserves the right to reassess the residence status of its employees in the education sector yearly.\n[\u2026]\n6.7 Isolated post allowance\n6.7.1 The isolated post allowance is credited to the employee in 26 bi\u2011monthly payments at the time of the pay period.\n6.8 Allowances for employee\u2019s annual trips\n6.8.1 Three (3) annual trips scheduled as follows or by special authorization from school management:\n6.8.2 First trip: Start of work at the beginning of the year and departure on holidays.\n6.8.3 Second trip: Christmas.\n6.8.4 Third trip: Easter or break week.\n6.8.5 The allowance for each annual trip for a non-resident is set at $750, including the outbound and return trip.\n6.8.6 The allowance will be paid at least 5 business days before the annual trip\u2019s effective date.\n6.9 Housing allowance\n6.9.1 The maximum annual housing allowance for a non-resident is $4,500 and is set on a pro-rata basis of 10 months, where appropriate.\n[158] A careful reading of each of three documents I referred to above reveals the existence of isolated post allowances for non-resident teaching staff and professional employees. The same is true for allowances for annual trips for non-resident employees and for the housing allowance.\n[159] The first document dated June 2005 (see Exhibit P-1, tab 6) defines the concept of residence, as shown in paragraphs 4.14 and 4.15. In that regard, main residence status and\/or that of his or her spouse is in Natashquan or less than 50 kilometres from Natashquan.\n[160] Clause 4.14 of the same document defines \u201cresidence\u201d in the legal sense of the term \u201cat the time of hiring\u201d, insomuch as the residence is located in the province of Quebec.\n[161] This administrative policy concerning residence was mentioned in the third document I cited, Exhibit P-1, tab 24, regarding the respondent\u2019s human resources policy management, dated November 2007.\n[162] Paragraph 4.9 again defines the concept of residence indicating as follows [Translation]: \u201cwhose ordinary and main place of residence and\/or that of his or her spouse is located within 50 km of Nutashkuan.\u201d\n[163] In this last document, in paragraph 6.9.1, the housing allowance may be paid to a non\u2011resident, based, of course, on the definition in paragraph 4.9 of the same document.\n[164] As for the agreement between the Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan and the employees of the Uauitshitun School in Natashquan (see Exhibit P-1, tab 7), it contains certain provisions in favour of employees hired outside a 50 km radius in the case of allowances for annual trips for employees (see paragraph 8.4) and moving allowances for employees from outside (paragraph 8.5). There is no such express provision for employees \u201cfrom outside\u201d in the case of the housing allowance (paragraph 8.6). In this last case, it would appear that the same policy was followed by the respondent and specifically applied to employees from outside (although the evidence is unclear on this latter point).\n[165] Therefore, the finding to be made is that residency was the criterion applied by the respondent to grant payment of the allowances the complainants are seeking and not race or national or ethnic origin.\n[166] However, it appears to me that residency is not one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination referred to in subsection 3(1) of the Act.\n[167] The complainants alleged, when they testified before me, that there was still discrimination between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, which was based on the fact that the allowances they are seeking to enforce were paid to individuals whose place of residence was not located within 50 km of Natashquan.\n[168] In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this is a moot point. Indeed, the real issue here is the one raised by the complainants as to whether or not an individual\u2019s place of residence was located within 50 km of Natashquan, as shown in the various documents I cited earlier, and not the disparities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.\n[169] In that regard, the Tribunal would like to point out that one of the respondent\u2019s witnesses, Genevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit, was a person residing outside a 50 km radius of Natashquan, but she held Aboriginal status through her former marriage to a non-Aboriginal man.\n[170] However, it appears that Ms. Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit was able to obtain the benefit of the isolated post, housing and trip allowances despite the fact that she was a non-resident Aboriginal (see Exhibits I-1, tab 14 and I-1, tab 20). Therefore, I cannot accept the complainants\u2019 argument that there is discrimination between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.\n[171] In support of this decision, I would like to refer to the following case law.\n[172] In McGill University Health Centre (Montr\u00e9al General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, at paragraph 49, the Honourable Justice Abella stated as follows:\n49 What flows from this is that there is a difference between discrimination and a distinction. Not every distinction is discriminatory. It is not enough to impugn an employer's conduct on the basis that what was done had a negative impact on an individual in a protected group. Such membership alone does not, without more, guarantee access to a human rights remedy. It is the link between that group membership and the arbitrariness of the disadvantaging criterion or conduct, either on its face or in its impact, that triggers the possibility of a remedy. And it is the claimant who bears this threshold burden.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[173] In another unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, the following is stated at paragraph 33 of the decision:\n[33] As the Tribunal properly recognized, to demonstrate prima facie discrimination, complainants are required to show that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the Code; that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to the service; and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent to justify the conduct or practice, within the framework of the exemptions available under human rights statutes. If it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to occur.\n[174] While I agree with the fact that the first two conditions have been met in reference to Moore, the third condition, a protected characteristic may have been a factor in the adverse impact, has not in my opinion.\n[175] Indeed, as I indicated earlier, residency is not one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination referred to in subsection 3(1) of the Act.\n[176] This reasoning was adopted in a decision of the Federal Court of Canada in Dobbin v. Canada (Department of Fisheries and Oceans), 2005 FC 2010, which reaffirmed the principle that a person\u2019s place of residence is not an enumerated ground of discrimination.\n[177] In that regard, I adopt the following paragraphs from Dobbin:\n[8] I find no reviewable error in the Commission's decision to refuse to deal with the Applicants' complaint pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(c) of the Act. Since a person's place of residence is not an enumerated ground of discrimination, it follows that the Commission would have no jurisdiction to enquire on alleged differential treatment of Newfoundland and Labrador fishers, as compared to the fishers in other provinces, based on quotas that were put into place by the Respondent. Distinction based on place of residence does not constitute a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Act. Clearly, the Act does not give the Commission statutory authority to investigage how a resident or a group of residents of one province or territory may be treated by a government department or federally regulated company as compared to how that organisation might treat a resident or group of residents of another province or territory.\n[9] There are numerous situations where individuals have been treated differently because of their \"place of residence\". This will not normally constitute a prohibited ground or distinction under human rights legislation. For example, in Nova Scotia Confederation of University Faculty Assn. v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), [1995] N.S.J. No. 296 (NSSC) (QL), the Nova Scotia Supreme Court reviewed a decision of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission to dismiss a complaint that was based on \"place of residence\". In that case, the basis for discrimination was that a differential fee was charged to foreign students by Universities in Nova Scotia. The Court upheld the finding of the Commission that the complaint was beyond its jurisdiction since the differential treatment was determined to be based on \"place of residence\". See also, Simon Fraser University International Students v. Simon Fraser University, [1996] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 13 (BCCHR) (QL).\n[10] Moreover, the Applicants' complaint fails to disclose any material fact suggesting that the Respondent's decision to refuse to provide the same fishing opportunity for CFA 16 to the Newfoundland based fishers may be motivated, in whole or in part, on the ground that the Applicants, as Newfoundlanders, are ethnically different or constitute a distinct group from the fishermen based in other provinces because of their national origin. The fact of the matter is that CFA 16 is managed by the Quebec Region. It appears that the allocation to the CFA 13 Quebec based fishers in CFA 16 in 2002 was a decision of the Respondent through consultation with the industry in the Quebec Region. While the Respondent has favoured the Quebec based fishers when it delivered the disputed quotas, the differential treatment is clearly based on their place of residence and not on their ethnicity or particular national origin.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[178] In another decision of the Human Rights Tribunal for British Columbia, in Gardezi (Gardezi v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, 2010 B.C.H.R.T. 262), the principles of Dobbin were reaffirmed.\n[179] In that regard, paragraph 40 of the decision states as follows:\n[40] Ms. Gardezi\u2019s complaint is, at its root, a complaint based on her last place of residence. Place of residence, standing on its own, is not a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[180] As a result, for the reasons just stated, I find that the complainants\u2019 complaint is unfounded in fact and in law and, on that ground alone, it is therefore dismissed.\n[181] Also, I would like to add that if I had come to the conclusion that a prima facie case was established, which this decision fails to recognize, the respondent, in my view, would have been successful in proving to the Tribunal that the administrative policies it applied do not appear excessive, particularly considering the respondent\u2019s financial conditions, which were described as [Translation] \u201ccatastrophic\u201d by witness Jules Wapistan.\n[182] I find, therefore, that the conduct and practices adopted by the respondent under the various administrative policies it adopted cannot be considered unjustified in this case, as noted by the Honourable Justice Abella in Moore of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[183] For all the reasons set out above, the complainants\u2019 complaint is therefore dismissed.\nV.

Background [1] The Complainant, Ms. Fallan Davis, in a complaint dated November 24, 2006, to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission), is asking that certain actions on the part of the representatives of the Respondent, namely, the Canada Border Services Agency (Respondent), be declared discriminatory on the basis of her race, age and sex, in violation of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act).\n[2] In that regard, certain incidents are alleged to have occurred on November 18, 2005, at the time the Complainant was questioned by officers of the Respondent upon returning from the United States by way of the Respondent\u2019s border crossing at Cornwall Island, Ontario.\n[3] The Complainant indicates in her complaint that she was allegedly stopped without warning and forced to stand outside her vehicle, without a coat, in the cold for a period of forty-five minutes.\n[4] She further mentions in her complaint that the officers on duty that day, who were part of the special unit known as Vehicule And Cargo Inspection System (VACIS), purportedly behaved in a racist and inappropriate manner with her.\n[5] In particular, she states that her Onkwehonwe Aboriginal identity was violated by the actions of the Respondent\u2019s officers.\n[6] In its response, the Respondent claims that the entire operation was part of a special operation that was being carried out at that time at the Respondent\u2019s border crossing on Cornwall Island, Ontario, in order to proceed with the verification of vehicles such as the one driven by the Complainant. The purpose of this operation was to check whether these vehicles contained secret compartments that could be used to move drugs, weapons or other contraband goods.\n[7] The operation conducted by the Respondent\u2019s officers on November 18, 2005, was apparently ordered by one of the Respondent\u2019s \u201cIntelligence\u201d officers working on Cornwall Island and required the presence of the VACIS team in order to proceed with the inspection of vehicles by scanner. This operation included inspections of vehicles such as SUVs, mini-vans, truck-trailers and other non-commercial vehicles.\n[8] According to the evidence heard before the Tribunal, it is therefore necessary to examine the behaviour of both the Complainant and the Respondent\u2019s representatives and verify whether the actions of the Respondent\u2019s representatives towards the Complainant provide a basis for the Complainant\u2019s complaint, as described above.\n[9] As this decision shall set out, it is my intention to uphold the Complainant\u2019s complaint.\nII. Facts A. Complainant\u2019s Evidence [10] On November 18, 2005, at approximately 10:30 in the morning, when the Complainant was going through the border crossing at Cornwall Island, Ontario, upon returning from the United States, she was instructed to pull over by officers of the Respondent in order to carry out an examination of her vehicle by scanner.\n[11] The Complainant told the Tribunal that, at the entrance to the border crossing, she normally uses the lane that is specifically reserved for Aboriginal residents of Cornwall Island. Before reaching her lane, she was summoned by the Respondent\u2019s officers to pull over to the lane normally used by commercial transport vehicles.\n[12] She further indicated to the Tribunal that she used the Cornwall Island border crossing daily, sometimes as often as ten times a day.\n[13] In addition, she told the Tribunal that November 18, 2005 had been a sunny day, but that it had been cold, about minus 6 degrees Celsius.\n[14] At the time she was pulled over, the Complainant indicated to the Tribunal that she recognized the first officer, namely, Officer Derek O\u2019Brien. He asked her whether she had any contraband cigarettes, alcohol, firearms or other goods, to which she responded in the negative to all of the questions. She then provided her driver\u2019s licence to Officer O\u2019Brien.\n[15] Following the instructions of Officer O\u2019Brien, she then drove her vehicle towards the lane normally reserved for commercial vehicles located behind the commercial building, where the VACIS unit was located, in order for her vehicle to be examined by scanner.\n[16] As the Complainant had never been behind this commercial building before, she was fearful in this unusual situation that she had not experienced before. She pointed out to the Tribunal that she was only 23 years old at the time.\n[17] Once she was at the back of the commercial building, she was then questioned by a second officer of the Respondent. She indicated to the Tribunal that she decided to call her grandmother in order to inform her of the situation, which was becoming worrisome to her.\n[18] According to the instructions of this second officer, she was apparently told to drive towards a truck and exit her vehicle. It was at that moment that she noticed a large white truck, outside of which was an arm-like appendage. She also noticed stop signs with disproportionately large lettering, on one of which was written \u201cdanger radiation\u201d.\n[19] At the time of the facts in this case, the Complainant was driving a black DENALI GMC with Ontario licence plates.\n[20] Following the instructions of this second officer, the Complainant moved her vehicle towards the white truck in question and exited her vehicle in order to stand in the area in which she had been instructed to remain.\n[21] When she exited her vehicle, a third officer of the Respondent approached her and instructed her to remain in a specifically designated secure area.\n[22] She indicated to the Tribunal that this was when she began to curse at this third officer while jumping up and down to try and warm herself up a bit. She then told the Tribunal that she asked this third officer to give her back her identification documents, to which he reportedly replied that he would return her identification documents to her once the scanning operations had been completed.\n[23] The Complainant indicated that she asked for permission to wait inside the Respondent\u2019s border crossing facility to warm herself up while her vehicle was being scanned.\n[24] Such permission was denied to her by this third officer, who allegedly told her to remain where she was.\n[25] Still in contact with her grandmother on her cell phone, the Complainant indicated that her grandmother called a man named John Boots, who was one of the elders of the Akwesasne Aboriginal community. Her grandmother told her that this John Boots would be bringing her a blanket so that she could warm up.\n[26] During this sequence of events, the Complainant indicated that she began to cry and that she asked the officers who were present what was happening and what they were looking for in her vehicle. They allegedly responded \u201ceverything and nothing\u201d, and told her that in their view she seemed definitely guilty of something.\n[27] The third of the Respondent\u2019s officers reportedly asked her if she was moving contraband cigarettes, while concluding that, in his opinion, the inspection of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle, by the scanner, would probably detect the presence of contraband cigarettes.\n[28] The Complainant told the Tribunal that at that point she repeated to this officer that she worked at a shop in the United States. The officer in question allegedly laughed at the Complainant and mocked her.\n[29] Faced with the attitude of this third officer, she asked him to identify himself, at which point he allegedly pointed to his badge, telling her: \u201cYou see this badge, do you know what this badge represents?\u201d\n[30] The Complainant replied that she did not know and that, at any rate, she did not care. She then apparently told the officer that he was on her land, stating \u201cthis is my land,\u201d to which the officer responded \u201cdo you know what our society thinks of you?\u201d in reference to the Aboriginal community in which she lived.\n[31] A few minutes later John Boots arrived on the scene. She told the Tribunal that this third officer was very rude to Mr. Boots and asked him to stand aside.\n[32] In this sequence of events, a fourth officer appeared on the scene bearing receipts for various items found in the Complainant\u2019s vehicle. This fourth officer reportedly asked her to go inside the main building of the border crossing in order to pay the taxes on the items she had purchased in the United States. The Complainant indicated to the Tribunal that she had never paid taxes on anything, given her Aboriginal status.\n[33] The Complainant told the Tribunal that during the search, her entire vehicle was inspected, and indicated that the officers who conducted the search tried to rip the seats out of her vehicle.\n[34] Inside the main building of the Respondent\u2019s border crossing, the Complainant met with the superintendent of the border crossing and confirmed that she had not declared any of the items that had been found in her vehicle, namely, toys and jeans, indicating that she had not had a chance to do so.\n[35] She further stated that once she was inside this building she began to hyperventilate, and started to cry again while feeling outraged at the situation she had just experienced.\n[36] In the same part of her testimony, she indicated that she did not recall having mentioned that she was going to call the Mohawk Warriors Society, even though in her mind it did not strike her as a bad idea. She considered people from the Mohawk Warriors Society as peacekeepers.\n[37] In short, the Complainant indicated that she had been the object of ridicule on the part of the Respondent\u2019s officers who had conducted the inspection of her vehicle.\n[38] She found the entire situation to have been confrontational and frightening for her. She was of the view that the third officer who had spoken to her when she was outside her vehicle failed to act appropriately or in a manner that was consistent with the code of conduct to which he was subject and that he did nothing to calm the situation.\n[39] She reiterated that she felt isolated and alone, before all of these identically-dressed men, especially with the indication that there was a danger of radiation on the premises. She told the Tribunal that she was pregnant at the time and confirmed that none of the officers who were present had asked her if she was in fact pregnant before scanning her vehicle.\n[40] In her testimony, the Complainant returned to the altercation with the third of the Respondent\u2019s officers, who she claims was the most confrontational with her. She once again acknowledged having told the officer that he was on her land and that this land did not belong to the Respondent. She further indicated to him that she did not live far from the Respondent\u2019s border crossing on Cornwall Island and once informed of this fact, this third officer allegedly asked her, in a defiant manner, whether she was going to run for it.\n[41] Specifying what had occurred on November 18, 2005, the Complainant confirmed that the area where the scanning operation took place was marked off with orange pylons. It was within this area cordoned off by these pylons that the scanning operation was conducted.\n[42] She further confirmed that during the time she was outside, she was exposed to the cold for a period of approximately forty minutes. She confirmed that the search of her vehicle had taken about ten to fifteen minutes.\n[43] Faced with the entire operation that took place on November 18, 2005, the Complainant likened the situation to that of a rape. She described the Respondent\u2019s officers as attackers who caused her much fear, and this fear would always remain with her still. Since then, she felt like a pariah when using the Respondent\u2019s border crossing.\n[44] In her testimony, the Complainant identified the third officer with whom she had a confrontation as being the one wearing badge number 11275, namely, Officer Denis Demers.\n[45] Lastly, she informed the Tribunal that following these incidents, she decided to file a complaint against the officers in question, but that the complaint against them was not deemed to be valid. She further stated that she went to the band council of her Aboriginal community in order to speak to the community\u2019s Chief and tell him what had happened. He purportedly recommended that she file a complaint with the Commission.\nB. Respondent\u2019s cross-examination [46] On cross-examination by the Commission\u2019s counsel, the Complainant also reiterated the words allegedly used by Officer Demers, who had reportedly asked her, in the following terms: \u201cDo you know what our society thinks of you?\u201d\n[47] She found the words used by Officer Demers as well as his conduct in general to be discriminatory, especially in light of the fact that she was pregnant. In her view, the Respondent\u2019s officers on that day abused their authority.\n[48] In addition, the Complainant indicated to the Tribunal that following the incidents that occurred on November 18, 2005, she searched the Internet in order to find out the potential effects of the radiation to which she may have been exposed and especially the potential effects on her unborn child. She told the Tribunal that it was after this research that she decided to have an abortion. In that regard, the Complainant decided to have the abortion on December 2, 2005, some 19 days after the incidents of November 18, 2005.\n[49] Moreover, on cross-examination, she acknowledged that she had made no mention of the fact that she was pregnant, and that the first time this had been mentioned was in an initial document dated July 13, 2007, a document entitled \u2018Rebuttal of Fallan Davis\u2019 addressed to the Commission (see Exhibit R-5, pages 4, 26 and 27).\n[50] Accordingly, she confirmed that there had been no mention of her being pregnant in her affidavit of November 21, 2005, the affidavit that recounted all of the facts in relation to the incidents of November 18, 2005.\n[51] Furthermore, the Complainant confirmed to the Tribunal that she had made no mention of having been pregnant during the investigation that had been launched by the Respondent, through its representative, Lucinda Reading, whom the Respondent had tasked with conducting an investigation of the incidents of November 18, 2005. In this regard, the Complainant stated that Ms. Reading had not asked her specific questions as to whether she was pregnant.\n[52] Similarly, the Complainant also admitted to the Tribunal that she had made no mention of her pregnancy when she filed her complaint with the Commission on November 23, 2006 (Exhibit R-2, Tab 96).\n[53] In response to another question from the Respondent\u2019s counsel with regard to whether she was pregnant, the Complainant indicated that one of her other children, born in 2007, namely, Georgia Jacob, who was born on February 27, 2007, may also have been affected by the radiation following the scanning operations conducted on November 18, 2005. In that regard, counsel for the Respondent referred the Complainant to one of her affidavits, dated October 28, 2008, in which it is noted that her child Georgia had Bell\u2019s palsy, which is a very rare medical condition. The Complainant submitted that Georgia may have been affected by the radiation from the VACIS.\n[54] Once again, the Complainant acknowledged to the Tribunal having never undergone medical tests to assess the level of radiation she may have been exposed to during the scanning operations conducted on November 18, 2005.\n[55] During her cross-examination, the Complainant told the Tribunal that she remains fearful when using the Respondent\u2019s border crossing, now located near the city of Cornwall.\n[56] Indeed, the Complainant indicated to the Tribunal that the border crossing located on Cornwall Island was closed on May 31, 2009, and relocated to the north shore, where the city of Cornwall is located.\n[57] She stated that she was still fearful when using the said border crossing at Cornwall Island, as were other members of her Aboriginal community who had also reportedly had problems with the Respondent\u2019s officers in the past.\n[58] Responding to another question from the Respondent\u2019s counsel, the Complainant acknowledged that another incident had occurred on August 6, 2005, when the vehicle in which the Complainant was travelling was searched by the Respondent\u2019s officers. At the time, the Complainant was accompanied by her sister-in-law, M\u00e9lissa Papineau. During this secondary inspection of her vehicle, the Complainant apparently stated that she would like to blow up the Cornwall Island border crossing. However, the Complainant told the Tribunal that it was not a serious threat in her view and that she had not uttered the threat inside the Respondent\u2019s border crossing.\n[59] Questioned about her obligation to declare the items in her possession when crossing the border, the Complainant told the tribunal that under normal circumstances, and if she had used her usual lane to cross the border, she believed that she would have declared the items and that she would certainly have remembered to do so.\n[60] In her testimony, the Complainant questioned why the border crossing was located on Cornwall Island, indicating that she failed to understand why the border crossing had been placed there. She further indicated to the Tribunal that she truly did not know what the territorial limits of Canada were with regard to the geographic location of the premises.\n[61] Questioned about the conduct of the officers she encountered on November 18, 2005, she further confirmed that the first officer she had encountered had not yelled at her, but that he had raised his voice.\n[62] In response to another question from the Respondent\u2019s counsel regarding her declaration of the goods she had in her possession and had acquired in the United States, she confirmed to the Tribunal that she would not have made such a declaration despite having been asked to do so by the first officer who had dealt with her at the border crossing.\n[63] With regard to her encounter with the second officer when she was transferred to the back of the commercial building in order for her vehicle to be scanned, the Complainant also acknowledged that this second officer was not aggressive towards her and had acted in a professional manner.\n[64] However, this officer did not inform her of the potential effects of the radiation on her vehicle, and more specifically with regard to her unborn child.\n[65] Questioned about her interaction with the third officer, namely, Officer Demers, she confirmed that the officer was dressed in the same manner as the other officers, that he was wearing a tuque and sunglasses and that he was easily recognizable due to \u201chis teeth being in her face.\u201d\n[66] According to her, Officer Demers addressed her in a loud voice, and she acknowledged having yelled at Officer Demers to return her driver\u2019s licence to her.\n[67] Lastly, with respect to her demand that her driver\u2019s licence be returned to her, and after Officer Demers\u2019 response telling her that she would have her driver\u2019s licence returned to her once the process was finished, she admitted having told the officer to \u201cfuck off\u201d.\n[68] Still under cross-examination by the Respondent\u2019s counsel, and with regard to her interaction with Officer Demers, she confirmed having called Officer Demers a \u201chomo.\u201d In addition, she allegedly called Officer Demers an \u201casshole.\u201d She acknowledged to the Tribunal that the language she used with Officer Demers was disrespectful.\n[69] In reference to a document shown to her by the Respondent\u2019s counsel and that consisted of a summary of the response she had presented to the Commission, dated July 13, 2007, (Exhibit R-5, page 26), the Complainant, who had indicated in the document that she had not used the words \u201cfuck off\u201d, acknowledged at the hearing that she had in fact used those words. The Complainant thus admitted that the statement that had been made in the document in question was a lie.\n[70] Similarly, the Respondent\u2019s counsel succeeded in getting the Complainant to admit that other information contained in the documentation she had provided was untrue or, at the very least, that she could no longer remember having heard the words Officer Demers had addressed to her.\n[71] In her cross-examination, the Complainant confirmed that during her conversation with the superintendent of the Cornwall Island Border Crossing, with regard to the goods she had purchased outside the country, that she was not required to pay taxes, on account of her Aboriginal status and also pursuant to the Akwesasne Residents Remission Order (SOR\/91-412) (Order), this Order having been issued with regard to the customs tariff and the exemption applicable to the Akwesasne Aboriginal community.\n[72] In that regard, once this formality was completed with the superintendent of the border crossing, the Complainant then left the premises and apparently took some photographs. She believed that she had been the subject of ridicule on the part of the VACIS officers who were present, as they had allegedly laughed at her.\n[73] At this stage of the Complainant\u2019s testimony, she left the court, on the ground that she was physically and mentally unable to continue the cross-examination conducted by the Respondent\u2019s counsel. In that regard, the Complainant\u2019s representative informed the Tribunal that the Complainant was under observation by a psychiatrist and was no longer able to continue the cross-examination.\nC. Other witnesses who have evidence on behalf of the Complainant John Boots\n[74] As regards for the conduct of the two officers present with the Complainant while she watched the search of her vehicle, witness John Boots, who was called by the Complainant\u2019s representative to testify, indicated that the two officers who were present yelled at the Complainant. Mr. Boots told the Tribunal that he could not remember the exact words that were said at the time, on account of the weather conditions. However, he indicated that the body language of the parties who were present, and in particular that of the two officers, was indicative of the situation in which the Complainant found herself.\n[75] Mr. Boots confirmed to the Tribunal that the Complainant was crying when he arrived and that she had her arms wrapped around herself in an attempt to keep warm, given the cold weather conditions on November 18, 2005.\n[76] He confirmed before the Tribunal that the tone that had been used between Officer Demers and the Complainant was loud and aggressive. Shortly after he arrived at the border crossing facility, Officer Demers asked him to leave the premises, given that his presence was not required.\n[77] In his view, the Complainant had been verbally assaulted by the officers present.\n[78] However, he did not recall what words had been used or the nature of what was said during the exchanges between the Complainant and the officers who were present.\nSergeant William Lafrance\n[79] In addition, the Complainant called as a witness Sergeant William Lafrance, who has been an officer with the Akwesasne Mohawk Police for 25 years.\n[80] In his testimony, Officer Lafrance told the tribunal that he had not been present during the incidents that had taken place on November 18, 2005, between the Complainant and the other officers of the VACIS team.\n[81] However, he had been informed that an altercation to that effect had occurred.\n[82] More specifically, he had received a call from the Complainant during which she stated that she wanted to file a complaint against the officers of the VACIS team, which he refused to do, given that, in his view, there were no reasonable grounds to support a criminal complaint against the officers of the VACIS team.\n[83] In his testimony, Officer Lafrance indicated that no one should be forced to stand outside in the kind of weather conditions to which the Complainant had been exposed on November 18, 2005.\n[84] He further confirmed to the Tribunal that he was aware that many complaints had been made by residents of the Aboriginal community with regard to the attitudes and conduct of the Respondent\u2019s officers at the Cornwall border crossing.\nLucinda Reading\n[85] The Complainant also called as a witness Lucinda Reading, who has been an employee of the Respondent for 37 years. At the time she gave her evidence, Ms. Reading was a Senior Advisor for the Respondent. She had been tasked by her superiors to conduct a factual analysis of the events that occurred on November 18, 2005, involving the Complainant as well as the VACIS team.\nWilliam Philips\n[86] Called upon by the Complainant to give evidence, William Philips was District Chief to the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne in November 2005.\n[87] He was in charge of the Department of Justice portfolio with the Respondent at the time and also worked with the police department.\n[88] With regard to the incidents involving the Complainant, Mr. Philips had been made aware of these incidents through the complaint filed by Ms. Davis; he also had conversations with Rod Hart, who was Chief of Operations at the Cornwall border crossing.\n[89] In his testimony, Mr. Philips confirmed that he had also met with Ms. Reading, with the Complainant as well as with her mother, discussing the development of good relations between the Aboriginal community and the officers of the border crossing.\n[90] However, he confirmed to the Tribunal that the Complainant was a \u201cbig mouth\u201d indicating that the Complainant spoke from the heart.\n[91] He further confirmed to the Tribunal that a number of incidents had occurred both prior to and after the incidents of November 18, 2005.\n[92] In a similar vein, he told the Tribunal that the Complainant was not a calm person considering her mother\u2019s own history.\nD. The closing of the border crossing [93] In her evidence, the Complainant\u2019s representative also called as a witness Officer Scott Anderson, who began his shift at the border crossing at noon on November 18, 2005.\n[94] In his testimony, Officer Anderson stated that when he arrived the Complainant had already left the premises of the border crossing and had returned to her vehicle. However, he noted an atmosphere of panic at the border crossing.\n[95] Informed of the altercation that had taken place between the Complainant and some of the officers deploying the VACIS equipment, Officer Anderson reportedly called the Chief of Operations of the Cornwall border crossing, Rod Hart, and provided him with a detailed account of what had happened.\n[96] Officer Anderson made reference to a journalist and a number of area residents having approached the border crossing and having taken photographs of the officers in charge of the VACIS machine operation.\n[97] Worried about this, he then contacted Mr. Hart, his superior officer. Mr. Hart ordered that the premises be secured and that the VACIS operation that was underway be stopped.\n[98] In light of the gathering of persons who were taking photos in the vicinity of the border crossing, and in the face of mounting concern, Officer Anderson then proceeded to close the commercial area in which the VACIS team was located in addition to calling for the assistance of the Akwesasne police to bolster security.\n[99] Officer Anderson further confirmed to the Tribunal that this decision was made after other officers at the port of entry had made it clear of their intention to initiate a work stoppage and refuse to work for the remainder of the day, as they feared their safety might be in jeopardy.\n[100] Consequently, all of the officers and staff on duty headed to a secure location within the main building at the Cornwall Island border crossing.\n[101] In that same time period, police officers from the Akwesasne police force arrived and escorted the VACIS team to Highway 401 so that they could return to their original posting at the Lansdowne border crossing.\n[102] Given the concerns expressed by the other officers who were present, Officer Anderson told the Tribunal that he decided to close the entire border crossing.\n[103] Towards the end of his cross-examination by the Respondent\u2019s counsel, Officer Anderson confirmed that the Complainant had in the past been unpleasant to deal with because she expressed her displeasure at having to identify herself each time she used the border crossing.\n[104] Lastly, he confirmed to the Tribunal that he had never feared for his safety during the incidents of November 18, 2005. He confirmed that he had agreed to work in the Aboriginal community on various jobs.\n[105] The evidence showed that an investigation conducted under the Canada Labour Code, Part II, by a Health and Safety officer, confirmed the lack of danger (see Exhibit C-22).\nE. Respondent\u2019s evidence [106] In its evidence, the Respondent called 14 witnesses, all of them officers working for the Respondent. Without repeating the entire testimony of all of the witnesses called by the Respondent, the tribunal will limit itself to evidence given by officers who were in direct contact with the Complainant and about whom she made the complaint of discrimination.\nOfficer Derek O\u2019Brien\n[107] Thus, as the first witness to have become directly involved with the Complainant, the Respondent called Officer Derek O\u2019Brien, who had been tasked with selecting which vehicles were to be subject to the VACIS operation on November 18, 2005.\n[108] Therefore, Officer O\u2019Brien was to proceed with what was commonly referred to as \u201cprimary inspections,\u201d before vehicles arrived directly in front of the gates of the border crossing.\n[109] According to Officer O\u2019Brien, a specific operation involving the inspection of SUV-type vehicles and pick-up trucks was scheduled for that day.\n[110] Thus, around 10:30 on the morning of November 18, 2005, he spotted the Complainant\u2019s vehicle heading towards lane 4, the one that was reserved for vehicles driven by Aboriginal residents.\n[111] At that time, he noticed that Ms. Davis was driving a large black SUV.\n[112] Noting that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle corresponded to type of vehicle that was to be inspected in the VACIS operation, he instructed the Complainant to stop in order for him to proceed with a cursory inspection of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle.\n[113] Given that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle had tinted windows, Officer O\u2019Brien told the Tribunal that he was unaware of who was driving the vehicle in question when he stopped it.\n[114] Once the driver lowered the window, he recognized the Complainant as being a resident of the Akwesasne Aboriginal community, but could not remember her exact name.\n[115] When questioned in regard to the primary inspection, he indicated to the Tribunal that he had never had any issues with the Complainant before and that she had always been polite and answered his questions every time.\n[116] During the stop on November 18, 2005, he asked her whether she had anything to declare, to which she responded in the negative.\n[117] Similarly, the Complainant also responded in the negative to the following questions: whether she had any alcohol or tobacco, firearms, or was carrying goods whose value was in excess of $10,000.\n[118] Once the Complainant had answered all of these questions in the negative, he then filled out an E-67 form, which is a form used to authorize a secondary inspection of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle.\n[119] This was when he noticed that the Complainant was not happy about the situation.\n[120] The E-67 form was blown away by the wind. Officer O\u2019Brien then proceeded to fill out a second E-67 form, which he handed to the Complainant after indicating to her that she should move to the commercial buildings of the Cornwall border crossing. He took note that the Complainant was angered by this situation. He then immediately relayed this information to the rest of the VACIS team that was to conduct the secondary inspection of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle.\n[121] For his part, he had no further interaction with the Complainant and his dealings with her ended at that time.\nOfficer Todd Smart\n[122] Once the Complainant was directed towards the VACIS team, at the time located in the commercial compound of the Cornwall border crossing, the Complainant then came into contact with a second officer, namely, Officer Todd Smart.\n[123] In his testimony, Officer Smart told the Tribunal he was what was commonly referred to as a \u201cpoint officer\u201d, on November 18, 2005. He was the first officer to interact with drivers who had been referred after their primary inspection.\n[124] Officer Smart told the Tribunal that at the time of his first contact with the Complainant, he was unaware that she was Aboriginal person. When the Complainant arrived before him, he noted that she was aggressive and upset. In addition, he noted that the Complainant was on her cell phone. He immediately asked her to stop using her cell phone, but she did not hang up right away. The Complainant then reportedly asked him why she had been directed to this part of the Cornwall Island border crossing and why she could not use \u201cher lane.\u201d\n[125] Officer Smart subsequently informed her that he did not know why she had been sent to have her vehicle scanned, and indicated to her that everyone was subject to inspection when crossing the border and that, for his part, he was simply doing his job.\n[126] A little later on, he was explaining the scanning procedure to her, but she cut him off and indicated to him that she was worried about radiation.\n[127] Officer Smart replied that if she would let him finish explaining, he would explain the scanning procedure to her and that in the end she would have no reason to be worried. He then finished explaining the scanning procedure.\n[128] Throughout his discussion with the Complainant, she never gave him any indication to the effect that she was pregnant and in that regard, Officer Smart indicated that the Complainant made no mention to him of her concerns about the impact of radiation on her unborn child.\n[129] A short time later, the Complainant\u2019s vehicle was then moved in the direction of the VACIS vehicle itself. It was at this point that he informed the other officers of the VACIS team of the Complainant\u2019s state of mind by indicating to them that she was angry.\n[130] Once her vehicle was in the immediate vicinity of the VACIS machine, the Complainant exited her vehicle and headed to a secure area so as to allow for her vehicle to be scanned.\nOfficer Denis Demers\n[131] She subsequently came into contact with a third officer, namely, Officer Denis Demers, whose conduct was specifically identified in the Complainant\u2019s complaint.\n[132] On November 18, 2005, Officer Demers was part of the VACIS team as a base officer.\n[133] Among his duties, Officer Demers indicated that he assisted in creating a secure zone using orange pylons, a sign warning of radiation as well as a stop sign. He indicated to the Tribunal that he conducted tests for radiation in four places near the VACIS machine itself, in order to ensure the area was safe.\n[134] As was indicated by the procedure that existed at the time, once a vehicle approached the area of the VACIS machine, drivers must not remain in their vehicle during the scanning process.\n[135] When the Complainant\u2019s vehicle arrived on the premises, he was informed by Officer Todd Smart of the Complainant\u2019s state of mind.\n[136] Upon approaching the Complainant, she became rude, cursing at him and saying things such as \u201cgo fuck yourself.\u201d In addition, the Complainant used inappropriate and vulgar language towards him, such as: \u201cfag, asshole, a big man with a big penis\u201d.\n[137] Officer Demers told the tribunal that he had never been subjected to such behaviour before, throughout his entire employment.\n[138] In addition, Officer Demers indicated that at no time did the Complainant mention anything about being pregnant. Moreover, the Complainant never expressed any of her concerns about the effects of radiation on her.\n[139] In the course of the heated discussion that ensued, the Complainant indicated that she was an Aboriginal person, and that she had never been subject to a search because of her status as an Aboriginal woman.\n[140] During the conversation, she allegedly asked him to return her driver\u2019s licence to her twice, to which he replied that he would return her driver\u2019s licence to her once the operation was finished. Faced with the Complainant\u2019s attitude, Officer Demers reportedly told her to stop cursing at him, but he apparently noted that she told him that she was an Aboriginal person, and that the land she was on was \u201cher land\u201d and that he had no right to search either her or her vehicle.\n[141] Prior to that, Officer Demers had not noticed that the Complainant was an Aboriginal person at all and only did so when the Complainant told him of this fact.\n[142] Throughout the course of the heated discussion he had with the Complainant, she never mentioned anything to him about being pregnant or about being concerned about being exposed to radiation.\n[143] During this sequence of events, Officer Demers indicated that he remembered having identified himself by pointing to his badge.\n[144] In reference to the Complainant\u2019s affidavit (Exhibit R-1, Tab 16), Officer Demers told the Tribunal that he had tried to calm the situation, while maintaining control.\n[145] It was for that reason that he had pointed to his badge in order to reassert his authority. In response to a question from the Respondent\u2019s counsel, Officer Demers had originally indicated that he had not uttered the following words \u201cyou\u2019re definitely guilty of something\u201d (see examination of January 29, 2014, Volume 46, page 164).\n[146] Because of her aggressiveness, he reportedly told the Complainant that her behaviour was telling and that based on his experience, she was acting like someone who had done something wrong. He indicated to the Tribunal that he found the Complainant\u2019s behaviour odd.\n[147] Still in reference to the Complainant\u2019s affidavit, counsel for the Respondent then drew the witness\u2019s attention to the passage in which the Complainant allegedly told him that they were using her land without permission and that, in this regard, she also told the officers of the VACIS team that they should go back to where they came from. During the same sequence of events, she reportedly mentioned to him that he was on the land of the Akwesasnoron. He allegedly responded by stating \u201cyou know what we think of your society,\u201d to which she reportedly replied that she didn\u2019t need to know and that she didn\u2019t care.\n[148] Officer Demers told the Tribunal that he could not remember the exact words he used but that he remembered having said something to the effect that he was on Canada Customs\u2019 property. However, he did not remember the Complainant having mentioned to him that it was the land of the Akwesasnoron. Similarly, Officer Demers denied having used the words \u201cdo you know what our society thinks of you?\u201d in reference to the Mohawk people.\n[149] Furthermore, in his testimony, Officer Demers indicated that the Complainant had never asked him if she could go inside to warm up. In addition, he denied using aggressive language when he spoke to Mr. Boots, one of the elders of the Akwesasne Aboriginal community.\n[150] He denied the fact that the Complainant was reportedly in tears in his presence or that she began hyperventilating. He also did not recall the Complainant having allegedly jumped up and down to warm herself up, as she claimed. He did not raise his voice, and did not remember having done so. In any event, he asserted that he asked the Complainant why she was speaking to him that way, as if she was trying to intimidate him.\n[151] On cross-examination by the Complainant\u2019s representative, who questioned him about the Complainant\u2019s affidavit, Officer Demers admitted having asked the Complainant whether she worked, without providing any specific reasons for asking her such a question; (see examination of Officer Demers, Vol. 47, 30 January 2014, page 272, as well as his incident report, filed as Exhibit R-2, Tab 99).\n[152] On cross-examination by the counsel for the Commission with regard to the Code of Ethics and Conduct normally applicable to the Respondent\u2019s officers (Exhibit HR-2), Officer Demers indicated that the Complainant\u2019s conduct as expressed by her provocative attitude did not constitute a violation of the law.\n[153] In one of his answers with respect to what he referred to as the use of \u201cforce continuum\u201d, which is a guide for determining the level of interaction to be employed with specific travellers, he decided to raise his voice, contrary to what he had declared in his earlier testimony. In addition, in response to the Complainant questioning his right to be on her land, he apparently pointed to his badge, telling her that the land was Canada Customs property. In his view, that manner of acting was a way of identifying himself as being part of Canada Customs.\n[154] In response to another question from the Commission\u2019s counsel, namely, whether it may have crossed his mind that acting in such a way could be perceived as a provocation to a Mohawk resident of Akwesasne, the witness stated that he did not recall anything in particular having crossed his mind.\n[155] In short, Officer Demers felt that he had been polite to the Complainant, that he had not used foul language when speaking to her, that he did not retort in any way, and that his conduct in general had not been subject to any sanctions or reprimands from his superiors.\nOfficer Kevin Sills\n[156] In the sequence of events that ensued while the Complainant was outside her vehicle waiting with Officer Demers, another officer appeared and became involved in that same sequence of events.\n[157] As the inspection of the Complainant\u2019s vehicle was drawing to a close, Officer Kevin Sills joined the discussion between Officer Demers and the Complainant.\n[158] Given that Officer Sills had just inspected the Complainant\u2019s vehicle, he approached her and asked her whether any of the goods that had been found in her vehicle had been declared, considering that she had said nothing about this during the process that resulted in the E-67 Form being issued. She then confirmed to Officer Sills that she had not declared the goods, in light of the fact that she did not have to pay tax because she was an Aboriginal person.\n[159] Officer Sills noted that her behaviour was hostile and that she was very angry.\n[160] Faced with the Complainant\u2019s conduct, Officer Sills told the Tribunal that he had tried to reduce the tension by offering her the option of going inside to discuss the matter of the undeclared goods. Consequently, Officer Sills indicated that he decided to report the situation to his supervisor on duty at the time and leave the final decision to him.\n[161] During the short interval in which he had contact with the Complainant, he noted that she was using her cell phone, but he could not understand what she was saying to her interlocutor. He further confirmed to the tribunal that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle had been thoroughly searched but that no damage had been caused to her vehicle.\n[162] Similarly, he did not hear the Complainant ask him to go inside during the search.\n[163] After having informed her of his decision to have her go inside to deal with the matter of the goods she had failed to declare, he further noted that the Complainant was very angry and that she asserted that she did not have to go inside, calling him an \u201casshole\u201d. Consequently, the tone used by the Complainant was loud, abrupt, and even hostile.\n[164] In response to the Complainant\u2019s hostility, Officer Sills indicated that he tried to reduce the existing tension by not yelling at the Complainant, but by using a professional tone of voice.\n[165] Once the Complainant had been provided with information in order to have her go inside the border crossing, he himself headed to the border crossing to find the officer in charge, namely, Superintendent Maurice Saucier, and apprise him of the situation. In that regard, he also handed Superintendent Saucier the receipts for the undeclared goods he had found in the Complainant\u2019s vehicle.\n[166] In that same timeframe, the Complainant got into her vehicle and parked it in the border crossing\u2019s parking lot. He noted that no one had accompanied the Complainant in order to force her to go inside. Thus, she entered the border crossing of her own volition.\n[167] On cross-examination, Officer Sills confirmed that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle was not a commercial vehicle and that it had been the first non-commercial vehicle to have been scanned by the VACIS team at the Cornwall Island border crossing that day. In addition, he confirmed to the Tribunal that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle was the only SUV-type vehicle that was scanned that day and that the Complainant had not been singled out personally for her vehicle to be scanned.\n[168] Furthermore, in response to another question by the Respondent\u2019s counsel that was supplementary to his examination-in-chief, namely, why he had not contacted officers of the Mohawk security force who were present, he replied that everything was under control and that there was no need to call them.\nInside the border crossing\n[169] Once inside the Cornwall border crossing, the Complainant was then brought before the officer in charge of the crossing, that is, Superintendent Maurice Saucier.\n[170] In his testimony, Superintendent Saucier stated that he noticed that the Complainant was mad and crying, and found that she was really angry.\n[171] In Superintendent Saucier\u2019s discussions with the Complainant, she told him that she had no taxes to pay and that she would call the Mohawk Warrior Society.\n[172] In response to the Complainant, Superintendent Saucier told her about the existence of the Order.\n[173] Superintendent Saucier told the Tribunal that, in the past, he had had other interactions with the Complainant that he knew her and knew her name, as she was a resident of Akwesasne. He also confirmed that the Complainant often used the border crossing for her travels.\n[174] Because he had been a border crossing officer who had performed primary inspections on vehicles entering Canada, he had already met her. He had characterized her as being unpleasant and even arrogant.\n[175] According to Superintendent Saucier, he had assumed that the Complainant knew the Order well, considering her many trips through the Cornwall Island border crossing in the past.\n[176] In his testimony, Superintendent Saucier stated that he contacted his immediate supervisor, Rod Hart in Ottawa, and told him about the situation on November 18, 2005. Mr. Hart then authorized the Complainant to leave the premises without paying taxes, in accordance with the Order.\n[177] Before the Complainant left the premises, he apparently reminded the Complainant of her obligation to declare goods purchased outside of Canada, in accordance with the Order.\n[178] Cognizant of the situation, the Complainant then made a statement referring to the VACIS team as scary. Superintendent Saucier then noted that the Complainant stopped crying and seemed calmer. A few seconds later, when the Complainant was with another border crossing officer, that is, Officer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Oakes, she composed herself and, finally, she left the border crossing.\n[179] Also in his examination, Superintendent Saucier stated that he was not worried about the Complainant\u2019s threat that she would call the Mohawk Warrior Society.\n[180] However, he confirmed to the Tribunal that he had indeed heard the Complainant\u2019s threat in that regard.\nOfficer Sylvie Beaudry-Giroux\n[181] Another border crossing officer, Officer Sylvie Beaudry\u2011Giroux, was present and she also heard the same threat from the Complainant that she would call the Mohawk Warrior Society.\n[182] Similarly, Officer Beaudry-Giroux also heard the Complainant curse at Superintendent Saucier while informing him that she did not want to pay taxes. She heard the Complainant shout and cry when she was two or three feet away from her.\nIII. Analysis [183] The Tribunal properly reviewed the evidence in the Complainant\u2019s record with respect to the arguments of the parties as well as the applicable legislation and case law in this case. After a lengthy analysis, I have concluded that the Complainant\u2019s complaint should be upheld in part, for the following reasons.\nA. General principles of discrimination [184] For a better understanding of the applicable statutory provisions in this case, I will reproduce the provisions of the following sections of the Act:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n(2) Where the ground of discrimination is pregnancy or child-birth, the discrimination shall be deemed to be on the ground of sex.\n[185] Similarly, more specifically, the Complainant\u2019s complaint is founded with respect to section 5 of the Act, which reads as follows:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSpecifically, the Complainant\u2019s complaint falls under paragraph 5(b) of the Act.\n[186] As previously noted, the Complainant claims that she was discriminated against because of her race, age and sex.\n[187] To understand the scope of the provisions of section 5 of the Act, the case law has developed certain criteria, which I will cite.\n[188] In one of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s first decisions on discrimination with respect to education programs, the Supreme Court, in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), [2012] 3 S.C.R. 360, stated the following principles regarding the interpretation of section 8 of the British Columbia Human Rights Code.\n[189] The Honourable Justice Abella of the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following at paragraph 33 of the decision:\n[33] As the Tribunal properly recognized, to demonstrate prima facie discrimination, complainants are required to show that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the Code; that they experienced an adverse impact with respect to the service; and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the respondent to justify the conduct or practice, within the framework of the exemptions available under human rights statutes. If it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to occur.\n[190] In another decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, that is, in Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada made the following finding at paragraph 129 of said decision:\n129 Section 5(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that \u201c[i]t is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public . . . to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation\u201d. Section 15(g) of the Canadian Human Rights Act provides, however, that it is not a discriminatory practice to deny access to a good, service, facility or accommodation customarily available to the general public if \u201cthere is bona fide justification for that denial or differentiation\u201d. In Central Alberta Dairy Pool, at p. 518, this Court unanimously agreed that \u201c[i]f a reasonable alternative exists to burdening members of a group with any given rule, that rule will not be bona fide.\u201d Grismer further elaborated that establishing a bona fide justification for a prima facie violation of human rights legislation requires a respondent to show that \u201cthe employer or service provider has made every possible accommodation short of undue hardship\u201d (para. 21). . . .\n[191] Similarly, in paragraph 130 of the same decision, the Supreme Court of Canada defined undue hardship:\n. . . can be established where a standard or barrier is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d insofar as there is a \u201csufficient risk\u201d that a legitimate objective like safety would be threatened enough to warrant the maintenance of the discriminatory standard (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Borough of Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202); where \u201csuch steps as may be reasonable to accommodate without undue interference in the operation of the employer\u2019s business and without undue expense to the employer\u201d have been taken (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 555); where no reasonable alternatives are available (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970); where only \u201creasonable limits\u201d are imposed on the exercise of a right (Eldridge, at para. 79); and, more recently, where an employer or service provider shows \u201cthat it could not have done anything else reasonable or practical to avoid the negative impact on the individual\u201d (Meiorin, at para. 38). The point of undue hardship is reached when reasonable means of accommodation are exhausted and only unreasonable or impracticable options for accommodation remain.\n[192] Similarly, in another decision by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal), that is, P.S.A.C. and Murphy v. C.R.A., 2010 CHRT 9, the Tribunal stated the following at paragraph 39:\n(39) It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the impugned decision or action (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, 1995 CanLII 3589 (FC) [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\n[193] Regarding the definition of service that appears in the first paragraph of section 5 of the Act, the Federal Court rendered a decision in a case involving the same parties as in the present case, that is, Canada (Attorney General) v. Davis, 2013 FC 40, where the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the Respondent was indeed providing a service to the public when it interacted with Ms. Davis on November 18, 2005 (see paragraph 54 of the judgment).\n[194] Regarding the degree of evidence required, another well-known discrimination decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, that is, Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons\u2011Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 (O\u2019Malley), stated the following at page 558:\nThe complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\n[195] In another decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, that is, F.H. v. McDougall, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, at page 60, the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following regarding the degree of evidence required in an allegation made in a civil case:\n[46] Similarly, evidence must always be sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test. But again, there is no objective standard to measure sufficiency. In serious cases, like the present, judges may be faced with evidence of events that are alleged to have occurred many years before, where there is little other evidence than that of the plaintiff and defendant. As difficult as the task may be, the judge must make a decision. If a responsible judge finds for the plaintiff, it must be accepted that the evidence was sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to that judge that the plaintiff satisfied the balance of probabilities test.\n[196] In discrimination cases, the evidence is not always direct and, in that respect, circumstantial evidence may lead tribunals to conclude that there was a form of discrimination. Thus, I would also like to refer to Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. 5029 (CHRT), where the Tribunal stated the following:\nDiscrimination on the grounds of race or colour are frequently practised in a very subtle manner. Overt discrimination on these grounds is not present in every discriminatory situation or occurrence. In a case where direct evidence of discrimination is absent, it becomes necessary for the Board to infer discrimination from the conduct of the individual or individuals whose conduct is at issue. This is not always an easy task to carry out. The conduct alleged to be discriminatory must be carefully analyzed and scrutinized in the context of the situation in which it arises.\nQuoting directly from Kennedy v. Mohawk College (1973) Ontario Board of Inquiry (Professor Borons).\n[197] Moreover, it has even been decided by our courts that the attitude underlying racial profiling is one that may be consciously or unconsciously held. In that respect, a person\u2019s conduct may be based on subconscious racial stereotyping (R. v. Brown, 64 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at paragraph 8).\n[198] Furthermore, in another decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that is, Peel Law Association v. Pieters, [2013] O.J. No. 2695, in reference to Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd., 2005 BCHRT 302, as well as Phipps v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII), the Court confirmed that there is no need to establish an intention or motivation to discriminate. The focus of the enquiry is on the Respondent\u2019s actions towards the complainant (see paragraph 111 of Peel Law Association v. Pieters).\n[199] In reference to Radek and Phipps, above, I reproduce the propositions in those decisions:\n1) the prohibited ground or grounds of discrimination need not be the sole or the major factor leading to the discriminatory conduct; it is sufficient if they are a factor;\n2) there is no need to establish an intention or motivation to discriminate; the focus of the enquiry is on the effect of the respondent's actions on the complainant;\n3) the prohibited ground or grounds need not be the cause of the respondent's discriminatory conduct; it is sufficient if they are a factor or operative element;\n4) there need be no direct evidence of discrimination; discrimination will more often be proven by circumstantial evidence and inference; and\n5) racial stereotyping will usually be the result of subtle unconscious beliefs, biases and prejudices.\n[200] Also, it is useful to reproduce the following paragraphs from Pieters, in which the Court, after reproducing the five above-mentioned propositions, noted the following:\n112] The first four of these are long established propositions of law. The Vice-Chair did not refer to Radek and Phipps as sources of authority for these propositions but because they provided a convenient summary of them. I see no relevance to the fact that Radek involved security guards and Phipps involved a police officer.\n[113] This court has repeatedly recognized the fifth proposition as a sociological fact. For example, Doherty J.A. has said in R. v. Parks (1993), 1993 CanLII 3383 (ON CA), 15 O.R. (3d) 324, 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (C.A.), at para. 54:\nRacism, and in particular anti-black racism, is a part of our community's psyche. A significant segment of our community holds overtly racist views. A much larger segment subconsciously operates on the basis of negative racial stereotypes.\n114 The Supreme Court of Canada has also endorsed the proposition. For example L'Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. and McLachlin J. writing in R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 46, cited Doherty J.A.'s statement with approval.\n[201] All of these decisions involve a situation between a person of authority and a person covered by, and having a characteristic identified in section 3 of the Act.\n[202] In Radek, above, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal carried out a careful and thorough analysis of the criteria that must apply with respect to racial profiling and the potential consequences. It is not my intention here to thoroughly revisit that decision.\n[203] However, I accept that many stereotypes can exist, consciously or unconsciously, voluntarily or even involuntarily and that it is through a careful analysis of the evidence that the decision-maker must be able to determine whether there are subtle scents of discrimination (see Basi, above).\n[204] For a detailed analysis of the stereotypes that may exist regarding the presence of discrimination toward Aboriginal people, I refer more specifically to paragraph 135 of Radek, which is very informative in that respect.\n[205] Recently, the Honourable Judge Mich\u00e8le Pauz\u00e9 stated the following at paragraph 173 of the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s decision in C.D.P.D.J. v. Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al, 2012 QCTDP 5, (\u201cRezko\u201d) dated April 18, 2012:\n[173] By nature, profiling constitutes a particular form of discrimination that is exercised in a context of authority and has the effect of nullifying or impairing the right to \u201crecognition and exercise of [a person\u2019s] human rights and freedoms, without distinction, exclusion or preference\u201d based on any of the grounds prohibited by the Charter.\n[206] Later, she stated the following at paragraph 181, citing the well-known Johnson case:\n[181] Accordingly, the Tribunal must focus on the factual and circumstantial evidence in order to determine whether improper behaviour such as the police officer\u2019s lack of courtesy or his intransigence allows the finding of differential or unusual treatment as compared with usual practices in similar circumstances:\nIn deciding whether there has been a prima facie case of differential treatment, a board of inquiry must try to establish how events usually unfold in a given situation. Deviations from normal practice and evidence of discourtesy or intransigence are grounds for finding differential treatment.\nFootnote: [98] Johnson v. Halifax Regional Police Service (No. 1), supra at para. 57. [(2003) 48 C.H.R.R.D\/307 (N.S Bd Inq.).]\nB. Analysis of the facts The sequence of events and the credibility of the key players\n[207] In her written arguments that she submitted to the Tribunal, the Complainant argued that the whole VACIS operation was planned in advance to trap her because no handwritten note or report was produced by the officers involved. Similarly, she characterized the events on November 18, 2005, as being acts of terror where she was virtually violated in her Aboriginal Akwesasne identity. Also in her submissions, the Complainant noted a discrepancy between the comments made by Officer Demers and by the Complainant herself during the altercation that occurred on November 18, 2005.\n[208] The Complainant\u2019s submissions contain several sociological and historical arguments that I do not intend to address in this decision. In fact, the Honourable Justice Harrington of the Federal Court stated the following in Canada (Attorney General c. Davis, 2009 FC 1104, at paragraph 59:\n[59] I hasten to point out that what is at issue are the events of November 18, 2005 at the border crossing on Cornwall Island, not the history of European settlement in North America.\n[209] Consequently, the Tribunal will only rely on the analysis of the events that took place on November 18, 2005, and nothing else.\n[210] Regarding the appellant\u2019s arguments, the Tribunal disagrees with the statements that the Complainant was purportedly tortured and\/or attacked by a group of men. The Tribunal also questions whether the Complainant acted correctly when she used foul language in addressing the Respondent\u2019s officers. The Tribunal also questions whether the whole sequence of events constituted a violation of the Complainant.\n[211] I will not comment further on the Complainant\u2019s written submissions because I consider them as being clearly exaggerated having regard to the factual background for which she filed a complaint.\n[212] With respect to the actual sequence of events, I also did not find evidence indicating that the victim was personally targeted by the intervention of the VACIS team on November 18, 2005. While the Complainant disagrees with the whole VACIS operation, for all of the reasons that she mentioned in her written submissions, the evidence has shown that the VACIS operation that was carried out was done so in the context of an intelligence bulletin dated June 21, 2005, whereby VACIS unit in northern Ontario had thus found modifications facilitating contraband in a vehicle of the same type as that of the Complainant. In that respect, it was therefore reasonable to think that a similar operation led by the VACIS team could also be carried out at the Cornwall Island border crossing on November 18, 2005.\n[213] As the evidence has demonstrated, no information of any kind was submitted in evidence to indicate that the Complainant\u2019s vehicle or the Complainant herself might have been targeted by the VACIS operation that was carried out on November 18, 2005.\n[214] The first officer who was in contact with the Complainant, that is, Officer O\u2019Brien, had not previously identified the Complainant when her vehicle approached the outskirts of the border crossing on November 18, 2005. As a result, the arguments submitted by the Complainant that she was specifically targeted by the VACIS operation do not appear to me to be founded.\n[215] In the sequence of the events that followed, once the Complainant was stopped by Officer O\u2019Brien, and by the Complainant\u2019s own admission, no criticism can be made of the two officers who had initial contact with her, that is, Officer O\u2019Brien and Officer Smart, regarding their conduct toward the Complainant.\n[216] Consequently, the only elements of the Complainant\u2019s complaint regarding discriminatory practices that could have taken place in respect of the Complainant on November 18, 2005, are those involving the conduct of Officer Demers and, partially, the conduct of Officer Sills, who was also in contact with the Complainant when she was in contact with Officer Demers.\n[217] With respect to Officer Sills, I can only find that his conduct and attitude were exemplary and most professional even though the Complainant also used vulgar and disrespectful language toward him. In that respect the evidence does not appear to me to be in any way conclusive to determine that Officer Sills acted with a discriminatory attitude or with discriminatory conduct toward the Complainant. However, it is not so with regard to the exchanges that took place between Officer Demers and the Complainant.\n[218] As pointed out in the case law, I must, as a conscientious decision-maker, in a civil case like the one before me, scrutinize the relevant evidence with care to determine \u201cwhether it is more likely than not that an alleged event occurred\u201d (see the end of paragraph 49 in the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in McDougall).\n[219] What the preponderance of evidence has established in this case is as follows. The Complainant\u2019s attitude toward the Respondent\u2019s officers during the events that occurred on November 18, 2005, was clearly and definitely aggressive, disrespectful, defiant and finally, assertive of her rights as an Aboriginal person who resides on Cornwall Island.\n[220] Through the extensive testimony that I had the opportunity to hear, it was clearly and unequivocally established that the Complainant consistently argued that the presence of the border crossing on Cornwall Island was undesirable. In that respect, the Complainant had already been, in the past, someone who had been characterized as arrogant and critical regarding the presence of the border crossing on Cornwall Island.\n[221] Furthermore, another incident had occurred on August 6, 2005, where the Complainant had expressed her disagreement with the presence of the border crossing officers on Cornwall Island, threatening that she would blow the border crossing up.\n[222] I can understand that, according to the Complainant, she uttered that threat indirectly, but that was sufficient to convince me that, for a long period of time, the Complainant had not accepted, and perhaps she has never accepted the presence of the Respondent\u2019s officers on Cornwall Island.\n[223] Certainly, the Complainant was entitled to express her disagreement with respect to the presence of the Respondent\u2019s officers on Akwesasne territory on November 18, 2005, as long as her disagreement was not expressed by concrete threatening gestures toward the Respondent\u2019s officers (see Johnson, above, at paragraph 41 in fine).\n[224] Generally, the Tribunal found several implausibilities or even exaggerations in the Complainant\u2019s testimony. In cross-examination, the Complainant admitted that she lied when she referred to certain situations alleged in her affidavit (Exhibit R-1, Tab 16) as well as with respect to other documents that she provided to the Commission for the purposes of its investigation.\n[225] Additionally, the Tribunal found that the Complainant left towards the end of her cross-examination for medical reasons. Several times, I approached the Complainant\u2019s representatives to encourage her to come back to complete the cross-examination that the Respondent\u2019s representative intended to continue. However, the Tribunal was informed by the Complainant\u2019s representative that she was able to return to work while she could have easily come to finish the cross-examination to which she was subject.\n[226] In light of the fact that the documentation submitted by the Complainant contained many inaccuracies, even exaggerations, and that she admitted to the Tribunal that she had in fact lied on a number of occasions, I have come to the conclusion that the Complainant\u2019s credibility was seriously damaged.\n[227] However, I can certainly understand that the Complainant had been personally affected by the presence of the Respondent\u2019s officers for quite some time prior to the events of November 18, 2005. The events of November 18, 2005, certainly gave the Complainant the opportunity to express her exasperation and anger directly toward the Respondent\u2019s officers.\n[228] At the hearing, I was able to see the Complainant\u2019s extreme sensitivity regarding her Aboriginal status with respect to the presence of the Respondent\u2019s officers on \u201cher territory\u201d.\n[229] In that respect, I can understand the actions taken and comments made by the Complainant toward the Respondent\u2019s officers and regardless of the Complainant\u2019s defiance, it was up to the Respondent\u2019s officers and more specifically Officer Demers to prevent the situation from deteriorating and especially, to try to calm her down. That was Officer Demers\u2019 responsibility, and in light of the answers he provided to the Complainant, I do not believe that Officer Demers took steps to maintain control of the dialogue between himself and the Complainant or even to calm her down (see Maynard v. Toronto Police Services Board, [2012] O.H.R.T.D. No 1122, at paragraph 189).\n[230] In reality, the Complainant\u2019s comments to Officer Demers had an aggressiveness that was deliberately defiant and assertive with respect to her being a young Mohawk woman.\n[231] The Complainant first reiterated her Aboriginal status to Officer Demers, and then adopted an assertive attitude regarding the territory on which the Cornwall Island border crossing is located and where the Respondent\u2019s officers were on November 18, 2005. Acting in that manner, the Complainant directly invoked her Aboriginal identity and used it to provoke Officer Demers.\n[232] However, I referred previously to Maynard, which advanced the paradigm that it is the responsibility of the officer who is in the presence of an aggressive person to maintain control of the dialogue and make an effort to calm her down (see Maynard, above).\n[233] What is the situation in this case?\n[234] It has been held that the existence of prejudice behind a policing action must be inferred from the totality of the evidence and not just from the perception of the victim (see Rezko, above, at paragraph 185 in reference to Shaw v. Phipps, 2010 ONSC 3884).\n[235] Consequently, the Tribunal must therefore analyze Officer Demers\u2019 conduct as well as the responses that he provided to the Complainant to assess whether Officer Demers committed discriminatory practices in violation of section 5 of Act.\n[236] In that analysis, the Tribunal was able to make the following findings:\n(a) Prior to the facts on November 18, 2005, Officer Demers admitted that it was general knowledge that there was a dispute between the Canadian government and the Mohawk authorities regarding the territory on which the Cornwall Island border crossing was located;\n(b) Also in his testimony, Officer Demers admitted that he had had no specific training on knowledge gained regarding the culture and traditions of Aboriginal communities;\n(c) Officer Demers raised his voice in dealing with the Complainant\u2019s conduct in an attempt to assert his authority and what he called \u201cforce continuum\u201d;\n(d) In his discussions with the Complainant, Officer Demers pointed to his badge to identify himself to the Complainant, who was questioning him in that respect;\n(e) Officer Demers questioned the Complainant about what job she could hold, for no apparent reason;\n(f) In response to a direct statement by the Complainant on the territorial aspect of the location occupied by the Respondent\u2019s border crossing on Cornwall Island, the evidence clearly established that he answered by saying that he was on the \u201cthe property of Canada Customs\u201d;\n(g) Furthermore, in light of the Complainant\u2019s aggressive and defiant attitude, Officer Demers stated that the Complainant\u2019s conduct could, in his experience, be an assertion that she had done something wrong.\n[237] According to the Complainant, other racist statements were also made by Officer Demers, but he has not acknowledged them.\n[238] Thus, the Complainant claimed that Officer Demers asked her if she was carrying contraband cigarettes, which Officer Demers denied in his examination.\n[239] Furthermore, Officer Demers denied saying the following: \u201cDo you know what our society thinks of your people?\u201d (referring to Aboriginal people).\n[240] Regarding those last two statements, the evidence is not conclusive as to whether Officer Demers made such statements. I will therefore focus on Officer Demers\u2019 conduct as I stated in paragraph 236, above.\n[241] It is true that in analyzing the facts, the credibility of the key players, that is, the Complainant and Officer Demers, must be weighed, but I cannot find that either of these two players had it completely right or wrong. As previously stated, the Complainant\u2019s testimony contained numerous inaccuracies, even lies, considering the documentation she submitted. I therefore accept as being more credible Officer Demers\u2019 responses that he did not ask the Complainant whether she was carrying contraband cigarettes or about what society thought about Aboriginal people.\n[242] Did Officer Demers\u2019 other responses and conduct constitute grounds of discrimination based on the fact that the Complainant was identified as being an Aboriginal person and in that respect, was she a victim of differential treatment under section 5 of the Act? (See paragraph 236.) These are the principal questions that I must answer.\n[243] In order to answer the above principal questions, the Tribunal referred to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decisions in Moore, above, as well as the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s decision in Radek.\n[244] In referring to the provisions in the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Moore, above, if the Complainant has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the Respondent to justify the conduct or practice, within the framework of the exemptions available under human rights statutes. As stated in Moore, if it cannot be justified, discrimination will be found to occur. (See also the well-known principles in O\u2019Malley, above).\nFirst point\n[245] The first test seems to me to have been satisfied to a large extent, meaning that the Complainant was part of a clearly identified group that could be the subject of prohibited discrimination. In fact, at the time of her interaction with Officer Demers, she admitted to him that she was an Aboriginal person and the written evidence entered in the record confirmed the Complainant\u2019s identity as an Aboriginal person. This first point was therefore met.\nSecond point\n[246] Regarding the second test, I also find that this factor was met considering that the Complainant experienced an adverse impact with respect to the services that the Respondent was required to provide to her. In that respect, I find that Officer Demers\u2019 conduct as well as the responses that he provided to the Complainant were factors that I consider as being a form of differential treatment of the Complainant. I therefore find that the second aspect was also met adequately by the Complainant. Indeed, the comments made by Officer Demers appeared to me to be unjustified, even aggressive, and defiant toward the Complainant.\nThird point\n[247] I have no doubt in also finding that the Complainant\u2019s protected characteristic, that is, that she is an Aboriginal person, was a factor in the adverse impact that she was a victim of.\n[248] In fact, all of the responses Officer Demers provided to the Complainant, as well as his conduct in general were in response to the Complainant\u2019s provocation relating to her Aboriginal status and to the territorial assertions she made to Officer Demers.\n[249] In other words, in responding directly to the Complainant\u2019s provocations, and in raising his voice, Officer Demers provided responses that were similar to those given by the Complainant.\n[250] In doing so, I find that Officer Demers overreacted and provided responses that indicated behaviour that was marked by racist stereotyping toward the Complainant. (See the question asked with respect to her job for no apparent reason: Radek, above, at paragraph 135, fifth point).\n[251] Consequently, I therefore find that the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination. Did the Respondent justify its conduct or practice, within the framework of the exemptions available under the Act? In the alternative, did the Respondent rebut the inferences arising from the evidence submitted by the Complainant? (See, for example, Rezko at paragraph 192; Johnson, at paragraphs 35, 63; Pieters, at paragraph 68.)\n[252] I answer these questions in the negative.\n[253] In fact, Officer Demers told the Tribunal that he raised his voice to keep the situation under control. He also stated that that approach was supposed to be a way to initiate an appeasement process with respect to the altercation that took place between himself and the Complainant. In light of the evidence, I find that the opposite reaction ensued.\n[254] Second, the responses that he provided to the Complainant regarding his badge, the reaffirmation that he was on territory owned by Canada Customs, and that the Complainant\u2019s aggressive conduct could be a kind of admission that she had done something wrong, can only lead me to conclude that there was racist stereotyping toward the Complainant.\n[255] In cross-examination, the Commission argued that Officer Demers did not conduct himself according to the criteria in paragraph (f) of chapter 3 of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, which was filed as an exhibit and entitled as follows: Contact with the Public-Sensitivity and Responsiveness \u2013 such that Officer Demers apparently did not act appropriately:\nYou must not make any abusive, derisive, threatening, insulting, offensive, or provocative statements or gestures to, or about, another person.\nIf you have the type of job in which you sometimes need to overcome an obstinate lack of cooperation on the part of the client, for example if you are a customs or tax official responsible for enforcement, a determined, persistent, professional stance will sometimes be needed on your part. (see Exhibit HR-2, paragraph f) (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis added.)\n[256] Even if I acknowledge that my jurisdiction does not extend to an analysis of a breach of the Code of Ethics and Conduct that was put in evidence in this case, I can only find that Officer Demers\u2019 conduct did not meet the criteria stated therein.\n[257] In that respect, Johnson, above, and Abbott v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 1909, and Abbott v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2010 HRTO 1314, draw an interesting parallel between the situations in those decisions with respect to the facts in this case.\n[258] In Johnson, the following was established: Deviations from normal practice and evidence of discourtesy or intransigence are grounds for finding differential treatment (see paragraph 57 of the decision).\n[259] In that same decision, in reference to another cited decision, that is, R. v. Zwicker, [1938] 1 D.L.R. 461 (N.S. Co.Ct.), it was established that Constable Sanford did not display the reasonable tolerance and tact required in a similar situation with respect to his position. It was thus inferred that race was a major factor in that professional failing (see paragraph 60 in fine).\n[260] In the Abbott decisions, above, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, applying the principles stated in Radek, also above, drew negative inferences from the police officer\u2019s conduct in the case taking into consideration the criteria set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. S., (R.D.) [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484.\n[261] In that respect, I adopt the following citation from Abbott (2009), above, where the following is stated at paragraph 45 of the decision:\n[45] Most often, racial discrimination emanates from unconscious attitudes and belief systems.\n[262] And further in the same paragraph, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario stated the following:\nThere is no evidence before me that Sergeant Ruffino consciously subscribes to any such attitudes or belief systems. But these kinds of attitudes and belief systems are part of our historical and social fabric, and are imbued in all of us through social interactions, the education system, the media and entertainment industries, and other means. (see paragraph 45)\n[263] Furthermore, in Rezko, above, I also adopt the comments of the Honourable Judge Pauz\u00e9 when she stated the following at paragraph 191:\n[191] In other words, if race, or another prohibited ground of discrimination, is one of the factors that led the person in authority to apply differential treatment, then profiling has been exercised and cannot be justified on other legal grounds for intervening. [Footnote omitted.]\n[264] In her decision, the Honourable Judge Pauz\u00e9 reproduced paragraph 91 of Peart v. Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 CanLII 37566 (ON CA), where the following is stated:\nRacial profiling is wrong. It is wrong regardless of whether the police conduct that racial profiling precipitates could be justified apart from resort to negative stereotyping based on race. For example, a police officer who sees a vehicle speeding and decides to pull the vehicle over in part because of the driver's colour is engaged in racial profiling even though the speed of the vehicle could have justified the officer's action.\n[265] In the present case, I have no doubt that Officer Demers replied to the Complainant taking into consideration the fact that the Complainant was asserting her rights as an Aboriginal person. I cannot consider Officer Demers\u2019 inappropriate exercise of authority toward the Complainant as sufficient justification. That approach seems to me to be completely consistent considering the case law that I cited above and more specifically, the above\u2011mentioned cases of Johnson, Abbott and Peart.\n[266] In Johnson, it was argued that a comparative test could be applied by taking into account a police officer\u2019s conduct if he had been confronted by a white person instead of a black person.\n[267] With respect, and considering the particular facts of this case, I find that that comparative analysis is not necessary. A simple review of Officer Demers\u2019 conduct, in light of his attitude in general, as well as the responses he provided to the Complainant are sufficient for me to recognize that Officer Demers acted, even unconsciously, based on racial stereotype. (As regards for the peripheral reduced role of comparative evidence, see: Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (Morris), at paragraphs 27-30; Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2013 FCA 75, at paragraphs 16-18).\n[268] In its arguments, the Commission also argues other grounds that could suggest racial profiling in this case. As such, it argues that one of the officers provided incorrect identification regarding the badge that he was wearing.\n[269] Taking into account that the evidence does not make it possible for me to establish the grounds underlying that refusal to provide appropriate identification, I cannot find that there was a ground of discrimination based on that factor alone.\n[270] Similarly, the Commission argues that the closing of the Cornwall crossing following the events on November 18, 2005, is another indication of racial stereotyping linking Aboriginal people to violence.\n[271] First, it is possible in light of the facts in this case to find that the closing of the Cornwall Island border crossing on November 18, 2005, could constitute another racist stereotype making it possible to link Aboriginal people to violence.\n[272] However, it is difficult for me to directly link the closing of the Cornwall Island border crossing to the violence that could have been committed by an Aboriginal group identified as the Mohawk Warrior Society.\n[273] In fact, the evidence was not determinative as to indicate the exact nature of what is known as the Mohawk Warrior Society. In that respect, several witnesses have expressed divergent views on the existence of the Mohawk Warrior Society and on the fact that it was a violent group.\n[274] More specifically, I accept the comments of the Complainant herself, who indicated that the Aboriginal people in the Mohawk Warrior Society were a peaceful group that helped other members of the Akwesasne Aboriginal community.\n[275] In the absence of more probative evidence on the existence of such stereotype, as the Commission submits, I cannot find that that element alone allows me to acknowledge that the Respondent acted in a discriminatory manner in this case.\nIV. Conclusion [276] As a result, and considering the evidence that was established in this case, I therefore indeed find that the Complainant\u2019s complaint is well founded in part, in fact and in law, according to section 5.\n[277] Under the provisions of section 53 of the Act, I must therefore examine the corrective measures necessary to stop the discriminatory practices.\n[278] In light of the evidence submitted, I am of the opinion that it would certainly be appropriate to grant the following remedies:\nA. Remedies with respect to the Complainant [279] Regarding remedies, I must therefore rule on the Complainant\u2019s requests. In that respect, the Complainant argues four points with respect to which I should award her damages.\n[280] For the purposes of this decision, I group the first three points together and award the Complainant an amount of $5,000 under the provisions of paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act.\n[281] With respect to all of the circumstances of this case and considering the reprehensible conduct of one of the Respondent\u2019s officers for which, moreover, I allowed the Complainant\u2019s complaint, I consider the amount of $5,000 to be fair and appropriate.\n[282] I also award interest for the above-mentioned amount, in accordance with subsection 53(4) of the Act and subsection 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[283] In establishing the above amount, that is, $5,000, I more specifically take into account the provisions of the Federal Court in Chopra v. Attorney General of Canada and Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2007 FCA 268, where, at paragraph 37 of the decision, it is indicated that there must be a causal link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed.\n[284] In that respect, the Complainant did not prove in a clear and concise manner the extent of the damages that she intended to claim. Similarly, no expertise, be it psychological or medical, was provided to the Tribunal regarding physical or moral harm that she might have experienced following the actions toward her by one of the Respondent\u2019s officers.\n[285] However, considering the causal link between the discriminatory practices and what the Complainant allegedly suffered in her proceedings and at the hearing, I find that $5,000 seems appropriate considering all of the circumstances in this case for which I was provided evidence.\n[286] Regarding the fourth point, which is a request with respect to costs against the Respondent, it is impossible for me to grant such request given the provisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Mowat, cited as Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, which did not recognize that the Act could allow the Tribunal to compensate a Complainant for any legal expenses incurred for the purposes of an appearance before the Tribunal.\nB. Remedies sought by the Commission [287] At paragraph 256 of its submissions, the Commission argues six points with respect to measures that would allow all of the Respondent\u2019s officers to have sufficient training in regard to discrimination and other accessory measures.\n[288] I will therefore adopt all of the Commission\u2019s recommendations and, in that respect, I therefore order, under paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act, that the Respondent adopt the following measures in consultation with the Commission, whose recommendations are as follows:\n(a) take steps to ensure that its current Code of Conduct contains a specific statement to the effect that the CHRA prohibits Border Service Officers (BSOs) from discriminating on the basis of prohibited grounds when processing travelers seeking admission to Canada;\n(b) provide BSOs working at the Cornwall border crossing with training material regarding the range of different perspectives within the Akwesasne community, and within the CBSA itself, regarding the Warrior Society, and\/or others in the Akwesasne community who may be recognized as Keepers of the Peace;\n(c) develop and implement a policy or directive that specifically prohibits all forms of race-based discrimination under the CHRA, including racial profiling;\n(d) prepare training, separate from the existing on-line Diversity and Race Relations module, that includes discussions of the new policy or directive on race-based discrimination, as well as current case law concerning the phenomenon of racial profiling;\n(e) retain independent consultants with appropriate expertise with respect to the above noted matters to assist in the preparation of the required materials, policies or directives; and\n(f) ensure that within a reasonable period of time, (i) all BSOs have been provided with the training mentioned above, (ii) adequate measures have been put into place to ensure the training is provided to new recruits, and is refreshed periodically as appropriate, and (iii) the CBSA provides confirmation to Ms. Davis and the Commission that these steps have been completed.\n[289] Additionally, and more specifically considering the facts in this case, I find that another recommendation should be applied by the Respondent, in consultation with the Commission, in particular that no operation of the same type as or similar to that which was conducted on November 18, 2005, shall be conducted without the direct participation of the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service or any other Aboriginal police force elsewhere in the country.\n[290] In fact, it seems essential to me that members of Aboriginal police forces be present with the Respondent\u2019s officers in any operation like the one in this case in order to preserve the distinct character of the Aboriginal peoples.\n[291] In that manner, Aboriginal people subject to similar search operations at border crossings should be reassured that their culture, identity and security as Aboriginal people will be better preserved and protected in the future. I issue this recommendation considering that the current agreement with the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service permits their intervention only on arrest and detention and following a request by the Respondent\u2019s officers. (See Exhibit C-6.)\n[292] Finally, and considering the recommendations previously issued, the Tribunal will retain jurisdiction in this case for an additional period of six months until the parties have confirmed that all of the above-mentioned orders have been duly applied.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 9, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1342\/7208\nStyle of Cause: Fallan Davis v.

Introduction [1] Eazy Express Inc. provides courier and delivery services. One of its clients is Canada Post. For this client, Eazy Express provides daily parcel delivery along specified routes. It hires sub-contractors for each of these routes. These sub-contractors follow Canada Post procedures for scanning parcels prior to going out for delivery and again at the delivery point. This ensures parcels are tracked and delivered on time.\n[2] The Complainant used to be a full-time sub-contractor for Eazy Express until she was terminated. Namely, Eazy Express says she was committing too many scanning errors. The Complainant alleges Eazy Express discriminated against her pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the CHRA], by considering the prohibited ground of sex (pregnancy) as a factor in its decision to end her full-time courier job. Pursuant to section 10 of the CHRA, the Complainant also alleges her situation is reflective of a larger practice by the Respondent, whereby it encourages couriers to quit or terminates them when they become pregnant.\n[3] Seven days of hearings were held in Guelph, Ontario from October 22-24, 2013,\nApril 8-10, 2014, and August 12, 2014. A total of nine witnesses were heard.\nII. Preliminary Issues [4] The Commission raised two preliminary issues. First, the Commission asks that the Complainant, another witness and two other persons named during the hearing be identified in this decision using initials. Second, the Commission raises the issue of whether the employment relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent is covered by sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\nA. Identifying the Complainant and other persons by initials [5] On this issue, the Commission submits that, since Tribunal decisions are publicly accessible, the Complainant, a witness, and two additional persons who did not testify, but whose names were mentioned during the hearing, be identified in this decision by the use of initials only and preferably not by their own initials. According to the Commission, personal matters, which do not deal with the issue of discrimination, were discussed during the hearing and will cause undue hardship to the persons involved in the events should they be made public.\n[6] The Respondent objects to the request to use initials and submits the circumstances of the case do not justify it. It is unclear what undue hardship would be caused to the Complainant and the other persons involved and it contends that some of the personal matters go to the Complainant\u2019s credibility.\n[7] I agree that some personal matters were discussed during the hearing that could potentially be harmful to the Complainant and another witness should they be disclosed publicly in this decision. As much as possible, I have anonymized this information in this decision. In fact, I did not find it necessary to refer to the other two individuals named during the hearing that the Commission and Complainant had concerns about. However, given the nature of the personal information disclosed during these proceedings, I will use the initials A.B. to identify the Complainant and C.D. to identify one of the witnesses.\nB. Is the employment relationship between the Complainant and Respondent covered by the CHRA? [8] This second preliminary issue arose because couriers at Eazy Express are independent contractors. According to the Commission, the evidence indicates that: (1) the remuneration and conditions of employment were unilaterally imposed by Eazy Express; (2) all couriers reported to the same supervisor; (3) the couriers were provided the tools of work such as the uniforms, radio and scanner to the exception of the vehicle for which a set compensation was provided;\n(4) the couriers had to perform their work during set hours determined by Eazy Express; and,\n(5) the couriers were obliged to follow Eazy Express\u2019 policies and procedures. Based on applicable case law (namely Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1991] 1 F.C. 571 (C.A.) (QL); and, McCormick v. Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, 2014 SCC 39, among others), the Commission submits there was an employment relationship between the Complainant and Respondent, which is covered by sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA\n[9] The Respondent does not take issue with the CHRA being applicable to the employment relationship between it and the Complainant. Therefore, for the reasons expressed by the Commission above, I accept that the employment relationship between the Complainant and Respondent is covered by sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\nIII. Legal Framework [10] The complaint is brought under two different sections of the CHRA. Section 7(a) of the CHRA makes it a discriminatory practice to refuse to employ or continue to employ an individual, because of a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 10(a) of the CHRA makes it a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or pursue a policy or practice that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Sex is a prohibited ground of discrimination, which includes discrimination on the basis pregnancy (see sections 3(1) and 3(2) of the CHRA).\n[11] The Complainant has the burden of proof of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c...one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u201d (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (SCC) at para. 28).\n[12] In the context of this case, to demonstrate prima facie discrimination the Complainant must show: that she had a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA; that she experienced an adverse impact with respect to her employment; and, that the protected characteristic was a factor in that adverse impact (see Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33 [Moore]).\n[13] A respondent faced with a prima facie case can avoid an adverse finding by calling evidence to show its actions were not discriminatory; or, by establishing a statutory defence that justifies the discrimination. Where the respondent relies on a statutory defence, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent (Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 at para. 67 [Pieters]). Where the respondent simply leads evidence to rebut the prima facie case, only the evidential burden shifts to the respondent (Pieters at para. 68). In that situation, the burden of proof remains on the complainant to establish the respondent\u2019s evidence is false or a pretext, and that the true motivation behind the respondent\u2019s actions was, in fact, discriminatory (see Pieters at para. 74; and, Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) [Basi]).\n[14] Proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence is generally difficult, as recognized by the Tribunal in Basi:\nDiscrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, rarely are there cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practiced.\n[15] Therefore, in many instances, the Tribunal will draw the inference of discrimination, if any, from circumstantial evidence. As the standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities, \u201cAn inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses\u201d (B\u00e9atrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at p. 142).\n[16] Finally, it is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient if the Complainant\u2019s pregnancy was one factor in the decision to terminate her employment (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1990] F.C.J. No. 419 (C.A.) (QL)).\nIV. Evidence at the hearing C. Witnesses called by the Complainant and Commission (i) The Complainant [17] The Complainant commenced her contract with Eazy Express Inc. towards the end of January 2008. She had been referred to the job by Ms. C.D., another courier for Eazy Express and her friend at the time. Initially, she worked as a contract relief worker. At the end of\nMarch 2008, when a full-time courier position became available, the Complainant was offered the contract.\n[18] The Complainant testified that she had been pregnant twice during the time she worked for Eazy Express.\n[19] She declared she was first pregnant in August 2008. According to the Complainant, this first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage around the weekend of August 22-23, 2008. The Complainant stated she informed her supervisor, Glenda Frandsen, and her other co-workers of her miscarriage on Monday, August 25, 2008.\n[20] At some point during the month of August 2008, the Complainant testified that she had been told by Sherry Rideout, a co-worker, that Ms. Frandsen had said to another co-worker: \u201ctake her [the Complainant] to a clinic and get rid of the problem\u201d. The Complainant\u2019s understanding was that this comment was in reference to aborting her pregnancy.\n[21] The Complainant announced a second pregnancy at the beginning of November 2008. She recalls informing 8 of her co-workers about the second pregnancy, but did not directly inform Ms. Frandsen. The Complainant says she did not inform Ms. Frandsen of the pregnancy because she had no reason to tell her. Later on she said she did not inform Ms. Frandsen based on her alleged comments regarding her first pregnancy (\u201ctake her [the Complainant] to a clinic and get rid of the problem\u201d).\n[22] On Friday, November 21, 2008, the Complainant says she was unexpectedly called into a meeting with Ms. Frandsen and advised of the termination of her full-time job as courier.\nMs. Frandsen\u2019s justification for the termination was that the Complainant was making too many scanning errors.\n[23] Before that day, the Complainant says she was never told of her scanning errors, nor made aware of any performance issues and had never been disciplined for any reason whatsoever. She also claimed to have never had access to any report with regard to her scanner performance. She does admit however that some personal and family issues, which also involved C.D. and another co-worker, became a distraction in the office in August 2008. In this regard, the Complainant testified that Ms. Frandsen told her not to let her home life affect her work life. The Complainant recognized this was a \u201cfair request\u201d, but added: \u201cI deny Glenda said I had problems at work\u201d.\n[24] Immediately after being informed of the termination, the Complainant told Ms. Frandsen of her second pregnancy. However, she assumed Ms. Frandsen must have already known about the pregnancy since she had already informed many of her co-workers about it. The Complainant assumed it was common knowledge in the work place that she was pregnant for a second time.\n[25] Despite her termination, the Complainant says Ms. Frandsen offered her a part-time job as a relief worker for the upcoming Christmas period. The Complainant testified that she was shocked and hurt by Eazy Express\u2019 decision to terminate her full-time route but accepted, with reluctance, to work as a relief worker. She felt obliged to accept the offer because she was the only income in her household at that moment, with two children to support and the Christmas period nearing. In the Complainant\u2019s view, it was odd that Eazy Express would continue to have her work in relief considering she had been accused of making too many scanning errors and was not offered any additional scanner training.\n[26] The Complainant testified that she started working as a relief worker on\nMonday, November 24, 2008. During that week, she claims to have overheard co-workers discussing the termination of her subcontract. She confronted them and was told by her\nco-workers that her subcontract was terminated because she was pregnant. During that same week, she says she was also told by Jason Bunnaman, the courier hired to replace her, that she was terminated because she was pregnant.\n[27] December 30, 2008 was the last day she worked at Eazy Express.\n[28] Until the termination of her contract with Eazy Express, the Complainant says she got along well with Ms. Frandsen and agreed she was a decent supervisor and a fair person.\n[29] The Complainant had a baby on July 19, 2009.\n(ii) Trudy Guenther [30] Ms. Guenther testified that she worked at Eazy Express for several years, as an independent contractor, and had three pregnancies during that period of time. As an independent contractor it was her understanding that she was responsible for any time off she needed, which would necessitate hiring someone to cover her route. Therefore, for the last 3 months of each of her pregnancies, she took the initiative to ask a member of her family to replace her on her route. She did not approach Eazy Express about the possibility of accommodation or having them find someone to replace her on her route.\n[31] She also testified that she did not know anyone at Eazy Express who was fired as a result of being pregnant and said that she was not aware of the existence of any policy to deal with pregnant employees.\n(iii) Kim Bilton [32] Ms. Bilton started working at Eazy Express Inc. in the fall of 2005 as a relief driver, until February or March of 2006, at which time she became pregnant. At that time, she had a conversation with Ms. Frandsen and Maria Cunha, another Eazy Express supervisor, about her pregnancy. According to Ms. Bilton, it was suggested to her to get another job where she would qualify for employment insurance maternity leave benefits, because contractors did not qualify for them. It was also suggested to Ms. Bilton that the physical demands of the job may not be good for the pregnancy. In this regard, Ms. Bilton claims Ms. Cunha told her that a pregnant woman working for Eazy Express in Cambridge lost her baby due to the physical demands of the job. Ms. Bilton also testified that she was told that Ted Brooks, the owner of Eazy Express at the time, did not have insurance to cover for pregnancy situations. Ms. Bilton added that no discussion regarding accommodation of her pregnancy took place, but that she could continue to work for the Respondent until she found another job.\n[33] Ms. Bilton found another job and had her baby in October 2006. She testified that she did not feel slighted by the conversation with Ms. Frandsen and Ms. Cunha, nor did she have any ill feelings towards the company or her supervisors. Indeed, after her pregnancy, she returned to Eazy Express as a relief driver for the 2006 Christmas period. In February 2007, she got a\nfull-time route.\n[34] In March or April 2008, Ms. Bilton became pregnant again. Once more, in order to qualify for employment insurance maternity benefits, she decided to get another job before giving birth to her baby.\n[35] Regarding scanning errors, Ms. Bilton was certain that all couriers made mistakes, but in her case, she was never spoken to about them.\n(iv) Sherry Rideout [36] Ms. Rideout is another former Eazy Express courier and co-worker of the Complainant. She also admitted to being friends with the Complainant. She worked for Eazy Express Inc. for approximately 7 months, from February to September 2008.\n[37] Ms. Rideout testified that she considered the Complainant to be a very hard worker, that her work was phenomenal, that she was not lazy and that she was quick at doing her work.\n[38] She testified that there was a lot of gossip and talk in the workplace about the Complainant\u2019s personal and family issues, and her conflict with C.D. She agreed that this was distracting in the workplace.\n[39] Ms. Rideout testified that sometimes drivers made scanning errors and recognized that she made errors herself; and, that it was Ms. Frandsen\u2019s responsibility to follow up with drivers with respect to scanning errors.\n[40] Ms. Rideout thought she got along well with Ms. Frandsen as a supervisor and believed she was a fair supervisor.\n[41] The reason she left Eazy Express Inc. was because she did not make enough money to cover her vehicle expenses. She added that her leaving Eazy Express had nothing to do with\nMs. Frandsen or the way she was treated by the organization.\n[42] Ms. Rideout indicated that, at the beginning of August 2008, she overheard part of a conversation between Ms. Frandsen and another co-worker wherein Ms. Frandsen said: \"Take her [the Complainant] to a clinic and get rid of the problem\u201d. She assumed the comment was in reference to an abortion clinic, but admitted \u201cI could be wrong\u201d in this assumption. In cross-examination, Ms. Rideout stated that she did not hear the other co-worker saying anything and only heard Ms. Frandsen\u2019s statement.\n(v) Jason Bunnaman [43] Mr. Bunnaman worked as a courier for Eazy Express Inc. from September 24, 2008 to March 16, 2011. He replaced the Complainant, as the full-time driver on her route following her termination in November 2008.\n[44] At the time of being offered the Complaint\u2019s full-time route, Mr. Bunnaman testified that Ms. Frandsen told him the reason the Complainant was being removed from her route was that she was making too many scanning errors, missed too much time, that she was pregnant and was considered a liability because Christmas was coming and there were heavy parcels to deliver.\n[45] However, in cross-examination, Mr. Bunnaman was questioned on the content of his written statement of January 10, 2011, made to the Commission\u2019s Investigator, wherein he stated the Complainant had quit her job and had not been fired. He testified that what was written in the statement was true and that he voluntarily wrote the note.\n[46] Mr. Bunnaman testified that he was terminated from Eazy Express after taking unauthorized time off. He considered his firing unfair and remains bitter about it. However, he admits he got along well with Ms. Frandsen as his supervisor.\n[47] During his time at Eazy Express, Mr. Bunnaman testified that he made scanning errors sometimes, which were brought to his attention by Ms. Cunha and Ms. Frandsen, who asked him to be more diligent. There was no mention of any sanctions related thereto. Finally,\nMr. Bunnaman testified that a printout was available for all drivers to check their scanning mistakes from the previous day.\nD. Witnesses called by the Respondent (i) April Desaulniers [48] Upon request by the Respondent, the Tribunal issued a subpoena to Groves Memorial Community Hospital, in Fergus, Ontario, to get a copy of the Complainant\u2019s medical file for the time period of August 22, 23 and 24, 2008.\n[49] April Desaulniers, a Health Information Management Professional with the Hospital, appeared before the Tribunal and produced the Complainant\u2019s medical records. Ms. Desaulniers found no record of any attendance by the Complainant on August 22, 23, or 24, 2008. She did however produce records for two different visits made by the Complainant to the Hospital during 2008.\n[50] The first visit, in May 2008, was for a sprained ankle.\n[51] The second visit, on August 18, 2008, for reasons that do not need to be divulged, indicated the Complainant was not pregnant at that time.\n(ii) C.D. [52] C.D. worked as a courier for Eazy Express Inc. from 2004 to 2012. She testified that she trained all new employees, including the Complainant. She agreed that scanning was an important function of the job.\n[53] In C.D.\u2019s view, the Complainant was making a lot of scanning errors. A report indicating each courier\u2019s scanning errors, left on a desk in the office, was available at the end of each workday for employees to identify their scanning errors, if any. According to C.D., based on consulting the daily scanning error report, the Complainant\u2019s errors were constant. Sometimes, C.D. said she noticed as many as 10 or 15 errors from the Complainant in a day.\n[54] Regarding the Complainant\u2019s first pregnancy, C.D. remembers she was told about it by the Complainant and heard her discussing it openly at the workplace. She remembered she was told on a Monday by the Complainant that she had had a miscarriage during the weekend.\n[55] Regarding the Complainant\u2019s second pregnancy, C.D. testified that the Complainant advised her in private that she was pregnant again. According to C.D., the Complainant asked her not to tell anyone about the pregnancy. C.D. said she respected the Complainant\u2019s wish.\n[56] C.D. also testified about the gossip in the workplace regarding the personal and family issues faced by the Complainant. According to C.D., the gossip was such that she found it distracting in doing her job in view of the tense atmosphere it created. In fact, C.D. testified that she was involved in the personal and family issues being faced by the Complainant. As a result, while C.D. said she and the Complainant were friends until the personal and family issues began, they did not talk much afterwards.\n[57] With regard to the Complainant\u2019s removal from her full-time route, C.D. testified that the Complainant had told her that the reason given for her termination was that the Complainant was committing too many scanning errors.\n(iii) Maria Cunha [58] Ms. Cunha started working at Eazy Express in 2004 and is the supervisor at the Cambridge office. She occasionally works in Guelph, filling in for Ms. Frandsen when she is unavailable. Ms. Cunha and Ms. Frandsen are also life partners. C.D. is also a friend of the couple.\n[59] Ms. Cunha testified about her experience with pregnant women at Eazy Express. She made reference to three different cases.\n[60] In the first case, the driver came to Ms. Cunha in about her fifth month of pregnancy indicating that her doctor had advised her that, due to medical complications, she should not carry on working as a driver. She provided Eazy Express 2 weeks\u2019 notice and moved on to a cab company. This driver subsequently came back to Eazy Express and was given a full-time run.\n[61] The second case was Ms. Guenther. Ms. Cunha testified that Ms. Guenther decided to work up until the birth of her child, took 2 days off, and then came back to work. According to Ms. Cunha, Ms. Guenther arranged to contract out her run to a relative during her two day leave, as she did not want to lose the money for the run.\n[62] The third pregnancy case Ms. Cunha spoke to was Ms. Bilton. Ms. Cunha recalled the conversation she had with Ms. Bilton regarding her pregnancy. She said Ms. Bilton came to her, informed her of the pregnancy, and asked what benefits were available to her from Eazy Express. According to Ms. Cunha, she explained to Ms. Bilton that as a self-employed contractor she was not entitled to employment insurance maternity leave benefits. She advised Ms. Bilton that to her knowledge, the only way she could access employment insurance benefits would be to get a job where she would be on the payroll for a number of weeks. Ms. Cunha indicated that she was prepared to allow Ms. Bilton to continue to work at Eazy Express if she chose to, but that it was Ms. Bilton\u2019s decision to move to a temporary agency in order to access employment insurance maternity leave benefits. Ms. Cunha claims she was only providing friendly advice to Ms. Bilton so that she could become eligible for employment insurance benefits during her maternity leave. Ms. Cunha denies having told Ms. Bilton about a Cambridge employee who had suffered a miscarriage or that Mr. Brooks did not have insurance to cover pregnancy situations. She added that she has no knowledge of the company\u2019s insurance coverage.\n[63] In the summer and fall of 2008, Ms. Cunha says she spent lots of time in the Guelph office because she was training new drivers and there was a Canada Post strike. During that time, she testified that she was advised by Canada Post of a high number of scanning errors made by the Complainant. Ms. Cunha remembered approaching the Complainant on 2 to 3 occasions to speak to her about her scanning errors. During these meetings, she says she would show the Complainant a report illustrating her errors. According to Ms. Cunha, the Complainant did not seem to recall making errors; she seemed distracted and not focused; and, was generally unable to provide any reasonable explanation for her errors.\n[64] Ms. Cunha testified that there was no exchange of correspondence or any written material between Canada Post and Eazy Express with regard to the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors. Furthermore, the scanning error reports were shredded.\n[65] Ms. Cunha also testified about Customer Relations Management complaints being received with respect to the Complainant, which involved customers complaining of a failure to make or attempt to make a delivery. According to Ms. Cunha, when she would approach the Complainant regarding these complaints, she would deny that these errors were being made.\n[66] Ms. Cunha also testified about a discussion she had with Ms. Frandsen at their home on the evening of November 21, 2008, regarding the Complainant\u2019s termination. According to\nMs. Cunha, Ms. Frandsen told her that Mr. Brooks instructed Ms. Frandsen to terminate the Complainant because of the scanning errors she was making. Ms. Cunha further testified that Ms. Frandsen told her that immediately following the Complainant being notified of her termination she informed Ms. Frandsen that she was pregnant, that her husband was without work, that Christmas was coming and that she would be unable to provide for her two kids.\nMs. Cunha said she only learned at that moment that the Complainant was pregnant again.\nMs. Frandsen then told Ms. Cunha that she called Mr. Brooks to explain the situation and that Mr. Brooks maintained the termination of her full time route but, considering the situation, offered to keep the Complainant on as a relief driver for the Christmas period. Ms. Cunha then testified that Ms. Frandsen told her that Mr. Brooks instructed Ms. Frandsen to assist the Complainant with her scanning during her relief work in view of the scanning errors that the Complainant had been making.\n(iv) Glenda Frandsen [67] Ms. Frandsen has worked for Eazy Express since 2004, becoming a supervisor in the Guelph office in 2006. In her role as supervisor, she acts as a liaison between Canada Post and the Eazy Express drivers, and ensures that the drivers are respecting the proper processes, namely the scanning processes. She reported to Mr. Brooks, until he died in December 2012. According to Ms. Frandsen, Mr. Brooks was the only person with hiring and firing authority at the company.\n[68] Ms. Frandsen testified that she has children herself and that lots of women who worked for Eazy Express became pregnant.\n[69] Ms. Frandsen interviewed the Complainant for a position at Eazy Express and recommended her to Mr. Brooks for hire, who ultimately decided to hire her. According to\nMs. Frandsen, the Complainant was initially a very satisfactory driver, who committed limited scanning errors and seemed to get along with fellow drivers. On this basis, she recommended the Complainant for a full-time route in March 2008 and Mr. Brooks authorized her nomination.\n[70] Ms. Frandsen explained that Canada Post provided a daily report identifying each driver\u2019s scanning errors. Those reports highlighted errors made by the driver 48 hours earlier. Those sheets were made available to all drivers for a review on a daily basis. The sheets remained the property of Canada Post and were destroyed after 6 months. Ms. Frandsen added that Canada Post also provided Eazy Express with Customer Relation Management complaints, which would show instances where a driver failed to attempt a delivery.\n[71] Ms. Frandsen said the Complainant\u2019s scanning went from \u201cimpeccable at first\u201d to \u201cbad\u201d in the middle of the summer of 2008 when \u201cdaily errors\u201d arose. She testified that in early\nJuly 2008 Canada Post contacted her indicating that Eazy Express should work with the Complainant to decrease her scanning errors. Ms. Frandsen checked the scanning error report for that day and saw the Complainant had made 6 to 7 errors. In Ms. Frandsen\u2019s view, 1 to 2 errors per week was reasonable, but 6 to 7 errors in one day was quite remarkable. She says she showed the Complainant the errors report and asked for an explanation, but the Complainant did not have one. Ms. Frandsen testified that she worked with the Complainant to find a way to redress the situation.\n[72] In late July, beginning of August 2008, Ms. Frandsen said there were rumours and innuendos in the work place relating to the Complainant\u2019s personal and family matters, including an issue with C.D. and another co-worker. Ms. Frandsen indicated that this was creating tensions among the drivers and between the Complainant and C.D. Ms. Frandsen informed Mr. Brooks of the situation. He told her to tell the Complainant and C.D. to be more professional in their working relationship. As required, Ms. Frandsen met with both of them and asked them to remain professional and to not create tension in the office because of their personal lives. According to Ms. Frandsen, they assured her of their cooperation and promised to discontinue talking about their personal lives at work.\n[73] In early August 2008, a few days after the meeting she had with the Complainant and C.D., Ms. Frandsen says the Complainant informed her that she was pregnant (the first pregnancy). At that time, Ms. Frandsen testified that she asked the Complainant if she could continue performing her duties and asked her that if there was an issue with some of the parcels being too heavy that she would come to her to ask for help. According to Ms. Frandsen, the Complainant said there was no problem and welcomed her invitation.\n[74] On the Monday following the weekend of August 22, 23 and 24, 2008, Ms. Frandsen says the Complainant approached her to advise her that she had lost her pregnancy. She offered the Complainant to take time off if she felt it necessary. The Complainant declined the offer.\nMs. Frandsen invited the Complainant to come to her if the situation changed.\n[75] In October 2008, Ms. Frandsen was informed by Canada Post that the Complainant had committed 25 scanning errors in one day. According to Ms. Frandsen, Canada Post also indicated that, due to the amount of errors, the Complainant\u2019s route was \u201con the chopping block\u201d. Therefore, Ms. Frandsen was concerned the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors could affect Eazy Express\u2019 contract with Canada Post.\n[76] Ms. Frandsen informed Mr. Brooks of the situation. He instructed her to give the Complainant one final warning.\n[77] On that same day, Ms. Frandsen says she met with the Complainant, instructed her to get her errors under control and that it was her final warning. According to Ms. Frandsen, the Complainant broke down in tears, advised her that her husband was not working, that she was the sole income earner in the family, and that she would attempt to keep her errors under control.\n[78] Over the next 2 weeks, Ms. Frandsen says the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors appeared to be declining. However, there were approximately four Customer Relation Management complaints reported by Canada Post over the next six weeks in relation to the Complainant\u2019s deliveries.\n[79] In November 2008, Canada Post again spoke to Ms. Frandsen to inform her that 13 errors had been made in one day on the Complainant\u2019s route, and that the driver of that route needed to be replaced. Ms. Frandsen informed Mr. Brooks of the situation. He asked her if she believed she had done everything possible to assist the Complainant and she replied in the affirmative. He then informed her to \u201ccut her loose then\u201d. Ms. Frandsen understood this as meaning that Mr. Brooks was giving her instructions to terminate the Complainant\u2019s contract with Eazy Express.\n[80] On that same day, at the end of the working day, Ms. Frandsen met with the Complainant. She says she informed the Complainant of the situation with Canada Post and Mr. Brooks\u2019 decision. At that point, Ms. Frandsen says the Complainant began to cry and told Ms. Frandsen that she was pregnant. The Complainant was also worried about her children and the fact that Christmas was coming.\n[81] Ms. Frandsen testified that this was the first knowledge that she had of the Complainant\u2019s new pregnancy. This came as a surprise to Ms. Frandsen because the Complainant had just told her she had suffered a miscarriage a few weeks before. According to Ms. Frandsen, she told the Complainant that she would speak to Mr. Brooks to see if a temporary arrangement could be put in place.\n[82] Following her meeting with the Complainant, Ms. Frandsen testified that she phoned\nMr. Brooks and advised him that the Complainant was pregnant. He authorized Ms. Frandsen to offer relief work to the Complainant to assist her over the Christmas period, but on the condition that Ms. Frandsen assist the Complainant with her scanning.\n[83] That evening, Ms. Frandsen says she phoned the Complainant to advise her that\nMr. Brooks had authorized the relief work.\n[84] According to Ms. Frandsen, the Complainant worked as a relief driver until\nDecember 31, 2008.\n[85] Ms. Frandsen denies being present for or overhearing any conversation involving\nMs. Bilton and Ms. Cunha about Ms. Bilton\u2019s pregnancy.\n[86] She also denies making the comment to take the Complainant to a clinic to get rid of the problem. She further added that she is against abortion and would never make such a comment.\n[87] Ms. Frandsen also denies giving Mr. Bunnaman any reasons for the termination of the Complainant\u2019s contract. She says it is not her practice to discuss with drivers the reasons or the circumstances surrounding the termination of another drivers\u2019 contract.\nV. Has the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination? [88] As mentioned above, to establish a prima facie case of discrimination the Complainant must show: that she had a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA; that she experienced an adverse impact with respect to her employment; and, that the protected characteristic was a factor in that adverse impact (see Moore at para. 33).\n[89] There is no dispute about the first two elements of this analysis. The Complainant lost her full-time job. She was pregnant at the time she lost her job. Pregnancy is protected from discrimination by section 3(2) of the CHRA. The final question is whether the pregnancy was a factor in her losing her full-time route.\nE. Was pregnancy a factor in the Complainant\u2019s termination? [90] In the circumstances of this case, for pregnancy to have been a factor in the Complainant\u2019s termination, there must be some indication that Eazy Express knew about it. If Eazy Express did not know about the Complainant\u2019s pregnancy, then it could not have considered it as a factor in terminating her employment. My assessment of the Complainant\u2019s evidence does not lead me to believe, on a prima facie basis, that the Respondent was aware of the Complainant\u2019s pregnancy when it terminated her employment.\n[91] The Complainant admitted that she did not inform Ms. Frandsen, her immediate supervisor, about her pregnancy until after her termination, because she had no reason to tell her. Later on she said she did not inform Ms. Frandsen because of her alleged comments regarding the first pregnancy (\u201ctake her [the Complainant] to a clinic and get rid of the problem\u201d). In any event, it is clear the Complainant did not directly inform Eazy Express of her second pregnancy. The Complainant assumed her employer knew about her second pregnancy since she had told 8 co-workers that she was pregnant. She assumed her pregnancy was common knowledge in the workplace. However, this abstract belief, without some fact to confirm that belief, is not enough (Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 32 at paras. 41-43, aff\u2019d 2006 FC 785).\n[92] The Complainant says she overheard co-workers discussing her termination and they told her that she was terminated because she was pregnant. However, it is difficult to ascribe any weight to this evidence because none of these co-workers were called to testify and no context is provided to explain the basis of their assertion. On what basis did these co-workers determine that the Complainant was terminated because she was pregnant? Were they told this by a supervisor? Did they assume this because of the timing of the termination? Or, was it simply office gossip? Ultimately, this evidence leaves the Tribunal with another assumption, without anything to back it up.\n[93] The only other evidence brought forward by the Complainant or Commission in support of the Respondent being aware of the Complainant\u2019s pregnancy and having considered that fact in terminating the Complainant\u2019s employment is the testimony of Mr. Bunnaman. However, his evidence was contradictory on this issue. On one hand, he enumerated a list of the reasons allegedly given to him by Ms. Frandsen for the Complainant\u2019s contract termination, including that she was pregnant; while on the other hand he stands behind a previous statement he made to the Commission that the Complainant quit her job and was not fired. In this regard, I note\nMr. Bunnaman\u2019s statement to the Commission was made before his termination. During his testimony he admitted that he considered his termination was unfair and remained bitter about it. This makes me think he may have had a reason to take a stance in favour of the Complainant. Furthermore, I have difficulty believing that Ms. Frandsen, Mr. Bunnaman\u2019s supervisor, would have given him a list of all the reasons for terminating an employee\u2019s contract, including admitting to discrimination. This is especially the case when the witnesses called by Complainant and Commission, including the Complainant and Mr. Bunnaman, indicated that they got along well with Ms. Frandsen and that she was a fair supervisor. Given the above, I give no weight to Mr. Bunnaman\u2019s statement regarding the reasons for the Complainant\u2019s termination.\nF. Did the Respondent have a practice of terminating pregnant women or encouraging them to quit? [94] The other evidence brought forward by the Complainant and Commission, the testimony of Ms. Guenther and Ms. Bilton, attempted to show that the Respondent terminates couriers or encourages them to quit when they become pregnant. The comments overheard by Ms. Rideout would also seem to fall under this allegation. The argument advanced here is that there is a systemic practice which can also be relied upon in support of proving individual discrimination against the Complainant. However, in my view, the evidence does not support the Complainant\u2019s allegations.\n[95] Ms. Guenther and Ms. Bilton were pregnant multiple times while employed by Eazy Express. Ms. Guenther testified that it was her understanding that, as an independent contractor, it was her responsibility to arrange for someone to cover her route when she needed time off, including maternity leave. With each of her 3 pregnancies, she took the initiative to ask a member of her family to replace her on her route. She was not fired or encouraged to quit during or following her pregnancies. The Commission argues that the implication of Ms. Guenther\u2019s actions is that she would have lost her route had she not found a replacement, which seemed to be Ms. Guenther\u2019s understanding as well. However, she also indicated in her testimony that she did not approach Eazy Express to discuss this assumption or accommodation generally.\n[96] Ms. Bilton testified that when she became pregnant in 2006 she had a conversation with Ms. Frandsen and Ms. Cunha regarding access to employment insurance benefits, the physical demands of the job and its potential effects on the pregnancy and the company\u2019s lack of insurance to cover pregnancy situations. During this conversation, she learnt that, given she was working as an independent contractor, she did not qualify for employment insurance maternity leave benefits. According to Ms. Bilton, she was told that, if she wanted access to these benefits, it would be in her best interest to apply for another job where she could qualify for them. This is in fact what she did. She had not negative feelings towards Eazy Express or her supervisors because of this and subsequently returned to work for the company. She followed the same procedure for her second pregnancy, which also occurred while she worked for Eazy Express.\n[97] I do not see anything discriminatory about this conversation. By inviting Ms. Bilton to seek work where she would be covered by employment insurance, and therefore could collect maternity leave benefits, appears to have been raised in the best interest of the employee and for valid economic reasons more than anything else. If the other issues were discussed, which the Respondent denies, Ms. Bilton did not indicate that she thought they were being raised in an effort to encourage her to quit. In the end, Ms. Bilton was not fired and decided on her own to pursue another employment opportunity where she could qualify for employment insurance.\n[98] With regard to the alleged comments made by Ms. Frandsen to another co-worker and overheard by Ms. Rideout regarding the Complainant\u2019s alleged first pregnancy (\u201ctake her [the Complainant] to a clinic and get rid of the problem\u201d), it is difficult to put much weight on this evidence given the co-worker involved in this conversation was not called to testify and no context to the conversation was provided. In any event, I am not sure what inference could be drawn from these alleged comments given there was no evidence regarding any discriminatory actions made against the Complainant with regard to her alleged first pregnancy. Even though the Complainant informed co-workers, including her supervisors, about her alleged first pregnancy, she was not fired and no evidence was submitted that she was encouraged to quit.\nG. Conclusion on prima facie case [99] Therefore, for the above reasons, there is insufficient evidence to support the Complainant\u2019s allegation that pregnancy was a factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate her contract as a full-time driver. Nor was there sufficient evidence to support the allegation that the Respondent terminates couriers or encourages them to quit when they become pregnant. As a result, the Complainant has not established a prima facie case of discrimination under section 7 or 10 of the CHRA and her complaint is dismissed.\nVI. Has the Respondent provided a reasonable explanation for the decision to terminate the Complainant\u2019s contract? [100] While the Complainant has not established a prima facie case, I also accept the Respondent\u2019s explanation for its decision to terminate the Complainant.\n[101] Ms. Cunha, Ms. Frandsen and C.D. testified that the Complainant was making numerous scanning errors between the months of July and November 2008.\n[102] Ms. Cunha said she discussed the situation with the Complainant on a couple of occasions and her reaction was that she did not remember making scanning errors, seemed distracted and not focused and generally unable to provide any reasonable explanation for her errors.\n[103] Ms. Frandsen testified that she received many complaints from Canada Post regarding the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors. When she met with the Complainant and asked her for explanations, she received none. She also says she worked with the Complainant to help her reduce her errors. However, that only seemed to work over the short term.\n[104] Witness C.D. testified that on many occasions, while checking the daily scanning error report, she noticed the Complainant was making a lot of scanning errors, sometimes as many as 15 in one day.\n[105] The evidence submitted by Ms. Cunha, Ms. Frandsen and C.D. supports the Respondent\u2019s explanation that the Complainant was terminated because of numerous and continuous scanning errors. While the Respondent did not submit documentary evidence to support the Complainant\u2019s termination, including any of the scanning error reports, records of conversations between the Complainant and her supervisors or conversations with Canada Post, I am satisfied that the testimony of Ms. Cunha, Ms. Frandsen and C.D. is credible and reliable. They maintained a consistent version of the facts; their answers were generally clear and short; and, despite C.D. having personal issues with the Complainant and Ms. Cunha and Ms. Frandsen still working for the Respondent, they gave me no reason to believe they were testifying in a self-serving manner. Furthermore, the testimony that the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors grew over time and were most significant during a time when she was dealing with many significant events in her life, makes Ms. Cunha, Ms. Frandsen and C.D.\u2019s evidence more plausible than not under the circumstances.\n[106] The Complainant claims she never had access to any report regarding scanning errors, nor was she ever told of her scanning errors. However, many of the witnesses put this claim into question. Ms. Frandsen and Ms. Cunha explained that Canada Post provided daily scanning error reports, which were made available to all drivers for review. When the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors were brought to their attention by Canada Post, Ms. Cunha and Ms. Frandsen testified that they showed the scanning error reports to the Complainant, asked her for an explanation and tried to work with her to correct the problem. Witness C.D. indicated that she consulted the scanning error report regularly and noticed the Complainant was making a lot of scanning errors. Ms. Rideout testified that it was Ms. Frandsen\u2019s responsibility to follow up with drivers with respect to scanning errors. Finally, Mr. Bunnaman testified that a printout was available for all drivers to check their scanning mistakes from the previous day. Mr. Bunnaman added that he made scanning errors sometimes, which were brought to his attention by Ms. Cunha and Ms. Frandsen, who asked him to be more diligent.\n[107] The Complainant and Commission also argue that the continuation of the Complainant\u2019s employment as a relief worker after her termination puts in question the Respondent\u2019s explanation for the termination. If Eazy Express was concerned about the Complainant\u2019s scanning errors why would they then continue to employ her in a role that involved scanning?\n[108] Again, I accept Ms. Frandsen\u2019s evidence on this issue. She testified that once she informed the Complainant of her termination, it was then that the Complainant informed her that she was pregnant; that her husband was without work; that she had to take care of their 2 children; and, that she was desperate because the Christmas period was coming. Ms. Frandsen then told the Complainant that she would speak to Mr. Brooks to see if a temporary arrangement could be put in place. Mr. Brooks authorized relief work for the Complainant over the Christmas rush period, with the caveat that Ms. Frandsen assist the Complainant with her scanning.\n[109] The Complainant\u2019s version of these events does not differ significantly from that of Ms. Frandsen. She says Ms. Frandsen simply offered her the relief work following the Complainant\u2019s declaration that she was pregnant. However, she subsequently admitted that it was possible that Ms. Frandsen contacted her later in the evening to offer her relief work following a conversation with Mr. Brooks. In any event, it is clear that the relief work was offered in response to the Complainant\u2019s announcement that she was pregnant and her related concerns. Furthermore, the caveat of Ms. Frandsen assisting the Complainant with her scanning provides further probability to the reasons behind the Complainant\u2019s termination and subsequent job offer.\n[110] As a final comment, and in evaluating the evidence as a whole, I note that I have doubts about the Complainant\u2019s credibility in general. Apart from some of the contradictions mentioned above (reasons for not informing Ms. Frandsen of her second pregnancy, at para. 91; and, never having access to the scanning errors report, at para. 106), I was struck by the inconsistency between the Complainant\u2019s version of events and the evidence of Ms. Desaulniers. The Complainant told her co-workers and Eazy Express that she was pregnant in August 2008 and that she suffered a miscarriage. She maintained this version of events before the Tribunal until the evidence of Ms. Desaulniers was brought forward. The evidence of Ms. Desaulniers also indicated the Complainant attended the hospital in May 2008 for a sprained ankle. However, the Complainant testified that, although she sprained her ankle around June 16, 2008, she did not go to the hospital. No explanation was provided for these inconsistencies in the evidence. While neither the inconsistency about the first pregnancy or the sprained ankle factored directly into my analysis of the issues in this complaint, I believe these additional credibility issues further reinforce my findings on a balance of probabilities.\n[111] Therefore, for these additional reasons, even if the Complainant had established a prima facie case, I find the Respondent has provided a reasonable explanation for the Complainant\u2019s termination and that this explanation is not a pretext for discrimination.\nVII. Decision [112] For the foregoing reasons, I find the Respondent, Eazy Express Inc., did not engage in a discriminatory practice on the prohibited ground of sex (pregnancy), under section 7 of the CHRA, when it terminated the Complainant\u2019s employment on November 21, 2008.\n[113] I also find the Respondent has not engaged in a practice, within the meaning of section 10 of the CHRA, of terminating the positions of full time couriers, or encouraging them to quit, when they became pregnant.\n[114] As the complaint is not substantiated, no remedy is ordered in favour of the Complainant.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 10, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1798\/2812\nStyle of Cause: A.B. v.

Ruling. 12\nI. Background \u2013 The Complaint [1] On August 12, 2013, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested that the Acting Chair of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Mr. Ken Kelsh (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) against the Canadian Pacific Railway (the \u201cRespondent\u201d).\n[2] The complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) alleges discrimination in employment on account of disability, adverse differential treatment and failure to accommodate, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cAct\u201d) and retaliation, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act. The Complaint was amended on June 1, 2012 to include the allegation of systemic discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s testing and bidding practices and procedures, contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[3] The Complainant belongs to a division of the Teamsters Union (\u201cUnion\u201d). His employment is governed by a collective agreement (\u201cCollective Agreement\u201d) between the Union and the Respondent.\n[4] Although the Commission will not participate in the hearing, it has filed a Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d), and a Response to the Motion which is the subject of this Ruling.\n[5] Oral argument on the Motion was heard via teleconference on September 19, 2014.\nII. Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint [6] The Respondent has motioned to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds below.\n\u2022 The Complainant has failed to exhaust the grievance procedure available to him under the Collective Agreement, contrary to subsection 41(1) of the Act.\n\u2022 Subsection 50(2) of the Act gives the Tribunal the power to determine all questions of law and fact arising in the course of determining any matter under the inquiry, including deciding its own jurisdiction.\n[7] In addition to its submissions in its Notice of Motion, the Respondent submitted the following documentary evidence in support of the Motion:\n\u2022 the Affidavit of Brianne Sly, sworn February 10, 2014 (\u201cSly Affidavit\u201d);\n\u2022 the Complaint;\n\u2022 the Commission\u2019s Section 40\/41 Report and Decision dated April 17, 2012;\n\u2022 an October 20, 2011 letter from David Brown, Union counsel, to the Commission\u2019s Early Resolutions Officer, Caroline Audet (\u201cBrown Letter\u201d).\nIII. Background to the Motion to Dismiss [8] There is no dispute among the parties as to the background to this Motion as described below.\n\u2022 August 24, 2011: the Complainant filed the Complaint with the Commission;\n\u2022 October 21, 2011: the Union sent the Brown Letter to the Commission. The crux of the Brown Letter is that the Union refused to file a grievance on behalf of the Complainant because in the Union\u2019s experience, the Complainant\u2019s lack of a specific certification (\u201cD Card\u201d) while at the same time holding an equivalent position without loss of pay, would not be successful at the grievance or arbitration stage;\n\u2022 The Brown Letter also commented that the Complainant\u2019s human rights matters should proceed at the Commission;\n\u2022 The Commission satisfied itself that the failure to commence a grievance was not attributable to the Complainant, and on June 27, 2012 decided that the Complaint should go forward because another redress procedure was not reasonably available to the Complainant, in accordance with the Commission\u2019s April 17, 2012 Section 40\/41 Report and Decision;\n\u2022 The Respondent did not apply to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s June 27, 2012 decision;\n\u2022 August 12, 2013: the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry.\n[9] With respect to the grievances filed on the Complainant\u2019s behalf, the main steps are described as follows:\n\u2022 June 21, 2013: Mr. Wade Phillips, a Union employee temporarily acting as assistant to the Union director, filed a grievance (\u201cGrievance #1\u201d) on behalf of the Complainant, which included a request for accommodation under the Act. This was the \u201cStep 1\u201d stage of the grievance process;\n\u2022 The Respondent denied Grievance #1;\n\u2022 September 17, 2013: Mr. Phillips filed a Step 1 grievance on behalf of the Complainant (\u201cGrievance #2\u201d) which also included a request for accommodation under the Act;\n\u2022 The Respondent denied Grievance #2;\n\u2022 The Union proceeded to the next stage (\u201cStep 2\u201d) with the Grievances;\n\u2022 The Respondent denied both grievances at Step 2;\n\u2022 The next stage in the grievance process is arbitration;\n\u2022 In February 2014, the Respondent served and filed its Notice of Motion;\n\u2022 Shortly thereafter, the Union withdrew the Grievances on a without prejudice basis;\n\u2022 As part of the Complainant\u2019s response to this Motion, Mr. Phillips swore an affidavit on April 17, 2014 (\u201cthe Phillips Affidavit\u201d) essentially declaring that:\n(i) he pursued the Complainant\u2019s two grievances because he was unaware of the Brown Letter (para. 3); and\n(ii) once he became aware of the Brown Letter on February 18, 2013 [sic], he withdrew the Grievances on a without prejudice basis (para. 4). [My note: given the dates in all the materials regarding this issue, I am assuming that in paragraph 4, Mr. Phillips meant February 18, 2014 and not 2013.]\n[10] The Respondent did not cross-examine Mr. Phillips on his Affidavit.\nA. The Respondent\u2019s Submissions in Support of the Motion to Dismiss [11] The Respondent\u2019s position is set out below.\n\u2022 The grievance procedure is still reasonably available to the Complainant, but he has elected not to pursue it;\n\u2022 The Grievances deal with substantially the same facts which are at issue in the Complaint. The Grievances had gone through to the end of the Step 2 process;\n\u2022 The Union withdrew the Grievance only at the request of Complainant\u2019s counsel;\n\u2022 Further, the withdrawal of the Grievances was on a \u201cwithout prejudice and without precedent\u201d basis, and the Grievances can therefore be revived. The essential nature of the Grievances and the Complaint are the same. In fact, the Complainant can exhaust the grievance process by filing grievances on \u201c\u2026exactly the same facts and the same human rights issues that are before the Tribunal in this matter, at any time\u201d (para. 6, Respondent\u2019s Reply to Complainant\u2019s Response to Motion);\n\u2022 The Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration and Dispute Resolution (\u201cCROA\u201d) is the more appropriate place to address the Complaint, because the CROA arbitrators are more familiar with the specialized work and labour environment that is part of the Respondent\u2019s workplace;\n\u2022 Labour arbitrators have the jurisdiction and the obligation to deal with human rights legislation;\n\u2022 If the Tribunal permitted the Complaint to proceed, it would be contrary to the purposes of subsection 41(1)(a), which the Respondent submits are:\na) to prevent the unnecessary duplication of proceedings, particularly when an arbitrable grievance and a human rights complaint \u201c\u2026 emerge from the same factual matrix\u201d;\nb) to promote the timely resolution of workplace disputes by \u201cexperts in the field who are sensitive to the workplace environment\u201d as set out in Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board v. O.P.S.E.U., Local 324, 2003 SCC 42 (\u201cParry Sound\u201d).\n\u2022 Instead of using the Human Rights procedure when the Union refused to represent him, the Complainant should have availed himself of section 37 of the Canada Labour Code (R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2). [My note: section 37 essentially provides that a bargaining agent shall not act in a manner that is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith in representing any employee under the applicable collective agreement.]\nB. The Complainant\u2019s Position [12] The Complainant\u2019s position is set out below.\n\u2022 The Grievances were mistakenly filed by Mr. Phillips, the temporary assistant to the Union president, because he was not aware of the Brown Letter;\n\u2022 This is not a case of \u201cforum shopping\u201d \u2013 the Complainant\u2019s counsel was not aware of the Grievances until he received this Motion;\n\u2022 The Complainant could not appreciate the consequences of filing the Grievances in terms of their possible impact on his Complaint. He did so only to find out why he was denied any particular position;\n\u2022 When Complainant\u2019s counsel and Union counsel Brown spoke on the phone in the presence of Union director William Brehl in October 2013, Union counsel was very direct, persistent and unequivocal in confirming that the Union did not support a grievance on behalf of the Complainant. Therefore, the Complainant has no grievance or review procedures reasonably available to him;\n\u2022 The Tribunal should dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Motion.\nC. The Commission\u2019s Position [13] The Commission takes the position below.\n\u2022 The Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to dismiss a complaint on a preliminary basis \u2013 it is the Commission which has the primary jurisdiction to do so (Harkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 CHRT 6 (\u201cHarkin\u201d), at para. 20;\n\u2022 The Tribunal is a creature of statute \u2013 the Canadian Human Rights Act. This enabling statute does not give the Tribunal the authority to conduct what would essentially be a second screening function once the Commission refers a complaint for an inquiry. Had Parliament intended that, it would have specifically granted the Tribunal this authority in its enabling statute;\n\u2022 When the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry, the Commission was satisfied that there was no ability for the Complainant to avail himself of any grievance procedure pursuant to subsection 41(1)(a) of the Act because the Union\u2019s counsel had stated in the Brown Letter that the Union would not grieve the Complainant\u2019s issue. Therefore the Complainant had no other grievance or review procedure reasonably available to him;\n\u2022 The Tribunal should dismiss a complaint on a preliminary basis only in exceptional circumstances \u2013 for example, if an inquiry constitutes an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process, or where an inquiry would violate principles such as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice.\nIV. Issues [14] The issues in this Motion are:\nA. Can the Tribunal decide its own jurisdiction?\nB. Can the Tribunal dismiss a complaint at a preliminary stage, before a hearing?\nC. Does the Tribunal have the authority to dismiss this Complaint on the basis that a grievance or review procedure is otherwise reasonably available to the Complainant, as set out in subsection 41(1)(a) of the Act?\nV. Analysis A. Can the Tribunal decide its own jurisdiction? [15] Subsection 50(2) of the Act states:\n\u201c50(2) In the course of hearing and determining any matter under inquiry, the member or panel [of the Tribunal] may decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter.\u201d\n[16] I conclude that by using the phrase \u201call questions of law and or fact\u201d, the wording in subsection 50(2) of the Act is sufficiently broad that the Tribunal can decide questions of its own jurisdiction.\nB. Can the Tribunal dismiss a complaint at a preliminary stage, before a hearing? [17] I also conclude that in very limited circumstances, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to dismiss complaints at a preliminary stage, prior to a hearing. Those limited circumstances are:\ni) when an inquiry would constitute an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s processes, as in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 (\u201cCremasco\u201d), aff\u2019d in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FCA 363; and\nii) where an inquiry would constitute re-litigation of a matter which although not falling into issue estoppel, would \u201c\u2026violate principles such as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration of justice\u201d (Toronto (City) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.), Local 79, [2003] S.C.J. No. 64, at para. 37).\nC. Does the Tribunal have the authority to dismiss this Complaint on the basis that a grievance or review procedure is otherwise reasonably available to the Complainant, as set out in subsection 41(1)(a) of the Act? (i) Abuse of Process and Re-litigation [18] The Respondent does not allege that it would be an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process if the inquiry into the Complaint were to continue.\n[19] Rather, the Respondent essentially alleges that the grievance procedure is the appropriate process to deal with the matters in the Complaint because: a) CROA arbitrators are both familiar with the specialized workplace environment in this Complaint, and also are capable, authorized and obligated to deal with the Complaint\u2019s human rights allegations; and b) section 41(1)(a) of the Act embodies Parliament\u2019s intention to avoid having matters that should be addressed through the grievance process dealt with by the human rights administrative process.\n[20] Even if the Respondent had alleged abuse of process, I find that the situation here does not constitute abuse of process. There has not been an inordinate delay in the Complainant\u2019s case. There is no re-litigation issue here because there is no arbitration decision \u2013 the Step 1 and 2 Grievances were made up of written submissions and written responses. There was no hearing and no arbitrator\u2019s decision, which would have constituted a final decision.\n[21] Proceeding with the inquiry would not violate judicial economy, consistency, finality or the integrity of the administration of justice.\n(ii) Should Tribunal dismiss this Complaint on the basis that s. 41(1)(a) of the Act applies? [22] Although the Tribunal has the authority, in very limited circumstances, to dismiss a complaint at a preliminary stage before a hearing, the issue remains whether that authority extends to the circumstances contemplated in subsection 41(1)(a).\n[23] Subsection 41(1)(a) of the Act states:\n\u201c41.(1) Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that\n(a) the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available;\u201d\n[24] In putting subsection 41(1)(a) into the Act, Parliament recognized that there are parallel proceedings which exist together.\n[25] Subsection 41(1) of the Act obligates the Commission to deal with any complaint filed with it, unless, in certain enumerated circumstances, such as in 41(1)(a), \u201cit appears to the Commission\u2026 that the enumerated circumstance or circumstances apply\u201d.\n[26] Parliament therefore specifically vested the Commission with the authority and responsibility to exercise the discretion to decide whether to \u201cdeal with any complaint filed with it\u201d, subject to the grounds in 41(1)(a) and the subsections following it.\n[27] Parliament did not give that authority to the Tribunal \u2013 otherwise, that authority would be in the Act, as in Harkin, supra, at paras. 21 and 22.\n[28] Further, Parliament did not authorize the Tribunal to be a second screening authority \u2013 that is not the scheme envisioned in the Act.\n[29] If a party is not satisfied with the way the Commission has exercised its discretion under subsection 41(1)(a), that party has recourse by way of an application to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision. The Respondent did not do that after the Commission\u2019s June 12, 2012 decision to proceed with the Complaint.\n[30] The Respondent\u2019s submission that as the Union representative for the Complainant, Mr. Phillips withdrew the grievances solely because Complainant\u2019s counsel asked him to do so is contrary to paragraph 4 of the Phillips Affidavit, in which he avers that \u201c[O]nce I became aware of Mr. Brown\u2019s letter on or about February 18, 2013 (sic) \u2026 I withdrew the grievances\u2026\u201d\n[31] Read together, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Phillips Affidavit establish that Mr. Phillips withdrew the Grievances once he became aware of the Brown Letter. Complainant counsel\u2019s information to Mr. Phillips regarding the situation only served as notice to Mr. Phillips that he had inadvertently grieved, contrary to his Union\u2019s position.\n[32] Put another way, I conclude that Mr. Phillips did not take his instructions to withdraw the Grievances from the Complainant\u2019s counsel, but rather from the Union\u2019s counsel, whose instructions and position were embodied in the Brown Letter.\n[33] During the September 19, 2014 oral hearing of the Motion via teleconference, Complainant\u2019s counsel confirmed that as in the Complainant\u2019s Response to Motion, when the Complainant\u2019s counsel spoke on the phone to Union counsel Mr. Brown in October 2013, with the Union\u2019s director, William Brehl, also present, Mr. Brown again confirmed that the Union would not pursue a grievance based on the D Card issue on the Complainant\u2019s behalf.\n[34] Further, the Phillips Affidavit was sworn in April 2014, after the Grievances were withdrawn. I find that the fact that the Grievances were withdrawn on a \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d basis is irrelevant to the true position of the Union, which had not and has not changed since the Brown Letter. That position is that so long as a potential grievance involves the lack of a D Card, by a potential griever whose salary is not affected by not having the D Card, the Union will not file a grievance, because in its experience, those grievances are never successful.\n[35] The Complainant would be left without recourse to a grievance or other procedure to address his human rights Complaint.\n[36] The Act is clear, as is the case law \u2013 the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to dismiss a Complaint at a preliminary stage of the Tribunal process on the basis of subsection 41(1)(a). That jurisdiction belongs to the Commission.\n[37] For all of the above reasons, the Respondent has not established that the Tribunal should dismiss the Complaint pursuant to this Motion.\nVI. Ruling [38] The Respondent\u2019s Motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 15, 2014\n",

Background [1] The Complainant, Ms. Shelley MacEachern, filed a Complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) on July 6, 2010 (the \u201cComplaint\u201d). In that Complaint, the Complainant alleges her employer, Correctional Services of Canada (\u201cCSC\u201d), on or around early January of 2010 refused her employment as a Corrections Officer in the Grande Cache Institution (\u201cGCI\u201d) as a result of her medical status, Type 1 Diabetes. The Complainant alleges the decision constituted discrimination due to disability. On May 7, 2012, the CHRC referred the Complaint to this Tribunal for inquiry.\n[2] On August 26, 2013, the Tribunal received the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) in which she included her original allegation of discrimination on the basis of disability, but in addition raised a number of new allegations regarding ongoing matters arising during her employment in an administrative capacity with CSC at the GCI between January of 2010 and August of 2013.\n[3] In December of 2013, the Complainant filed her application to amend her Complaint to add the additional claims set out in the SOP (\u201cAmendment Application\u201d). The Amendment Application is the subject of this ruling. In particular, the Complainant seeks to amend the Complaint to add claims under sections 14(1)(c) and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\nII. Complainant\u2019s Position [4] The Complainant\u2019s submissions in the Amendment Application were, at times, difficult to interpret. Extensive detail is provided about the daily activities of the Complainant between May of 2010 and August of 2013. It is difficult to determine which of these daily activities are intended to form the substance of the allegations of harassment under s. 14(1)(c) and retaliation under s. 14.1. However, it should be noted that given that the Complainant is unrepresented by counsel every effort has been made to interpret the material provided in support of the application broadly.\n[5] After being refused a position as a Corrections Officer in early 2010, the Complainant gained employment in an administrative position at the GCI. The Complainant states she experienced no harassment, retaliation or discrimination in her position with CSC at CGI from the filing of her complaint in 2010 until the winter of 2011 when an additional member, Ms. T. Opperman was added to the Complainant\u2019s working group as a Supervisor. Following the addition of Ms. Opperman, the Complainant alleges she experienced a number of occasions of harassing and\/or retaliatory behaviour. Although the Complainant does not identify which of the facts alleged in the Amendment Application form the basis of each of her claims of harassment and\/or retaliation, the essential salient allegations appear to include:\n(a) Supervisors within the Complainant\u2019s Security Intelligence Office (\u201cSIO\u201d) working unit would, on occasion, lock the door of the SIO office and place a sign on the door indicating the SIO office was closed. The Complainant alleges this was done on occasions when the Supervisors were in that office;\n(b) The door of a meeting room was locked on more than one occasion while the Complainant was inside attending a meeting with her union rep;\n(c) A summer student was brought into the SIO working unit to work on a project regarding inmate security that the Complainant had worked on the previous summer. The Complainant alleges the transfer of this project to the summer student was a punishment of her by one of her Supervisors as she had not completed the project on time previously;\n(d) The Complainant was asked to file 40-50 files in a fifteen minute time period;\n(e) The Complainant\u2019s attire was criticized by her Supervisor;\n(f) The Complainant had a verbal altercation with her Supervisor in which she was asked to leave the SIO office although she was working on a matter in the SIO office at that time.;\n(g) The Complainant received an Unprofessional Conduct report from her Supervisor related to her interaction with another employee at the Institution. The Complainant seems to argue that the report was unjustified;\n(h) The Complainant was directed to attend an Attendance Awareness meeting despite the fact that her union representative did not agree with the direction and following that meeting was placed on three months probation;\n(i) The Complainant was required to move her desk into another working unit for approximately six weeks as a result of an ongoing conflict resolution issue with another Supervisor; and\n(j) The Complainant has had a series of ongoing disputes with her Supervisor involving use of lieu time payouts, sick pay and cash payouts. She alleges she was forced to take leave without pay rather than use lieu time for sick days.\n[6] The Complainant argues that all of these actions are harassment and\/or retaliation for her Complaint.\nIII. Respondent\u2019s Position [7] The Respondent argues there is no factual connection between the matters raised in the Complaint and the matters raised in the Amendment Application. In particular, the Respondent alleges the matters relating to harassment are simply an ongoing issue of workplace conflict and compensation entitlement unrelated to the Complainant\u2019s disability. They allege in regard to retaliation claims that no evidence has been put forward to suggest those parties involved in the matters in the Amendment Application were aware of the Complaint or reacting to it. The Respondent adds, the Complainant\u2019s allegations state there were no \u201cretaliation\u201d issues for more than 18 months following the filing of the Complaint. Therefore, there is no factual nexus between the original Complaint and the matters in the Amendment Application.\n[8] The Respondent\u2019s position is further that the Amendment Application should not be granted as it will suffer prejudice should the additional allegations be added. The alleged prejudice to the Respondent includes:\n(a) The claims as set out in the Amendment Application are not stated with sufficient particularity to allow the Respondent to know the case to be met;\n(b) The matters set out in the Amendment Application are the subject of a grievance initiated by the Complainant before the Treasury Board of Canada and could therefore result in multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting resolutions; and\n(c) The allegations in the Amendment Application would result in a significantly longer hearing involving multiple witnesses with no knowledge of matters raised in the Complaint.\nIV. Amending Complaints [9] It is well established that the Tribunal has the authority to amend complaints \u201c...for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, [1994] 1 FC 3 (FCA); cited in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30 [Parent]).\n[10] Despite the broad discretion in granting amendments, an amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint, as this would bypass the referral process mandated by the Act (see Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at paras. 7-9; and, Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 45929 (CHRT) at para. 11).\n[11] Given this restriction, a proposed amendment must be linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint. There must be a factual nexus between the original complaint and the amendment sought (see Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at para. 7; and, Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 at paras. 17-18; and, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2012 CHRT 24 at para. 16).\n[12] When the proposed amendment arises out of a different set of facts such that it constitutes a new complaint, it is outside of the scope of the complaint referred from the CHRC and therefore the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to include it in its inquiry (Canadian Museum of Civilization Corp. v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, 2006 FC 704 at paras. 40 and 50).\n[13] In addition to establishing a link between the subject of the original complaint and the proposed amendment, the Tribunal must also examine the prejudice that the Respondent could suffer in allowing the Complainant to amend its complaint. As stated in Parent, supra, at paragraph 40:\nThe issue of prejudice is the predominant factor to be considered in such circumstances: the amendment must not be granted if it results in a prejudice to the other party.\n[14] The substance of the Complainant\u2019s allegations as set out in her Amendment Application are that she has experienced ongoing harassment and retaliation between the winter of 2011 and the fall of 2013. The Complainant\u2019s position is that these claims should be added as harassment under section 14(1)(c) or as retaliation for the filing of her Complaint under s. 14.1.\n[15] Sections 14 and 14.1 of the Act provide:\n14. (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[16] While the Complainant\u2019s original Complaint as referred by the CHRC dealt with her denial of employment as a Corrections Officer as a result of her medical condition, being diabetes, the matters set out in the Amendment Application deal broadly with an ongoing issue of workplace dispute in her administrative role with the GCI. In order for the Complainant to amend her Complaint on the basis of s. 14(1)(c) to add harassment, that harassment would by necessity have to be connected in some way to the facts and\/or disability that form the substance of her original Complaint. There is no indication that any of the matters alleged as harassment are connected with or relate to the original Complainant or the Complainant\u2019s diabetes.\n[17] In order for the matters raised in the Amendment Application to fall within s. 14.1 and constitute retaliation for the Complaint, there would have to be some indication put forward by the Complainant that the matters occurred with some knowledge of or in response to the Complaint. The Complainant does not allege that her Supervisors in the administrative position were aware of or responding to the Complaint, and there is no connection between the refusal of employment giving rise to the original Complaint and any of the matters arising in the Amendment Application. Rather, the Complainant\u2019s allegations of retaliation appear to focus primarily on allocation of work, formal leave policies and interpersonal matters between the Complainant and one of her supervisors \u2013 none of which are connected in fact by the Complainant to her diabetes or her Complaint.\n[18] There is no factual nexus between the matters in the Amendment Application and the Complaint. Rather, the Amendment Application constitutes a substantially new claim and this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear that new claim without referral from the CHRC.\n[19] The Respondent also claims it will be prejudiced by the Complainant\u2019s proposed amendments because the claims are not stated with sufficient particularity to know the case to be met. Claims for particularization can usually be remedied by filing amended Statements of Particulars and\/or providing ample time and opportunity to respond to the allegations (see for example, Itty v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2013 CHRT 33 at para. 61; Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2013 CHRT 9 at para. 14; Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 CHRT 31 at para. 31; and, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2012 CHRT 24 at para. 17). In any event, it is not necessary to address the Respondent\u2019s prejudice argument as I am satisfied that the amendments are not appropriate for the reasons stated above.\n[20] Given the above, the finding that there is no factual nexus between the original Complaint and the matters raised in the Amendment Application, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to permit the Complaint to be amended to allow the additional matters to be heard.\n[21] Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s Amendment Application is hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nRicki Johnston\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 11, 2014\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1823\/5312\nStyle of Cause: Shelley Annette MacEachern v.

Conclusion and Decision. 27\nI. Overview [1] The facts related to this complaint have the potential to raise important and complex issues regarding the treatment of inmates with mental disabilities under the care and control of Correctional Service of Canada (CSC). The scope of these issues and their implications is at the core of the present motion.\nII. Complaint [2] On March 12, 2008, Ms. Doreen Lothian, the legal guardian of the Complainant,\nMr. Roger Desmarais, made a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) alleging that CSC discriminated against Mr. Desmarais based on intellectual\/mental disability and family status contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[3] The complaint alleges that this discrimination occurred, on a continuing basis, during two different federal sentences that CSC was responsible for administering: the first sentence being from November 13, 2001 to November 12, 2003; and, the second sentence from\nDecember 20, 2005 to December 19, 2007.\n[4] In addition, the complaint alleges that the discrimination against Mr. Desmarais was a \u201creflection of a systemic issue regarding the treatment of intellectually disabled offenders and in particular for those without adequate family support.\u201d\n[5] The complaint indicated that there was sufficient evidence, at that point in the proceedings, to indicate that there was a possibility that the systemic issues, which existed when Mr. Desmarais alleged he experienced discrimination, still exist.\n[6] On November 22, 2010, David Langtry, Deputy Chief Commissioner of the Commission informed the parties, by letter, of its decision:\n\u201c...the Commission decided, pursuant to section 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), to request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint because:\nthe issues raised by this complaint are indicative of possible systemic barriers to the treatment and rehabilitation of inmates with mental disabilities and as such, further inquiry by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is warranted.\n[\u2026]\nFor your information, either party to a complaint can ask the Federal Court to review a Commission\u2019s decision under subsection 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act.\u201d\n[7] On August 16, 2012, the Commission provided the Tribunal with its Statement of Particulars, in which it further defined the ongoing systemic discriminatory practices that, it argues, are at the core of the discrimination suffered by Mr. Desmarais. These include:\n(a) Placing inmates with mental disabilities in segregation, and its adverse effect on their physical and mental well-being;\n(b) The lack of programming tailored to the needs of intellectually disabled inmates;\n(c) Policies involving the assessment of risk and security classification; and\n(d) Processes involved in obtaining informed consent to obtain information on an inmate with an intellectual deficiency or mental illness.\nIII. Motion [8] On July 26, 2013, the Respondent filed a motion to strike part of the complaint. More specifically, the Respondent submits that this Tribunal should quash the systemic discrimination aspects of this inquiry or, in the alternative, limit their scope to the relevant periods of time, i.e. from 2001 to 2003 for the issues focused on the administrative segregation practices at CSC and the alleged lack of programming for intellectually disabled inmates, and from 2004 to 2006 for the allegations based on the policies applicable to the assessment of risk and security classification.\n[9] The Respondent further requests, in the alternative, that the disclosure of evidence related to the allegations of systemic discrimination be limited to those documents which defined the existing situation while the Complainant was imprisoned under the supervision of CSC.\nIV. Facts [10] Mr. Desmarais, who was born on October 2, 1982, has been diagnosed with an overall IQ of 56, which accords with the DSM-IV designation of \u201cmental retardation,\u201d and he is illiterate.\n[11] In 2001, when the Complainant was 18 years old, he was convicted of three sexual offences and one count of breaking and entering, and was sentenced, inter alia, to a term of imprisonment of two years in a federal penitentiary and three years of probation, with the strong recommendation that he be transferred to the Philippe Pinel Institute of Montreal (\u201cPinel\u201d) for treatment.\n[12] In the course of the trial, the judge, who wanted to ensure that Mr. Desmarais would be transferred to Pinel after sentencing, called Mr. Bigras as a witness, who was a CSC classification officer.\n[13] In his testimony, Mr. Bigras associated Mr. Desmarais with being a member of a group of federal inmates who had significant intellectual deficits. Mr. Bigras, who had never met Mr. Desmarais, indicated that he knew little about Mr. Desmarais beyond his IQ. Nevertheless, he predicted that Mr. Desmarais would not go to a minimum security prison but could end up in Port Cartier maximum-security prison, and would most likely be reviewed for a detention order. The following are some of the statements made by Mr. Bigras:\n\"Excusez, je sais que [...] je connais un peu ses d\u00e9lits. Je n\u2019ai lu aucun rapport puis je sais un peu la [...] au cause de son quotient intellectuel, \u00e7a se limite \u00e7a\n[...]\nOn n\u2019a pas toujours l\u2019encadrement \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention en protection o\u00f9 on les envoie en isolement pr\u00e9ventif [\u2026]\"[1].\n[14] The Complainant served his first term from November 13, 2001 to November 12, 2003.\n[15] The Complainant was first incarcerated at the Regional Reception Center where his case was assessed in view of determining the appropriate security classification. CSC assigned the Complainant a medium level classification and determined that he should be incarcerated at La Macaza, an institution in the Qu\u00e9bec region, which has a number of programs for sexual offenders.\n[16] The CSC assessment process identified Mr. Desmarais as requiring:\n\u201cintensive treatment specifically targeting the needs of intellectually challenged sexual offenders, and a long-term, consistent follow-up plan for community reintegration\u201d.[2]\n[17] In February 2002, Pinel refused to accept Mr. Desmarais for admission.\n[18] Also in February 2002, Mr. Desmarais was refused by the CSC Regional Mental Health Unit (\u201cRHMU\u201d), as it reportedly did not have the \u201cappropriate structure or treatment opportunities for an Anglophone, low-functioning sexual offender\u201d.[3]\n[19] On April 10, 2002, the Complainant was transferred to administrative segregation at La Macaza because he had been sexually exploited by other inmates and had been the object of complaints for \u201ccompulsive masturbation\u201d. According to a CSC psychological report, Mr. Desmarais was unable to participate in the sex offender treatment program at La Macaza institution due to \u201cproblems related to his mental retardation\u201d.[4]\n[20] The Complainant was kept in administrative segregation for a period of 11 months.\n[21] In October 2003, the Complainant was once again transferred to administrative segregation, this time after he had threatened an employee.\n[22] The Complainant was released on November 12, 2003, after completing his sentence.\n[23] Since 2003, the Complainant has been under a protective regime of tutorship (guardianship).On June 7, 2007, the Quebec Superior Court appointed Ms. Doreen Lothian as Mr. Desmarais\u2019 legal guardian.\n[24] In July, October and November of 2005, the Complainant was arrested for several breaches of probation, as well as for resisting arrest.\n[25] On December 21, 2005, the Complainant was sentenced, inter alia, to a term of incarceration of two years with regard to these arrests. He served this second term of incarceration from December 21, 2005, to December 20, 2007.\n[26] Given his history, the Complainant was assessed as a maximum security inmate. However, his transfer to a maximum security institution was suspended when CSC requested his transfer to Pinel.\n[27] On or about February 7, 2006, the Complainant was granted admission to Pinel, where he was transferred in April 2006 and where he remained until the completion of his term of incarceration.\n[28] On March 19, 2008, the Complainant, through his guardian, filed a complaint with the Commission, alleging discrimination pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA.\n[29] On April 12, 2011, in the course of new criminal accusations for events of a sexual nature that took place after the Complainant\u2019s second term of incarceration, the Complainant was declared unfit to stand trial by the Court of Qu\u00e9bec, Criminal Chamber.\n[30] On July 26, 2011, the Tribunal Administratif du Qu\u00e9bec (TAQ) affirmed the Court of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s decision that the Complainant was unfit to stand trial and ordered that he be detained.\n[31] On September 10, 2013, the TAQ, which each year reviewed the Complainant\u2019s situation to determine if he had become fit to stand trial, declared that he had become fit to stand trial and sent his case back to the criminal court.\n[32] As a result of this decision, Mr. Desmarais was in the provincial detention at Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies, while awaiting his return to court scheduled for September 21, 2013.\nV. Arguments A. Respondent\u2019s Position (i) The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Moore supports limiting the scope of the present complaint [33] The decision rendered on November 9, 2012, by the Supreme Court of Canada in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, is at the core of the Respondent\u2019s position. The following paragraphs describe the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Moore decision.\n[34] The Moore case is centered on allegations of discrimination by the Province of British Columbia against Jeffrey Moore, a child with a severe learning disability, whose needs for intense remedial instruction were not met by the public school system during a period of fiscal restraint in that province.\n[35] Throughout its reasons, the Supreme Court emphasizes the necessity to focus a claim of discrimination \u201cduring the relevant period\u201d: Moore at paras. 35, 37, 50 and 51. It also stresses that a Tribunal\u2019s remedies must be \u201csustainable given the actual scope of the complaint\u201d: Moore at para. 56. This decision has shed new light on cases where allegations invoked \u201csystemic discrimination\u201d to enlarge the scope of an individual claim. The Respondent argues that since Moore, this is no longer possible.\n[36] The Respondent submits that, in light of this recent decision, the Courts and the Tribunal must ensure that inquiries by the Tribunal remain centered on the specific circumstances of the complainant. Whatever systemic conclusions are drawn in a particular case must therefore flow directly from these personal circumstances.\n(ii) The present facts to do lend themselves to a finding of systemic discrimination [37] The Respondent states that the present facts do not open the door to findings of systemic discrimination, and that the Complainant\u2019s allegations only relate to the first period of incarceration and to a short portion of the second period of incarceration.\n[38] More specifically, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s examination of CSC\u2019s practice of placing inmates with mental disabilities in administrative segregation should be limited to practices in place at CSC in 2001-2003, and for a few days in April 2006, when the Complainant was put into administrative segregation. The Respondent notes that the Complainant was never subjected to prolonged periods of administrative segregation during his second period of incarceration.\n[39] Regarding CSC\u2019s alleged lack of programming for intellectually disabled inmates, the Respondent submits that the inquiry should be limited to the first term of incarceration of the Complainant, as he was transferred to Pinel shortly after he was incarcerated for the second time, and was thus not in need of a program dispensed by CSC.\n[40] The Respondent further submits that the Tribunal\u2019s examination of the applicable policies involving the assessment of risk and security classification should only be centered on the Complainant\u2019s two periods of incarceration as different practices may or may not have developed after April 2006, and are not relevant to evaluate the circumstances specific to the Complainant.\n[41] In response to the Commission\u2019s allegation that the CSC\u2019s processes for obtaining the informed consent of an inmate with an intellectual deficiency or mental illness so as to access personal information are discriminatory, the Respondent contends that this issue should also be restricted to the Complainant\u2019s two periods of incarceration.\n[42] The Respondent argues that the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the complaint should be restricted in this manner as the Complainant has ceased to be under the responsibility of CSC since 2007, and that whether the Complainant will ever become under the care of CSC in the future remains unlikely, hypothetical, and ultimately, lies mostly with the Complainant himself. Furthermore, as the Respondent will in all likelihood never again be found fit to stand trial, it follows that he would not gain any personal benefit from an inquiry into the evolution of practices and policies at CSC. The Respondent submits that it would therefore be useless for the Tribunal to look at current CSC practices and to oversee the implementation of ameliorative measures, as, like Jeffrey Moore who would not re-enter the public school system, the Complainant will most likely never re-enter a federal penitentiary.\n[43] The Respondent submits that, as set out in Moore, the inquiry should focus on the individual discrimination that the Complainant would have suffered during the long, past periods, during which he was under the supervision of CSC. To extend the inquiry into CSC\u2019s previous and current policies on each one of the four grounds of discrimination alleged in the complaint would be akin to transforming the Tribunal into a Royal Commission and would shift the focus of the inquiry too far beyond the Complainant\u2019s specific circumstances. The Respondent submits that this interpretation of Moore is supported by the recent Supreme Court of British Columbia decision British Columbia v. Mzite, 2013 BCSC 116 (Mzite) and the Court\u2019s statement at paragraph 54 which reads:\nAs an adjudicator of the particular claim before it, the investigation of practices at VIRCC that resulted in interruptions of medication would be directed to the period of Mr. Mzite\u2019s incarceration. If a discriminatory practice was found to exist at the time, it could not be assumed that any remedy individual to Mr. Mzite would have remedial consequences for others in his circumstances after a lapse of two years from the date of Mr. Mzite\u2019s release from VIRCC. The weight given to the allegation of systemic discrimination in determining the public interest in accepting this extremely late-filed complaint suggests an improper purpose, namely an investigation into the practices of the provision of medication to prisoners at VIRCC as of December 2010 and later, at least twenty months after the discriminatory acts alleged by Mr. Mzite. This, coupled with the aforementioned errors in assessing the reason for delay, I find is patently unreasonable.\n[44] The Respondent submits that any developments that may or may not have occurred since the Complainant was incarcerated are of no relevance to the inquiry into the present complaint. The Tribunal should therefore not undergo any analysis of systemic discrimination because it would serve no useful purpose for the Complainant.\n[45] The Respondent submits that while the specific facts of the Desmarais case do not give rise to a broad inquiry into CSC\u2019s practices, the Starblanket case, which is also presently in front of the Tribunal, might be a more appropriate case. The Starblanket case also deals with an intellectually disabled inmate who has spent prolonged periods of time in administrative segregation. However, unlike Mr. Desmarais, Mr. Starblanket is still currently imprisoned in a federal institution, or was until a short time ago.\n(iii) The proper administration of justice favours limiting the scope of the present complaint [46] Pursuant to sections 44 to 46 of the Act. The Respondent submits that, should the Tribunal accept to undergo a large inquiry into the practices and policies put into place by CSC since 2001, and considering that the Complainant is in no way affected by such policies, it would require a very serious commitment of the part of all parties and the Tribunal in terms of both financial and human resources, as disclosure would be exponentially wider and there would be more witnesses, both ordinary and expert.\n(iv) The present motion could not have been brought sooner [47] The Respondent alleges that it could not have judicially reviewed the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal on these grounds because the referral was made on November 2, 2010, which is two years before the Moore decision was rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[48] The Respondent further submits that it could not have brought this motion sooner and contends that, in any event, neither the Complainant nor the Commission would be prejudiced by the few months delay between the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Moore and the date of this motion.\n[49] It submits that a ruling on this Motion before the hearing is in the best interest of all parties and would be more advantageous than doing so after full disclosure and the commencement of the hearings.\n(v) Orders sought [50] For these reasons, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should quash the allegations of systemic discrimination from the realm of its inquiry.\n[51] The Respondent also asks that all requests for disclosure that do not relate to the specific circumstances of the complaint be dismissed, as they are outside the realm of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry and thus, are not relevant.\n[52] In the alternative, should the Tribunal remain convinced that there would be some benefit to a review of the allegations of systemic discrimination, the Respondent requests that such a review be limited to the specific periods of time for which the Complainant was detained in an institution under the supervision of CSC.\n[53] In the alternative, the Respondent requests that the disclosure of evidence related to the allegations of systemic discrimination be limited to documents that address the situation that existed when the Complainant was imprisoned under the supervision of CSC, and not at any other time.\nB. Commission\u2019s position (i) The motion should not be granted in the absence of a hearing on the merits. [54] The Commission disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the scope of this complaint should be reduced and that it should not have to provide disclosure relating to alleged ongoing systemic discrimination. The Commission submits that the Tribunal is the master of its own proceedings, but must exercise its power cautiously when asked to dismiss a complaint or portions of a complaint without a hearing. The CHRA already includes a screening function, which is performed by the Commission. The Commission notes that the referral of the complaint to the Tribunal in no way restricted the scope of the complaint so as to exclude allegations of systemic discrimination and that the Tribunal\u2019s mandate was determined by the Commission\u2019s referral letter. Section 50(1) of the CHRA also states that the Tribunal \u201cshall\u201d provide parties with \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present evidence and make arguments on the matters raised in the complaint. The Commission is of the view that in the present case, this includes allegations of systemic discrimination.\n[55] The Commission submits that, as per Buffet v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 16 (Buffet) and Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (FNCFCS) aff\u2019d in Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2013 FCA 75, a situation such as this requires a full hearing into the facts. It relies on the words of Prothonotary Aronovitch in AGC v. First Nations Child and Family Services et al., T-1753-08 (Amended Order \u2013 November 26, 2009) at p. 5 (aff\u2019d AGC v. First Nations Child and Family Caring Society et al., 2010 FC 343) (FNCFCS 2009 Order) where he held:\n\u201c[t]he subject matter of the complaint being serious and complex, I agree that it should not be determined in summary fashion and in the absence of the factual record necessary to fully appreciate the matters in issue.\u201d\n[56] The Commission argues that the present case involves a complex set of facts and law, which raise serious issues regarding the treatment of inmates with mental disabilities. The Office of the Correctional Investigator (OCI) has, over the years, consistently reported on and expressed concern about the practice of segregation as a means to manage inmates suffering from mental illness. This view has been echoed by the Federal Court of Canada, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the United Nations Committee Against Torture, who have declared that the solitary confinement of mentally ill offenders constitutes a form of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment and, in some circumstances, torture. The Commission argues that to fully appreciate these issues, a hearing into the merits of the case is required.\n(ii) The complaint should not be limited to the Complainant\u2019s two periods of incarceration under the care of CSC [57] The Commission further argues that the systemic discrimination is alleged to have occurred prior to Mr. Desmarais\u2019 incarceration, during his incarceration period and to be ongoing. It is also alleged to have affected numerous other incarcerated persons under the care and control of CSC. In light of this, the Commission submits that it would not be acceptable for the complaint to be limited to the Complainant\u2019s two incarceration periods as requests the Respondent, particularly on the preliminary basis presently sought. In this regard, the fact that the Complainant is no longer housed in a CSC facility, that there has been a significant passage of time since he has been incarcerated under the care or control of CSC and that he was not incarcerated at the time the complaint was filed is, in the Commission\u2019s view, of no importance. Furthermore, and contrary to the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the fact that he was found unfit to stand trial in 2011 is not meaningful as he could still be returned to CSC\u2019s care and control.\n[58] The Commission states that it will seek to demonstrate that the entire events experienced by Mr. Desmarais result from the application of systemic policies and\/or practices by CSC. To demonstrate this, the Commission intends to put forward similar factual evidence of inmates with intellectual disabilities who were placed in solitary confinement for extensive periods of time.\n[59] These include the cases of Marvin Jeffrey Tekano and Ashley Smith, the Starblanket case referred to by the Respondent, as well as numerous cases documented by the OCI over the last decade. This would also include reports dealing with the issue of solitary confinement issued by various United Nations human rights organizations. The Commission submits that, unless the Respondent \u201ccategorically affirm[s] that the alleged practices are no longer employed and further undertakes that they will not be employed in the future, the proper administration of justice requires the Tribunal to hear the systemic allegations [...]\u201d. The Complainant is entitled to have his day in court and to present all the evidence, including any systemic evidence, in support of his allegations.\n[60] The Commission is of the view that if the Respondent intends to argue that the alleged discriminatory practices no longer occur and\/or that CSC\u2019s policies have changed, the Respondent is entitled to bring this evidence as part of its case. Furthermore, should Mr. Desmarais fail to demonstrate a prima facie case of systemic discrimination, after having had the opportunity to fully present the evidence on this at a hearing, the Tribunal could then dismiss those systemic portions of the complaint.\n[61] The Commission submits that, as was the case in Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2013 CHRT 12 (Emmett), the Respondent has not discharged its burden to demonstrate that its motion should be granted.\n(iii) The purpose of the CHRA supports dismissing the Respondent\u2019s motion [62] The Commission is of the opinion that the Respondent\u2019s statement that the Tribunal can neither hear allegations of systemic discrimination nor award systemic remedies is a negation of the very purpose of the CHRA for two reasons. The first is that it would undermine the preventive purpose of the CHRA. This purpose is made clear in section 53(2) of the CHRA, which reads:\n(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n[Emphasis added]\n[63] The Commission contends that this section expressly authorizes the Tribunal to use its remedial power to address systemic discrimination and that its interpretation is in keeping with the words of the Supreme Court in CN. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 (Action Travail) at p. 1142:\nWhen confronted with such a case of \u2018systemic discrimination\u2019, it may be that the type of order issued by the Tribunal is the only means by which the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act can be met.\n[64] The second reason is that, if CSC\u2019s motion were granted, the Commission submits that it would be a significant waste of public resources as other potential complainants in a situation similar to that of Mr. Desmarais would have to re-litigate the same issues raised in this case.\n[65] In the FNCFCS 2009 Order, Protonotary Aronovitch stated:\n\u201cThere is an interest however, in allowing a full and thorough examination in the specialized forums of the Tribunal, of issues which may have impact on the future ability of aboriginal peoples to make discrimination claims.\u201d\n[66] The Commission argues that, similarly, should CSC\u2019s motion be granted, the ability of disabled inmates or any other vulnerable group in Canadian society to make meaningful future complaints that raise systemic issues will be seriously restricted, which will additionally undermine the purpose of the CHRA to prevent discriminatory practices.\n[67] Finally, the Commission submits that it is not asking the Tribunal to carry out a \u2018Royal Commission\u2019 but rather, to carry out its statutory duty to hear and assess the evidence related to the allegations raised in this complaint, both of the individual and systemic nature. The Commission submits that the full inquiry into past and current government practices that this case requires is the very type of inquiry that this Tribunal, as a quasi-judicial specialized human rights body, is statutorily empowered to conduct. In support of its position, the Commission refers to the decisions rendered in First Nations Child and Family Services Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2013 FCA 75 and Hughes v. Election Canada, 2010 CHRT 4.\n(iv) The Moore decision does not apply in the manner argued by the Respondent\n[68] The Commission submits that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the Supreme Court decision in Moore does not stand for the preposition that the Tribunal cannot enquire into ongoing systemic practices of discrimination. In this decision, the Supreme Court was concerned with the lack of nexus between the actual scope of the complaint and the systemic remedies ordered. However, the Court did not state that a Tribunal must, in all cases, limit its inquiry and remedies to the individual complaint.\n[69] The Commission also submits that the Moore decision is based on a specific set of facts and on the British Columbia Human Rights Code, and should be distinguished from the present case. While the complaint in Moore relied on systemic evidence, the complaint was not one of systemic discrimination (or a group complaint, as permitted under the BC Human Rights Code), but rather, a complaint about individual discrimination. Mr. Desmarais\u2019 complaint, on the other hand, clearly indicates that the complaint raises both individual and systemic allegations.\n[70] Paragraph 7 of the complaint clearly states\nThe systemic nature of this discrimination was demonstrated by Mr. Bigras, a CSC classification officer testifying in 2001 regarding admission into IPPM. Mr Bigras who never met Roger or read any reports on him, accurately predicted, solely on the basis of Roger\u2019s intellectual disability, Roger\u2019s fate inside CSC should he not be sent to IPPM as the judge wished, namely: segregation (solitary confinement); detention order denying statutory release; minimum security classification \u2026\n(Emphasis in original)\n[71] The Commission also notes that the fact that the ongoing application of a systemic discriminatory practice is the core of the complaint was also made clear in Section 40\/41 of the Investigation Report, in the Commission\u2019s decision and referral letters and in the Statement of Particulars provided by the parties to the Tribunal. As such, the Commission submits that Moore does not apply in the manner argued by the Respondent because systemic allegations were clearly raised by the Complainant at the outset of the present proceedings. The Commission also submits that none of the decisions that have subsequently relied on or cited Moore have applied the type of interpretation advanced by the Respondent in its motion.\nC. The Complainant\u2019s position (i) The complaint should not be limited to the Complainant\u2019s two incarceration periods. [72] The Complainant objects to the Respondent\u2019s motion that the time period for disclosure be restricted to the two incarceration periods of the Complainant, from 2001 to 2003, and from 2005 to 2007. To accept such a position goes against the principles of administrative fairness, which dictate that the time frames should, at the minimum, be the same for both the Complainant and the Respondent.\n[73] The Complainant cannot accept that the Respondent would have access to significant documentation related to the history of Mr. Desmarais, from the time he was a small child up to 2013, while the Complainant would be restricted to a period of time that would be shorter than his period of incarceration. The consequence would be that the Complainant would not have access to important information related to CSC\u2019s practices and to the case management of Mr. Desmarais\u2019 situation.\n[74] Furthermore, the Complainant submits that in the present circumstances, the starting of the \u201crelevant period\u201d should be set at the beginning of the discrimination, which is November 2001, when Mr. Bigras testified in front of the court and accurately forecasted the fate of Mr. Desmarais within CSC. Relevant disclosure should begin with the inclusion of all information upon which Mr. Bigras would have based his testimony.\n[75] The Complainant adds that the end of the \u201crelevant period\u201d should be the time of the hearing, to prevent future discrimination.\n(ii) A systemic inquiry is necessary and helpful to the Complainant\u2019s case [76] One of the arguments raised in the Respondent\u2019s Motion to demonstrate that the systemic inquiry is neither necessary nor helpful is that there is no similarities between the present case with any other disabled inmate under CSC\u2019s supervision. CSC has never introduced any evidence to support such an assertion and it can be inferred from this that no such evidence exists. The Respondent\u2019s reference to the Starblanket case, in paragraph 46 of its Motion, implies that both the Desmarais and the Starblanket cases have elements in common, which would further suggest that Mr. Desmarais\u2019 case is not unique.\n[77] The Respondent has also alleged that the likelihood that the Complainant will return to a federal institution is low, as he has been declared unfit to stand trial. As such, the Respondent submits that Mr. Desmarais is not affected by the practices and policies put in place by CSC after the termination of his incarceration period. The Complainant disagrees; in fact, Mr. Desmarais is not presently being held at Pinel but is being detained at Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies, a provincial detention center, while he waits to return to court. While Mr. Desmarais does have an intellectual disability, which is permanent, the Respondent is wrong to equate a disability and a finding of unfitness with the conclusion that unfitness is a permanent state. A person with a disability, who is unfit, can evolve with special training to the point where they understand the judicial system sufficiently to meet the low bar that divides fitness and unfitness. In fact, on September 10, 2013, the TAQ ruled that Mr. Desmarais was fit to stand trial and returned his case to the criminal court. As such, it must be assumed that the possibility exists that Mr. Desmarais may again, at some point, be sentenced to a federal sentence. Therefore, an improvement in the practices and policies of CSC could be of great benefit to the Complainant.\n[78] In addition, the complaint filed on behalf of Mr. Desmarais alleges that the root of the discrimination against him was systemically motivated, based on his disability and his family status. Human rights tribunals, in ruling on the scope of a complaint, have previously ruled that systemic evidence is admissible in the context of proving an individual complaint. In paragraph 64 of the Moore decision, Justice Abella stated:\n[...] the Tribunal was certainly entitled to consider systemic evidence in order to determine whether Jeffrey had suffered discrimination, [...].\n[79] The Complainant submits that the Moore decision, even though systemic discrimination was not in evidence in that case, recognized that individual complaints may introduce systemic evidence, and that systematic remedies may naturally flow from a claim. This is in line with previous human rights jurisprudence. For example, in Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and others, 2003 BCHRT 6750, the Tribunal stated \u201cDespite the fact that I have found this complaint to be systemic in nature, it is still the complaint of an individual Complainant.\u201d\n(iii) The Respondent\u2019s motion further delays the present proceedings [80] The Complainant disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the motion could not have been brought at an earlier date. The Moore decision, which was a highly publicized decision, came out at the beginning of November 2012. The Respondent signed its Statement of Particulars on October 17, 2012 and committed itself to providing a full disclosure with a short delay. It postponed its filing many times through the subsequent months, and, at the end of May 2013, disclosure had not yet been filed. It was only during a case management call organized by the Tribunal in June 2013 that the Respondent announced its intention to make a motion to limit the time periods for disclosure.\n[81] Although the systemic discrimination allegations and the intention to address them had been transparent throughout the process, CSC\u2019s resistance to provide a full disclosure in a timely manner has resulted in a delay of close to a year.\nVI. Analysis [82] The Respondent asks the Tribunal to quash the systemic discrimination aspects of this inquiry or, in the alternative, to limit their scope to the relevant periods of time, for the above-stated reasons. In so doing, the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to considerably restrict the debate surrounding the complaint. The Commission and the Complainant both object to this motion.\n[83] In light of the fact that the present Motion was brought by the Respondent, the burden lies on the Respondent to convince the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to dismiss the systemic aspects of the present complaint. The Tribunal is master of its own proceedings (s. 50. (3) (e) of the CHRA) and has the ability to reject portions of a complaint. However, as stated in the Commission\u2019s Reply, when asked to do so on a preliminary basis, in the absence of a hearing, the Tribunal must exercise this power cautiously and even then, the case law is clear that this should only occur \u2018in the clearest of cases\u2019: Buffet at para. 39. The CHRA already includes a screening function, which is performed by the Commission.\n[84] In considering such a motion, the Tribunal must have regard for the requirements of section 50(1) of the CHRA. This section provides that the Tribunal \u201cshall\u201d provide parties with a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to present evidence and make arguments on the matters raised in the complaint. The Tribunal must also render its decision in compliance with the rules of natural justice: See Buffet at paras. 38-40; FNCFCS at paras. 125, 131-132, 140.\n[85] It is with these guiding principles in mind that I must determine the present motion.\nA. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to examine the systemic allegations [86] The Tribunal\u2019s derives its authority from the CHRA:\n49.(1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint [\u2026].\n[87] The Commission\u2019s letter of Nov. 22, 2010, which was signed by David Langtry and mandated the Tribunal to conduct an inquiry into the complaint, clearly asked that the systemic discrimination aspect of the complaint be specifically examined:\n\u201c[\u2026] the issues raised by this complaint are indicative of possible systemic barriers to the treatment and rehabilitation of inmates with mental disabilities [...]\u201d\n[88] This letter also mentioned:\n\u201cFor your information, either party to a complaint can ask the Federal Court to review a Commission\u2019s decision under subsection 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act. That application to the Court must normally be filed within 30 days of receipt of the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d\n[89] In the following two decisions, the Tribunal explained the purpose of the Commission\u2019s letter of request:\n(a) Kanagasabapathy v. Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7, in which the Tribunal stated that \u201cit is this letter of request [from the CHRC] addressed to the Chairperson that breathes life into the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in regard to a complaint.\u201d Kanagasabapathy at para. 37;\nand\n(b) in Emmett the Tribunal held as follows: \u201cHad the Commission decided to dismiss her allegations on the basis of age, it would have made a specific decision about it, would have provided reasons for dismissal and, therefore, would have indicated the dismissal of this portion of the complaint in its referral letter to the Tribunal.\u201d: Emmett at para. 40.\n[90] In the case at hand, as well as in the Emmett case, not only did the Commission not restrict any part of the complaint, but it specifically asked the Tribunal to verify if the issues raised by the complaint \u201care indicative of possible systemic barriers to the treatment and rehabilitation of inmates with mental disabilities\u201d. Consequently, I conclude that the Commission intended for the Tribunal to investigate the entirety of the complaint by Mr. Desmarais, having special consideration for its systemic component. The Tribunal is not at liberty to contest or review the Commission\u2019s decision in this regard; this purview belongs to the Federal Court. However, in this instance, neither party filed a judicial review of this decision.\n[91] The CHRA also explicitly provides the Tribunal, upon proper referral of a complaint, with the necessary authority to correct and prevent discriminatory practices such as the ones alleged by Mr. Desmarais. This section reads as follows:\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17.\n[Emphasis added]\n[92] These powers have been granted to the Tribunal ensure the application of the CHRA; their purpose is not to punish but to prevent discrimination. As stated in Action Travail at p. 1134:\nIn order to promote the goal of equal opportunity for each individual to achieve \u201cthe life that he or she is able and wishes to have\u201d, the Act seeks to prevent all \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d based, inter alia, on sex. It is the practice itself which is sought to be precluded. The purpose of the Act is not to punish wrongdoing but to prevent discrimination.\n[Emphasis added]\n(i) The Moore decision [93] The Respondent\u2019s argues that while the Tribunal possesses the jurisdiction to examine allegations of systemic discrimination, the Moore decision precludes this examination in the present case as there is an absence of nexus between these allegations and the complaint.\n[94] In the Moore decision, while the Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s finding of discrimination against Jeffrey Moore and the finding of the school District\u2019s liability in this regard, it found that the evidence which formed the basis of the liability of the Province was too remote to demonstrate discrimination against the Complainant. In so doing, the Court clarified that systemic discrimination must relate to the complaint as framed by the Complainant which, in that case, was made on behalf of Jeffrey Moore. The Court rejected the Tribunal\u2019s binary approach to the discrimination (individual and systemic), stating that remedies ordered by a Tribunal \u2018must flow from the claim\u2019: See Moore at paras. 58 \u2013 71.\n[95] Despite the Respondent\u2019s submissions to the contrary, I do not interpret this decision as precluding the examination of systemic discrimination in the present case. Contrary to the complaint in Moore, which was focused on Jeffrey, the complaint of Mr. Desmarais clearly alleges discrimination of a systemic nature and was referred to the Tribunal in this manner. Paragraph 7 of the complaint reads:\nThe systemic nature of this discrimination was demonstrated by Mr. Bigras, a CSC classification officer testifying in 2001 regarding admission into IPPM. Mr. Bigras who never met Roger or read any reports on him, accurately predicted, solely on the basis of Roger\u2019s intellectual disability, Roger\u2019s fate inside CSC should he not be sent to IPPM as the judge wished, namely: segregation [solitary conferment]; detention order denying statutory release; maximum security classification\u2026\n[Emphasis in original]\n[96] Combined with the Commission\u2019s referral letter to the Tribunal which, as previously stated, clearly raises allegations of systemic discrimination, I am of the view that these allegations are properly before the Tribunal in this case. This is contrasted with the situation in Moore where the Court found that the scope of the inquiry and the resulting remedial orders had been expanded beyond Jeffrey\u2019s actual complaints during the judicial review stage: Moore at paras 68 -69.\n[97] It follows that, in the case at hand, were the Tribunal to consider evidence of systemic discrimination and order systemic remedies in the event that it finds the complaint substantiated, this would be in keeping with the Court\u2019s decision.\n[98] The Respondent relies on the Mzite decision in support of its interpretation of the Moore decision. The Mzite decision dealt with a British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal decision to accept the Mr. Mzite\u2019s complaint despite the fact that it was outside of the six-month limitation period provided at s. 8(1)(b) of the Human Rights Code. The Tribunal found that, in light of the novelty of the complaint and its systemic component, it was in the public interest, pursuant to s. 22(3)(a) of the Code, to accept the complaint despite the delay. On judicial review, the Supreme Court of British Columbia determined that the Tribunal had erred in this regard. In the Court\u2019s view, a decision on Mr. Mzite\u2019s complaint would have been limited to his incarceration period which had ended twenty two months earlier and, as such, would not benefit the \u2018public interest\u2019 as per s. 22(3)(a) in a manner which supported accepting the complaint.\n[99] With respect, I do not find this decision helpful with regard to the present motion. The Court does appear to limit the inquiry into the complaint to Mr. Mzite\u2019s incarceration period and notes that any resulting remedy would have limited value to others in light of the delay. However, this statement is made in view of determining whether the complaint should be accepted well past the expiry of the limitation period due to the public interest as per the Code. I do not agree that this constitutes an interpretation of the Moore decision which ought to be transposed to the present context. I note, in addition, that this decision is in no way binding on this Tribunal.\n(ii) Limiting the scope of the hearing and the disclosure to the Complainant\u2019s periods of incarceration [100] The Respondent further requests that the hearing and the disclosure be restricted mainly to the first period of incarceration, as the allegations of discrimination during the second period of incarceration only pertain to a limited period of time. The Respondent contends that since Mr. Desmarais is no longer incarcerated, and is unlikely to be under the care of CSC in the future, to extend the hearing and the disclosure to dates beyond this period of time would go beyond the scope of the complaint and run contrary to the Moore decision.\n[101] It is worth noting that the Court in Moore overturned the Tribunal\u2019s decision to award a number of systemic remedies, however it did not preclude the Tribunal from considering systemic evidence in its decision to substantiate the complaint. In fact the Court explicitly recognized the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider systemic evidence in order to determine whether Jeffrey had suffered discrimination: Moore at para. 63.\n[102] The Respondent seeks to strike the allegations of systemic discrimination outside of the Complainant\u2019s periods of incarceration with CSC on a preliminary basis, a discretion which, as stated above, the Tribunal must exercise only in the \u2018clearest of cases\u2019. Were the Tribunal to grant the motion as requested, this would prevent the Complainant from relying on any evidence of systemic discrimination at CSC outside of the periods of his incarceration to support his own claim of discrimination. The Court in Moore explicitly recognizes that systemic evidence \u2018can be instrumental in establishing a human rights complaint\u2019: Moore at para. 65. There is no question that evidence of systemic discrimination against intellectually disabled inmates by the Respondent both during and outside of Mr. Desmarais\u2019 periods of incarceration may support the Complainant\u2019s individual complaint of discrimination.\n[103] The Respondent also argues that, like Jeffrey Moore, who had finished high school and would not re-enter the public school education system, Mr. Desmarais is no longer under the supervision of CSC and, having been declared unfit to stand trial, will not be in the future. Therefore, as found in the Moore case, any remedy going beyond the period of time relevant to the individual complaint reaches beyond its scope.\n[104] As previously stated, the present motion pertains to the disclosure and scope of the hearing, not to any potential future systemic remedies. Furthermore, Mr. Desmarais has been reevaluated and was recently declared fit to stand trial. He may therefore, in the future, be once again placed under the supervision of CSC. Consequently, the current practices and policies of CSC with regard to intellectually disabled individuals like Mr. Desmarais are relevant to the Complainant. This supports their inclusion as part of the disclosure and the hearing.\n[105] Moreover, in the event that the complaint is found substantiated, it will be incumbent upon the Tribunal, pursuant to section 53(2)(a), to fashion a remedy designed \u2018to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in the future\u2019. With no knowledge of CSC\u2019s current practices and policies with regard to intellectually disabled inmates, the Tribunal will not be in a position to craft or implement any such remedy, thereby frustrating the very purpose of the CHRA.\n[106] I consider it appropriate to make a reference to the pronouncement of the Tribunal on this same issue in Emmett, which is indicative of the proper course to take:\nAt this stage of the proceedings, prior to having received any evidence on the merits of the Complainant\u2019s allegations, I see no basis upon which I can dismiss the Complainant\u2019s claims for relief postdating the time period of her complaint. I was also not provided with any authority, whether in the Act or otherwise, that restricts the period over which complainants can claim relief. (...) Ultimately, the Complainant still has to establish a link between the alleged discriminatory practices and the loss she is claiming. If there is no link, and the remedies requested are only related to the retaliation complaints, the remedy will not be awarded. The Respondent will have a full and ample opportunity to present its arguments in this regard at the hearing of this matter.\n[107] As in Emmett, I have not been provided with any authority that supports restricting the period over which the Complainant can claim relief.\n[108] For these reasons, I determined that the relevant period for the submission of the disclosure of documents and for the scope of the hearing will start in November 2001, on the day Mr. Bigras testified and forecasted the Complainant\u2019s future at CSC, and end on the day of the release of the present decision.\n(iii) The proper administration of justice [109] The Respondent argued that authorizing the Complainant to go ahead with its allegations of systemic discrimination would increase costs for all parties and the Tribunal due to the large amount of disclosure required. While these predictions are always difficult to make, I am of the view that to determine these issues in a manner that impacts the Complainant as well as future complainants like him would avoid a multiplicity of cases and result in savings in costs for all involved. In my view, this would better serve the interest of justice.\n[110] The Respondent added that the Desmarais case was not as appropriate and as justified as the Starblanket case, also presently before the Tribunal, for a study of systemic discrimination regarding inmates with intellectual\/mental disability. I cannot respond to such an assertion, since I have authority over the Desmarais case, but no authority over any other case managed by other members of the Tribunal.\n(iv) Timing of this Motion [111] Taking into account what has been said above, I do not consider it to be necessary to elaborate on this matter.\nVII. Conclusion and Decision [112] The present case involves a complex set of facts, as can be seen in paragraphs 8 to 32 above, and also of law, which raises issues directly related to the Respondent\u2019s policies and practices regarding the treatment of inmates with mental disabilities. Combined with the caution with which the Tribunal must proceed in dismissing aspects of a complaint on a preliminary basis, and the clear wording of the Complaint Form and Referral Letter to the Tribunal, I am of the view that the allegations of systemic discrimination can only be determined once parties have had the opportunity to fully present the evidence on this matter at a hearing. This view is supported by a number of cases already mentioned: See for example Buffet and FNCFCS.\n[113] The Tribunal still has the ability to dismiss the systemic portions of the complaint as part of its remedial discretion. This discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37) and reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\n[114] For these reasons, my decision is the following:\nThe Motion is quashed;\nThe disclosure period shall start on November 2001, the day Mr. Bigras testified, and shall end the day the present decision is rendered.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 25, 2014\n[1] A -2 Court of Qu\u00e9bec, Criminal Chamber, Transcript of testimony of Mr. Bigras before Justice Vaillancourt, 2001-10-03 at pp. 31-35\n[2] A-3 CSC, Psychological initial assessment, J.

Mr. Warman\u2019s Complaint against Mr. Lemire [2] Mr. Warman\u2019s complaint referenced only to material found on Freedomsite.org. He alleged in the complaint that Mr. Lemire was the owner and webmaster of the website. The material referred to in the complaint consisted mainly of postings by registered users of the site on the website's message board.\n[3] At the hearing into the complaint, however, Mr. Warman and the Commission expanded the complaint to include material found on JRBooksonline.com and Stormfront.org. They alleged that Mr. Lemire was the registered owner of JRBooksonline.com and thus responsible for its content. With respect to Stormfront.org, they alleged that Mr. Lemire posted messages on the website's message board that violated s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA or the Act).\nIII. Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Decision (2009 CHRT 26) [4] Member Hadjis held that Mr. Warman and the Commission were not able to substantiate their claim of Mr. Lemire\u2019s proprietorship over JRBooksonline.com (para. 47). He also found that Mr. Lemire\u2019s posting on Stormfront.org was not hate speech as covered by the Act. Finally, Mr. Lemire was found not to have caused the communication of hateful material on Freedomside.org, for which he is the administrator, when Craig Harrison posted hateful content (see Warman v. Harrison, 2006 CHRT 30).\n[5] Only the \u201cAIDS Secrets\u201d article on Freedomsite.org was found to constitute a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 13(1), by expressing \u201cunusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation and vilification towards homosexuals in particular\u201d (Warman v. Lemire, 2009 CHRT 26, para. 207). In the article, \u201c[h]omosexuals are presented as dangerous and immoral persons, who, motivated by a selfish desire to indulge their own sexual deviance and not have their blood donations tested, are responsible for the deaths of untold thousands of persons\u201d (para. 200). The article also used statistics out of context to define HIV\/AIDS as an inherently Black disease (para. 195).\n[6] On the constitutional question as to whether s. 13 violates s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Tribunal was only prepared to deviate from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 SCR 892, if Mr. Lemire could distinguish the circumstances of his case from those in Taylor (para. 221).\n[7] Member Hadjis found that the current enactment of s. 13 of the Act, amended after the ruling in Taylor, no longer minimally impaired the infringed freedom of expression because the penalties for a finding of communicating hate speech or causing hate speech to be communicated \u2014 ss. 54(1)(c) and 54(1.1) \u2014 are now too similar to criminal sanctions as opposed to an administrative penalty. He also found that \u201c[t]he process can no longer be considered exclusively remedial, preventative, and conciliatory in nature, which was at the core of the Court\u2019s finding in Taylor that s. 13(1)\u2019s limitation of freedom of expression is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, and thereby \u2018saved\u2019 under s. 1 of the Charter\u201d (para. 279). Moreover, the Tribunal determined that the Commission\u2019s decision to send the case to the Tribunal for inquiry despite removal of the offending content, and the Commission\u2019s general disuse of any measures to conciliate, rendered the impugned legislation unconstitutional in light of its practical effect (paras. 283 and 284). Thus, the Tribunal refused to apply ss. 13(1), 54(1)(c) and 54(1.1) of the CHRA.\nIV. Federal Court\u2019s Decision (2012 FC 1162) [8] On judicial review, on a standard of correctness, the Court agreed that the remedial measures under s. 54 had become unconstitutionally punitive, but that the Tribunal erred in not applying the doctrine of severance; the Tribunal should have severed ss. 54(1) and (1.1), and found s. 13 constitutional to the extent it had been upheld in Taylor. The Court therefore declared ss. 54(1) and (1.1) unconstitutional and remitted the matter to the Tribunal to issue a declaration under s. 13 in respect of the one discriminatory article and consider whether a remedy should be imposed under ss. 54(1)(a) and\/or (b) (paras. 138 and 139).\n[9] The Court also found that \u201cthere is nothing in ss 50-54 of the Act, which define the Tribunal\u2019s powers in conducting an inquiry, to give it [authority to review the actions of the Commission]\u201d (para. 52). The Tribunal may only consider Charter issues that arise at the hearing, as it has no jurisdiction to review how the Commission makes decisions in its administrative role; only the courts may scrutinize the Commission\u2019s decision-making process, and the proper way to do this is by way of judicial review (para. 57). Therefore, the propriety of the Commission\u2019s decision to mediate and conciliate, or refer the matter to the Tribunal, was outside the mandate of the Tribunal and should have had no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s constitutional analysis.\nV. Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s Decision (2014 FCA 18) [10] Evans JA of the Federal Court of Appeal fully endorsed the constitutionality of ss. 13, 54(1)(c) and 54(1.1). He ruled that s. 13 \u2014 as well as its penalty provisions \u2014 are constitutional, especially in light of the government\u2019s pressing and substantial objective to prevent the vilification of vulnerable groups. Moreover, the financial sanctions possible in the event a respondent is found to have breached s. 13 are not truly penal, but administrative, and therefore also constitutional. He varied the Federal Court\u2019s order by setting aside the declaration of unconstitutionality, but otherwise left the Federal Court\u2019s order intact (para. 107).\n[11] The Court agreed that \u201cthe effects of a legislation may invalidate it if they flow necessarily from its terms\u201d, but unconstitutional administrative action does not carry the same implications as unconstitutional legislation (para. 47). However, it disagreed with the Federal Court\u2019s holding that the Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the Commission\u2019s application of its administrative powers. \u201cThe Judge\u2019s narrow construction of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to \u2018inquire into the complaint\u2019 would undermine the reasons for conferring legal authority on it to decide the constitutional validity of its enabling legislation\u201d (para. 51). So long as the Commission\u2019s action is relevant to the determination of the legal question before the Tribunal, the Tribunal may inquire into it. In this case, however, the Commission\u2019s actions were not relevant to the constitutional issue (para. 52).\n[12] Relying heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 SCR 467, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that the message sent to Canadians by having hate speech laws is part of a necessary endeavour to promote equality in society, and that the actual effectiveness of the legislation where the impugned Internet content is stored on foreign servers is not relevant to the constitutionality of such legislation (paras. 60-63). Subsection 13(2), which makes the section applicable to the Internet \u2014 where, it was argued, targeted groups have ample opportunity to respond \u2014 is also a minimal impairment of the right to freedom of expression under s. 2(b) of the Charter because hate speech actually prevents oppressed groups from contributing as equals in social discourse (paras. 64 and 70). The Federal Court of Appeal also rejected the suggestion that the Internet facilitates an educative exchange of views on topics of the sort raised in material captured by s. 13; \u201cbecause of the extreme nature of prohibited hate speech it strikes me as fanciful to imagine that those who engage in it are likely to be open to an educative exchange of ideas\u201d (para. 65).\n[13] When it comes to the financial sanctions for a breach of s. 13, Evans JA affirmed:\nFinancial penalties imposed for non-compliance with a statutory scheme and payable into the general revenue fund have been found not to be penal in nature for the purpose of determining if the procedural protections of section 11 of the Charter apply \u2026 Penalties for non-compliance imposed by regulatory legislation for the protection of the public in accordance with the objectives of the statute are not necessarily penal in nature for the purpose of section 11. (para. 78)\n[14] Evans JA was deferential to Parliament\u2019s decision to impose a financial penalty to induce compliance with, and deter breach of s. 13 of the Act, noting that sanctions need not be perfect (para. 91). Combined with the objective of \u201cprotecting the societal standing of vulnerable groups and preventing discrimination against them,\u201d (para. 92) and that the sanction prevents offenders from avoiding liability when they target groups as opposed to individuals (para. 93), Evans JA said:\nWhen viewed in the context of the CHRA\u2019s remedial scheme, the imposition of a penalty under paragraph 54(1)(c) and subsection 54(1.1) carries no more of a moral stigma than a finding that an individual has wilfully or recklessly engaged in the communication of hate speech [subsection 53(3) of the Act, which was unchallenged], and by virtue of paragraph 54(1)(b) is required to compensate specifically identified individuals. (para. 98)\n[15] As such, the financial sanctions are not penal but administrative and impose \u201caccountability for the damage caused by the vilification of targeted groups and of deterring the communication of hate speech in order to decrease discrimination against them\u201d (para. 104).\nVI. Reassignment of the Case [16] It should be noted that subsequent to the Court\u2019s remittance order, the CHRT Acting Chairperson assigned this case to a different Tribunal Member, as the term of Tribunal Member Hadjis expired in early 2010.\nVII. Issues before the Tribunal [17] The Tribunal is currently seized with the following issues that require decision:\n1. Should the Tribunal adjourn the matter until the judicial review litigation has been finally determined, i.e. until the appellant forfeits his opportunity to seek leave to appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada denies leave, or grants leave and decides the appeal?\n2. Should the Tribunal convene a hearing to hear evidence and submissions on Mr. Lemire\u2019s claim for a stay based on abuse of process?\n3. Implementation of the remittance order, as varied by the Federal Court of Appeal?\n1. Should the Tribunal adjourn the matter until the judicial review litigation has finally been determined? [18] The Respondent has taken the position that this matter should be adjourned sine die pending the final determination of any and all appeal proceedings in the aforementioned judicial review. In his view, the case raises important issues going to one of the most fundamental freedoms of Canadians, that of freedom of expression. Those issues have not yet been finally determined and will not be so until all appeals are completed. In his words: \u201c[t]his matter may yet proceed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201d\n[19] I cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s arguments.\n[20] Decisions of the Tribunal, and remittance orders from the Federal Courts, are not subject to an automatic stay pending appeal or leave to appeal. The Tribunal must act upon a higher court\u2019s order, unless a party is able to obtain a judicial stay. Furthermore, under s. 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal is compelled to conduct proceedings \u201cas informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\u201d As such, the Tribunal will not adjourn the matter pending completion of judicial review appeals in the same matter.\n[21] Parties may seek a stay through s. 50 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7, or s. 65.1(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26.\n[22] Mr. Lemire has not, in his submissions on an application for adjournment sine die, demonstrated that a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness would occur without the adjournment. This is significant because a potential breach of natural justice would have constituted legitimate grounds for the Tribunal not proceeding expeditiously: s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA.\n[23] In view of the foregoing, the request for an adjournment sine die is denied.\n2. Should the Tribunal convene a hearing to hear evidence and submissions on Mr. Lemire\u2019s claim for a stay based on abuse of process? [24] In the alternative, the Respondent requests a hearing to deal with \u201coutstanding matters\u201d, which he submits includes a motion for a stay of proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process. In this last regard, he claims that the prosecution of the complaint by both Complainant and Commission was oppressive, malicious, contemptible, and carried out in bad faith, such as to bring the administration of human rights law into disrepute.\n[25] In order to succeed in a motion for a stay based on abuse of process, which would necessarily require relitigation of the case, Mr. Lemire would have to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings on abuse of process through relitigation of facts, as set out in Toronto (City) v. CUPE Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 SCR 77 (Toronto v. CUPE). Otherwise, Mr. Lemire\u2019s abuse of process motion would itself constitute an abuse of process. In Toronto v. CUPE, the Court said:\nThere may be instances where relitigation will enhance, rather than impeach, the integrity of the judicial system, for example: (1) when the first proceeding is tainted by fraud or dishonesty; (2) when fresh, new evidence, previously unavailable, conclusively impeaches the original results; or (3) when fairness dictates that the original result should not be binding in the new context. (para. 52)\n[26] The first proceeding was before a Member who is no longer with the Tribunal. In his ruling, he thoroughly analyzed the processes of the Commission both in the case before the Tribunal and their practices in general. The Member found that the Commission\u2019s administrative practices contributed to the unconstitutionality of the hate message provisions. The Federal Court held that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to take said practices into account. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed on the jurisdictional point, but held that in the current case such administrative practices were simply not relevant. Now, back before the Tribunal, the Respondent seeks to advance the same arguments, reframed as \u201ca motion for a stay of proceedings on the ground of abuse of process.\u201d\n[27] It is unnecessary to go any further in the analysis. The context in which Mr. Lemire would claim that the Commission and Mr. Warman\u2019s pursuit of this case was an abuse of process is not at all different from the initial hearing. The facts and evidence in question were clearly before the original member; there is no fresh or new evidence that was previously unavailable; moreover, there is no new context that would prevent the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision from binding the Tribunal and the parties.\n[28] Therefore, Mr. Lemire\u2019s abuse of process motion would not conform to the requirements in Toronto v. CUPE and would in itself constitute an abuse of process as it seeks the relitigation of previously decided matters. Hearing this motion would also violate the Tribunal\u2019s s. 48.9(1) mandate to proceed expeditiously. Therefore, there will be no hearing or submissions on Mr. Lemire\u2019s claim for a stay based on abuse of process.\n[29] I would add as a final observation on this issue that it was open to the Respondent to argue, before both the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal, that any order remitting the matter to the Tribunal should direct the Tribunal to consider \u2014 or in effect reconsider \u2014 his abuse of process arguments. Whether or not the Respondent sought such a direction, none can be found in either Court\u2019s order. I am unwilling to infer one from the clear dispositive language used in both judgments.\n3. Implementation of the remittance order, as varied by the Federal Court of Appeal (a) Declaration [30] The Court ordered the Tribunal to issue a declaration in regard to the discriminatory communication. There is no discretion exercisable by the Tribunal in complying with this portion of the order. Accordingly, the Tribunal hereby declares that Mr. Lemire did violate s. 13 of the CHRA, causing hate speech to be communicated, when he posted the \u201cAIDS Secrets\u201d article to the public forum Freedomsite.org.\n(b) Order to Cease the Discriminatory Practice [31] The Tribunal, in accordance with ss. 54(1)(a) and 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, orders Mr. Lemire to cease engaging in the above noted discriminatory practice, that is to say to cease communicating or causing to be communicated, by the means described in s. 13, namely the Internet, any matter of the type contained in the \u201cAIDS Secrets\u201d article that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by reason of the fact that the person or persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. The Commission acknowledges that Mr. Lemire took down the offending post before the first hearing, but that is immaterial to the purpose of a cease and desist order under the Act. \u201cThe purpose of a Cease and Desist Order under s. 54 (1) (a) of the Act is to both remediate conduct found to be contrary to s. 13 (1) of the Act and to send a message to others that such conduct is not acceptable\u201d (Warman v. Northern Alliance, 2009 CHRT 10, at para. 57 (Northern Alliance)). Furthermore, to limit the order to specifically the content impugned in this case would defeat the purpose of such legislation designed to remedy systemic and persistent discrimination in Canadian society. The order is thus to ensure that the Respondent, Mr. Lemire, no longer engage in the kind of conduct found to be discriminatory in this case (Northern Alliance, para. 57).\n(c) Compensation for reckless or wilful discrimination to a victim specifically identified in the communication [32] No order shall be issued under s. 54(1)(b), as none was sought by the parties.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Remedies. 24\nX........... Order 26\nI. Context [1] On October 30, 2009, Mrs. Joyce Beattie and Mr. James Louie filed separate complaints against Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), now known as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC or the Respondent), with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission), on behalf of herself and Mr. James Louie (the Complainants). The Complainants allege that in refusing to accept and process Mr. Louie\u2019s application for a ministerial lease on Lot 175 of which he is the owner\/holder pursuant to s. 58(3) of the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I\u20115, the Respondent had discriminated against the Complainants on the ground of their national or ethnic origin and race, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA).\n[2] The Commission referred both complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) on July 29, 2011, with the instruction that they be heard in a single inquiry as they involve substantially the same issues of fact and law.\nII. Relevant Facts [3] Mr. Louie is a member of the Okanagan Indian Band (the Band) and resides on the Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1. Mr. Louie is in lawful possession of Lot 170-1 and Lot 175, Block 4, Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1. This land, known as \u201clocatee land\u201d, was allotted to Mr. Louie, the \u201clocatee\u201d, by the Band council with approval of the Minister of INAC. Mr. Louie\u2019s right of lawful possession of these lands is evidenced by a Certificate of Possession, issued pursuant to s. 20 of the Indian Act.\n[4] On June 29, 2007, Mr. Louie and Mrs. Beattie, also an Indian as defined in the Indian Act, submitted an Application for Use of Land Within an Indian Reserve and an Application for Lease of Locatee Land to the Respondent pursuant to section 58(3) of the Indian Act for the creation of a pre-paid residential lease of Lot 170 to the developer, Mrs. Beattie. The proposed lease was to be for a term of forty-nine years with a nominal rent of one dollar. This lease application led to the filing of another, distinct complaint before the Tribunal, which resulted in Tribunal decision Louie v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2011 CHRT 2, issued January 26, 2011 (Louie v. INAC).\n[5] On January 23, 2008, Mr. Louie submitted a similar application to the Respondent for the creation of a lease for Lot 175. This lease was between the Minister and Mr. Louie and also stipulated a term of forty-nine years, commencing on March 1, 2008, with the nominal prepaid rent of one dollar. The application specified that the intended purpose of the proposed lease was residential use, including the construction of a single family residence. In order to finance the construction of the residence, it was Mr. Louie\u2019s intention to pledge the lease to secure a construction loan from Mrs. Beattie to a maximum of $200,000.00. Mr Louie intended to assign the lease to Mrs. Beattie for the duration of the construction loan, with the remainder of the lease reverting to Mr. Louie when the loan was repaid.\n[6] It is this lease application, pertaining to Lot 175, that is the subject of the present decision.\n[7] On February 7, 2008, the Respondent sent an email to Mr. Bruce Beattie, Representative of the Complainants, stating:\nPlease be advised that INAC has received legal opinion and will not be able to accept and process the Application for Use of Land Within an Indian Reserve dated January 23, 2008 on Lot 175, because the Indian Act does not authorize a leasehold interest to a locatee on his own Certificate of Possession CP land. If Mr. Louie wishes to be a part of the leasehold interest, he will need to incorporate.\n[8] The Complainant\u2019s Representative replied in an email sent later that day, expressing his disagreement with the Respondent\u2019s position. In Mr. Louie\u2019s view, the Indian Act is silent on whether locatees can hold leasehold interests on lands which they have agreed to vacate to the Crown for the term of a lease. The Indian Act also says nothing about requiring a locatee to incorporate in order to hold a lease. The Complainant\u2019s Representative informed the Respondent that Mr. Louie was not prepared to incorporate as this would not be of any benefit to him. In view of avoiding further delays however, Mr. Louie requested amending the 2008 lease application to name Mrs. Beattie as the proposed lessee.\n[9] On February 15, 2008, Mr. Louie sent a letter to the Chief and Council of the Band and c.c.ed the Respondent. Mr. Louie stated that, as the Respondent would not create a locatee lease in his name, he would have Mrs. Beattie enter into the lease for Lot 175. Mr. Louie explained that the lease would then be transferred into Mr. Louie\u2019s name, either by assignment or sublease. Mr. Louie also stated that his intention for entering into the lease was to increase the land value and facilitate conventional mortgage financing for construction of a new house for himself on Lot 175.\n[10] On February 28, 2008, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative emailed the Respondent, requesting that they be provided with the legal authorities upon which the Respondent relies to support the position that \u201cthe Indian Act does not authorize a leasehold interest to a locatee on his own CP land\u201d.\n[11] On March 5, 2008, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative again emailed the Respondent and stated that, in light of the Respondent\u2019s lack of response to the February 28, 2008 email, Mr. Louie had decided that he still wanted the lease for Lot 175 to be between the Minister and himself rather than between the Minister and Mrs. Beattie.\n[12] On March 19, 2008, Mr. Louie sent a letter to the Minister of INAC, expressing his dissatisfaction with the delay in processing the lease applications for Lot 175, as well as the delays in processing his June 29, 2007 lease application for Lot 170-1. Mr. Louie explained:\nIn order to make better economic use of my CP lands, the Indian Act requires me to apply for s. 58(3) ministerial leases. Those leases are clearly intended to provide economic opportunity and benefits for CP holders, but my experience is that the locate lease application process, as it is currently administered in the BC Region, has become so grossly inefficient and racially offensive that it is more likely to inhibit than facilitate economic development. It is quite obvious to me that most of the negative aspects of the existing lease application process derive from an archaic and entrenched racist mindset that perceives all Indians to be incompetent to determine their own economic self-interest and who are therefore inherently in need of the degrading paternalism that INAC officials euphemistically call a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. While I recognize that this perception exists among INAC officials and is incorporated in INAC administrative policies and practices, I do not accept that it has any factual or legal justification. I therefore do not accept that it should have any binding effect on me or how I choose to use my own lands.\n[\u2026]\nI believe that this chain of events clearly demonstrates a level of administrative dysfunction at the BC Regional lands office that can only reflect badly on any commitment you and your ministry have to integrity and honourable treatment of individual Indian land holders. The situation is certainly not conducive to economic development of reserve land, especially where CP land holding is well established and provides the only available opportunity for viable and sustainable economic development.\n[13] Mr. Louie alleged that the delays were due to the obstructive conduct of the BC Regional lands office management level officials and requested a departmental investigation into the manner in which s. 58(3) of the Indian Act was being administered by officials of the Respondent.\n[14] On April 15, 2008, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative provided the Respondent with the most recent draft of the proposed lease. The Respondent replied on April 17, 2008, stating that it did not agree with the lease document. The Respondent reiterated its position that Mr. Louie needed to incorporate before the lease could be granted to him. The Respondent also stated that it required more information to ensure compliance with the National Building Code, the Species at Risk Act and so as to address other health and safety issues surrounding the lease application.\n[15] On April 21, 2008, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative sent another copy of the April 15, 2008, draft lease. In his covering email, he stated that Mr. Louie was unwilling to consider any changes to the terms in the draft lease.\n[16] On May 15, 2008, the Minister of INAC replied to Mr. Louie\u2019s March 19, 2008, letter:\nThis is in response to your correspondence of March 19, 2008 regarding your applications for locatee leases on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1.\nAs a matter of law, there is a special relationship between a Certificate of Possession holder and Canada. The underlying title to reserve lands remains with the federal Crown, while the benefit of those lands and the right to possess them belongs to the Certificate of Possession holder. This is not the usual case for a private landholder. This is a special circumstance, giving rise to a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d A fiduciary relationship is created between the Certificate of Possession holder and Canada when Canada enters into Certificate of Possession leases. This is based on Canada\u2019s unilateral discretion over the Certificate of Possession holder\u2019s Indian interest. Nothing short of legislative reform can extinguish or alter this relationship.\nConsequently, with Canada as the first party on any instrument granting an interest in reserve land, careful review of the leasing details must be taken into consideration so that the appropriate terms and conditions can be fully set out in the lease.\nUnder the Indian Act, the authority to establish the rent lies with Canada and cannot be extinguished by any means except legislative change. This authority extends beyond setting of the rent and a release will not alter Canada\u2019s unilateral authority to establish lease terms, which would also include, but is not limited to, environmental provisions.\nThe leasing process on reserve land is consistent nationally and derived from policy and procedures that are currently in place. Certain requirements must be met before issuing a leasehold interest to any third party on reserve lands.\nOptions to opt out of the Indian Act for the management of lands are available to First Nation communities through the First Nations Land Management Act, self-government and treaty. The Department encourages First Nation members and councils to work toward long-term regimes that meet their community\u2019s needs.\nOn March 31, 2008 a draft lease was sent to you for your review. I would ask that you work with the British Columbia regional office so that it may assist you in meeting the requirements for a locatee lease on reserve lands. I will encourage my officials to consult you in the setting of a rent which is economically viable.\nChuck Strahl\n[17] On June 20, 2008, the Complainants jointly filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that the Respondent\u2019s response to the lease application for Lot 170-1 was discriminatory. This complaint eventually led to Tribunal decision in Louie v. INAC where the Tribunal found in favour of the Complainants. The Tribunal ordered that the Respondent, among other things, \u201creconsider the applications of the Complainants for a locatee lease in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and order\u201d and \u201ccease its discriminatory practices and take measures, in consultation with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to redress the practices or to prevent the same or similar practices from occurring\u201d: Louie v. INAC at para. 64.\n[18] In a phone conversation between the parties on September 9, 2008, Mr. Louie explained that his intent was to use the lease as security for a new home construction loan. Mrs. Beattie would assign the lease back to Mr. Louie upon repayment of the loan. The Respondent replied in an email dated October 1, 2008, confirming its initial position that the Indian Act does not authorize the grant of a leasehold interest to a locatee on his own Certificate of Possession lands and that an assignment of a lease from Mrs. Beattie to Mr. Louie would effectively result in a direct lease to Mr. Louie.\n[19] The application process continued until the end of 2008, with further unsuccessful exchanges between the Complainants and the Respondent.\n[20] On October 23, 2009, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative sent a letter to the Respondent inquiring about the status of the lease application for Lot 175.\n[21] On October 30, 2009, the Complainants filed the present complaint with the Commission.\n[22] On November 6, 2009, the Respondent reiterated that it could only accept the lease application on Lot 175 pursuant to section 58(3) of the Indian Act if the lessee was a corporation. The Respondent also requested the details of the business arrangement between the Complainants so that it could conduct its due diligence with respect to Mr. Louie\u2019s ability and competence to enter into the proposed transaction and avoid exposure to future claims of breach of the Respondent\u2019s fiduciary duty to First Nations and their members.\n[23] On April 17, 2011, following the January release of Louie v. INAC, Mr. Louie\u2019s representative sent a replacement lease application for Lot 175 along with copies of a draft lease between the Minister and Mr. Louie to the Respondent and asked that the Respondent provide comments. On May 3, 2011, Mr. Louie again sent the replacement Application and a lease between the Minister and Mr. Louie, this time in final form.\n[24] On June 2, 2011, the Respondent sent a letter to Mr. Louie\u2019s representative, stating that the short form lease provided on May 3, 2011, did not meet the Crown\u2019s requirements and had not been signed by the Minister\u2019s representative.\n[25] In a letter dated July 15, 2011, the Respondent advised the Commission of the following:\n[\u2026] please be advised that the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has carefully reviewed the lease application for Lot 175 submitted by Mr. Louie. Please be further advised that the Department has reconsidered its earlier position and is in a position to enter into a lease with Mr. Louie. A lease will be sent shortly to Mr. Louie\u2019s representative for Mr. Louie\u2019s review and signature.\n[26] On November 16, 2011, the Complainants first became aware of the existence of the Respondent\u2019s July 15, 2011 letter to the Commission.\n[27] To this date, the Complainants have not received the lease from the Respondent.\n[28] The Tribunal held a hearing in this matter during the week of October 7, 2013. Mr. Louie did not attend. Mrs. Beattie did attend but did not give evidence. Mr. Beattie, the Complainants\u2019 Representative, appeared as a witness at the hearing and gave evidence for the complainant.\nIII. Legislation [29] Section 2 of the CHRA reads as follows:\nThe purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n[30] Section 5 of the CHRA reads as follows:\nIt is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[31] Section 28 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n(1) Subject to subsection (2), any deed, lease, contract, instrument, document or agreement of any kind, whether written or oral, by which a band or a member of a band purports to permit a person other than a member of that band to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise any rights on a reserve is void.\n(2) The Minister may by permit in writing authorize any person for a period not exceeding one year, or with the consent of the council of the band for any longer period, to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise rights on a reserve.\n[32] Section 29 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\nReserve lands are not subject to seizure under legal process.\n[33] Section 58(3) of the Indian Act reads as follows:\nThe Minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being designated.\n[34] Section 89(1) of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n(1) Subject to this Act, the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.\n(1.1) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a leasehold interest in designated lands is subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress and execution.\nIV. Issues A. Have the Complainants met their burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of race and national or ethnic origin contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA?\nB. If there was prima facie discrimination, has the Respondent met its burden of proving that it had a bona fide justification for its initial refusal to approve a lease?\nC. If there was prima facie discrimination that did not have a bona fide justification, what remedies would be appropriate?\nV. Summary of Complainants\u2019 Submissions [35] The Complainants submit that section 58(3) of the Indian Act, which allows the Minister to lease, for the benefit of an Indian, land that is in his or her possession, provides an exception to section 28(1). Section 28(1) of the Indian Act prevents a \u201cmember of a band\u201d like Mr. Louie, from entering into a lease or any other agreement which would permit \u201ca person other than a member of that band to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise any rights on a reserve\u201d. The Complainants argue that since the leasing of private reserve land pursuant to section 58(3) is entirely exempt from the principle of section 28(1), there can be no justification for the Respondent\u2019s decision to exclude locatees from participating either as lessor, co-lessor, or lessee, on a section 58(3) lease.\n[36] Pursuant to section 29 of the Indian Act, reserve lands are excluded from seizure under a legal process and, pursuant to section 89(1) of the Indian Act, an Indian may not subject his or her real or personal property on reserve to \u201ccharge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress of execution in favour or at the instance of anyone other than an Indian or a band\u201d. The Complainants submit that these provisions effectively preclude Indian locatees from entering into otherwise economically beneficial transaction with any non-Indians. In the Complainants\u2019 view, the purpose of section 58(3) is therefore to allow private owners of reserve land to enhance its economic value. The Complainants argue that the Respondent\u2019s policy requiring Indian locatees to incorporate and act as a surrogate lessee instead of participating in the lease in their personal capacity entirely defeats this purpose. As corporations are not an \u201cIndian or a band\u201d as per section 89(1) and as defined at section 2(1), they do not possess the legal capacity to enter into an enforceable lease on reserve loan transaction which Mr. Louie needed to build a home on Lot 175.\n[37] The Complainants rely, in support of this interpretation, on Louie v. INAC, which pertained to the Respondent\u2019s conduct in processing Mr. Louie\u2019s application for a section 58(3) lease of Lot 170-1. The Complainants argue that in this decision, the Tribunal denied the existence of a fiduciary duty in the exercise of ministerial discretion pursuant to section 58(3) and recognized the right of Indians to independently determine all of their own private interests and to independently act in their personal capacity in any lawful pursuit of those private interests, including any leasing of private reserve land.\n[38] The Complainants argue that in the present case, the Respondent\u2019s exercise of discretion in deciding to approve a locatee lease was paternalistic and discriminatory. The Respondent\u2019s demand that Mr. Louie incorporate, on penalty of the denial of processing his application, was an unlawful abuse of the Minister\u2019s authority under section 58(3) and constitutes prima facie discrimination against both Complainants on the basis of their racial, national or ethnic origins.\n[39] The Complainants reject the Respondent\u2019s bona fide justification for the discrimination. The fiduciary nature of the relationship between the Crown and Indians does not justify racially discriminatory administrative policies and practices applied by the federal government to control all use of reserve land.\n[40] The Complainants ask for compensation for the lost economic opportunity they have each suffered by the unjustified delay caused to their intended loan and new home construction plans pursuant to subsections 53(2)(c) and (d) of the CHRA. The Complainants ask for this compensation from the time of the original proposed lease start date of March 1, 2008 until the Complainants abandoned the idea of obtaining a section 58(3) lease on June 1, 2011.\n[41] The Complainants also request compensation in the amount of $20,000.00 each for the Respondent\u2019s willful or reckless discrimination pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA. The Complainants allege that the Respondent had continuous access to legal advisors and that its decisions and actions were planned and deliberate and demonstrated a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n[42] The Complainants request that if payment of these amounts is not fully made within 30 days of the order, the Complainants should obtain interest at the rate provided for under Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\nVI. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Submissions [43] The Respondent alleges that neither Mr. Louie\u2019s Indian status, nor his membership in the Band, play a role in the processing of his 2008 application. The Respondent maintains that pursuant to section 58(3) of the Indian Act, an enforceable and binding lease must create a \u2018leasehold interest\u2019. As such, the Respondent was merely attempting to meet its statutory responsibilities.\n[44] As for the alleged discrimination against Mrs. Beattie, the Respondent submits that she has not established that she was denied a service by the Respondent within the meaning of \u201cservice\u201d pursuant to section 5 of the CHRA nor, in any case, that the denial of the lease application was on the basis of her Indian status. The denial of the proposal that Mrs. Beattie be the lessee in 2008 was not based on a discriminatory ground but rather, based on the fact that the assignment did not create a \u2018leasehold interest\u2019 recognized under the Indian Act. The Respondent notes that the lease application submitted by Mr. Louie did not name Mrs. Beattie as the proposed lessee and that at no time did the Respondent ask whether Mrs. Beattie was a status Indian.\n[45] The Respondent submits that since neither of the Complainants have established that they have experienced an adverse impact based on a prohibited ground of discrimination as a result of the Respondent\u2019s initial position regarding the lease application, they have failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination as detailed in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para. 33 [Moore]. While the Complainants\u2019 business and\/or commercial intentions may have been impacted by the Respondent\u2019s initial position, this was not based on their race or national ethnic origin.\n[46] The Respondent argues that if the Tribunal does conclude that the Complainants have demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, the Respondent possesses a bona fide justification for the discrimination.\n[47] The unique nature of reserve land, \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d, as a matter of federal constitutional authority pursuant to section 91(24) of the Constitution, limits the applicability and enforcement of public health and safety and environmental standards established in provincial and municipal regulatory regimes. The Courts have recognized that the possession of lands on a reserve is \u201cof the very essence of the federal exclusive legislative power under s. 91(24)\u201d: Derrickson v. Derrickson, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 285 at para. 41, and that any provincial or municipal legislation purporting to regulate the use of these lands would be an invasion of Parliament\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction: Surrey (District) v. Peace Arch Enterprises Ltd., (1970) 74 W.WR. 380 (BCCA) at p. 383.\n[48] Nevertheless, in processing applications for lease of locatee lands, the Respondent is bound by a number of statutory responsibilities arising from the Indian Act and other legislation such as the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The Respondent, in this regard, has the difficult task of balancing the competing interests including those of the Crown, the public, the Band and the applicant: Tsartlip at paras. 41, 47. While bands have the authority to enact by-laws pursuant to section 81 of the Indian Act, including by-laws which touch on health and safety, the Band enacted no such by-laws in the present case. The result is that the Respondent, as lessor, and the Band, possesses limited or no means to seek redress or take action if, as lessees, either of the Complainants acted contrary to the law, were disorderly or a nuisance, or constructed a building that was unsafe.\n[49] It is to address this regulatory gap, that the Respondent considers what lease terms may be required to establish standards and regulate the proposed use of the land. However, in the present case, Mr. Louie stated several times that the lease terms were non-negotiable. The Respondent submits that a complainant must also play his or her part in the process of accommodation under human rights statutes and has the duty to facilitate the search for accommodation: Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970 [Renaud] at para. 43. The Respondent argues that in the present case, Mr. Louie failed to fulfill this duty and that allowing the lease application would have resulted in the Respondent entering into a lease that lacked adequate protection for the Crown, the Band and the public. This would have amounted to undue hardship on the Respondent.\n[50] Turning to the remedies requested by the Complainants, the Respondent argues that, pursuant to section 53(c) and (d) of the CHRA, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to award compensation for economic losses such as the loss of the use of a construction loan and its interest. Section 53(c) and (d) provide that the Tribunal may award compensation for lost wages and any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice (53(c)) as well as costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities, or accommodation and for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice (53(d)). The Respondent submits that principles of statutory interpretation support the view that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to award compensation is restricted to these paragraphs and does not confer a \u201cfree-standing authority to confer costs in all types of complaints\u201d: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 SCC 53 (Mowat) at paras. 37-38, 41. Therefore, in the absence of an explicit provision allowing the Tribunal to compensate for economic losses, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to make the award requested by the Complainants.\n[51] The Respondent also argues that, in the event that the Tribunal finds that it does have the jurisdiction to award the requested remedies, the Complainants have not met the requisite burden of proof for a claim of economic loss. The Complainants have provided no documentary evidence setting out the terms and conditions of the alleged construction loan, disclosing the rate of interest for the loan, nor demonstrating that the money for the loan was available and, if it was, what use was made of the money in the meantime. Moreover, the Respondent argues that since the interest on the loan is the amount that Mr. Beattie would have paid in interest and not received, it is difficult to see how this constitutes a loss. As for Mrs. Beattie\u2019s claim, she has also provided no documentary evidence demonstrating that she possessed the money for the loan, that the parties had an agreement and if she had in any way mitigated the loss of interest on the alleged loan.\n[52] Finally, the Respondent submits that the Complainants provided no evidence to support their claim for compensation for pain and suffering pursuant to section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA and that the facts do not support their claim for compensation due to the Respondent\u2019s wilful and reckless behaviour pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA. The Courts have found that the latter can only be awarded if the Respondent\u2019s actions can be characterized as intentionally discriminatory or devoid of caution: Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins, 2011 FC 1168 (overturned on other grounds 2013 FCA 105). While the Respondent\u2019s policies and practices in place at the time of these applications may have been mistaken, there is no evidence to suggest that they were implemented in bad faith or with the intent to discriminate against the Complainants.\nVII. Analysis Have the Complainants met their burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of race and ethnic or national origin contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA?\n[53] The CHRA is quasi-constitutional legislation enacted to give effect to the fundamental Canadian value of equality. As identified in s. 2, its purpose is to ensure that individuals have an equal opportunity to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have, without being hindered by discriminatory practices based upon, among other things, race and ethnic origin. The Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that human rights legislation is to be given a large, purposive and liberal interpretation to ensure the remedial goals of the legislation are best achieved. A strict grammatical analysis may thus be subordinated to the remedial purposes of the human rights law so as to enhance rather than enfeeble it. First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 (\u201cFNCFCS\u201d); C.N.R. v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1987] S.C.J. No. 42 (\u201cAction Travail\u201d).\n[54] Where a Complainant alleges an infringement of s. 5 of the CHRA, the Complainant bears the onus of showing a prima facie case of discrimination. This generally requires that the following be established on the balance of probabilities:\n(a) the Respondent was engaged in the provision of \u201cservices customarily available to the general public\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5;\n(b) the Respondent either denied the service to the complainant, or adversely differentiated against the complainant in the provision of the services; and\n(c) the denial or adverse differentiation was based in whole or in part on a prohibited ground of discrimination, and\/or had a disproportionate adverse impact on persons identified by a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[55] The threshold for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is low. A prima facie case is one that covers the allegations made and which, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. Once a Complainant establishes a prima facie case, the Complainant is entitled to relief in the absence of some alternate explanation from the Respondent. FNCFCS, supra\n[56] The term \u201cservices customarily available to the general public\u201d is not defined in the CHRA, however, the case law indicates that \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 contemplates something of benefit held out as a service and offered to the public, in the context of a public relationship. However, according to the cases, a service does not have to be available to all members of the public in order to be \u201ccustomarily available to the public\u201d with the meaning of s. 5. It is enough for a segment of the public to be able to avail themselves of the service. Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, [2008] F.C.J. No. 710; Canada (Attorney General) v. Rosin, [1991] 1 F.C. 391.\n[57] Services performed by the government are generally deemed to be necessary for and of benefit to the public otherwise they would not need to be performed. A service such as the processing of an application for a ministerial lease under s. 58(3) of the Indian Act as applied for by Mr. Louie in this case represents necessary work performed by government employees, on behalf of and for the benefit of the public (i.e. an applicant). Ultimately, if such an application is approved, certain benefits will flow to the applicant such as the entering into of the lease in order to secure financing and allow development and economic activity to occur. Canadians living off reservations do not have to go through a process where lands that they own\/and or control cannot be leased or mortgaged without a Minister of the Crown having to lease the lands for them to a lessee or mortgagee for these purposes.\n[58] In his decision in Louie v. Canada Member Craig of this Tribunal was dealing with the same type of lease application for essentially the same purposes with the same parties as in this case for the adjacent Lot for which Mr. Louie also had a Certificate of Possession. In Parts IV and V of his decision at paragraphs 44 to 50 Member Craig dealt with the questions of whether INAC provided \u201cservices\u201d under s. 5 of the CHRA and what the correct interpretation of s. 58(3) of the Indian Act was. I agree with and adopt his reasons with respect to both of these questions for the purposes of this case. As well, I agree with and adopt his comments at paragraphs 54, 55, 57, 58 and 59 wherein he commented on the same letter from the then Hon. Minister Chuck Strahl of May 15, 2008 referred to in paragraph 16 herein As such it is instructive to reproduce the aforementioned paragraphs from Member Craig\u2019s decision below:\n[44] Extracts from two decisions are pertinent to the question whether all government actions are \"services\" within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[45] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin [2008] F.C.J. No 710 (C.A.) at page 9, the Court made the following observation:\n\"Addressing this question, I agree that because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the \"customarily available to the general public\" requirement in section 5 will usually be present in cases involving discrimination arising from government actions (see for example Rosin, supra at para.11, and Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) (1988, 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253 at 266-268). However, the first step to be performed in applying section 5 is to determine whether the actions complained of are \"services\" (see Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para.60).\"\n[46] In Canada (Attorney General) v Rosin, 1 F.C. 391 (paragraphs 8 and 11), the Federal Court of Appeal determined that a service does not have to be available to all members of the general public in order to be \"customarily available to the general public\":\n\"In order for a service or facility to be publicly available, it is not required that all the members of the public have access to it. It is enough for a segment of the public to be able to avail themselves of the service or facility. Requiring that certain qualifications or conditions be met does not rob an activity of its public character. The cases have shown that \"public\" means \"that which is not private,\" leaving outside the scope of the legislation very few activities indeed.\n\" \u2026 It is difficult to contemplate any government or branch of government contending that a service it offered was a private one, not available or open to the public. Indeed, it may well be said that virtually everything government does is done for the public, is available to the public, and is open to the public.\"\n[47] INAC is a government ministry which offers numerous services to Indians who have status under the Act. In her testimony in the matter of s. 58(3) locatee leases, Ms. Craig referred to applicants as \"clients\" and explained the many ways that INAC intercedes on behalf of locatees in arranging leases with potential lessees.\n[48] That s. 58(3) entails provision of services to a segment of the public is admitted by INAC's Lands and Trust Services itself, as evidenced by Ms. Davidson's email sent to Mr. Louie on September 24, 2007:\n\"I can assure you that Lands and Trust Services is willing and able to work through the locatee process with you. We provide a service to the First Nations in British Columbia and are more than willing to work through the process collaboratively and respectfully.\"\n[49] I conclude that INAC does provide services that are \"customarily available to the general public,\" namely that segment of the public who are status Indians, and that these are beneficial services being \"held out\" and \"offered\" to the public.\n[50] I am satisfied that the interpretation of s. 58(3) by the Federal Court of Appeal in Boyer v. R. [1986] 2 F.C. 393, applies to the facts of this case:\n\"15 \u2026 The right of a Band member in the piece of land which is allotted to him and of which he has lawful possession, although in principle irrevocable, is nevertheless subject to many formal limitations. The member is not entitled to dispose of his right to possession or lease his land to a non member (section 28), nor can he mortgage it, the land being immune from seizure under legal process (section 29), and he may be forced to dispose of his right, if he ceases to be entitled to reside on the reserve (section 25). These are all undoubtedly limitations which make the right of the Indian in lawful possession very different from that of a common law owner in fee simple. But it must nevertheless be carefully noted that all of those limitations have the same goal: to prevent the purpose for which the lands have been set apart i.e. the use of the Band and its members, from being defeated. None of them concerns the use to which the land may be put or the benefit that can be derived from it. The land being in the reserve, its use will, of course, always remain subject to provincial laws of general application and the zoning by-laws enacted by the Band council, as for any land in any municipality where zoning by-laws are in force, but otherwise I do not see how or why the Indian in lawful possession of a land in a reserve could be prevented from developing it as he wishes. There is nothing in the legislation that could be seen as \"subjugating\" his right to another right of the same type existing simultaneously in the Band council. To me, the \"allotment\" of a piece of land in a reserve shifts the right to use and benefit thereof from being the collective right of the Band to being the individual and personalized right of the locatee. The interest of the Band, in a technical and legal sense, has disappeared or is at least suspended. \u2026.\n\"17 \u2026 But in any event, I simply do not think that the Crown, when acting under subsection 58(3), is under any fiduciary obligation to the Band. The Guerin case was concerned with unallotted reserve lands which had been surrendered to the Crown for the purpose of a long term lease or a sale under favourable conditions to the Band, and as I read the judgment it is because of all of these circumstances that a duty, in the nature of a fiduciary duty, could be said to have arisen: indeed, it was the very interest of the Band with which the Minister had been entrusted as a result of the surrender and it was that interest he was dealing with in alienating the lands. When a lease is entered into pursuant to subsection 58(3), the circumstances are different altogether: no alienation is contemplated, the right to be transferred temporarily is the right to use which belongs to the individual Indian in possession ...\n\"18 The conclusion to me is clear. Bearing in mind the structure of the Indian Act and the clear wording of subsection 58(3) thereof, there is no basis for thinking that the Minister is required to secure the consent of the Band or the Band council before executing a lease such as the one here in question. It seems that the Act which has been so much criticized for its paternalistic spirit has nevertheless seen fit to give the individual member of a Band, a certain autonomy, a relative independence from the dicta of his Band council, when it comes to the exercise of his entrepreneurship and the development of his land.\"\n[54] INAC's paternalistic conduct toward Mr. Louie was unequivocally endorsed and supported by then Hon. Minister Chuck Strahl in his letter to Mr. Louie on May 18, 2008. The Minister bluntly pronounced that Mr. Louie could not dictate the terms of his sought-after locatee lease, and claimed that \"a fiduciary relationship is created \u2026 when Canada enters into Certificate of Possession leases. \u2026Under the Indian Act, the authority to establish the rent lies with Canada and cannot be extinguished by any means except legislative change. This authority extends beyond the setting of the rent and a release will not alter Canada's unilateral authority to establish the lease terms, which would also include but is not limited to environmental provisions.\" (emphasis added)\n[55] The Hon. Minister was mistaken. There is no fiduciary obligation involved in the exercise of ministerial discretion under s. 58(3). Moreover, a unilateral exercise of discretion would be injudicious and negate the purpose of s. 58(3), which is intended to facilitate the leasing of land by individual Indian land owners who envision a benefit for themselves (See Boyer, supra).\n[57] INAC's refusal to accept that Mr. Louie had the right to determine the benefit that might accrue to him from the commercial enterprise that he and Ms. Beattie had undertaken brought the application process to a standstill. For all practical purposes the Complainants' application for a ministerial lease on the terms that they had agreed upon was rejected by the Minister in his May 15, 2008 letter to Mr. Louie. The Minister's letter exacerbated INAC's discriminatory treatment of the Complainants.\n[58] While it was not raised in evidence before me it is noteworthy that on June 18, 2008, little more than a month after writing to Mr. Louie, the then Hon. Minister announced that legislation extending human rights protections to all First Nations communities had received Royal Assent. \"Passage of Bill C-21, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act marks a significant turning point in the relationship between First nations and the Government of Canada,\" said Minster Strahl. \"It underscores this government's strong commitment to protecting the human rights of all Canadians.\" The announcement, however, had no apparent effect on INAC's position regarding the complainants' applications. Nothing changed, and the complaint before me is the result.\n[59] Since the Act is now subject to the CHRA, I conclude that the application process under s. 58(3) must become an enabling administrative function that recognizes and accepts status Indians (other than those who are minors or mentally incompetent) as personally responsible Canadians capable of making their own determinations of anticipated benefits to be derived from leasing their lands, and that ministerial discretion must not be exercised unilaterally.\n[59] Section 5 of the CHRA requires that services customarily available to the general public must be provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Where a statute has ambiguous language that can be interpreted in more than one way, the CHRA requires that the administering department choose the interpretation that is most consistent with human rights principles. Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4.\n[60] For a complaint to be substantiated under the CHRA, the failure to provide the service in a non-discriminatory manner, either through denial thereof or through adverse differentiation, on the basis of a prohibited ground, must be found to have an adverse or negative impact on a person.\n[61] The Respondent\u2019s initial interpretation, prior to July 11, 2011 was that that Mr. Louie could not be the lessee as there would be no leasehold interest created by such a lease as he was the locatee (even though the Minister would be acting as lessor not Mr. Louie) and that a corporation had to be formed by Mr. Louie to create a different person at law. Further, this interpretation went on to also prohibit Mrs. Beattie from being the lessee (when that idea was floated) even though she was not the locatee, as the Complainants intention was to assign the lease from her back to Mr. Louie, which transaction was then seen by the Respondent as the same type of transaction as a lease to Mr. Louie and was deemed not acceptable. This initial interpretation did not stem from the wording of the legislation itself but from the Respondent exercising its discretion in the making of an interpretation in the course of processing the s. 58(3) application under the Indian Act. As such, both Mr. Louie and Mrs. Beattie were judged by the Respondent to be incapable of being the lessees of Lot 175 to allow a finance and build transaction to take place for reasons that are neither set out in s. 58(3) or supported by an interpretation of s. 58(3) that coincides with human rights principles that should be invoked, according to the cases, in interpretations so as to enable rather than enfeeble the legislation.\n[62] The Respondent\u2019s initial incorrect interpretation, which was subsequently reversed on July 11, 2011, caused negative impacts for both Mr. Louie and Mrs. Beattie in that they lost opportunities to develop and finance a residence on a lot. Additionally, in my opinion, the initial interpretation deprecated the dignity of both of these status Indians in a manner that would never occur to non Indians off reservations wishing to deal with their lands in the manner proposed by the Complainants in this case.\n[63] Section 5 of the CHRA requires that services customarily available to the public be provided in a non-discriminatory manner. In making the initial interpretation refusing Mr. Louie\u2019s application the Respondent used a restrictive, narrow, legalistic approach rather than a broad, purposive and liberal approach favoured by the courts in cases involving human rights. The Respondent\u2019s refusal over a period of several years based upon its incorrect legal interpretation, constituted a denial of a service to status Indians within the meaning of s. 5(a) based upon their race and national or ethnic origin and also constituted adverse differentiation in the provision of a service within the meaning of s. 5(b) in comparing the treatment of these two status Indians to non Indians off reservations.\n[64] As such, I find that the Complainants have met their burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of race and ethnic or national origin contrary to s. 5 of the CHRA.\nHas the Respondent met its burden of proving that it had a bona fide justification for its initial approval to approve the lease?\n[65] Where a Complainant proves a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 5 of the CHRA, the burden shifts to the Respondent to rebut the prima facie case, either by showing that events did not occur as alleged, or that it had a bona fide justification for its conduct, under s. 15(1)(g) or 15(2) of the CHRA.\n[66] The defence of bona fide justification under the CHRA is to be interpreted and applied in light of Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, which establishes that it will only be made out where, among other things, the approach taken by the Respondent was \u201creasonably necessary\u201d, in the sense that departing from the approach would have caused undue hardship. British Columbia (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), (1999) 3 S.C.R. 868.\n[67] In this case by virtue of its letter of July 11, 2011 the Respondent has already changed its approach to allowing applications for Ministerial leases under s. 58(3) of the Indian Act where the lessee is the locatee. This is effectively an admission that its previous approach was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the applicable jurisprudence, and that the previous approach therefore did not have a bona fide justification with the meaning of the CHRA and applicable case law.\n[68] The Respondent continues, however, to appear to maintain its position that it cannot enter into a lease unless it procures from the lessee (who it now says may be a locatee) terms that address the \u201cregulatory gap\u201d referred to in paragraphs 47,48 and 49 herein. In my opinion, this position perpetuates the paternalistic and discriminatory implementation of s. 58(3) of the Indian Act that is not reasonably necessary and is without any bona fide justification. Across the rest of Canada off reserves, necessary building, land use and environmental regulations such as the ones referred to in the paragraphs referred to above are not enforced through government leases that would apply only to persons who require leases to obtain security for financing but not to persons who have the money to build or develop without requiring securitization for financing. Rather than use s. 58(3) as a means of addressing the \u201cregulatory gap\u201d through terms in Ministerial leases on reservations, the Respondent needs to come up with another approach that establishes a fulsome and holistic regime prohibiting building to occur that does not conform to building, zoning and environmental requirements applicable in all cases, whether or not financing of development is required and Ministerial leases are sought therefor.\nVIII. Decision [69] On the basis of the foregoing reasons, I find that the Complaint in this matter has been substantiated.\nIX. Remedies [70] Section 53(2) and (3) of the CHRA includes the following provisions relative to remedies:\nComplaint substantiated\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice;\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any or all additional costs of obtaining alternative goods, services, facilities or accommodation and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nSpecial compensation\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[71] The Complainants seek remedies including economic losses for the value of a construction loan they say would have been made to Mr. Louie by Mrs. Beattie in 2008 to finance the house construction, including the loss of the opportunity for the loan to Mr. Louie and the loss of interest that would have been paid to Mrs. Louie. The loan, of course, was never made and no real evidence of its particulars and documentation therefor was produced at the hearing. I accept the submissions of the Respondent in paragraphs 50 and 51 herein with respect to this request for a remedy in that there is no evidence of the loss actually having been sustained and there is no jurisdiction in s.53(2) of the CHRA to allow an award by me for this request.\n[72] The Complainants are entitled to special compensation under s. 53(3) of the CHRA as I believe on the evidence before me that the conduct of the Respondent in refusing the Complainants applications for a Ministerial lease was done with full knowledge of the consequences and impacts to the Complainants of its actions during the time that the refusal was on going and the Respondent had not changed its interpretation and position. In my opinion, the later interpretation that it chose to make should have been clear to the Respondent from the outset in keeping with the purposive and liberal attitude that should be adopted in making interpretations of this nature in these circumstances. As such, I find that its conduct in this respect was intentional and wilful and falls within s. 53(3).\nX. Order [73] Therefore, the Tribunal orders and directs that the Respondent, within one month of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, pay each of the Complainants the amount of $5000.00 as special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3) of the CHRA.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Ulyatt\nDate:\nMarch 5, 2014\nCitation: 2014 CHRT\n8\n[1] The Complainant Clay Mazurkewich has filed a complaint against the Respondent, S & S Delivery Services Ltd. on June 16, 2011 alleging discrimination by the Respondent, his employer, under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cthe CHRA\u201d).\n[2] The Complainant and the Respondent were not represented by legal counsel at the hearing, and the particulars of the complaint, evidence on the extent of the disability of the Complainant and the position of the Respondent were far from satisfactory.The Complainant alleged that he was discriminated against by the Respondent due to a medical disability; in particular, chronic pain, which was exacerbated whilst working and therefore his termination was contrary to section 3 of the CHRA. It was implicit in the Complainant\u2019s evidence and submissions that there was a breach of section 7 (a) of the CHRA.\n[3] The Respondent is a small trucking company that operates out of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and the Respondent was represented at all times by the President and principal shareholder of the corporation, Brian Slobodian.\n[4] The Complainant had been employed by the Respondent previously, but had rejoined the Respondent\u2019s place of employment as a fork lift operator, as well as being required to do some manual lifting.\n[5] The Complainant testified that he experienced severe lower back pain on April 18, 2011 as a result of the jarring\/jolting action in operating a forklift during the course of his employment with the Respondent.The Complainant also experienced severe back pain on April 21, 2011 and April 29, 2011, and had reported same to his supervisor, John Simpson. As such, the Complainant had taken those days off.The back pain was later diagnosed as a result of a degenerative disc disease by the medical consultant of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Board (hereinafter referred to as WCB).The evidence disclosed that the supervisor, John Simpson, did not report the absences of the Complainant on the above dates to the principal of the company, Brian Slobodian.\n[6] On May 2, 2011, the Complainant reported to his supervisor, John Simpson, that after the company baseball practice, he had seen his doctor over the weekend and the Complainant had been advised that he should take time off work. The Complainant was advised by his supervisor that a Workers Compensation claim would have to be completed.\n[7] The Complainant testified that, later that same day, he received a telephone call from Brian Slobodian advising him that if he had filed a claim with the WCB, he was \u201ca bastard\u201d and Mr. Slobodian, during the call, terminated the Complainant\u2019s employment.The Complainant alleges that Brian Slobodian further stated that if the Complainant came on the employer\u2019s property, he would be charged with trespassing.\n[8] The Complainant further testified that his mother, with whom the Complainant was currently residing, was on an extension phone and listening in on the conversation.The Complainant\u2019s mother did testify at the hearing and confirmed the Complainant\u2019s evidence as to the conversation with Mr. Slobodian.\n[9] The Respondent did not contradict the evidence concerning the dismissal, the derogatory comment or the comment about having the Complainant charged with trespassing.The Respondent advised that he had been upset by the Complainant\u2019s actions inasmuch as the Complainant had attended a company baseball practice on April 30, 2011, but was unavailable for work on May 2, 2011.At no time did the Respondent challenge the Complainant\u2019s claim that he was disabled or injured.Whilst the Respondent did not take issue with the complainant\u2019s testimony regarding their conversation of May 2, 2011, the Respondent did testify that he thought that the conversation was on a cell phone and not a land line.Thus, it would have been impossible for the Complainant\u2019s mother to have monitored the conversation.\n[10] The Complainant applied for WCB benefits pursuant to Saskatchewan Legislation, and was initially declined compensation as the initial finding was that the Complainant was not disabled.On appeal, which involved a review of the evidence submitted by the Complainant, the Complainant was successful and did receive benefits totaling $5,421.90, running from the termination date until July 15, 2011, the date on which, according to the WCB findings, he was fit to return to work.\n[11] The Complainant never returned to his employment with the Respondent, and ultimately found alternate employment with a new employer which lasted from August 21, 2011 to August 31, 2011.The Complainant left this position for a third position, commencing September 4, 2011.The evidence of the Complainant was that, for personal reasons which he did not disclose, nor was he asked to, he voluntarily left the third position after less than a day.There was no assertion by the Complainant that his departure from either position of employment obtained after his termination by the Respondent was for physical or medical reasons.\n[12] On the issue of compensation for lost wages resulting from the discriminatory practice alleged, the Complainant's position was that he ought to receive pay over a period commencing on the date on whichhis Workers Compensation benefits ended, July 15th, 2011, when he was deemed fit to work, and continuing after his departure from the two subsequent jobs and extending to October 31, 2011, being the date he alleges hisemployment with the Respondent would have been terminated in any event:The evidence of the Complainant, unchallenged by the Respondent, was that a secondary operation of the Respondent was closed on October 31, 2011, at which time staff was terminated.The Complainant would as well have been terminated at that time.There is no issue between the Complainant and the Respondent that the secondary operation was now closed and that the Complainant\u2019s employment would have ended at that time, had the events of May 2 not intervened.\n[13] Neither the Complainant nor the Respondent were clear as to precise calculation of the Complainant\u2019s applicable pay loss stemming from the Respondent\u2019s actions.The parties have agreed that the Complainant\u2019s final pay would have been $17.50 per hour.At the hearing, the Respondent did not challenge the injury or disability, or raise any issues relating to the mitigation of the Complainant\u2019s losses up to August 21, 2011.\n[14] The issue of disability is a key criterion that the Complainant must satisfy.Moreover, in order to be successful under section 7(a) of the CHRA, the Complainant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.In Chaudhary v. Smoother Movers, (2013) CHRT 15 (CanLII), the Tribunal at paragraphs 33 and 35 stated as follows:\n[33] The Complainant in proceedings before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, (1985) CanLII 18 (SCC), (1985) 2 SCR 536 at para. 28).\n[35] Paragraph 7(a) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In complaints under subsection 7(a), the Complainant must establish a link between a prohibited ground of discrimination and the employer\u2019s decision to refuse to employ or continue to employ him or her. (see Roopnarine v. Bank of Montreal, (2010) CHRT 5 (CanLII), 2010 CHRT 5 at para. 49). That said, discrimination does not need to be the only reason for the decision. It is sufficient that discrimination be one factor in the decision. (See Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., (1990) F.C.J. No. 419 (F.C.A.) (Q.L.); and, Khiamal v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), (2009) FC 495 (CanLII), 2009 FC 495 at para. 61).\n[15] In this case, the alleged prohibited ground is disability.The question of what constitutes a disability was canvassed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Desormeaux v. Ottawa (City), (2005) FCA 311 at paragraph 15, wherein the Court stated:\nAs the Supreme Court established in Granovsky v. Canada, (2000) SCC 29 (CanLII) (2000) 1 S.C.R. 703 at para.34 and in City of Montreal (supra) at para. 71, disability in a legal sense consists of physical or mental impairment which results in a functional limitation or is associated with a perception of impairment.\n[16] Thus, in order to be successful, the Complainant must first establish on a prima facie basis: (1) that he suffered from a disability and (2) that his disability played a role in the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate his employment, contrary to section 7(a) of the CHRA.\n[17] The evidence confirms that the Complainant has met both criteria; that he was disabled and that the termination of his employment was based, at least in part, on his disability.Due to the complainant\u2019s back injury, he was advised by his doctor to take time off work.When he conveyed this advice to his supervisor, the supervisor told him he would have to complete a WCB form.When Mr. Slobodian learned of the possibility of a WCB claim, he terminated the complainant\u2019s employment.Thus, but for the complainant\u2019s disability, he would not have lost his job.\n[18] Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established the onus shifts to the Respondent, to demonstrate that the impugned conduct is justified.Chaudhary v. Smoother Movers (supra) stated at paragraph 52:\nOnce a complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the respondent must demonstrate that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act (see sections 15-24 of the Act).\n[19] The only potential explanation that I could garner from Mr. Slobodian\u2019s evidence and argument was that the Complainant\u2019s termination was not for disability but for fabricated assertion of disability given the Complainant\u2019s ability to attend a baseball practice.However, on the totality of evidence this explanation could not be accepted.The evidence before the Tribunal was clear in that the Respondent ought to have known that the Complainant was disabled due to the information shared with the supervisor.Moreover regardless of what Mr. Simpson may have done with the information he received, the Respondent\u2019s president, Brian Slobodian, specifically acknowledged during his May 2 conversation with the Complainant that the Complainant was being terminated based upon his inability to work for medical reasons.Having found no reasonable explanation to rebut the prima facie case, I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that the Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate the complainant\u2019s employment was based on his disability, and that therefore the complaint is substantiated.\nRemedy\n[20] The Complainant has asked for lost wages, not only up to the time he accepted a second position on August 21, 2011, which ended on August 31, 2011, but also past the third job he accepted on September 4, 2011, which lasted less than one day.The Complainant sought compensation to the date when the Respondent\u2019s warehouse would have closed on October 31, 2011, at which time the Complainant acknowledged that he would have been permanently laid off.\n[21] Pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, the Complainant is entitled to receive compensation for any and all wages that he was deprived of as a result of the discriminatory practice.The loss of income by the complainant is a result of the discriminatory act in the manner of termination, and I therefore find it is eligible for compensation.\n[22] The evidence before the Tribunal was poor and inadequate.However, the parties did agree that the hourly wage for employment was $17.50 and the evidence disclosed that the Complainant was paid until the end of the disability period on July 15, 2011 by WCB.The new position that the Complainant accepted commenced on August 21, 2011.\n[23] Upon considering the evidence and the submissions, I find that the Complainant should be compensated for the time period up to when he commenced his new employment on August 21st, 2011. It would be unreasonable for the Respondent to have to reimburse the Complainant for alleged loss of income arising from a choice on the part of the Complainant not to work.Therefore I set the amount of compensation for lost wages at five weeks from July 18, 2011 to August 21, 2011, being 200 hours at $17.50 per hour, for a total of $3,500.00\n[24] The Complainant has also made a claim in respect of compensation for willful or reckless discrimination under section 53(3) of the CHRA.The evidence established that the Respondent, knowing the Complainant\u2019s medical condition, acted in a manner that was reckless in not considering the Complainant\u2019s physical condition. This claim is allowed.In considering all the circumstances, including the fact that the negative comments and termination were done in private (to the best of the respondent\u2019s knowledge), I find an award of $1,000.00 in special compensation pursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA is appropriate.\n[25] I will retain jurisdiction in the event that any dispute arises regarding the quantification or implementation of any of the remedies ordered under this decision.\nOrder\n[26] For the foregoing reasons, I hereby order that:\nPursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA, the respondent compensate the complainant in the amount of $3,500;\nPursuant to section 53(3) of the CHRA, the respondent compensate the complainant in the amount of $1,000.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Gupta; Ms. Zagorska, Counsel for CAS and PWGSC; David Langtry, Commissioner CHRC; Jodie van Dieen, Director General and Senior General Counsel; and Hon. Mike Wallace, MP for Burlington and Chair Government Human Rights Committee.\n[2] The Tribunal is also in receipt of a letter from the Complainant in this matter, Anne Marsden, sent by fax on March 6, 2014 at 9:32 a.m. addressed to her treating physician.\n[3] In both these letters, the Complainant indicates she is abandoning her complaints currently before the Tribunal.\n[4] The Tribunal will respond to the correspondence by way of this ruling.\n[5] The complainant states:\nThe promise by the Tribunal of an expeditious hearing being held with the complainant being given full opportunity to be heard as a result of the Canadian Human Rights Commissioner David Langtry\u2019s order has been repeatedly and blatantly denied.\n[6] She also states:\nThe known consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s well evidenced repetitive clearly intentional removal of the right of full opportunity to be heard on the complainant\u2019s health and quality of life leaves her with no alternative than to abandon the complaints.\n[7] The Tribunal finds that the record of this proceeding does not support the Complainant\u2019s allegations that she was deprived of the full opportunity to be heard by this Tribunal.\n[8] To the contrary, the Tribunal notes that the Complainant had neglected or refused attempts by the Tribunal to schedule a Case Management Conference Call that was to take place in Fall 2013, specifically to set hearing dates.\n[9] In addition, hearing dates were scheduled for March 2014, with a Case Management Conference Call scheduled for March 7, 2014 to discuss the parameters for the continuation of the hearing into the complaints. The Complainant, however, decided to abandon her complaints for reasons that are mentioned in her letters.\n[10] The Tribunal notes as well, that in a letter dated November 21, 2011 to the Registrar of the Tribunal, the Complainant\u2019s attending physician states \u201cSince 2010 I have advised her in the best interests of her health to retire from her advocacy role.\u201d\n[11] Notwithstanding the advice of her own physician, the Complainant chose to pursue the current complaints before the Tribunal\u2014as is her right\u2014though in so doing she put her own health in jeopardy. While the tribunal made every possible effort to accommodate the complainant\u2019s health issues, ultimately, the Tribunal cannot be responsible for a medical situation that originates from the Complainant\u2019s decision to pursue her complaints.\n[12] Additionally, during the last few weeks, the Tribunal has taken notice of many aggressive, abusive and untruthful e-mails addressed to tribunal staff and to the presiding member, including the Acting Chairperson. Communications were sent directly to tribunal members on many occasions, instead of being sent to the Registry Office for forwarding (as per repeated directions and reminders). These abusive communications culminated in an email sent on March 5, 2014, wherein the complainant requested that the Acting Chief Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission initiate an RCMP investigation into what she believed to be criminal conduct that had allegedly occurred during the inquiry, namely \u201cobstruction of justice, assault, misrepresentation of fact\u201d.\n[13] The tribunal finds the many outrageous allegations in these e-mails to be groundless and notes that they are illustrative of the incapacity of the complainant to represent her case adequately.\n[14] It is noteworthy that through much of this case, the complainant appeared to be represented by her spouse, designated as her Personal Support Person. Many of the abusive communications in this proceeding appeared to have been sent by him, on the complainant\u2019s behalf. That said, it was made abundantly clear on several occasions by direct communication with the complainant that her Personal Support Person was fully mandated to make submissions on her behalf, and that he did so with her full knowledge and consent.\n[15] The tribunal reiterates the fact that it had attempted to fulfil its obligations under the Canadian Human Rights Act towards the complainant. The tribunal is fully committed to accommodating the needs of all hearing participants, and indeed remained committed to accommodating the complainant\u2019s needs notwithstanding her vexatious conduct. Were it not for the negative and aggressive attitude of the Complainant, she could have obtained a hearing of her complaints in March 2014 or earlier, had she only declared her availability, as she had been invited to do well before now.\n[16] It is not the Tribunal that brought this inquiry to an end. It is the complainant who did so.\n[17] While an express finding in this regard may not be necessary, given her abandonment of the complaints, the Tribunal concludes that the Complainant has insufficient evidence to present in support of her complaints, despite having been invited to present her case many times, and despite the tribunal\u2019s ongoing willingness to accommodate her needs .\n[18] Consequently, the complaints are, for all purposes, dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 7, 2014\n",

La plainte\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision portant sur une plainte sign\u00e9e par Joyce Beattie (la plaignante) le 18 janvier 2011 et re\u00e7ue par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 19 janvier 2011. Cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2011.\n[2] Dans la plainte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada et ci-apr\u00e8s, l\u2019intim\u00e9) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard [Traduction] \u00ab lors de la fourniture d\u2019un service qui est destin\u00e9 au public et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu, suivant les paragraphes 5(3) et 9(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens, de fournir \u00e0 toute personne. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sommairement refus\u00e9, sur le seul fondement d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite, soit la situation de famille, d\u2019examiner avec suffisamment d\u2019attention les faits et les r\u00e8gles de droit qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir le droit de la plaignante d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite au registre des Indiens et de devenir membre d\u2019une bande conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)c) et 11(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens. La plainte vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher une violation continue de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des obligations que cette loi lui impose relativement \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante le 2 juin 2010 pour que soient apport\u00e9es les corrections n\u00e9cessaires concernant son inscription au registre des Indiens et son appartenance \u00e0 une bande \u00bb. Dans sa plainte, la plaignante all\u00e8gue en outre que [Traduction] \u00ab les documents et la demande de modification de sa cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription pour celle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 [l\u2019al.] 6(1)c), ce qui lui conf\u00e8re le droit de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in \u00e0 laquelle elle a appartenu et devrait appartenir, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au registraire des Indiens le 7 juin 2010. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2010, le registraire a rejet\u00e9 sommairement la demande de la plaignante [...] \u00bb\n[3] Selon ce qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la plainte, l\u2019acte ou les actes discriminatoires pr\u00e9tendument survenus pour des motifs de distinction illicite fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la situation de famille aux termes de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) sont ceux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Ces deux articles de la LCDP sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\n3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(2) Une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l\u2019accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu ;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[4] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 9 janvier 2012, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP.\n[5] J\u2019ai proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte dans la semaine du 30 septembre 2013.\n[6] En d\u00e9cembre 1949, la Loi des Indiens, L.R.C. 1927, ch. 98, comportait les dispositions suivantes :\nII. Les faits\n2. En la pr\u00e9sente loi, \u00e0 moins que le contexte ne s\u2019y oppose, l\u2019expression\n[\u2026]\nb) \u00ab bande \u00bb signifie une tribu, une peuplade ou un groupe d\u2019Indiens qui poss\u00e8de en commun une r\u00e9serve ou des terres indiennes dont le titre l\u00e9gal est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne, ou qui y est int\u00e9ress\u00e9, ou qui participe \u00e9galement \u00e0 la distribution d\u2019annuit\u00e9s ou d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats dont le gouvernement du Canada est responsable; et, lorsque quelque d\u00e9cision est prise par elle en cette qualit\u00e9, signifie la bande en conseil;\nc) \u00ab bande irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00bb signifie une tribu, une peuplade ou un groupe d\u2019individus de sang indien qui ne poss\u00e8de aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans une r\u00e9serve ou des terres dont le titre l\u00e9gal est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Couronne, qui n\u2019a aucun fonds commun administr\u00e9 par le gouvernement du Canada, et qui n\u2019a pas de trait\u00e9 avec la Couronne;\n[\u2026]\ne) \u00ab Indien \u00bb signifie\n(i) tout individu du sexe masculin et de sang indien r\u00e9put\u00e9 appartenir \u00e0 une bande particuli\u00e8re,\n(ii) tout enfant de cet individu,\n(iii) toute femme qui est ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement mari\u00e9e \u00e0 cet individu ;\nf) \u00ab Indien non soumis au r\u00e9gime d\u2019un trait\u00e9 \u00bb signifie tout individu de sang indien qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9 appartenir \u00e0 une bande irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, ou qui vit \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on des Indiens, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u00e9journe que temporairement en Canada ;\n[7] La plaignante est n\u00e9e le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1949, dans une localit\u00e9 des Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest appel\u00e9e Tsiigehtchic (anciennement Arctic Red River). Ses parents biologiques sont James Delap Harris et Roselia (ou Roaslie) Harris (n\u00e9e Arruka ou Aruke).\n[8] James Delap Harris et Roselia (ou Rosalie) Harris (n\u00e9e Arruka ou Aruke) se sont mari\u00e9s aux environs de 1938.\n[9] Le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1949 ou vers cette date, Norbert Otto Natsie et Bernadette Natsie (n\u00e9e Coyen) ont adopt\u00e9 Joyce Beattie, alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de quatre jours, selon la coutume autochtone, sa m\u00e8re biologique ne pouvant prendre soin d\u2019elle en raison de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[10] Au moment d\u2019adopter la plaignante selon la coutume autochtone, Norbert Otto Natsie et Bernadette Natsie (n\u00e9e Coyen) \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des Indiens en vertu des dispositions alors en vigueur de la Loi sur les Indiens et leurs noms figuraient dans la liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s \u00e9tablie sous le r\u00e9gime du Trait\u00e9 no 11 pour la bande des Loucheaux no 6, telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait connue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que Gwichya Gwich\u2019in est le nom contemporain de la bande des Loucheaux no 6.\n[11] Le nom de la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues dans le Trait\u00e9 no 11 pour la bande connue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque sous le nom de Loucheaux no 6 au moment de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone.\n[12] Le 4 septembre 1951, d\u2019importantes modifications \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur. La loi modificative, Loi sur les Indiens, L.C. 1951, ch. 29, pr\u00e9voyait notamment ce qui suit :\n2. (1) Dans la pr\u00e9sente loi, l\u2019expression\n[\u2026]\nb) \u00ab enfant \u00bb comprend un enfant indien l\u00e9galement adopt\u00e9 ;\n[...]\ng) \u00ab Indien \u00bb signifie une personne qui, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi, est inscrite \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien ou a droit de l\u2019\u00eatre ;\n[\u2026]\nj) \u00ab membre d\u2019une bande \u00bb signifie une personne dont le nom appara\u00eet sur une liste de bande ou qui a droit \u00e0 ce que son nom y figure ;\n[...]\n11. Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article douze, une personne a droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite si\n[\u2026]\nb) elle est membre d\u2019une bande\n(i) \u00e0 l\u2019usage et au profit communs de laquelle des terres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou, depuis le vingt-six mai mil huit cent soixante-quatorze, ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un trait\u00e9 les mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9, ou\n(ii) que le gouverneur en conseil a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 une bande aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\n[...]\nd) elle est l\u2019enfant l\u00e9gitime\n(i) d\u2019une personne du sexe masculin d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a) ou b).\n[...]\n14. Une femme qui est membre d\u2019une bande cesse d\u2019en faire partie si elle \u00e9pouse une personne qui n\u2019en est pas membre, mais si elle \u00e9pouse un membre d\u2019une autre bande, elle entre d\u00e8s lors dans la bande \u00e0 laquelle appartient son mari.\n[13] L\u2019article 5 de la Loi sur les Indiens de 1951 cr\u00e9ait un registre des Indiens \u00ab o\u00f9 doit \u00eatre consign\u00e9 le nom de chaque personne ayant droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite comme Indien \u00bb. Jusque-l\u00e0, il n\u2019y avait jamais eu de registre centralis\u00e9 pour l\u2019inscription des Indiens ; au lieu de cela, l\u2019intim\u00e9 tenait, pour chaque bande, une liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par le trait\u00e9 ou une liste des membres de la bande. \u00c0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications de 1951, les listes d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tablies pour les bandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 collig\u00e9es pour former le registre des Indiens ; parall\u00e8lement, une liste g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e afin de recevoir le nom des personnes qui avaient le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrites au registre, mais qui n\u2019appartenaient pas \u00e0 une bande\n[14] Le 6 avril 1974, la plaignante a \u00e9pous\u00e9 Bruce Beattie, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inscrit au registre pr\u00e9vu par la Loi sur les Indiens et qui n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019y \u00eatre inscrit. En raison de ce mariage, Mme Beattie a perdu tout droit \u00e9ventuel d\u2019inscription et d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque en mati\u00e8re de mariage avec un non-Indien. Ces dispositions s\u2019appliquaient uniquement aux femmes.\n[15] Le 17 mars 1975, la plaignante et Bruce Beattie ont eu un fils, T\u2019Seluq Beattie.\n[16] Le 1er juin 1976, la plaignante et Bruce Beattie ont eu une fille, Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie).\n[17] Le 17 avril 1985, le Projet de loi C\u201131 : Loi modifiant la Loi sur les Indiens, est entr\u00e9 en vigueur. En cons\u00e9quence, la Loi sur les Indiens a \u00e9t\u00e9 substantiellement modifi\u00e9e. Les nouvelles dispositions pr\u00e9voyaient notamment ce qui suit :\n2. (1) Les dispositions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[\u2026]\n\u00ab enfant \u00bb S\u2019entend notamment d\u2019un enfant indien l\u00e9galement adopt\u00e9.\n\u00ab Indien \u00bb Personne qui, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi, est inscrite \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien ou a droit de l\u2019\u00eatre.\n[\u2026]\n\u00ab membre d\u2019une bande \u00bb Personne dont le nom appara\u00eet sur une liste de bande ou qui a droit \u00e0 ce que son nom y figure.\n[\u2026]\n5. (5) Il n\u2019est pas requis que le nom d\u2019une personne qui a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite soit consign\u00e9 dans le registre des Indiens, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au registraire.\n11. (1) \u00c0 compter du 17 avril 1985, une personne a droit \u00e0 ce que son nom soit consign\u00e9 dans une liste de bande tenue pour cette derni\u00e8re au minist\u00e8re si elle remplit une des conditions suivantes :\n[\u2026]\nc) elle a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) et a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un membre de cette bande en raison des circonstances pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a ;\n[18] Depuis les modifications apport\u00e9es par le projet de loi C-31, ce sont les paragraphes 6(1) et (2) de la Loi sur les Indiens qui d\u00e9finissent quelles personnes ont le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrites au registre des Indiens. Au lendemain de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications du projet de loi C\u201131, ces paragraphes avaient respectivement les r\u00f4les suivants :\nle paragraphe 6(1) \u00e9tablissait les cat\u00e9gories de personnes ayant droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription, dont les suivantes :\ntoute personne qui \u00e9tait inscrite ou avait le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre le jour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur des modifications de 1985 (al. 6(1)c)) ;\nles femmes dont le nom avait \u00e9t\u00e9 omis ou retranch\u00e9 d\u2019une liste de bande (avant le 4 septembre 1951) ou du registre des Indiens (\u00e0 compter du 4 septembre 1951) en raison de leur mariage avec un non-Indien (al. 6(1)c)) ;\nles personnes dont les deux parents sont Indiens (al. 6(1)f) ;\nle paragraphe 6(2) rendait admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019inscription les personnes dont l\u2019un des parents est Indien.\n[19] Les personnes inscrites ou ayant le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre en vertu du paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens peuvent transmettre ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont avec des personnes non inscrites ou n\u2019ayant pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens. En revanche, les personnes inscrites ou ayant le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens ne peuvent transmettre ce m\u00eame droit aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont avec des personnes non inscrites ou n\u2019ayant pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[20] Les modifications pr\u00e9vues au projet de loi C\u201131 permettaient \u00e0 la bande d\u2019assumer le contr\u00f4le sur ses membres et de maintenir sa propre liste, moyennant certaines conditions (Loi sur les Indiens, article 10). Toutefois, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle en assume la responsabilit\u00e9, la liste de la bande est tenue au minist\u00e8re par le registraire des Indiens, qui peut y ajouter ou en retrancher le nom des personnes ayant ou n\u2019ayant pas le droit d\u2019y figurer aux termes de la Loi (Loi sur les Indiens, article 9). Le registraire des Indiens n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019ajouter un nom \u00e0 la liste d\u2019une bande \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une demande d\u2019inscription \u00e0 cet effet ne lui soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e (Loi sur les Indiens, paragraphe 9(5)).\n[21] Les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens dans le cadre du projet de loi C\u201131 ont modifi\u00e9 les droits \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des parents biologiques de la plaignante. En effet, par suite de ces modifications : (i) James Delap Harris a obtenu le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) et (ii) Roselia (ou Rosalie) Harris (n\u00e9e Arruka ou Aruke) a obtenu ce droit en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c).\n[22] Vers le 1er septembre 1985, la plaignante a fait parvenir au registraire des Indiens une demande d\u2019inscription pour elle-m\u00eame et ses enfants sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[23] En 1986, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a inscrit la plaignante au registre, suivant l\u2019al. 6(1)f), du fait de sa filiation biologique. Il a \u00e9galement inscrit ses enfants suivant le paragraphe 6(2), \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ceux-ci avaient un parent qui \u00e9tait inscrit (la plaignante) et un parent qui ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas et n\u2019avait pas droit de l\u2019\u00eatre (M. Beattie). Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 les noms de la plaignante et de ses enfants \u00e0 la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope (la bande de la m\u00e8re biologique de la plaignante), cette bande ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas adopter de r\u00e8gles propres en mati\u00e8re d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 ses membres.\n[24] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 10 mars 1986, le registraire des Indiens a inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019elle et ses enfants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il y expliquait \u00e9galement (i) que si la bande de Fort Good Hope d\u00e9cidait, avant le 28 juin 1987, d\u2019assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de sa propre liste de bande, la plaignante devrait pr\u00e9senter une demande \u00e0 la bande afin d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite avec ses enfants sur la liste de cette bande et (ii) que si la bande de Fort Good Hope n\u2019assumait pas la responsabilit\u00e9 de sa liste avant le 28 juin 1987, la plaignante et ses enfants auraient le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits comme membres de cette bande suivant l\u2019al. 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[25] Au 28 juin 1987, la bande de Fort Good Hope n\u2019avait toujours pas pris le contr\u00f4le de sa liste. Par cons\u00e9quent, le registraire des Indiens a ajout\u00e9 le nom de la plaignante et de ses enfants, T\u2019Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie) \u00e0 la liste de bande de Fort Good Hope en date du 28 juin 1987.\n[26] Le 3 mars 2010, la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens (la LESIRI) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Parlement et adopt\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re lecture. En autres choses, la LESIRI ajoutait une nouvelle disposition \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens, l\u2019al. 6(1)c.1), qui conf\u00e9rait le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 l\u2019enfant issu d\u2019un mariage entre un homme non inscrit et n\u2019ayant pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription et une femme vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9, en raison du mariage, retranch\u00e9 d\u2019une liste de bande (avant le 4 septembre 1951) ou du registre des Indiens (\u00e0 partir du 4 septembre 1951), si les conditions suivantes \u00e9taient r\u00e9unies : (i) l\u2019enfant est n\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la date du mariage; (ii) l\u2019enfant a lui-m\u00eame eu ou adopt\u00e9 un enfant avec une personne non inscrite et n\u2019ayant pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription le 4 septembre 1951 ou apr\u00e8s cette date. La LESIRI a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en troisi\u00e8me lecture \u00e0 la Chambre des communes le 22 novembre 2010, et au S\u00e9nat le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2010. Le projet de loi a re\u00e7u la sanction royale le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2010 et la LESIRI est entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 31 janvier 2011.\n[27] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 avril 1993, le sous-ministre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a officiellement reconnu ce qui suit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement intervenu avec la Couronne au sujet des annuit\u00e9s :\n[Traduction] Les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Trait\u00e9 no 11 \u00e0 Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie et T\u2019Seluq Beattie ne sont pas li\u00e9s au statut, mais ils pourraient \u00eatre rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres facteurs, dont l\u2019ascendance. En ce qui concerne Joyce Wilma Beattie, Nikota Beattie et T\u2019Seluq Beattie, les droits \u00e0 l\u2019annuit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par le Trait\u00e9 no 11 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis \u00e0 la naissance et ont continu\u00e9 d\u2019exister par la suite, et il s\u2019agit de droits issus de trait\u00e9s reconnus et confirm\u00e9s par le paragraphe 35(1) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[28] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au registraire des Indiens en date du 2 juin 2010, la plaignante a, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone et qu\u2019elle avait obtenu de la Cour supr\u00eame des Territoires du Nord-Ouest un certificat attestant la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette adoption survenue en date du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1949. Elle demandait d\u00e8s lors ce qui suit : (i) le remplacement de sa cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription, soit celle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens, par celle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c), du fait de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, et (ii) le remplacement de la bande \u00e0 laquelle elle \u00e9tait affili\u00e9e, soit la bande \u00e0 laquelle appartenait sa m\u00e8re biologique (752, Good Hope), par celle \u00e0 laquelle appartenaient ses parents adoptifs (753, Gwichya Gwich\u2019in).\n[29] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2010, le registraire des Indiens a notamment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : (i) l\u2019adoption de la plaignante selon la coutume autochtone ne lui conf\u00e9rait pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens; (ii) [Traduction] \u00ab [\u00e0] titre indicatif, les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019inscription de la personne adopt\u00e9e par deux parents indiens sont pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens et celle de la personne adopt\u00e9e par des parents dont l\u2019un est Indien est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00bb; (iii) si la plaignante souhaitait modifier son affiliation afin de devenir membre de la bande de ses parents adoptifs, elle devait communiquer avec le bureau r\u00e9gional du MAINC situ\u00e9 aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest afin de demander un transfert officiel.\n[30] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante en date du 16 d\u00e9cembre 2010, le registraire des Indiens a inform\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re de ce qui suit : (i) il \u00e9tait convaincu que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest; (ii) les noms de ses parents adoptifs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9s au registre des Indiens; (iii) son inscription continuait de relever de la cat\u00e9gorie pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens;(iv) elle demeurait membre de la bande de Fort Good Hope suivant l\u2019al. 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[31] T\u2019Seluq Beattie a eu un enfant avec Stephanie Beattie (qui n\u2019est pas inscrite et n\u2019a pas droit de l\u2019\u00eatre sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens) : Theron Beattie, n\u00e9 le 16 octobre 2003.\n[32] En date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2011, T\u2019Seluq Beattie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019inscription au nom de son enfant, Theron Beattie. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2012, le registraire des Indiens l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que parce que lui-m\u00eame, T\u2019Seluq Beattie, \u00e9tait inscrit sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens et que Stephanie Beattie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une personne inscrite ou ayant le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre, il n\u2019avait pas pu conclure que Theron Beattie avait le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit.\n[33] Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie) a eu deux enfants avec Reynold Bangloy (qui n\u2019est pas inscrit et n\u2019a pas droit de l\u2019\u00eatre sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens) : Jreyden Bangloy, n\u00e9 le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, et Brodin Bangloy, n\u00e9 le 26 mars 2005.\n[34] Le 11 mars 2011, Nikota Bangloy a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019inscription au nom de ses enfants, Jreyden et Brodin Bangloy. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2012, le registraire des Indiens l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens et que Reynold Bangloy n\u2019\u00e9tait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une personne inscrite ou ayant le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre, il n\u2019avait pas pu conclure que Brodin Bangloy avait le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit. Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2012, le registraire a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au m\u00eame effet concernant Jreyden Bangloy.\n[35] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 9 d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait savoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait modifi\u00e9 son point de vue et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9sormais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que la plaignante avait le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c). Ce retournement s\u2019expliquait par le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait modifi\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019elle donnait au mot \u00ab enfant \u00bb dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927. Jusque-l\u00e0, selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il en avait faite, ce terme ne visait que les enfants biologiques d\u2019un Indien du sexe masculin. Or, comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 Mme McLeynachan lorsqu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9, celui-ci avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de consid\u00e9rer le terme [Traduction] \u00ab sous un autre angle \u00bb d\u00e9sormais, en \u00e9largissant la port\u00e9e de sa d\u00e9finition aux enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume autochtone. Cette nouvelle interpr\u00e9tation a eu les cons\u00e9quences suivantes :\nla plaignante est devenue une \u00ab Indienne \u00bb le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1949, \u00e9tant l\u2019enfant d\u2019un Indien du sexe masculin (son p\u00e8re adoptif selon la coutume autochtone) ;\nla plaignante avait le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indienne en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens de 1951 ;\nla plaignante a perdu ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription lors de son mariage avec Bruce Beattie en 1974 ;\nil s\u2019ensuit que la plaignante \u00e9tait une femme ayant perdu un droit avant le 17 avril 1985 en raison de son mariage et qu\u2019\u00e0 cette date, elle remplissait les conditions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) ;\nses enfants, T\u2019Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie), avaient le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1), au lieu du paragraphe 6(2) ;\nses petits-enfants, Jreyden et Brodin Bangloy, et Theron Beattie, avaient d\u00e9sormais le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits, et ce, sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2), parce que leurs parents avaient acquis le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) ;\nla plaignante et ses enfants continuaient d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 la bande de Fort Good Hope ;\nla plaignante et ses enfants pouvaient demander le transfert de leur appartenance \u00e0 une autre bande de leur choix, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[36] Le 3 janvier 2013, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre du registraire l\u2019informant, entre autres, de deux choses : (i) par suite d\u2019un examen plus pouss\u00e9, le droit \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement de la plaignante \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 de la cat\u00e9gorie pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 celle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c); (ii) elle maintenait d\u00e9sormais son appartenance \u00e0 la bande de Fort Good Hope en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[37] Vers le 3 ou le 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens a modifi\u00e9 les cat\u00e9gories d\u2019inscription de T\u2019Seluq Beattie et Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie) de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient d\u00e9sormais inscrits sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, au lieu du paragraphe 6(2).\n[38] Le 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens (i) a inscrit Theron Beattie et Brodin et Jreyden Bangloy sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens ; (ii) a ajout\u00e9 les noms de Theron Beattie et de Brodin et Jreyden Bangloy \u00e0 la liste des membres de la bande de Fort Good Hope conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11(2)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[39] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019administrateur de l\u2019inscription des Indiens de la bande de Fort Good Hope en date du 4 janvier 2013, le registraire des Indiens a justifi\u00e9 comme suit l\u2019inscription de Theron Beattie sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens :\n[Traduction]\nFondement :\nLa cat\u00e9gorie applicable au parent (T\u2019Seluq Beattie) est pass\u00e9e de celle du paragraphe 6(2) \u00e0 celle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) par suite des modifications apport\u00e9es en 2011 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens par la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement au registre des Indiens. Sa m\u00e8re, JOYCE WILMA BEATTIE, n\u00e9e HARRIS le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1949, s\u2019est inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens sous le no 7520073601.

Le droit initial \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 2d)(ii) de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1927, ch. 98, qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab tout enfant \u00bb d\u2019un individu du sexe masculin a droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit comme Indien. Ainsi, en tant qu\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9e par un Indien inscrit selon la coutume autochtone le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1949, elle aurait eu le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite comme Indienne au moment de l\u2019adoption. Elle a \u00e9pous\u00e9 BRUCE ALLAN BEATTIE, un non\u2011Indien, le 6 avril 1974.\n[40] M\u00eame si la question de l\u2019inscription de la plaignante est d\u00e9sormais r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9 continue de refuser de modifier la bande \u00e0 laquelle elle appartenait selon la loi. Les parties ont \u00e9chang\u00e9 d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions sur cet aspect. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que la plaignante avait droit \u00e0 ce que son nom soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in, mais elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait proc\u00e9der au changement puisque son nom figurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope et que le seul moyen d\u2019obtenir qu\u2019il soit consign\u00e9 dans la liste des Gwichya Gwich\u2019in consistait \u00e0 [Traduction] \u00ab transf\u00e9rer son appartenance conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 12b) de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00bb.\n[41] Dans des lettres adress\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et portant les dates du 27 mars et du 18 avril 2013, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de retrancher les noms de la plaignante, de Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie), de T\u2019Seluq Beattie, de Jreyden Bangloy, de Brodin Bangloy et de Theron Beattie de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope.\n[42] Dans une lettre adress\u00e9e au repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante et dat\u00e9e du 29 avril 2013, le registraire des Indiens par int\u00e9rim a inform\u00e9 ce dernier, entre autres choses, de ce qui suit : (i) les noms de la plaignante, de Nikota Bangloy (n\u00e9e Beattie), de T\u2019Seluq Beattie, de Jreyden Bangloy et de Brodin Bangloy avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9s de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 29 avril 2013; (ii) le nom de Theron Beattie serait retranch\u00e9 de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 30 avril 2013.

Les questions en litige\n(a) L\u2019affaire est-elle devenue th\u00e9orique du fait de la modification de la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription dont rel\u00e8ve la plaignante en janvier 2013 et du retrait de son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope en avril 2013 ?\n(b) La plaignante et la Commission se sont-elles correctement acquitt\u00e9es du fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille ou le sexe, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP ?\n(c) S\u2019il y a eu discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est-il acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau de prouver que son refus de proc\u00e9der aux modifications demand\u00e9es concernant la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription applicable \u00e0 la plaignante et sa bande d\u2019appartenance, en juin 2010, reposait sur un motif justifiable ?\n(d) S\u2019il y a eu discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue sans motif justifiable, quelles seraient les mesures de r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9es ?\nIV. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des observations de la Commission\n[45] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 2 juin 2010, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de faire passer la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription qui lui \u00e9tait applicable de celle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) \u00e0 celle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c), du fait qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone, et de retrancher son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope afin de l\u2019ajouter \u00e0 celui de la bande de ses parents adoptifs, la bande d\u2019Arctic Red River (753 Gwichya Gwich\u2019in, T.N.\u2011O.). La question qui se pose est de savoir si, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 ces demandes, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait engag\u00e9 dans la prestation de \u00ab services [\u2026] destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[46] Les \u00ab services \u00bb vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 s\u2019entendent de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est offert ou mis \u00e0 la disposition du public dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique. Comme les mesures du gouvernement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prises au profit du public, l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9es au public \u00bb, est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires se rapportant \u00e0 des mesures prises par le gouvernement.\n[47] Faire droit aux demandes de la plaignante revenait \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer des avantages qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas offerts autrement.\n[48] Lorsqu\u2019il a trait\u00e9 la demande de la plaignante et a rendu sa d\u00e9cision concernant son droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription et \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de son nom consign\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste d\u2019une certaine bande, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournissait des services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP car il a d\u00fb, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande, exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin de d\u00e9terminer si les crit\u00e8res d\u2019inscription pr\u00e9vus dans la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient remplis.\n[49] Contrairement aux situations qui pr\u00e9valaient dans Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 CAF 7 (\u00ab Murphy \u00bb), Matson et al. c. Indian & Northern Affairs Canada (aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada), 2013 CHRT 13 (\u00ab Matson \u00bb) et Andrews et al. c. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 21 (\u00ab Andrews \u00bb), nous avons affaire ici \u00e0 un cas o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 disposait, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande de la plaignante, du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner au terme \u00ab enfant \u00bb dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927. En d\u00e9cidant dans un premier temps de donner \u00e0 ce terme, dans le cadre du traitement de la demande, une d\u00e9finition restrictive excluant les enfants adopt\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire au lieu d\u2019appliquer une disposition l\u00e9gale \u00e0 caract\u00e8re imp\u00e9ratif. Les choix qu\u2019il a faits \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont parfaitement susceptibles d\u2019un contr\u00f4le en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, puisqu\u2019ils concernent la prestation de services destin\u00e9s au public.\n[50] Durant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre la demande initiale (2 juin 2010) et le changement de la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription applicable (confirm\u00e9 le 3 janvier 2013), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante le service qu\u2019elle demandait, \u00e0 savoir, l\u2019\u00e9valuation juste et non discriminatoire de son droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il l\u2019a ainsi priv\u00e9e d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) de la LCDP. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, durant cette m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture de ce service. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation du droit de cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a choisi d\u2019\u00e9tablir des distinctions entre enfants biologiques et enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume autochtone. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision de refuser la demande de la plaignante en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription pendant au moins deux ans apr\u00e8s l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LESIRI, le 31 janvier 2011. Le refus de modifier la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription applicable a compromis la possibilit\u00e9 pour la plaignante de transmettre son droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 ses descendants pendant cette p\u00e9riode, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de veiller \u00e0 ce que les registres gouvernementaux tiennent d\u00fbment compte de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone en reconnaissant la bonne filiation.\n[52] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis que l\u2019obstacle ayant initialement emp\u00each\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 la demande de modification de la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription applicable \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 sa situation d\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9e, de sorte qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019\u00ab enfant \u00bb de son p\u00e8re adoptif selon la Loi des Indiens de 1927 et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait d\u00e8s lors \u00eatre inscrite que sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) ou du paragraphe 6(2). En ce sens, le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019il a \u00e9tablie \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur la situation de la plaignante en tant qu\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone, un aspect vis\u00e9 par le motif de distinction illicite de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb selon la LCDP.\n[53] En refusant de reconna\u00eetre les effets juridiques de l\u2019adoption effectu\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime d\u2019inscription, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a effectivement emp\u00each\u00e9 la plaignante pendant pr\u00e8s de deux ans et demi d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c), qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1985 dans le but de rem\u00e9dier en partie \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe qui a longtemps perdur\u00e9 dans les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens relatives au mariage avec un non-Indien. En ce sens, bien qu\u2019il tire son origine de questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation de famille, l\u2019acte discriminatoire relev\u00e9 par la Commission a \u00e9galement eu des r\u00e9percussions pr\u00e9judiciables crois\u00e9es li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante en tant que femme autochtone.\n[54] En modifiant sa position concernant l\u2019inscription de la plaignante et son appartenance \u00e0 une bande, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a effectivement reconnu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation restrictive qu\u2019il avait ant\u00e9rieurement adopt\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas [Traduction] \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb au sens de la jurisprudence applicable et que, partant, son point de vue ant\u00e9rieur ne reposait pas sur un motif justifiable selon la LCDP et la jurisprudence applicable.\n[55] La plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019elle est devenue th\u00e9orique, car certaines questions demeurent non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9paration depuis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a modifi\u00e9 sa position vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019inscription et de l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande. Pour pouvoir juger du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte, le Tribunal doit, entre autres choses, d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire ou non.\n[56] Le Tribunal devrait ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables.\n[57] La plaignante souscrit aux observations de la Commission et les fait siennes.\n[58] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle-m\u00eame et ses descendants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s des services administratifs auxquels ils ont droit suivant le Trait\u00e9 no 11, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande vis\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9, le versement des annuit\u00e9s, l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re aux \u00e9tudes et la tenue de registres.\n[59] Par suite de la modification, en 1985, des r\u00e8gles de la Loi sur les Indiens r\u00e9gissant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription (projet de loi C-31), ce droit n\u2019est plus li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande \u00e9tablie en vertu de la loi et ne peut avoir d\u2019incidence sur l\u2019effectif d\u2019une bande vis\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019a eu aucun effet sur les droits issus de trait\u00e9s depuis 1982 en raison de l\u2019\u00e9diction de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, de sorte que depuis 1985 au moins, les listes de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par trait\u00e9 ne sont pas les m\u00eames que les listes des bandes \u00e9tablies en vertu de la loi et qu\u2019elles ne d\u00e9terminent pas l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande selon la loi. Le droit d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 une bande repose sur des qualit\u00e9s personnelles diff\u00e9rentes. L\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande vis\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9 est d\u2019ordre constitutionnel et repose exclusivement sur la filiation biologique par rapport \u00e0 un Indien qui a adh\u00e9r\u00e9 au trait\u00e9 d\u2019origine et sur la situation de famille actuelle. L\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande selon la loi, quant \u00e0 elle, n\u2019a pas de caract\u00e8re constitutionnel et elle d\u00e9pend exclusivement, soit des r\u00e8gles de l\u2019article 11, soit des r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies par la bande en vertu du pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et les unes comme les autres n\u2019exigent pas forc\u00e9ment comme condition une preuve de filiation naturelle ou une situation de famille particuli\u00e8re.\n[60] Depuis l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en 2008, dont la port\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie en 2011 afin d\u2019englober les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du gouvernement d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation, y compris un conseil de bande, un conseil tribal ou une autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale qui offre ou administre des programmes et des services sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens\u00bb, tous les services administratifs du registre des Indiens, y compris l\u2019inscription ordinaire sous le r\u00e9gime de la loi et la v\u00e9rification des faits pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par un trait\u00e9 \u00e0 un individu et de l\u2019affiliation \u00e0 une bande vis\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9, sont d\u00e9sormais assujettis \u00e0 la fois aux principes applicables en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et aux garanties constitutionnelles dont jouissent tous les droits et revendications territoriales existants, qu\u2019ils soient ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s. L\u2019obligation constitutionnelle d\u2019accorder la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance aux droits ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s existants lors de l\u2019application des principes de droits de la personne \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens est reconnue comme suit :\nV. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des observations de la plaignante\n1.1 Il est entendu que l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 la protection des droits existants \u2014 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2014 des peuples autochtones du Canada d\u00e9coulant de leur reconnaissance et de leur confirmation au titre de l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982.\n[61] La plaignante, ses deux enfants et ses trois petits-enfants sont tous des Indiens vis\u00e9s par le Trait\u00e9 no 11, selon les clauses de ce trait\u00e9, et chacun d\u2019eux l\u2019est depuis sa naissance, puisque le Canada a officiellement reconnu qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient tous des descendants naturels d\u2019un adh\u00e9rent au trait\u00e9 d\u2019origine et qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient soit eux-m\u00eames des adh\u00e9rents au Trait\u00e9 no 11, soit des enfants d\u2019adh\u00e9rents. Tous sont \u00e9galement membres de la bande des Loucheaux no 6 d\u2019Arctic Red River vis\u00e9e par le Trait\u00e9 no 11, car c\u2019est \u00e0 cette bande que le Canada a officiellement reconnu que la plaignante appartenait du fait de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, et ses descendants naturels ont le droit d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 cette m\u00eame bande qui figure toujours dans les listes de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par trait\u00e9. Tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de a \u00e9t\u00e9 garanti \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux par l\u2019article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 depuis le 17 avril 1982.\n[62] Les Indiens signataires du Trait\u00e9 no 11 ont \u00e9galement le droit constitutionnel d\u2019\u00eatre correctement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans tous les documents administratifs du Canada, y compris dans les listes de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par trait\u00e9 et dans le registre des Indiens.\n[63] Apr\u00e8s le premier versement de l\u2019annuit\u00e9 \u00e0 un adh\u00e9rent du Trait\u00e9 no 11, l\u2019intim\u00e9 maintient, \u00e0 titre de service permanent, des registres de tous les paiements annuels post\u00e9rieurs sans qu\u2019il ne soit jamais n\u00e9cessaire de renouveler l\u2019adh\u00e9sion et tous les changements survenus dans la situation de famille ou l\u2019affiliation \u00e0 une bande sont simplement consign\u00e9s dans les listes de paiement au moment du versement annuel.\n[64] Jusqu\u2019en 2011 inclusivement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni les services administratifs requis par le Trait\u00e9 no 11 et a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 chacun de ses enfants l\u2019annuit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au trait\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e de leur vie depuis leur naissance. La plaignante et ses enfants ont ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement reconnus comme des adh\u00e9rents au Trait\u00e9 no 11 et ont touch\u00e9 les annuit\u00e9s y pr\u00e9vues sur le seul fondement de leurs actes de naissance, lesquels indiquent qu\u2019ils sont des descendants naturels d\u2019adh\u00e9rents au Trait\u00e9 no 11 de 1921. Depuis 1921, la seule chose que les descendants des adh\u00e9rents au Trait\u00e9 no 11 ont eu \u00e0 produire pour prouver leurs droits au titre du trait\u00e9 et \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s relative \u00e0 la bande \u00e0 laquelle appartenaient leurs anc\u00eatres est leur acte de naissance officiel, si tant est qu\u2019ils en poss\u00e9daient un.\n[65] En 2011, les enfants de la plaignante ont fourni \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 des exemplaires des actes de naissance de leurs enfants naturels et, en qualit\u00e9 de chefs de famille, ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019annuit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au Trait\u00e9 no 11 leur soit vers\u00e9e \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames et \u00e0 leurs enfants. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de verser l\u2019annuit\u00e9 aux petits-enfants de la plaignante au motif qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas inscrits sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[66] La plaignante affirme que les d\u00e9cisions prises en 2011 par le fonctionnaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui est responsable r\u00e9gionalement de l\u2019administration du trait\u00e9 ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 en un refus effectif de biens (annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au trait\u00e9) et de services (inclusion sur la liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s), soit les seuls services offerts par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour faciliter l\u2019adh\u00e9sion au Trait\u00e9 no 11, et que ce refus \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur un fait non pertinent, \u00e0 savoir que les petits-enfants avaient le statut d\u2019enfants \u00ab non inscrits \u00bb selon la Loi sur les Indiens et qu\u2019ils ont, de ce fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 arbitrairement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas des descendants des adh\u00e9rents au Trait\u00e9 no 11 d\u2019origine. La plaignante soutient que ces d\u00e9cisions administratives sont injustifi\u00e9es, que ce soit au vu des clauses du Trait\u00e9 no 11 ou des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, et qu\u2019elles portent par cons\u00e9quent atteinte aux droits constitutionnellement garantis qui sont issus du Trait\u00e9 no 11.\n[67] En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, la plaignante demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019elle-m\u00eame, ses deux enfants et ses trois petits-enfants sont tous des Indiens vis\u00e9s par le Trait\u00e9 no 11 depuis leur naissance respective et qu\u2019ils jouissent par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 titre personnel, des droits, b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et privil\u00e8ges existants qui sont garantis par la constitution aux Indiens vis\u00e9s par le Trait\u00e9 no 11, y compris le droit d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 la bande indienne d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine sous le nom de Loucheaux no 6 d\u2019Arctic Red River et vis\u00e9e par le Trait\u00e9 no 11 et d\u2019\u00eatre officiellement inscrits \u00e0 ce titre dans les listes de paiement des annuit\u00e9s \u00e9tablies pour cette bande conform\u00e9ment au Trait\u00e9 no 11.\n[68] En vertu des alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) et d) de la Loi sur les Indiens, la plaignante demande, au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses trois petits-enfants, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit tenu de payer imm\u00e9diatement les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s des annuit\u00e9s qui leur sont dues en vertu du Trait\u00e9 no 11 pour chacune des ann\u00e9es de leur vie ainsi que le remboursement de tous les frais de scolarit\u00e9 engag\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent pour leur instruction, frais que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer en vertu des clauses du Trait\u00e9 no 11, mais dont il a retenu le versement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit statu\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9sente plainte .\n[69] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement qu\u2019en tant que victimes d\u2019actes d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s, ses deux enfants, ses trois petits-enfants et elle-m\u00eame ont droit, chacun, au versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[70] Il ne subsiste plus de litige entre les parties en ce qui a trait au droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription de la plaignante du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est revenu sur sa position le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013 et que, pour cette raison, la question litigieuse est devenue th\u00e9orique.\n[71] Il ne subsiste plus de litige entre les parties en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande selon la loi du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est revenu sur sa position concernant le retranchement des noms de la plaignante et de ses descendants de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope le 29 avril 2013 et que la plaignante a retir\u00e9 sa demande visant \u00e0 faire ajouter son nom \u00e0 la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in. Pour ces raisons, cette question est elle aussi devenue th\u00e9orique.\n[72] La plainte vise \u00e0 contester la loi, et rien de plus, exactement comme dans l\u2019affaire Matson. La plainte traite de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et du terme \u00ab enfant \u00bb dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927.\n[73] Le registraire a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab enfant \u00bb aux fins de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 6 afin de pouvoir d\u00e9terminer correctement quelle cat\u00e9gorie s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 la plaignante en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien et, pour ce faire, il n\u2019a exerc\u00e9 aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 et modifi\u00e9 son interpr\u00e9tation, le registraire n\u2019a pas non plus exerc\u00e9 de pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (l\u2019article 6 ne conf\u00e8re aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant au traitement des enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume autochtone) : il a simplement rectifi\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e qu\u2019il avait faite des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives.\n[74] La plaignante conteste non pas la mani\u00e8re dont sa demande d\u2019inscription a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e, mais bien l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le registraire au mot \u00ab enfant \u00bb et aux r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablissant le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. On ne peut raisonnablement parler de \u00ab service \u00bb dans le cas de ces crit\u00e8res qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrits par le Parlement en vertu de la comp\u00e9tence que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle. L\u2019\u00e9laboration de lois par le Parlement n\u2019est pas un service.\n[75] Le terme \u00ab service \u00bb ne vise pas la d\u00e9finition que donne le l\u00e9gislateur du terme \u00ab Indien \u00bb dans la Loi sur les Indiens. Plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments sp\u00e9cifiques s\u2019opposent \u00e0 une telle interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab service \u00bb : l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables, la notion de contrainte excessive et les facteurs \u00ab de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb dont tient compte l\u2019analyse servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un motif est justifiable. La prise en compte de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il est impossible d\u2019\u00e9valuer une mesure de contestation d\u2019une loi comme la pr\u00e9sente plainte de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e au moyen de ces m\u00e9canismes.\n[76] Si le Tribunal conclut que la plainte vise uniquement \u00e0 contester la l\u00e9gislation, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour en \u00eatre saisi, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Murphy, Matson et Andrews, et que la plainte devrait par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal estimerait que la plainte n\u2019est pas th\u00e9orique et qu\u2019elle rel\u00e8ve de sa comp\u00e9tence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que ses actes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires.\n[77] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que les crit\u00e8res applicables en mati\u00e8re de discrimination ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment les m\u00eames selon qu\u2019une affaire soit r\u00e9gie par la Charte ou par les lois sur les droits de la personne; cependant, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 des affaires relevant de la LCDP la d\u00e9finition de la discrimination \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 RCS 143, et formul\u00e9e en ces termes par le juge McIntyre :\nVI.

Ant\u00e9rieurement, il n\u2019y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les alin\u00e9as 6(1)f) et 6(1)c) en mati\u00e8re de transmission du statut. Ind\u00e9pendamment du statut de la plaignante sur le plan de l\u2019inscription, ses petits-fils n\u2019auraient pas pu \u00eatre inscrits \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens avant le 31 janvier 2011. De plus, suivant l\u2019article 11 de la Loi sur les Indiens, ils ne pouvaient faire ajouter leurs noms \u00e0 la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope ou de la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in.\n[80] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les questions relatives aux droits ancestraux et issus de trait\u00e9s que la constitution garantit \u00e0 la plaignante n\u2019entrent pas dans le champ d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, laquelle porte sur l\u2019inscription et l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, et qui qu\u2019il en soit, ces droits n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s.\n[81] Le champ d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente plainte a trait \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante le 2 juin 2010 en vue de faire modifier son statut d\u2019inscription et sa bande d\u2019appartenance en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens pour tenir compte du fait qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone. C\u2019est pourquoi les demandes d\u2019indemnisation et les all\u00e9gations de violations ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 cette demande d\u00e9passent le champ d\u2019application de la plainte.\n[82] Le droit de se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019avantages au titre d\u2019un trait\u00e9 est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande qui a sign\u00e9 un trait\u00e9 ou y a adh\u00e9r\u00e9.

De plus, les t\u00e9moignages entendus n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas que les petits-enfants de la plaignante jouissent de droits issus d\u2019un trait\u00e9 depuis la naissance. La preuve montre que la bande des Loucheaux no 6 est la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne tient plus de liste de paiement des annuit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues au trait\u00e9 pour la bande des Loucheaux no 6 depuis 1955.\n[85] On ne peut qualifier les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019intentionnellement discriminatoires ou d\u2019inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s, ce qui est une condition n\u00e9cessaire pour pouvoir rendre une ordonnance en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Aucune preuve ne permet de conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab a agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il savait \u2013 et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame, qu\u2019il voulait \u2013 discriminatoire \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plaignante.\n[86] Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la plainte de discrimination serait jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e et o\u00f9 une mesure de r\u00e9paration d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public serait ordonn\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande \u00e0 ce que six mois lui soient accord\u00e9s pour \u00e9laborer et mettre en \u0153uvre la Directive.\n[87] Le fait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son refus initial, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa position concernant les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la plaignante le 2 juin 2010 en vue d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens et d\u2019obtenir que son nom soit retranch\u00e9 de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope et ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la liste de la bande Gwichya Gwich\u2019in, compte tenu de son adoption selon la coutume autochtone, n\u2019a pas pour effet, \u00e0 mon sens, de rendre th\u00e9oriques les questions de savoir si ce refus initial de l\u2019intim\u00e9 constituait un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quelles mesures de r\u00e9paration cet acte doit entra\u00eener, s\u2019il en est.\n[88] Bien que le Tribunal ne puisse imposer les mesures de r\u00e9paration pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP que s\u2019il conclut que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le contraire n\u2019est pas vrai. Le Tribunal peut conclure qu\u2019une plainte est fond\u00e9e sans imposer de telles mesures. Si une personne met fin \u00e0 la conduite dont le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle est discriminatoire avant l\u2019instruction de la plainte, le Tribunal peut n\u00e9anmoins conclure que la plainte est fond\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la cessation de la conduite, m\u00eame s\u2019il est possible qu\u2019aucune r\u00e9paration ne soit ordonn\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, une affaire ne devient pas th\u00e9orique du seul fait que l\u2019auteur des actes en cause d\u00e9cide d\u2019y mettre fin ou qu\u2019une ordonnance de r\u00e9paration pourrait ne pas \u00eatre rendue, si le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait discriminatoire pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait perp\u00e9tr\u00e9 et que la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[89] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, non seulement la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 est toujours d\u2019actualit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avant qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9vise sa position, mais la question des mesures de r\u00e9paration \u00e0 titre individuel comme de celles command\u00e9es par l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public continue \u00e9galement de se poser malgr\u00e9 le changement dans la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[90] Par ailleurs, puisque l\u2019audience a eu lieu et que les parties ont pu d\u00e9battre en profondeur, dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure contradictoire, des questions faisant intervenir d\u2019importants droits quasi constitutionnels, aucun argument l\u00e9gitime ne permet d\u2019affirmer que des ressources judiciaires limit\u00e9es seront ainsi gaspill\u00e9es, etc., au vu des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence pour d\u00e9terminer si une affaire est th\u00e9orique.

La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffit \u00e0 justifier un verdict favorable \u00e0 la partie plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.

Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019analyse grammaticale stricte peut se trouver subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019objet r\u00e9parateur des dispositions sur les droits de la personne de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que dernier soit renforc\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019affaibli.

Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), (1987) A.C.F. no 42.)\n[95] La LCDP ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019expression \u00ab [services] destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb, mais selon la jurisprudence, le terme \u00ab services \u00bb doit s\u2019entendre, \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est offert ou mis \u00e0 la disposition du public dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique. Cela dit, il n\u2019est pas obligatoire que le service soit accessible \u00e0 tous les membres du public pour qu\u2019il soit vis\u00e9 par l\u2019article 5. Le fait qu\u2019une partie du public puisse se pr\u00e9valoir de ce service est suffisant. (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, (2008) A.C.F. no 710; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin, (1991) 1. C.F. 391.)\n[96] En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les services que fournit le gouvernement sont tenus comme n\u00e9cessaires au public et avantageux, sans quoi il serait inutile de les fournir. Avantages et services ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment synonymes. Un service tel que le traitement d\u2019une demande d\u2019inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens dont le but est de d\u00e9terminer si la demande satisfait aux exigences d\u2019inscription pr\u00e9vues par la loi repr\u00e9sente une t\u00e2che n\u00e9cessaire que les fonctionnaires doivent accomplir pour le compte et au profit du public (c.-\u00e0-d. l\u2019auteur de la demande). Au final, si l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la t\u00e2che aboutit \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la demande et \u00e0 l\u2019inscription de son auteur, celui-ci pourra d\u00e8s lors obtenir certains avantages, tels que des services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s, la possibilit\u00e9 de demander le financement des \u00e9tudes postsecondaires et certaines exemptions d\u2019imp\u00f4t. Pour qu\u2019une plainte soit fond\u00e9e selon la LCDP, il faut conclure que le d\u00e9faut de fournir le service \u00e0 une personne d\u2019une mani\u00e8re exempte de discrimination, soit parce qu\u2019elle en a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, soit parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e sur la based\u2019un motif de distinction illicite, a eu sur elle un effet pr\u00e9judiciable ou n\u00e9gatif.\n[97] La plaignante \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) de la Loi sur les Indiens lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre plut\u00f4t inscrite sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) et \u00e0 modifier la bande \u00e0 laquelle elle appartenait, apr\u00e8s avoir inform\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en juin 2010 du fait qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone. Au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande, la LESIRI avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et adopt\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re lecture, avec les dispositions mentionn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, en vertu desquelles ses petits-enfants pourraient pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00eatre inscrits sous le r\u00e9gime du paragraphe 6(2), \u00e0 condition que l\u2019intim\u00e9 reconnaisse son adoption selon la coutume autochtone pour les besoins de son inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c). Ainsi, m\u00eame si la plaignante touchait d\u00e9j\u00e0 les prestations associ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f), l\u2019intim\u00e9, en rejetant initialement ses demandes de modification de son inscription et de la bande \u00e0 laquelle elle appartenait en raison des mauvaises interpr\u00e9tations auxquelles il est arriv\u00e9 dans le cadre du traitement de ces demandes, lui a fait subir, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ses descendants, les effets pr\u00e9judiciables ou n\u00e9gatifs suivants :\ni) elle n\u2019a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une reconnaissance officielle en tant qu\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone par des parents qui se sont dans les faits charg\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9lever depuis le moment o\u00f9 elle a eu quatre jours. Malgr\u00e9 le fait que le registraire \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 consigner dans les dossiers de la plaignante son adoption selon la coutume autochtone en d\u00e9cembre 2010, il a refus\u00e9, \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, de donner un effet juridique \u00e0 cette adoption dans le cadre de son r\u00e9gime de tenue des dossiers pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 6. Ce refus de reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re juridique du lien qui l\u2019unit depuis toujours \u00e0 ses parents adoptifs a eu sur elle un effet pr\u00e9judiciable en portant atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9e. Les tribunaux ont jug\u00e9 que la reconnaissance appropri\u00e9e du lien parent enfant r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une adoption constituait un service pouvant faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire en vertu des lois sur les droits de la personne car elle s\u2019inscrit dans un \u00ab processus de confirmation de la vie \u00bb. (A.A. c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Minist\u00e8re des Services familiaux et communautaires), (2004) N.B.H.R.B.I.D. no 4.)\nii) elle n\u2019a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire retrancher son nom de la liste de la bande \u00e0 laquelle elle ne souhaitait plus appartenir sur simple pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande en ce sens, ce qui a \u00e9galement port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9. Le mot \u00ab transfert \u00bb ne figure ni \u00e0 l\u2019article 9, ni \u00e0 l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens, de sorte que la personne dont le nom appara\u00eet dans la liste de bande et qui souhaite plut\u00f4t le voir figurer \u00e0 une autre liste de bande (ou qui veut tout simplement ne figurer sur aucune liste) ne peut obtenir que son nom soit retranch\u00e9 de la liste de la bande dont elle ne veut plus faire partie en pr\u00e9sentant une simple demande \u00e0 cet effet, s\u2019\u00e9vitant ainsi de devoir entreprendre une d\u00e9marche inutile, humiliante et chronophage afin d\u2019obtenir le consentement des bandes concern\u00e9es, comme l\u2019a d\u2019abord exig\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\niii) elle n\u2019a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de transmettre \u00e0 ses enfants le statut pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) (au lieu de celui du paragraphe 6(2)) et, par le fait m\u00eame, de transmettre \u00e0 ses petits-enfants (qui, autrement, n\u2019avaient pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription) le statut pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(2) au moment de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LESIRI le 31 janvier 2011, ce qui a eu pour effet de priver ses enfants de l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux avantages tangibles offerts aux personnes inscrites \u00e0 titre qu\u2019Indiens.\n[98] L\u2019adoption de la LESIRI \u00e9tait une r\u00e9ponse directe \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique avait rendue dans l\u2019affaire McIvor. Ayant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019article 6 inop\u00e9rant parce que contraire \u00e0 la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, la Cour d\u2019appel a reconnu que la facult\u00e9 de transmettre le statut \u00e0 son enfant \u00e9tait un avantage conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi sur les Indiens, en prenant soin de pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019elle serait encline \u00e0 tirer la m\u00eame conclusion quant \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de transmettre son statut \u00e0 ses petits-enfants. La LESIRI avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Parlement lorsque les demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en juin 2010 et, \u00e0 n\u2019en pas douter, toutes les parties \u00e9taient au courant des nouvelles dispositions \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Il est, \u00e0 mon sens, tout \u00e0 fait compr\u00e9hensible que la plaignante ait attendu \u00e0 juin 2010 pour demander la modification de son statut puisqu\u2019en l\u2019absence de la LESIRI, l\u2019inscription n\u2019aurait offert \u00e0 ses petits-enfants aucun avantage tangible. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait qu\u2019elle ait attendu au mois de juin 2010 pour pr\u00e9senter ses demandes et le d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des demandes et l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LESIRI ne sont ni importants, ni pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. (McIvor v. Canada (Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153.)\n[99] Une distinction fondamentale peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie entre les faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et les affaires Murphy, Matson et Andrews en ce sens que dans ces affaires, les plaintes ne concernaient pas des actes commis par une personne exer\u00e7ant un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans l\u2019application des lois en cause. Ces plaintes \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t dirig\u00e9es contre les lois en question, sans plus. Dans toutes ces affaires, l\u2019objet v\u00e9ritablement poursuivi par les plaignants en invoquant la LCDP \u00e9tait d\u2019obtenir que le l\u00e9gislateur apporte des modifications aux lois m\u00eames et non pas \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les fonctionnaires exer\u00e7aient quelque pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans l\u2019application de ces lois. L\u2019excellent t\u00e9moin produit par l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mme Linda McLeynachan, a en fait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les fonctionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient fini par r\u00e9viser leur position concernant la demande d\u2019inscription non pas parce que le libell\u00e9 des dispositions en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 une autre interpr\u00e9tation de ces dispositions apr\u00e8s les avoir examin\u00e9es [Traduction] \u00ab sous un autre angle \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que son interpr\u00e9tation initiale \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e, et non qu\u2019il fallait de nouvelles dispositions l\u00e9gales.\n[100] Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019user de discr\u00e9tion pour interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions l\u00e9gales dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre, que ce soit par rapport \u00e0 la demande visant la modification de l\u2019inscription ou \u00e0 visant la suppression d\u2019un nom de la liste des effectifs d\u2019une bande. Au d\u00e9part, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a rejet\u00e9 les demandes en se fondant sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e des dispositions. Toutefois, il a fini par modifier sa position sans que le l\u00e9gislateur ne modifie la loi. Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 savait, de toute \u00e9vidence, qu\u2019il avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9viser sa position sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire modifier la loi, sans quoi il ne l\u2019aurait pas fait. Vraisemblablement, ce changement de position reposait sur ce qui pourrait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation plus [Traduction] \u00ab souple, g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019objet de la loi \u00bb. Le fait que les conseillers juridiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 fournir leur interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions dans cette affaire ne modifie pas la nature du travail effectu\u00e9 par ses fonctionnaires responsables du traitement des demandes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 en faire autre chose qu\u2019un service destin\u00e9 au public, et ce, m\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fini par juger que les avis juridiques obtenus au d\u00e9part \u00e9taient erron\u00e9s et devaient \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9s.\n[101] En optant, au d\u00e9part, pour une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive du terme \u00ab enfant \u00bb figurant dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 exclure les enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume autochtone, de m\u00eame que pour une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de l\u2019article 12 de la Loi sur les Indiens, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 exclure la possibilit\u00e9 de retrancher, sur demande de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9, un nom figurant dans une liste de bande vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article 11, l\u2019intim\u00e9 exer\u00e7ait son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans le cadre de la prestation de services de traitement des demandes.\n[102] Suivant l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, les services destin\u00e9s au public doivent \u00eatre fournis sans discrimination. Lorsque le libell\u00e9 d'une disposition l\u00e9gale comporte quelque ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 susceptible de plus d'une interpr\u00e9tation, le minist\u00e8re responsable de son application est tenu, selon la LCDP, de retenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus compatible avec les principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4)\n[103] La position initialement adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la demande d\u2019inscription pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) et au retrait du nom de la plaignante de la liste des effectifs de la bande d\u2019appartenance de ses parents biologiques reposait, dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, sur des interpr\u00e9tations erron\u00e9es de la Loi sur les Indiens qui ont caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 ses descendants des effets pr\u00e9judiciables qui ont dur\u00e9 environ deux ans et demi, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 97 des pr\u00e9sents motifs. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9gag\u00e9 ces interpr\u00e9tations en suivant une d\u00e9marche formaliste et rigide qui : (i) ne reconnaissait pas aux enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume autochtone la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00ab enfant \u00bb au sens de la Loi des Indiens de 1927; (ii) limitait le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription des personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es selon la coutume autochtone avant le 17 avril 1985, mais qui pr\u00e9sentaient une premi\u00e8re demande d\u2019inscription apr\u00e8s cette date au r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) ou au paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens; (iii) ne permettait pas qu\u2019un nom soit retranch\u00e9 de la liste d\u2019une bande sans le consentement d\u2019un tiers.\n[104] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ces interpr\u00e9tations initiales erron\u00e9es parce qu\u2019il a \u00e9cart\u00e9 les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation larges, lib\u00e9rales et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiques mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 94 des pr\u00e9sents motifs et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas retenu les interpr\u00e9tations les plus compatibles avec les principes relatifs aux droits de la personne auxquels il est fait allusion au paragraphe 102, ci-dessus. Au lieu de recourir \u00e0 [Traduction] \u00ab un angle nouveau \u00bb pour modifier ult\u00e9rieurement ses interpr\u00e9tations, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb, d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu, s\u2019ouvrir les yeux sur les interpr\u00e9tations correctes. Cela nous aurait \u00e9pargn\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et de labeur.\n[105] Le refus initial de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de modifier la cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription de la plaignante et de l\u2019autoriser \u00e0 retirer son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope, refus qui a dur\u00e9 deux ans et demi et qui reposait sur des interpr\u00e9tations l\u00e9gislatives erron\u00e9es, revenait \u00e0 priver la plaignante d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) de la LCDP puisque les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comportaient une \u00e9valuation irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et discriminatoire de son droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) et de son droit de demander \u00e0 ce que son nom soit retranch\u00e9 de la liste d\u2019une bande \u00e0 laquelle elle ne souhaitait plus appartenir. Les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la prestation d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) car ils proc\u00e9daient de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une distinction d\u00e9favorable des enfants adopt\u00e9s par rapport aux enfants biologiques dans le cadre de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de dispositions l\u00e9gales.\n[106] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le refus ou le traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plaignante en tant que personne adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone et, par cons\u00e9quent, il rel\u00e8ve du motif de distinction illicite fond\u00e9 sur la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb suivant l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. Le Tribunal et les tribunaux judiciaires ont statu\u00e9 que la situation de famille englobait la relation entre parents et enfants adoptifs et que les distinctions pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e9tablies entre enfants adoptifs et enfants biologiques constituaient un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille qui \u00e9tait interdit par la LCDP. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019enfant dont l\u2019adoption selon la coutume autochtone a \u00e9t\u00e9 certifi\u00e9e a droit au m\u00eame traitement selon la loi que l\u2019enfant adopt\u00e9 l\u00e9galement.

Canada, 2008 CF 409.)\n[107] Une fois que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer cette preuve, soit en d\u00e9montrant que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas eu lieu, soit que sa conduite repose sur un motif justifiable, suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) ou le paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[108] Il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur le motif justifiable pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, qui nous enseigne que ce moyen sera \u00e9tabli uniquement si, entre autres choses, la d\u00e9marche que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9e \u00e9tait \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb en ce sens que le fait d\u2019y renoncer lui aurait fait subir une contrainte excessive. (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868)\n[109] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 modifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9marche, du moins en ce qui concerne la plaignante, puisqu\u2019il a pris les mesures suivantes : (i) il a fait passer sa cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019inscription \u00e0 celle de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens; (ii) il a reconnu son droit d\u2019\u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la liste de la bande \u00e0 laquelle appartiennent ceux qui l\u2019ont adopt\u00e9e selon la coutume autochtone; (iii) il a retranch\u00e9 son nom de la liste de la bande de Fort Good Hope. Ces mesures reviennent dans les faits \u00e0 admettre que l\u2019approche restrictive ant\u00e9rieure n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb au sens de la jurisprudence applicable et qu\u2019elle ne reposait donc pas sur un motif justifiable au sens de la LCDP et de la jurisprudence applicable.\n[110] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est fond\u00e9e.\n[111] En mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9paration, l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nC. Le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif justifiable peut-il \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce?\nVIII. D\u00e9cision\nIX. Mesures de r\u00e9paration\n53. (2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17;\nb) d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\nd) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\ne) d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[112] Comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9 aux paragraphes 67 et 68 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, la plaignante demande, en guise de r\u00e9paration pour elle-m\u00eame et pour ses descendants, un jugement d\u00e9claratoire ainsi qu\u2019une ordonnance de paiement pour la violation des droits individuels issus d\u2019un trait\u00e9, violation qui, selon elle, d\u00e9coule de la violation par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des droits issus du Trait\u00e9 no 11. Sur ce point, la plaignante a tent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9largir le champ d\u2019application de la plainte pour englober davantage que ce sur quoi elle porte r\u00e9ellement et dont il est question au paragraphe 2 des pr\u00e9sents motifs, \u00e0 savoir le rejet par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des demandes qu\u2019elle lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en juin 2010 en vue d\u2019obtenir la modification de son statut d\u2019inscription et le retrait de son nom de la liste de son ancienne bande. Je n\u2019ai pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour rendre ce genre de d\u00e9cision d\u00e9claratoire ni pour ordonner de tels paiements : cela tient \u00e0 la fois au fait que la plaignante n\u2019a produit aucune preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience afin d\u2019\u00e9tayer cet argument et que ces all\u00e9gations et les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es d\u00e9bordent le cadre des questions en litige dans l\u2019instance et celui des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives applicables en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9paration et reproduites ci-dessus.\n[113] La plaignante n\u2019a pas r\u00e9clam\u00e9 d\u2019indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait que j\u2019ai explicitement interrog\u00e9 son repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Dans ces circonstances, ce serait faire preuve d\u2019iniquit\u00e9 envers l\u2019intim\u00e9 que de rendre une ordonnance en vertu de cet alin\u00e9a, malgr\u00e9 les conclusions que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9es quant aux r\u00e9percussions de ses actes discriminatoires. Cela dit, compte tenu de la preuve port\u00e9e \u00e0 ma connaissance, j\u2019ai le sentiment que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 les demandes de la plaignante en sachant tr\u00e8s bien quelles seraient les cons\u00e9quences de son geste pour la plaignante et ses descendants, et il a mis plus de deux ans et demi avant de revenir sur sa position. \u00c0 mon avis, les interpr\u00e9tations pour lesquelles il a opt\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement relativement aux demandes auraient d\u00fb lui appara\u00eetre clairement d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, du fait de l\u2019attitude lib\u00e9rale et soucieuse de l\u2019objet de la loi qu\u2019il convient d\u2019adopter lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter des lois de cette nature dans un tel contexte. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il s\u2019est conduit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et que ses actes tombent sous le coup des dispositions du paragraphe 53(3) susmentionn\u00e9.\n[114] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, j\u2019estime que les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par la Commission dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sont de mise, sous r\u00e9serve du fait que le d\u00e9lai de six mois demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour \u00e9laborer et mettre en \u0153uvre les directives lui sera accord\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je me r\u00e9jouis d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019instruction de la plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 amorc\u00e9 la r\u00e9daction des directives n\u00e9cessaires.\n[115] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nX. Ordonnance\nQue l\u2019intim\u00e9 mette fin aux actes discriminatoires suivants :\ni) le refus de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019enfant adoptif d\u2019un Indien du sexe masculin comme \u00e9tant l\u2019\u00ab enfant \u00bb de cet Indien, au sens o\u00f9 ce terme est entendu dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927;\nii) le refus d\u2019examiner les demandes visant une premi\u00e8re inscription des enfants adopt\u00e9s avant le 17 avril 1985 sous le r\u00e9gime de toute autre disposition que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) ou le paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens;\nQue l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans les six mois suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal :\ni) remette un bulletin, une directive ou un document comparable \u00e0 tous les membres du personnel concern\u00e9s par le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens afin de les informer de ce qui suit : (i) le terme \u00ab enfant \u00bb, au sens entendu dans la Loi des Indiens de 1927, doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure tant les enfants adoptifs que les enfants biologiques; (ii) les personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es avant 1985 pourraient avoir le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrites \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en vertu d\u2019autres dispositions que l\u2019al. 6(1)f) ou le paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, tout d\u00e9pendant de la situation particuli\u00e8re de chacun;\nii) transmette \u00e0 la Commission un exemplaire du bulletin, de la directive ou de tout document comparable, accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une confirmation que le bulletin a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 tous les membres du personnel concern\u00e9s par le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nQue l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans le mois suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, verse \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 5 000,00 $ au titre de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

La d\u00e9cision. 141\nI. Introduction [1] Dans une plainte dat\u00e9e du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2005 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), Levan Turner a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC), qui portait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque le nom d\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ADRC), a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la couleur en cours d\u2019emploi. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 une question suppl\u00e9mentaire, li\u00e9e \u00e0 une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue : l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9.\n[2] La plainte de M. Turner d\u00e9coule de la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu de deux processus de dotation concernant un emploi d\u2019inspecteur des douanes aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ADRC et de l\u2019entit\u00e9 qui l\u2019a remplac\u00e9e dans le secteur des douanes et de l\u2019immigration, l\u2019ASFC. Suivant son entrevue, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Turner ne remplissait pas les conditions requises pour une offre d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Victoria affich\u00e9e le 11 octobre 2003 (le concours Victoria 7003) et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 comme non admissible apr\u00e8s une premi\u00e8re entrevue men\u00e9e dans un autre processus, une offre d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver affich\u00e9e le 9 juin 2003 (le concours Vancouver 1002).\n[3] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte \u00e0 Victoria (C.-B.) du 17 au 21 novembre 2008 ainsi que du 19 au 22 janvier 2009, et il l\u2019a conclue par voie de conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 17 mars 2009.\n[4] Le 10 juin 2010, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la plainte de M. Turner :\n[183] Je conclus que l\u2019ASFC a fourni une explication raisonnable au fait que M. Turner ne s\u2019est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes ni dans le concours Vancouver 1002, ni dans le concours Victoria 7003. Je conclus aussi que rien dans la preuve ou dans les explications de l\u2019ASFC ne donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un pr\u00e9texte.\n[184] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que la plainte de M. Turner n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle est rejet\u00e9e.\n[5] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas fait mention d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, un point que le plaignant avait soulev\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage et son argumentation, avec les motifs de l\u2019\u00e2ge, de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale et ethnique.\nII. Le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [6] Dans un jugement unanime que le juge Mainville a rendu le 30 mai 2012, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 le jugement prononc\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et elle renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de M. Turner au Tribunal pour nouvel examen par un membre diff\u00e9rent.\n[7] Les paragraphes 3 \u00e0 11 de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale r\u00e9sument les circonstances de base qui sont pertinentes pour ce qui est d\u2019un nouvel examen de la part du Tribunal.\n[3] L\u2019appelant se d\u00e9crit comme un homme corpulent de race noire. Il travaille maintenant pour Service Canada. La plainte de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9coule de deux concours visant \u00e0 combler des postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (ADRC), remplac\u00e9e par l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature dans le cadre de chacun des deux concours, l\u2019appelant travaillait comme inspecteur des douanes saisonnier \u00e0 Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique, comme il l\u2019avait fait de 1998 \u00e0 2003. En tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes saisonnier, l\u2019appelant avait toujours re\u00e7u des examens de rendement \u00e9crits positifs de la part de ses superviseurs.\n[4] Le premier concours, affich\u00e9 par l\u2019ADRC le 9 juin 2003, visait \u00e0 combler un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Vancouver. Le deuxi\u00e8me concours, affich\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2003, visait \u00e0 combler un poste similaire \u00e0 Victoria (Victoria 7003).\n[5] En plus des crit\u00e8res habituels \u00e0 remplir, une restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e pour le concours de Vancouver, selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [l]es candidats qui ont pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne seront pas admissibles au pr\u00e9sent processus \u00bb (p. 822 du dossier d\u2019appel (DA)). L\u2019appelant n\u2019ayant pas pass\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue pour un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Vancouver, il s\u2019est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 admissible au concours et a donc pos\u00e9 sa candidature. Il a r\u00e9ussi le test d\u2019inspecteur des douanes que devaient passer tous les candidats. La phase suivante du processus de concours comportait deux entrevues. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re entrevue, qui a eu lieu le 26 avril 2004, et il a r\u00e9ussi cette \u00e9preuve. Cependant, un des membres du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue a reconnu l\u2019appelant comme ayant auparavant \u00e9chou\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de l\u2019entrevue dans le cadre d\u2019un processus de concours visant \u00e0 combler des postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Victoria. Bien que l\u2019appelant ait r\u00e9ussi l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la premi\u00e8re entrevue du concours visant \u00e0 doter le poste de Vancouver, sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement rejet\u00e9e au motif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9e.\n[6] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul candidat exclu du concours de Vancouver en raison de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Au moins un autre candidat avait \u00e9galement postul\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s pour les postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Victoria. Il y a eu un cas dans lequel la candidate avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen sur dossier de son portefeuille de comp\u00e9tences pour un poste \u00e0 Victoria et n\u2019avait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9e en entrevue pour ce poste. Cette candidate n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue du concours de Vancouver. Un autre candidat du m\u00eame nom que celui d\u2019une personne qui avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de l\u2019entrevue dans le cadre d\u2019un concours pour Victoria n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu du concours de Vancouver; toutefois, il y avait une certaine confusion quant \u00e0 son identit\u00e9.\n[7] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019appelant a eu un doute quant aux motifs de son exclusion, et il a demand\u00e9 de plus amples renseignements \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC. Il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande.\n[8] L\u2019appelant remplissait les crit\u00e8res pour le concours Victoria 7003, mais il a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de l\u2019entrevue dans le cadre de ce concours. L\u2019entrevue a eu lieu le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Le jury de s\u00e9lection du concours a jug\u00e9 l\u2019appelant inhabile au regard de deux comp\u00e9tences : a) la communication interactive efficace et b) le travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et la collaboration.\n[9] Avant ces entrevues, le superviseur de l\u2019appelant avait envoy\u00e9 un long courriel \u00e0 plusieurs membres du groupe de gestion de l\u2019ADRC exposant ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre les faiblesses de l\u2019appelant. Le courriel \u00e9tait dat\u00e9 du 4 octobre 2003; il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 environ deux mois avant l\u2019entrevue de l\u2019appelant dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7003 et un peu moins de sept mois avant son entrevue dans le cadre du concours de Vancouver. Ce courriel indiquait que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait per\u00e7u comme quelqu\u2019un qui [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9vite parfois les t\u00e2ches plus difficiles, ou qui conna\u00eet la bonne proc\u00e9dure (li\u00e9e \u00e0 la t\u00e2che difficile), mais qui demande l\u2019avis du surintendant, esp\u00e9rant que le surintendant utilisera son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et choisira la voie la plus facile. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 que d\u2019autres inspecteurs s\u2019\u00e9taient plaints du fait qu\u2019il laissait les encaissements pour les prochaines personnes plut\u00f4t que de les effectuer pendant son quart de travail \u00bb. Le courriel indiquait \u00e9galement qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab une partie de [l\u2019appelant] cherche effectivement la solution de facilit\u00e9. [\u2026] \u00bb : p. 321 et 322 du DA.\n[10] L\u2019appelant a vigoureusement contest\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans ce courriel, qui contredisaient les \u00e9valuations \u00e9crites officielles positives qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7ues de tous ses superviseurs, y compris de celui qui avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le courriel. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait le seul employ\u00e9 saisonnier \u00e0 avoir fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un tel courriel.\n[11] Compte tenu de ses ann\u00e9es de service comme inspecteur des douanes saisonnier \u00e0 Victoria, de ses \u00e9valuations d\u2019emploi positives et de son exp\u00e9rience pass\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019activit\u00e9s reli\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019application de la loi, l\u2019appelant en est venu \u00e0 croire que son exclusion du concours de Vancouver et son \u00e9chec \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de l\u2019entrevue dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7003 s\u2019expliquaient par le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s injustes au sein de l\u2019ADRC selon lesquelles il \u00e9tait un gros Noir paresseux. Il a donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission) a par la suite renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[8] L\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019arguments devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais celle\u2011ci a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait \u00e0 examiner que le \u00ab principal moyen d\u2019appel \u00bb \u2013 l\u2019argument selon lequel le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue en tant que motif de discrimination. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que cet argument \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9 (paragraphe 2).\n[9] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait remarquer que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une \u00ab d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids \u00bb (paragraphe 21), m\u00eame si ce motif avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans le formulaire de plainte et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Turner, m\u00eame s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ce motif \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises au cours de l\u2019instance et m\u00eame s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab abord\u00e9 comme un point important dans les observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal \u00bb (paragraphe 46). La Cour a conclu que \u00ab le membre du Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait compris que l\u2019appelant soulevait la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue \u00bb (paragraphe 26). Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le silence du Tribunal sur cette question \u00e9tait troublant :\n[33 Dans ce contexte, le silence absolu du Tribunal sur la question de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue est troublant. Le Tribunal a-t-il refus\u00e9 d\u2019examiner ce motif de discrimination parce qu\u2019il estimait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour le faire? Ou le Tribunal \u00e9tait-il d\u2019avis qu\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids ne constitue pas un motif de discrimination vis\u00e9 par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne? Ou encore le Tribunal a-t-il conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce motif? Dans l\u2019affirmative, pourquoi le Tribunal n\u2019a-t-il pas tenu compte des arguments de l\u2019appelant concernant l\u2019importance des motifs interreli\u00e9s ou combin\u00e9s de discrimination et les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Radek? Ou encore le Tribunal a-t-il tout simplement oubli\u00e9 d\u2019aborder ces questions? En l\u2019absence d\u2019une analyse quelconque dans les motifs du Tribunal, nous ne connaissons tout simplement pas les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 ces questions.\n[10] Compte tenu de ces diverses possibilit\u00e9s, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait remarquer que le fait que le Tribunal conclue qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner le motif de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue dans cette affaire soul\u00e8verait de \u00ab s\u00e9rieuses questions [\u2026] quant au bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une telle conclusion compte tenu de la jurisprudence m\u00eame du Tribunal \u00bb et susciterait aussi des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00ab compte tenu de la demande expresse de l\u2019appelant d\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 proposer une modification dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle conclusion \u00bb (paragraphe 34). Par ailleurs, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une conclusion sur le fait de savoir si la question de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant le Tribunal, \u00ab la conclusion [du Tribunal] selon laquelle il existait une explication non discriminatoire peut \u00eatre remise en question, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il se peut que le Tribunal ait tir\u00e9 cette conclusion dans des circonstances o\u00f9 les motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de discrimination n\u2019ont pas tous \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s convenablement \u00bb (paragraphe 47).\n[11] Si, subsidiairement, le Tribunal a conclu implicitement que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019\u00ab il n\u2019a pas expos\u00e9 les motifs pour lesquels il a tir\u00e9 cette conclusion \u00bb (paragraphe 36). Le fait de ne pas avoir trait\u00e9 comme il faut de ce motif est la raison pour laquelle la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal :\n[50] \u00c0 mon avis, la plainte de l\u2019appelant selon laquelle il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, et cette question \u00e9tait suffisamment importante pour que le Tribunal ait l\u2019obligation de statuer sur celle-ci ou d\u2019expliquer pourquoi il ne pouvait en traiter. En l\u2019absence de motifs dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ou d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse claire qui se d\u00e9gage du dossier, il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision de deviner les raisons pour lesquelles le Tribunal n\u2019a pas statu\u00e9 sur la question de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue ou quelle conclusion le Tribunal aurait tir\u00e9e s\u2019il avait abord\u00e9 la question. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la cour de r\u00e9vision a des pr\u00e9occupations raisonnables quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue qu\u2019aurait pu conna\u00eetre l\u2019instance si le Tribunal avait abord\u00e9 la question, la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devrait \u00eatre accueillie.\n[12] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019examiner la question juridique consistant \u00e0 savoir si une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids \u00e9tait un motif de distinction illicite vis\u00e9 par la LCDP, car, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9cision motiv\u00e9e de la part du Tribunal sur ce point, il s\u2019agirait l\u00e0 d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses (paragraphe 35).\n[13] Outre la mani\u00e8re dont le Tribunal avait trait\u00e9 du motif d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a port\u00e9 une attention consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l\u2019argument du plaignant concernant les motifs combin\u00e9s ou interreli\u00e9s de discrimination, dont, selon elle, le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas tenu compte (paragraphe 33, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait remarquer ce qui suit :\n[48] Dans les observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la notion de motifs combin\u00e9s ou interreli\u00e9s de discrimination, selon laquelle, pour l\u2019essentiel, lorsque des motifs multiples de discrimination sont pr\u00e9sents, leur effet combin\u00e9 peut \u00eatre plus grand que la somme de leurs effets individuels. Toujours selon la notion des motifs combin\u00e9s ou interreli\u00e9s, des analyses distinctes de chacun de ces motifs multiples minimisent ce qui, en fait, constitue de la discrimination compos\u00e9e. Lorsqu\u2019ils sont analys\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, il se peut que chacun des motifs pris individuellement ne justifie pas une conclusion de discrimination, mais lorsque les motifs sont pris ensemble, il se peut qu\u2019un tableau diff\u00e9rent s\u2019en d\u00e9gage.\n[14] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une approche multidimensionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, d\u00e9crite par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Montr\u00e9al (Ville); Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Boisbriand (Ville), 2000 CSC 27 (l\u2019arr\u00eat Boisbriand) :\n[\u2026] une approche multidimensionnelle qui tienne compte de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment socio\u2011politique du motif de discrimination, et qui mette l\u2019accent sur la dignit\u00e9 humaine, le respect et le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que sur la condition biom\u00e9dicale tout court. Ainsi que l\u2019a fait remarquer la juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 au paragraphe 77 des motifs de cet arr\u00eat : \u00ab [C]ette approche reconna\u00eet que les attitudes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de ses membres contribuent souvent \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la perception d\u2019un \u2018handicap\u2019. Ainsi, une personne peut n\u2019avoir aucune limitation dans la vie courante sauf celles qui sont cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9judice et les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes. \u00bb (paragraphe 30)\n[15] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait remarquer que l\u2019article 3.1 de la LCDP \u00ab pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire comprend notamment les actes fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite \u00bb, et elle a signal\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse du principal motif d\u2019une plainte ne doit pas faire abstraction des autres motifs ni de \u00ab l\u2019existence possible de la discrimination compos\u00e9e r\u00e9sultant de la combinaison de ces motifs \u00bb (paragraphe 49). Au paragraphe 31, elle a cit\u00e9 en y souscrivant l\u2019analyse qu\u2019a faite le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019affaire Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and Securiguard Services Ltd. (No. 3), 2005 BCHRT 302 (Radek), aux paragraphes 464 et 465 :\n[traduction]\n[464] La corr\u00e9lation qui existe entre plusieurs motifs combin\u00e9s ou interreli\u00e9s de discrimination est parfois d\u00e9sign\u00e9e le \u00ab recoupement \u00bb. La notion de recoupement a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e dans plusieurs d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes, notamment : Morrison v. Motsewetsho (2003), 48 C.H.R.R. D\/51 (T.D.P. Ont.), Comeau v. Cote, [2003] BCHRT 32, et Baylis-Flannery v. DeWilde (No. 2) (2003), 48 C.H.R.R. D\/197 (T.D.P. Ont.). Suivant la d\u00e9cision Baylis-Flannery : \u00ab L\u2019analyse du recoupement dans la discrimination est un exercice ax\u00e9 sur les faits dans le cadre duquel sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s la pertinence et les effets disparates de l\u2019existence possible d\u2019une discrimination compos\u00e9e \u00bb : au paragraphe 143. Dans cette affaire, il \u00e9tait question de harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019une femme noire, et le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que la connaissance des effets de la discrimination compos\u00e9e \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9viter :\nde s\u2019appuyer sur un mode singulier d\u2019analyse en pr\u00e9sence de motifs multiples de discrimination, lequel tend \u00e0 minimiser ou m\u00eame \u00e0 oblit\u00e9rer les effets de la discrimination raciale sur les femmes de couleur qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination pour d\u2019autres motifs, plut\u00f4t que de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019existence possible de la discrimination compos\u00e9e (au paragraphe 144).\n[465] On peut affirmer la m\u00eame chose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce relativement \u00e0 la race, la couleur, l\u2019ascendance et la d\u00e9ficience. Bien que la plainte individuelle de Mme Radek soit principalement fond\u00e9e sur sa race, sa couleur et son ascendance, l\u2019analyse de ces motifs ne doit pas faire abstraction de sa d\u00e9ficience et de l\u2019existence possible de la discrimination compos\u00e9e.\n[16] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que d\u2019autres aspects de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal posaient probl\u00e8me : le choix du Tribunal de ne pas conclure si l\u2019on avait \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de la race ou de l\u2019origine nationale et ethnique, mais plut\u00f4t de tenir pour acquis qu\u2019une telle preuve avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et d\u2019examiner si l\u2019employeur avait donn\u00e9 une explication raisonnable (paragraphes 14 et 15); il y avait aussi le fait de ne pas avoir tir\u00e9 de conclusion de fait \u00ab quant \u00e0 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des faiblesses all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de l\u2019appelant d\u00e9crites dans le courriel de son superviseur \u00bb et \u00ab quant \u00e0 savoir comment et dans quelle mesure ce courriel [avait] pu influer sur le processus de s\u00e9lection \u00bb (paragraphe 15).\n[17] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, ordonn\u00e9e en appel et rendue par le membre instructeur Wallace Gilby Craig, repose sur un examen de la totalit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix, des pi\u00e8ces pertinentes, des d\u00e9clarations pr\u00e9liminaires et des arguments (\u00e9crits et oraux) des avocats, et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, des plaidoiries que ces derniers ont faites \u00e0 Victoria, les 20 et 21 novembre 2013.\nIII. Le cadre juridique A. La preuve prima facie [18] Dans une affaire de discrimination vis\u00e9e par la LCDP, le fardeau de preuve initial oblige le plaignant \u00e0 produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dignes de foi qui \u00e9tablissent, directement ou par inf\u00e9rence, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. La norme prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CODP et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, (O\u2019Malley) :\n[28] [\u2026] [J]e suis d\u2019accord avec la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour dire que chaque cas se ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 une question de preuve et donc que, dans ces affaires comme dans toute instance civile, il doit y avoir reconnaissance et attribution claires et nettes du fardeau de la preuve. \u00c0 qui doit\u2011il incomber? Suivant la r\u00e8gle bien \u00e9tablie en mati\u00e8re civile, ce fardeau incombe au demandeur. Celui qui r\u00e9clame l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation doit la prouver. Donc, selon la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Etobicoke quant au fardeau de la preuve, savoir faire une preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire de l\u2019existence d\u2019un cas de discrimination, je ne vois aucune raison pour laquelle cela ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer dans les cas de discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Dans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire qu\u2019il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9. [\u2026]\n[19] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2005] A.C.F. no 731 [CAF] (Morris), aux paragraphes 27 et 28, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu ce qui suit :\n[27] [\u2026] [L]a d\u00e9finition juridique de la preuve prima facie n\u2019exige pas que la Commission soumette un type particulier de preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir les faits n\u00e9cessaires en vue de d\u00e9montrer que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire selon la d\u00e9finition figurant dans la Loi. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) exige uniquement que l\u2019on d\u00e9favorise une personne en cours d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite. La question de savoir si la preuve qui est fournie dans un cas donn\u00e9 est suffisante afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir que l\u2019on d\u00e9favorise une personne pour un motif de distinction illicite, si l\u2019on y ajoute foi et si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne donne pas d\u2019explications satisfaisantes, est une question mixte de fait et de droit.\n[28] Un crit\u00e8re juridique souple, en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie, permet mieux que d\u2019autres crit\u00e8res plus pr\u00e9cis de promouvoir l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sous-tendant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019\u00e9limination, dans la sph\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, de la discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi ainsi que de la discrimination en ce qui concerne la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations et d\u2019habitations. La discrimination prend des formes nouvelles et subtiles. En outre, comme l\u2019avocate de la Commission l\u2019a signal\u00e9, il est maintenant reconnu que la preuve comparative de discrimination rev\u00eat des formes beaucoup plus nombreuses que la discrimination particuli\u00e8re identifi\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes.\n[20] Une fois qu\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, il revient alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication raisonnable montrant que les pr\u00e9tentions relatives au pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 acte discriminatoire ne sont pas fond\u00e9es ou que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre non discriminatoire : Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 189; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Lambie, (1996) 124 F.T.R. 303, au paragraphe 16.\n[21] Si l\u2019on donne une explication raisonnable, le plaignant doit dans ce cas montrer qu\u2019elle n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte : Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1988] T.C.D.P. no 2, au paragraphe 38474 (Basi).\nB. La \u00ab subtile odeur \u00bb de discrimination [22] Le fait que la discrimination s\u2019exerce souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile dans un processus par ailleurs appropri\u00e9 est un point que l\u2019on a examin\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Basi :\nLa discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la couleur se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rares sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. Dans les cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019existe pas de preuves directes, il revient alors \u00e0 la Commission de conclure \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 partir de la conduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discriminatoire de la ou des personnes en cause. Ce n\u2019est pas toujours une t\u00e2che facile. Il faut analyser soigneusement la conduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discriminatoire dans le contexte dans lequel elle a pris naissance.\n[23] Dans la d\u00e9cision Basi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb impr\u00e9gnaient la fa\u00e7on dont le mis en cause avait trait\u00e9 le plaignant. Le Tribunal a conclu que la seule inf\u00e9rence que l\u2019on pouvait tirer dans les circonstances \u00e9tait que la raison pour ne pas embaucher M. Basi \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte.\nLa mani\u00e8re dont le CN a tent\u00e9 de justifier ses actes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Basi aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des droits de la personne comporte franchement de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. Je ne peux que conclure que la raison de ne pas embaucher M. Basi, comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 M. Symenuk, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas aussi transparente, directe ou raisonnable qu\u2019il l\u2019avait d\u2019abord laiss\u00e9 entendre. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les explications fournies \u00e0 la Commission et les renseignements contenus dans les dossiers du CN, j\u2019ai l\u2019impression que le mis en cause tentait de justifier les actions de M. Symenuk. Les contradictions constat\u00e9es me portent \u00e0 conclure, de mani\u00e8re non seulement hautement probable [sic] [m]ais aussi contraignante, que les explications de M. Symenuk sur son mode de s\u00e9lection et les explications ult\u00e9rieures concernant les qualifications, entre autres, sont des pr\u00e9textes.\n[24] Le Tribunal a pris en compte et suivi la d\u00e9cision Basi dans l\u2019affaire Maillet c. Canada (PG), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 6 :\n[6] La discrimination n\u2019est pas une pratique qu\u2019on devrait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 voir ouvertement. Un tribunal devrait par cons\u00e9quent examiner toutes les circonstances lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme une subtile odeur de discrimination. Dans des affaires comportant de la preuve circonstancielle, une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e lorsque la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au soutien de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination rend une telle inf\u00e9rence plus probable que le font les autres inf\u00e9rences ou hypoth\u00e8ses possibles [\u2026]\n[25] Par exemple, un acte discriminatoire peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de pair avec une mesure de dotation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi par ailleurs appropri\u00e9e. Dans de tels cas, l\u2019explication officiellement donn\u00e9e pour justifier la d\u00e9cision de ne pas embaucher une personne \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un pr\u00e9texte qui dissimule la nature discriminatoire de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019embauche. Le Tribunal applique un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets pour d\u00e9cider si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans le contexte d\u2019une embauche. Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9cisions Florence Shakes c. Rex Pak Limited, (1982) 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (Shakes) et Israeli c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique, (1983) 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 (Israeli), le plaignant doit montrer que :\n1) il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour occuper l\u2019emploi en question;\n2) il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9;\n3) une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e que lui, mais qui ne pr\u00e9sentait pas les caract\u00e9ristiques sur lesquelles ce dernier avait fond\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne, a obtenu le poste.\n[26] Ce crit\u00e8re ne s\u2019applique pas automatiquement \u00e0 toutes les affaires d\u2019embauche (voir, par exemple, la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, [2002] T.C.D.P. no 3, au paragraphe 77), mais je suis convaincu qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce il constitue un moyen utile d\u2019\u00e9valuer si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli ou non l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nC. La d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue\n[27] Dans sa plaidoirie, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident en soi que M. Turner \u00e9tait ob\u00e8se, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins capable d\u2019accomplir la totalit\u00e9 des fonctions d\u2019un inspecteur des douanes. Pourtant, malgr\u00e9 cela, les surintendants de Victoria ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e, que M. Turner \u00e9tait paresseux et ne disait pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[28] Ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si la question d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant le Tribunal. Cela soul\u00e8ve la question juridique de savoir si une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids est un motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019envisage la LCDP.\n[29] La d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite aux termes de l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019analyse qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9e la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boisbriand, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e m\u00eame en l\u2019absence d\u2019une restriction physique ou mentale concr\u00e8te des activit\u00e9s, en se fondant uniquement sur les perceptions qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au sujet des restrictions d\u2019une personne. En appliquant ce raisonnement, je conclus que le motif de la d\u00e9ficience dont il est question \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi englobe la d\u00e9ficience tant per\u00e7ue que r\u00e9elle. Il est \u00e9galement bien \u00e9tabli que le poids d\u2019une personne est une caract\u00e9ristique qui peut justifier une plainte de discrimination pour cause de d\u00e9ficience : Bouchard c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [1990] D.T. 12\/90 (TCDP); Hamlyn v. Cominco Ltd., [1989] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 29. L\u2019effet conjugu\u00e9 de ces principes est que, selon moi, une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue li\u00e9e au poids est un motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019envisage la LCDP.\n[30] Je conclus \u00e9galement que ce motif de distinction est port\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant le Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans la plainte que M. Turner a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission ainsi que dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Tribunal, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9 dans les observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019appelant au Tribunal et qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question \u00e0 maintes reprises dans les plaidoiries.\nD. Le recoupement [31] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019article 3.1 de la Loi dispose express\u00e9ment qu\u2019\u00ab il est entendu que les actes discriminatoires comprennent les actes fond\u00e9s sur un ou plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite ou l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de plusieurs motifs \u00bb. \u00c0 mon avis, cette disposition refl\u00e8te une pr\u00e9occupation semblable \u00e0 celle dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans la d\u00e9cision Radek, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au sujet de la notion de recoupement : les tribunaux administratifs devraient \u00eatre conscients de [traduction] \u00ab [l]a corr\u00e9lation qui existe entre plusieurs motifs combin\u00e9s ou interreli\u00e9s de discrimination \u00bb (Radek, au paragraphe 464). Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019analyse du motif principal d\u2019une plainte ne doit pas faire abstraction des autres motifs qui y sont soulev\u00e9s, ni de \u00ab l\u2019existence possible de la discrimination compos\u00e9e r\u00e9sultant de la combinaison de ces motifs \u00bb (paragraphe 49).\nE. Le racisme et le st\u00e9r\u00e9otypage au Canada [32] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a fait valoir que le racisme et le st\u00e9r\u00e9otypage sont des facteurs pertinents pour ce qui est d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 des processus d\u2019embauche qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il a cit\u00e9, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, la d\u00e9cision Sinclair c. London (City), 2008 HRTO 48 (Sinclair), ainsi que l\u2019acceptation par l\u2019arbitre, au paragraphe 18, du fait que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] le racisme anti-Noir et ses manifestations subtiles sont bien reconnues dans le droit canadien, et les preuves d\u2019expert du genre de celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien qu\u2019elles soient utiles, ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour que le Tribunal en consid\u00e8re les effets [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[33] Dans la d\u00e9cision Sinclair, l\u2019arbitre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Spence, 2005 CSC 71, aux paragraphes 31 \u00e0 33, ainsi que sur le fait que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada avait souscrit aux conclusions de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Parks, (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 :\n[31] Dans l\u2019affaire Parks, un Noir \u00e9tait accus\u00e9 du meurtre au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 d\u2019un Blanc. Comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, rien n\u2019indiquait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un crime raciste ou que la race jouerait un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9fense (p. 361). Le juge Doherty a n\u00e9anmoins conclu \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e racisme, en particulier le racisme anti\u2011Noirs, est partie int\u00e9grante de la mentalit\u00e9 de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb (p. 369). Il a ajout\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Une couche importante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 professe ouvertement des vues racistes. Une couche plus large encore est inconsciemment influenc\u00e9e par des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux n\u00e9gatifs. De surcro\u00eet, nos institutions, y compris la justice p\u00e9nale, refl\u00e8tent ces st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u00e9gatifs qu\u2019elles perp\u00e9tuent. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments se conjuguent pour propager le fl\u00e9au du racisme dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re. Les Noirs sont parmi les principales victimes de ce fl\u00e9au.

Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve A. La d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire du plaignant [35] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal, l\u2019avocat du plaignant, Me Yazbeck, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Turner avait travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019ADRC comme employ\u00e9 saisonnier \u00e0 Victoria (C.-B.), de 1998 \u00e0 2003. Il a qualifi\u00e9 le r\u00e9gime d\u2019embauche que l\u2019on appliquait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de processus concurrentiel dans le cadre duquel on \u00e9tablissait des listes d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de toutes les personnes qualifi\u00e9es, class\u00e9es par ordre de m\u00e9rite, lequel processus avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 en 1999 par le m\u00e9canisme actuel, qui cr\u00e9e des r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 partir desquels les gestionnaires de l\u2019ASFC (autrefois partie de l\u2019ADRC) peuvent d\u00e9cider de mani\u00e8re discr\u00e9tionnaire quels candidats embaucher.\n[36] Pour aider le Tribunal, l\u2019avocat a fait un survol du dossier du plaignant :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Mais l\u2019essentiel, pour le moment, est que M. Turner exer\u00e7ait les fonctions li\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste. Il conna\u00eet le travail, il est qualifi\u00e9. Et vous entendrez des t\u00e9moignages, et verrez des \u00e9valuations de son rendement faites durant toute cette p\u00e9riode, qui montrent que son rendement \u00e9tait bon. Il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 d\u00e9vou\u00e9, bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9, un travailleur assidu, plein de ressources, et ainsi de suite.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 16, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 17, lignes 1 \u00e0 4.\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9, malheureusement pour moi, je puis invoquer une preuve irr\u00e9futable et dire : il s\u2019agit d\u2019un cas type de discrimination. Comme vous le savez, nous sommes ici \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019odeurs subtiles.\nEt ce qui est arriv\u00e9, c\u2019est que l\u2019on a un employ\u00e9 qui travaille bien, qui a un bon rendement. Mais quand vient le temps d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit dans les r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s en [\u2026] 2003 et ensuite en 2004, ce qui lui permettrait peut\u2011\u00eatre d\u2019avoir un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, un emploi s\u00fbr et de longue dur\u00e9e, quelque chose se produit. Tout \u00e0 coup, voil\u00e0 qu\u2019on d\u00e9termine qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e8de pas les qualit\u00e9s requises.\nEt, ceci \u00e9tant dit avec \u00e9gards pour le Tribunal, je vous demanderai de vous poser la question, de vous poser cette question : pourquoi? Pourquoi est-ce arriv\u00e9? Pourquoi un employ\u00e9, qui avait un bon rendement, qui n\u2019avait pas de lacunes sur le plan du rendement, pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 n\u2019est-il, tout \u00e0 coup, plus qualifi\u00e9?\nLe plaignant, Monsieur, s\u2019appelle Levan Turner. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un homme noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, et il est d\u2019avis que ces facteurs, de m\u00eame que sa taille, sont les raisons pour lesquelles on lui a refus\u00e9 cet emploi.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 17, lignes 6 \u00e0 25; page 18, lignes 1 \u00e0 3.\n[37] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur la pi\u00e8ce C\u20112 (le recueil de documents du plaignant, volume 2, onglet 33), qui est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent pour le processus qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi \u00e0 Victoria :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u00e9change de courriels entre M. Klassen, qui \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer les capacit\u00e9s de M. Turner, son rendement [\u2026] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un courriel adress\u00e9 \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, comme une note au dossier.\nEt ensuite, ce qu\u2019il a fait, c\u2019est envoyer une copie du courriel aux autres personnes que vous verrez \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ici. Un grand nombre de ces personnes \u00e9taient des gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs, et leurs noms seront mentionn\u00e9s lors de la pr\u00e9sente audience comme des personnes qui ont pris part aux processus de s\u00e9lection auxquels nous avons affaire.\nCe qui est important, M. Sinclair, c\u2019est d\u2019examiner certaines des choses que dit cet homme, M. Klassen, \u00e0 propos de M. Turner [\u2026]\nSi vous jetez un coup d\u2019\u0153il au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe [\u2026] On commence \u00e0 y parler de la fa\u00e7on dont il est per\u00e7u. Du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019abstient parfois d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches les plus difficiles, ou qu\u2019il conna\u00eet la bonne proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, mais demande conseil au surintendant.\nVous constaterez plus loin que le propre compte rendu de M. Klassen au sujet de cette discussion est que M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 stup\u00e9fait d\u2019apprendre cela, mais n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 une position d\u00e9fensive.\nParagraphe suivant [\u2026] \u00ab J\u2019ai ensuite expliqu\u00e9 que cette perception existait depuis quelques \u00e9t\u00e9s et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une chose qu\u2019il devrait am\u00e9liorer l\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine. \u00bb L\u00e0 encore, une perception. Et, ensuite, \u00e0 la fin du paragraphe, \u00e0 la phrase suivante : \u00ab Je lui ai rappel\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est pas ainsi qu\u2019on le per\u00e7oit tout le temps. \u00bb\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 19, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 20, ligne 1\n[\u2026] Quelle est cette perception? Quelle est cette image? Et, en fin de compte, je crois que ce que vous allez conclure, Monsieur, c\u2019est qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la perception d\u2019un homme d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr de race noire qui est corpulent. Vous constaterez \u00e9galement \u00e0 la lecture du formulaire de plainte que la taille de M. Turner est \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9e comme motif.\nC\u2019est donc dire que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des processus de dotation est fort douteuse. Et si vous avez un processus comme celui-ci, et vous entendrez dire \u00e0 quel point il \u00e9tait d\u00e9ficient \u2013 si vous avez un processus qui peut aussi facilement ne pas respecter certaines des r\u00e8gles de base qui r\u00e9gissent la dotation en personnel dans la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il n\u2019est pas surprenant que ce processus permette d\u2019exclure quelqu\u2019un parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un employ\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, noir et corpulent. Ce n\u2019est pas un syst\u00e8me rigoureux que l\u2019Agence applique.\n[\u2026] Et, comme vous le savez, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence du Tribunal ainsi que celle de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans ces circonstances, il y aura pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une preuve, une preuve prima facie de discrimination qui n\u2019aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9fut\u00e9e.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Quelle est la preuve prima facie que vous soulevez?\nMe Yazbek : La preuve prima facie, Monsieur, est que nous avons ici un employ\u00e9 qui a clairement pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste, qui \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour ce dernier, qu\u2019on a priv\u00e9 du ou des postes en question, mais qu\u2019on a priv\u00e9 de ces postes pour des raisons qui sont des pr\u00e9textes. Et la preuve prima facie est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune explication autre que la race ou l\u2019\u00e2ge de l\u2019employ\u00e9, ou sa d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire son poids.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 29, lignes 1 \u00e0 15\nB. La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [38] Apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire du plaignant, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est content\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre avant que le surintendant Ronald Paul Tarnawski commence \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. \u00c0 ce moment, le pr\u00e9sident a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e si le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tarnawski se limiterait \u00e0 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au concours Vancouver 1002.\n[traduction]\nMe Stark : Oui [\u2026] il y a quelques renseignements de base essentiels qui, selon moi, seront utiles pour expliquer le contexte et la mani\u00e8re dont ces concours sont con\u00e7us. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la section du recrutement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque environ \u2013 avant ces concours, disons. Et une bonne partie de l\u2019uniformisation et des comp\u00e9tences dont nous avons trait\u00e9, il est en mesure de les expliquer et de dire ce qui les justifie.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Pourquoi est-ce pertinent? \u00c0 ce stade, compte tenu de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que nous avons entendus, s\u2019agira-t-il d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments utiles? Je suis s\u00fbr que vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 votre argumentation \u00e0 ce stade-ci. S\u2019agit-il d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve utiles?\nMe Stark : Eh bien, voici ce que je dirais : ce qui est en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est un point int\u00e9ressant, en ce sens que ces deux processus de s\u00e9lection sont \u2013 essentiellement, ils sont semblables \u00e0 ceux de n\u2019importe quel autre office f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le plan de la s\u00e9lection et pour ce qui est de savoir si les candidats sont qualifi\u00e9s par rapport aux comp\u00e9tences exig\u00e9es.\n[\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : [\u2026] si j\u2019ai bien compris, la question en litige va \u00eatre de nature circonstancielle parce que personne n\u2019a dit que M. Turner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible au processus de Victoria parce qu\u2019il est noir, parce qu\u2019il a une d\u00e9ficience ou \u00e0 cause de son \u00e2ge. Il faut donc que l\u2019on tire de la preuve une inf\u00e9rence quelconque, c\u2019est bien cela?\nMe Stark : Oui.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Maintenant, il y a le processus de Vancouver pour lequel il s\u2019est qualifi\u00e9, sauf qu\u2019ils ont appris plus tard, par erreur, qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait m\u00eame pas d\u00fb y participer parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible, selon leur interpr\u00e9tation des restrictions.\nMe Stark : Je crois qu\u2019il faut faire attention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard par contre parce que le processus de Vancouver \u2013 l\u00e0 encore, je paraphrase ce que le t\u00e9moin dira au tribunal \u2013, mais le processus de Vancouver, contrairement \u00e0 celui de Victoria, \u00e9tait un processus en deux \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re entrevue ne portait que sur la CIE, la communication interactive efficace. Et comme l\u2019indique la feuille ma\u00eetresse, M. Turner a obtenu la simple note de passage de 70 %.\nVous vous souviendrez probablement du t\u00e9moignage de M. Turner, soit qu\u2019au cours de cette entrevue, on lui a pos\u00e9 des questions sur la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. \u00c0 la suite de la discussion qui a eu lieu au cours de cette premi\u00e8re entrevue, des v\u00e9rifications ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et on a d\u00e9couvert qu\u2019en fait il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 sans succ\u00e8s dans d\u2019autres processus depuis le 1er janvier 2002.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, quelle est la question en litige selon vous? [\u2026] S\u2019agit-il du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le processus de Vancouver?\nMe Stark : C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et la raison pour laquelle il n\u2019a pas [\u2026] d\u2019apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages que j\u2019ai entendus, je n\u2019ai pas entendu M. Tarnawski, est qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 cause de la restriction [\u2026]\nMe Stark : C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et, selon moi, la question en litige consiste \u00e0 savoir si cette restriction \u2013 qui, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, ne semblait pas l\u2019exclure, et il ne pensait pas qu\u2019il \u00e9tait exclu \u2013 a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente. Et il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la question qui a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ou interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement.\nMais il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un point que le tribunal peut r\u00e9gler. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019on l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner \u00e0 titre de subterfuge de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ne puisse pas obtenir le poste parce qu\u2019il est noir, qu\u2019il a une d\u00e9ficience ou qu\u2019il est trop \u00e2g\u00e9.\nMe Stark : Il faut qu\u2019il y ait un pr\u00e9texte.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Oui.\nMe Stark : Un pr\u00e9texte que l\u2019on peut prouver.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 111, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 112, lignes 2, 3 et 17 \u00e0 25; page 113, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 114; lignes 1 \u00e0 12.\nC. Le t\u00e9moin Christopher James Hughes [39] M. Hughes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des efforts qu\u2019il a faits pour retrouver du travail aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002, affich\u00e9 le 9 juin 2003, et dans celui du concours Victoria 7003, affich\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2003. \u00c0 titre de premier t\u00e9moin dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, M. Hughes a parl\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise du traitement des demandes qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour les deux offres d\u2019emploi; il a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 de questions qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, constituaient de la manipulation de concours de la part de la direction.\n[40] En 1995, M. Hughes \u00e9tait au service de Revenu Canada \u00e0 Victoria (C.-B.), \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de recouvrement. Tout d\u2019abord employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il a acquis le statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e en 1996. En mars 2001, il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, et, en 2002, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes saisonnier (de mai \u00e0 octobre), ce qui lui a permis de continuer \u00e0 travailler l\u2019hiver \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de services aux entreprises aupr\u00e8s de Revenu Canada. M. Hughes a soutenu que l\u2019on avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi le 30 septembre 2004, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019une d\u00e9pression qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait de travailler.\n[41] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de son travail d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, il avait appris \u00e0 bien conna\u00eetre un coll\u00e8gue inspecteur, le plaignant Levan Turner. M. Hughes a expliqu\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient les fonctions des inspecteurs des douanes \u00e0 Victoria :\n[traduction]\nNous \u00e9tions affect\u00e9s au secteur maritime, et nous travaillions donc \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur. Nos fonctions consistaient \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier des gens, des v\u00e9hicules et des bateaux, tout ce qui arrivait \u00e0 Victoria. Les navires de croisi\u00e8re aussi. Donc, le Clipper qui arrivait de Seattle, le Coho qui arrivait de Port Angeles, ainsi que tous les passagers et tous les v\u00e9hicules qui en descendaient. Il y avait aussi le terminal pour navires de croisi\u00e8re se trouvant \u00e0 Ogden Point.\nEt nous \u00e9tions affect\u00e9s soit \u00e0 la ligne primaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la premi\u00e8re personne que l\u2019on voit lorsqu\u2019on se pr\u00e9sente aux douanes et qui pose les premi\u00e8res questions. Et ensuite nous \u00e9tions affect\u00e9s par roulement \u00e0 la ligne secondaire, celle o\u00f9 l\u2019on fouille davantage les personnes, comme une fouille \u00e0 nu, ou leurs bagages, et c\u2019est \u00e0 cet endroit qu\u2019ont lieu les arrestations et les saisies de drogue.\nEt nous travaillions aussi par roulement comme agent de caisse. S\u2019il y avait quelqu\u2019un qui avait des droits ou des taxes \u00e0 payer, nous nous occupions de la caisse. Et, \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le aussi, nous nous occupions du d\u00e9douanement des hydravions qui arrivaient de Seattle. Il s\u2019agissait donc d\u2019emplois tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s, qui comportaient de nombreuses fonctions.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 33, lignes 2 \u00e0 23\n[42] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

Bien des blagues au sujet des Am\u00e9ricains ob\u00e8ses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en sa pr\u00e9sence.\nEt bien des agents des douanes plus jeunes et en forme m\u2019ont taquin\u00e9.

Et j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert que presque chacun des \u00e9tudiants avec lesquels j\u2019avais travaill\u00e9 en 2002, en 2003 et en 2004 qui voulaient devenir des employ\u00e9s permanents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s par l\u2019ASFC en 2004, en 2005 et en 2006.\nEt, selon moi, il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019on embauche de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence des jeunes, soit dans le cadre des processus de s\u00e9lection, soit dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime de transition des \u00e9tudiants.\nEt le programme pour \u00e9tudiants lui-m\u00eame est surutilis\u00e9. Plus de 50 % des employ\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 sont des \u00e9tudiants. Et on ne voit \u00e7a nulle part ailleurs au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 j\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, il y avait peut\u2011\u00eatre un ou deux \u00e9tudiants au sein d\u2019un service qui comptait une centaine d\u2019employ\u00e9s.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 36, ligne 25, page 37, lignes 1 \u00e0 14.\n[44] Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 de relater l\u2019exp\u00e9rience directe qu\u2019il avait eue avec M. Turner, M. Hughes a dit du plaignant qu\u2019il avait une attitude professionnelle et l\u2019esprit d\u2019\u00e9quipe.\n[traduction]\nJe l\u2019ai vu prendre part \u00e0 de nombreuses mesures d\u2019application de la loi. Il y avait une personne que j\u2019avais orient\u00e9e vers la ligne secondaire et c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui avait saisi la marijuana. Je l\u2019ai vu prendre part \u00e0 une arrestation \u2013 une personne qui faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019un mandat non ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 \u2013 avec Terry Klassen. Je sais qu\u2019il s\u2019est servi du dispositif de d\u00e9tection de preuve en vue d\u2019intercepter des conducteurs soup\u00e7onn\u00e9s d\u2019\u00eatre en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEt, dans toutes les activit\u00e9s de formation que nous avons suivies, il \u00e9tait l\u2019un des meilleurs apprenants et il comprenait bien les renseignements. Et je ne crois pas, jamais je n\u2019ai entendu parler d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui pour ses interactions avec le public voyageur.\nEt, \u00e0 ma connaissance, il \u00e9tait toujours ponctuel et prenait des pauses-repas qui convenaient aux gestionnaires. Je ne l\u2019ai pas vu faire un usage abusif du temps dont il disposait.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 38, lignes 23 \u00e0 25, page 39, lignes 1 \u00e0 12.\nLe courriel de M. Klassen [45] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hughes de parler de l\u2019onglet 33, un courriel transmis par le surintendant int\u00e9rimaire M. Klassen \u00e0 d\u2019autres surintendants, qui exposait en d\u00e9tail leur impression que M. Turner \u00e9tait une personne que le travail rebutait.\n[traduction]\nQ. M. Hughes, \u00e9tiez-vous pr\u00e9sent dans la salle quand j\u2019ai fait ma d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9liminaire?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Oui. Et j\u2019ai cit\u00e9 un extrait d\u2019un courriel que M. Klassen avait \u00e9crit et dans lequel il faisait \u00e9tat d\u2019une certaine perception de M. Turner. \u00cates-vous personnellement au courant d\u2019une perception de ce genre?\nR. Tous ceux qui travaillaient avec lui savaient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un bon travailleur. Les gens qui ne travaillaient pas avec lui avaient le sentiment qu\u2019il \u00e9tait paresseux et que, en raison de sa taille, il ne pouvait pas faire ce travail. [\u2026]\nR. Oui, je peux en donner un exemple. Lorsqu\u2019on exerce les fonctions d\u2019agent de caisse pendant le quart de nuit, s\u2019il s\u2019agit de plus qu\u2019un certain montant d\u2019argent, on est cens\u00e9 payer en argent comptant. Par contre, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez d\u2019argent pour constituer un fonds de caisse appropri\u00e9, on ne paie pas en argent comptant.\nJe me souviens que les gens du quart de jour se sont plaints \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises que Levan Turner ne payait pas en argent comptant. Cependant, il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire pour constituer un fonds de caisse appropri\u00e9. Et c\u2019est ce qui a probablement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 certaines des perceptions erron\u00e9es.\nEt je sais pertinemment que l\u2019\u00e9quipe de jour s\u2019en est plainte \u00e0 Terry Klassen. Il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises que moi non plus je ne paie pas en argent comptant, mais on ne m\u2019a jamais pos\u00e9 de questions \u00e0 ce sujet.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 39, lignes 13 \u00e0 24; page 40, lignes 11 \u00e0 24.\nLe concours Vancouver 1002 \u2013 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 [46] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a soumis \u00e0 M. Hughes la question de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui figurait dans l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi relatif au concours Vancouver 1002 et il lui a demand\u00e9 comment il l\u2019interpr\u00e9tait et s\u2019il en avait parl\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s.\n[traduction]\nQ. Et ensuite \u2013 il y a une phrase en caract\u00e8res gras au milieu du paragraphe : \u00ab Les candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours. \u00bb Avez-vous remarqu\u00e9 cette phrase lorsque vous avez vu ce paragraphe pour la premi\u00e8re fois?\nR. Oui. Tous les candidats qui se trouvaient \u00e0 Victoria en ont parl\u00e9. Cela concernait le concours de Vancouver. [\u2026] On nous avait inform\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avance, par voie interne, que ce concours serait lanc\u00e9. Tous l\u2019ont donc remarqu\u00e9 le premier jour ou le lendemain. Et il en a beaucoup \u00e9t\u00e9 question parmi les gens du bureau.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 45, lignes 7 \u00e0 15.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Que voulait donc dire, selon vous, cette restriction?\nR. Selon moi, elle voulait dire que, si l\u2019on avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande depuis le 1er janvier 2002 en vue d\u2019un concours \u00e0 Vancouver, on ne pouvait pas en pr\u00e9senter une autre. Et c\u2019est habituellement ce qui \u00e9tait fait dans le pass\u00e9; on mettait l\u2019accent sur l\u2019emplacement. Et cela a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 fait plus tard.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : De quoi vous pr\u00e9occupiez-vous donc?\nR. Je me pr\u00e9occupais du fait que la port\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9finition serait \u00e9largie de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober n\u2019importe quel concours, tenu n\u2019importe o\u00f9 au Canada, pour les postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes. C\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour exclure Levan, mais moi aussi j\u2019aurais d\u00fb \u00eatre exclu, et cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : [\u2026] autrement dit, votre inqui\u00e9tude \u00e9tait que, si vous aviez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 votre candidature pour un poste, un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102, pas seulement \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport de Vancouver, mais n\u2019importe o\u00f9 au Canada, vous n\u2019auriez pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible?\nR. C\u2019est \u2013 oui, c\u2019est exact. Parce que c\u2019est ambigu.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 49, lignes 2 \u00e0 22.\n[47] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le concours Vancouver 1002 et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9, qu\u2019il avait rempli un portefeuille de comp\u00e9tences qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 et accept\u00e9, et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait aussi pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 Victoria en vue d\u2019un emploi offert dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7003 et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2003 pour un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102. Le pr\u00e9sident lui a ensuite demand\u00e9 s\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 du fait que la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 que comportait le concours de Vancouver pouvait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 lui :\n[traduction]\nR. : Oui, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises, et en f\u00e9vrier 2003 aussi. C\u2019\u00e9tait en fait avant que l\u2019on affiche cet avis. Il s\u2019agit donc de l\u2019entrevue qui aurait pu m\u2019exclure.\nQ. (L\u2019avocat du plaignant) Vous avez donc pos\u00e9 votre candidature \u2013 pour ce concours, ce processus de s\u00e9lection?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Et qu\u2019est-il arriv\u00e9 de votre demande?\nR. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 et j\u2019ai rempli le portefeuille \u00e9crit. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 cette \u00e9tape avec succ\u00e8s et on m\u2019a convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue.\nQ. \u00c0 un point quelconque, au moment de votre pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection ou au moment de votre convocation \u00e0 une entrevue ou m\u00eame au cours de l\u2019entrevue, avez\u2011vous pris part \u00e0 une entrevue?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Deux entrevues.\nQ. Est-ce que \u2013 vous a\u2011t\u2011on demand\u00e9 si vous aviez \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 pour un autre poste PM\u201102 depuis le 1er janvier 2002?\nR. On ne m\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 si j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 depuis janvier 2002. Mais il ressortait clairement de mon CV que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 50, lignes 10 \u00e0 13 et 21 \u00e0 24; page 51, lignes 1 \u00e0 7.\n[48] La pi\u00e8ce \u00ab Onglet 28 \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 M.

Hughes avait vu ce document et on lui a demand\u00e9 quels renseignements il en avait tir\u00e9.\n[traduction]\nR. Je devais m\u2019assurer que mon CV portait sur les facteurs li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Je devais m\u2019assurer que je traitais de l\u2019exigence relative aux \u00e9tudes. Et ce document devait aussi [\u2026] il montre les crit\u00e8res de placement.\nQ. Et pouvez\u2011vous tout simplement me donner une explication concernant la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un examen d\u2019inspecteur des douanes qui est faite au bas de la premi\u00e8re page de ce document, au bas de la page 224?\nR. Oui, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 cet examen en 1997.\nQ. Cela \u2013 pouvez\u2011vous me dire bri\u00e8vement de quoi il s\u2019agissait?\nR. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un examen de quatre heures et demie, l\u2019un des plus difficiles que j\u2019ai eu \u00e0 subir. Et cet examen v\u00e9rifie votre aptitude \u00e0 analyser et \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, votre aptitude \u00e0 vous souvenir de choses. Il y a quelques communications \u00e9crites, quelques calculs. Et il est con\u00e7u pour voir si vous \u00eates un bon \u2013 si vous avez ce qu\u2019il faut pour \u00eatre un bon agent des douanes.\nQ. Maintenant, vous l\u2019avez pass\u00e9 en 1997. Avez-vous d\u00fb le reprendre?\nR. Non, il suffit d\u2019obtenir une note de passage et on peut s\u2019en servir pendant un temps ind\u00e9fini.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 52, lignes 13 \u00e0 25; page 53, lignes 1 \u00e0 11.\n[49] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002, la premi\u00e8re fois en avril 2004 par M. Tarnawski et Holly Freeland, et ensuite en mai 2004 par M. Tarnawski, Mark Northcote et Karen Warren.\n[50] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hughes si, lors des deux entrevues concernant le concours de Vancouver, on lui avait pos\u00e9 des questions sur des faits qu\u2019il avait mentionn\u00e9s dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite au portefeuille de comp\u00e9tences, et pourquoi il pensait que ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9crites d\u00e9montraient sa comp\u00e9tence.\n[traduction]\nR. Dans les deux, le jury en choisissait un ou deux et ne parlait que d\u2019un ou deux, peut\u2011\u00eatre trois, tout au plus. Et il a fallu que je d\u00e9veloppe ce que j\u2019avais \u00e9crit et que j\u2019essaie de me souvenir de plus d\u2019informations. Et parfois, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 57, lignes 2 \u00e0 6.\n[51] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a ensuite orient\u00e9 M.

Hughes a reconnu l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que celui-ci ne comportait aucune restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, qu\u2019il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature, qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u le portefeuille \u00e9crit de comp\u00e9tences avant de recevoir celui qui s\u2019appliquait au concours Vancouver 1002, qu\u2019il avait pass\u00e9 l\u2019examen \u00e9crit et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue qui a eu lieu le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2003; M. Hughes a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 dans le cadre du concours de Victoria avant de l\u2019\u00eatre dans le cadre du concours de Vancouver.\n[traduction]\nQ. Et, au cours de l\u2019entrevue du 16, que s\u2019est-il pass\u00e9? Comme vous l\u2019avez mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, que vous demandiez toujours ce pourquoi on vous \u00e9valuait ou on vous notait, que s\u2019est\u2011il pass\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0?\nR. Eh bien, une partie de \u2013 dans ce processus de s\u00e9lection, j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert en fait que ma r\u00e9troaction, la fa\u00e7on dont elle \u00e9tait not\u00e9e. Mais c\u2019est s\u00fbr que la communication orale \u00e9tait not\u00e9e, et je crois que deux ou trois comp\u00e9tences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies pour en parler afin que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de mes communications puisse \u00eatre not\u00e9e.\nEt, quand j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 de ma r\u00e9troaction, on m\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 que l\u2019entrevue aussi \u2013 si on vous invite \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, vous avez r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 toutes les comp\u00e9tences d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 l\u2019examen \u00e9crit et il est simplement question d\u2019obtenir une note entre 70 et 100 % pour les autres comp\u00e9tences s\u2019il est possible de fournir plus de d\u00e9tails.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 60, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 6, lignes 1 \u00e0 10.\n[traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] Que vouliez\u2011vous dire en disant que vous aviez r\u00e9ussi? Pouvez-vous simplement le confirmer de nouveau?\nR. Eh bien, dans le portefeuille \u00e9crit lui\u2011m\u00eame, il est dit que \u2013 si vous ne r\u00e9pondez pas \u00e0 l\u2019exigence minimum, qui est de 70 %, votre portefeuille est exclu et vous avez \u00e9chou\u00e9. Il faut donc obtenir au moins 70 % \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque comp\u00e9tence pour \u00eatre simplement invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue. Et il faut que cela soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 lors de l\u2019examen \u00e9crit, dans le portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 61, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 62, lignes 1 \u00e0 2.\n[52] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a renvoy\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab Onglet 43 \u00bb (volume 2).\n[traduction]\nQ. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une chose qui concerne M. Turner. Mais cela indique que, lors d\u2019une entrevue, il n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 deux des comp\u00e9tences ici; comprenez\u2011vous? Et vous verrez qu\u2019il y a deux personnes du nom de Mme Pringle et M. Baird qui ont pris part \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue?\nR. Non, ce n\u2019est pas le cas. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont on m\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 le fonctionnement de ce concours, la seule comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 laquelle il aurait pu \u00e9chouer est la communication interactive efficace, car il aurait obtenu une note minimum de 70 avant de passer l\u2019entrevue. Et, on n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 d\u2019une question de travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe ou de collaboration qui \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle dont il \u00e9tait question dans le portefeuille \u00e9crit, et c\u2019\u00e9tait exactement la m\u00eame chose.\n[\u2026] R. Parce qu\u2019avant l\u2019entrevue, chacun avait obtenu au moins une note de 70 % \u00e0 l\u2019examen \u00e9crit. Et cela m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 par Trevor Baird, le pr\u00e9sident du jury, lors de ma s\u00e9ance de r\u00e9troaction.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Cela veut\u2011il dire que la communication interactive efficace n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019une des sept comp\u00e9tences?\nR. Non. Parce que la communication \u00e9crite \u00e9tait exclue; il s\u2019agissait strictement de la communication orale.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, vous dites que le travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et la collaboration \u00e9taient une comp\u00e9tence \u00e9crite?\nR. Oui, c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et, pour \u2013 vous deviez obtenir au moins 70 % pour les sept comp\u00e9tences?\nR. Pour \u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Oui.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : L\u2019entrevue. Donc, ce que vous dites [\u2026] c\u2019est que, si le r\u00e9sultat est de 40, vous \u00eates d\u2019avis qu\u2019une fois que vous obteniez 70, il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019obtenir un chiffre inf\u00e9rieur?\nR. Exact. Parce qu\u2019on m\u2019a parl\u00e9 du portefeuille lui\u2011m\u00eame, on ne m\u2019a pas dit : donnez\u2011nous un exemple diff\u00e9rent de travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe; on m\u2019a dit : tr\u00e8s bien, jetez un coup d\u2019\u0153il \u00e0 votre pr\u00e9sentation \u00e9crite et parlez\u2011nous en.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : La seule possibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait donc d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat sup\u00e9rieur?\nR.

Et nous produirons quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la nature de ces mesures correctives.

Et il y a \u2013 ce que je ferai valoir, c\u2019est qu\u2019il r\u00e8gne une grande confusion au sein des Ressources humaines quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de composer avec le changement dans la l\u00e9gislation applicable. [\u2026] Je ne tiens pas \u00e0 d\u00e9battre de nouveau des questions dont l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission de la fonction publique \u00e9tait saisi; les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s sont admises.

Et, M. le pr\u00e9sident, j\u2019attire seulement votre attention sur la page 612, paragraphe 95. Il y est question de ce dont le t\u00e9moin vient tout juste de parler \u00e9galement, les d\u00e9finitions du professionnalisme et de l\u2019application de la loi, qui ne sont pas \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le portefeuille de comp\u00e9tences ou la trousse d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Et il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 que les candidats n\u2019avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re dont on \u00e9valuerait ces qualifications quand ils avaient re\u00e7u leurs portefeuilles de comp\u00e9tences, et les membres du jury de s\u00e9lection n\u2019avaient pas en main les d\u00e9finitions de ces deux qualifications lorsqu\u2019ils ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 les candidats.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous dites donc qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 des deux \u2013 de deux des comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles on vous a \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 votre seconde entrevue, mais que cela avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 Victoria?\nM.

Je n\u2019ai donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment \u00e9valu\u00e9 au chapitre du professionnalisme et de l\u2019application de la loi. Je demandais donc de refaire cette partie du concours de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que je puisse vraiment \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 sur les comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles on \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 m\u2019\u00e9valuer.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Quelles sont les trois comp\u00e9tences qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9es?\nR.

Et ces trois-l\u00e0 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas inscrites dans l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi. Et on a essay\u00e9 de me dire que c\u2019\u00e9tait la m\u00eame chose que le professionnalisme et l\u2019application de la loi.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Quand vous a-t-on \u00e9valu\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 ces trois comp\u00e9tences?\nR.

[\u2026] Sur l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi on disait qu\u2019on \u00e9valuerait le professionnalisme et l\u2019application de la loi.\n[55] M. Hughes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re entrevue qu\u2019il avait pass\u00e9e dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 de vive voix relativement \u00e0 la communication efficace, mais que, par la suite, \u00e0 la seconde entrevue, dans laquelle il devait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par rapport au professionnalisme et \u00e0 l\u2019application de la loi, on lui avait pos\u00e9 des questions sur le traitement des situations difficiles, la prise de d\u00e9cisions et la confiance en soi, et que, malgr\u00e9 cela, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 pour le professionnalisme et l\u2019application de la loi. Quand le pr\u00e9sident lui a demand\u00e9 comment il savait que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, M.

Mais, quand j\u2019ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 \u00e0 quoi cela correspondait, cela correspondait au traitement des situations difficiles et \u00e0 la confiance en soi. Le professionnalisme ou l\u2019orientation en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application de la loi n\u2019ont donc jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s, mais on a tent\u00e9 de dire que cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 99, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 100, lignes 1 \u00e0 10; page 101, lignes 1 \u00e0 11 et 22 \u00e0 25.\nLe contexte des listes d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et des r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s [56] Le pr\u00e9sident a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hughes d\u2019expliquer si l\u2019ADRC s\u2019\u00e9tait servie de r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019ADRC l\u2019avait fait, mais qu\u2019il y avait eu des changements quand l\u2019Agence \u00e9tait devenue assujettie \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : J\u2019ai donc lu quelque chose au sujet de M. Turner et de la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e durer quelques ann\u00e9es; elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit sur cette liste, mais son nom en a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9. Y a-t-il donc quelque chose \u00e0 propos de la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, ou parlons-nous seulement du r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s? Ou le savez-vous?\nR. Je croyais avoir situ\u00e9 le contexte de la plainte, que M. Turner avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et, ensuite, dans un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s en 2000 et que, entre 2000 et 2003, on aurait pu l\u2019embaucher sans concours, soit \u00e0 partir de ce r\u00e9pertoire soit \u00e0 partir du programme de dotation de l\u2019ADRC.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Mais savez-vous quand le r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s est entr\u00e9 en vigueur?\nR. Oui, l\u2019ADRC l\u2019a adopt\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement, vers la fin de 2001, je crois; elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Tr\u00e8s bien, une derni\u00e8re question. Donc, si vous \u00e9tiez inscrit sur la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u2013 pourquoi appara\u00eetriez-vous sur la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et dans un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s?\nR. Il existe une disposition selon laquelle, quand l\u2019ADRC a vu le jour, il \u00e9tait toujours possible d\u2019utiliser les listes d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Il y a donc eu un certain chevauchement pendant un temps.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et cela \u2013 la liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 n\u2019existe plus?\nR. Non. Elles ont pris fin \u00e0 la fin de 1995 \u2013 ou, excusez-moi, 2005. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique (1985) a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e, mais, parce que l\u2019ADRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e, on a cess\u00e9 de l\u2019utiliser en novembre 1999, sauf pour les cas o\u00f9 il y avait un chevauchement.\nMe Stark : M. Sinclair, il faut peut-\u00eatre que j\u2019intervienne ici. Le t\u00e9moin fait syst\u00e9matiquement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC et je crois qu\u2019il veut dire en fait l\u2019ASFC. Et cela ajoute peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 la confusion. C\u2019est l\u2019ASFC qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 2003, en d\u00e9cembre, et les concours se sont chevauch\u00e9s entre l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, et, ensuite, apr\u00e8s le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003, les r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s ont essentiellement relev\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC.\nLe contre-interrogatoire de M.

Tr\u00e8s bien.\n\u00ab \u00c0 cause du nombre croissant de plaintes de voyageurs, dont un grand nombre concernent les actes et les comportements d\u2019inspecteurs des douanes relativement nouveaux, il estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer les candidats, de traiter de certains crit\u00e8res non inclus dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des exigences en mati\u00e8re de dotation.

C\u2019est exact.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Vous convenez donc avec moi, dans ce cas, que les candidats inscrits \u00e0 ce concours ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale et par rapport aux m\u00eames crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation?\nR. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 nous n\u2019avons jamais su si la notation \u00e9tait raisonnable, car [\u2026] l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas examiner le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la notation vu que j\u2019avais eu gain de cause pour les deux premi\u00e8res all\u00e9gations.\nQ. [\u2026] Passons au paragraphe 104, l\u2019all\u00e9gation 3.\n\u00ab [\u2026] Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 lors de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des faits, la preuve qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tayait pas l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9; elle a plut\u00f4t mis en doute le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des deux comp\u00e9tences. \u00bb\nQ. Vous conviendrez avec moi que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de partialit\u00e9.\nR. Exact. Parce qu\u2019il a dit, ce que je voulais dire c\u2019\u00e9tait le caract\u00e8re raisonnable. Le paragraphe suivant pr\u00e9cise donc qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 la question parce que j\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu gain de cause pour les deux all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et que \u2013 pour autant que nous le sachions, il aurait pu y avoir un tas de notes incoh\u00e9rentes, mais il estimait que cela ne valait pas la peine d\u2019examiner la question parce que le processus \u00e9tait irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement vici\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Donc, l\u00e0 encore, vous n\u2019avez aucune preuve \u00e0 fournir au Tribunal qui pourrait [\u2026] donner \u00e0 penser que des candidats en particulier, dans ce r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente? Ont-ils tous \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on?\nR. Non, je dirais que Trent Van Helvoirt et Brianna Hewson ont certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente.\nQ. Et en quoi ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente?\nR. Eh bien, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue leurs deux portefeuilles et les deux comportent de nombreuses lacunes.\nQ. Donc \u2013 et les deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s, \u00e0 en juger par votre \u2013\nR. Les deux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 titre permanent, oui.\n[58] Plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, la Commission de la fonction publique a publi\u00e9 des directives concernant la mise en \u0153uvre de mesures correctives. Un aspect en particulier \u00e9tait que le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par le statut de PM\u201103 pour les agents des services frontaliers.\n[traduction]\nQ. Maintenant, dans ce compte rendu de motifs, au paragraphe 3, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce qui suit :\n\u00ab [\u2026] la version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s concernant les postes d\u2019agent des services frontaliers PM\u201103 contient les m\u00eames qualifications suppl\u00e9mentaires que l\u2019ASFC avait \u00e9valu\u00e9es par erreur dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection de PM\u201102. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, il serait redondant et inefficace \u00e0 ce stade-ci d\u2019exiger que l\u2019ASFC r\u00e9\u00e9value des qualifications que l\u2019on n\u2019exige plus pour le poste actuel. [\u2026] Maintenant, pour ce qui est de la propre situation du plaignant, la preuve a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas parvenu \u00e0 obtenir la note de passage pour les qualifications concernant le traitement des situations difficiles et la confiance en soi, deux des qualit\u00e9s que l\u2019on requiert maintenant pour les postes d\u2019agent des services frontaliers PM\u201103. De ce fait, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prendre d\u2019autres mesures correctives relativement \u00e0 ses circonstances pr\u00e9cises (celles de M. Hughes). \u00bb\nQ. Maintenant, souscrivez\u2011vous \u00e0 cette conclusion selon laquelle il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 des deux secteurs \u2013 deux crit\u00e8res auxquels vous avez essentiellement \u00e9chou\u00e9 lors du concours?\nR. Eh bien, en fait, je ne souscris pas du tout \u00e0 cela. Comme vous le savez, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur n\u2019a jamais examin\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re raisonnable du facteur de la confiance en soi et du traitement des situations difficiles, ni tenu compte du fait que j\u2019avais r\u00e9ussi sur le plan de ces comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 Victoria. Je ne souscris pas du tout \u00e0 cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Donc, ces types de concours, les r\u00e9pertoires de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s, sont la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019Agence embauche des personnes au niveau d\u2019entr\u00e9e?\nR. Parfois. Comme je l\u2019ai dit auparavant, elle engage plus d\u2019une centaine d\u2019\u00e9tudiants. Et elle a utilis\u00e9 aussi des processus non annonc\u00e9s, et sans concours aussi.\nTranscription : volume I, section I; page 194, lignes 21 \u00e0 25; page 177, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 178, lignes 1 \u00e0 6, 9 \u00e0 10 et 18 \u00e0 25; page 179, lignes 1 \u00e0 6; page 189, lines10 \u00e0 23; page 194, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 195, lignes 1 \u00e0 19; page 196, lignes 23 \u00e0 25; page 197, lignes 1 \u00e0 5.\nb) Le Programme de transition \u00e0 l\u2019intention des \u00e9tudiants [59] En contre-interrogatoire, quand on lui a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9crire le Programme de transition \u00e0 l\u2019intention des \u00e9tudiants, M. Hughes en a fait une description succincte et a \u00e9galement fait part de son opinion sur son utilisation.\n[traduction]\nR. Il est con\u00e7u par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour procurer une certaine souplesse aux minist\u00e8res et leur permettre d\u2019embaucher des \u00e9tudiants exceptionnels, qui ont montr\u00e9 qu\u2019ils sont d\u2019excellents travailleurs.\nEt il semble, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es de l\u2019ASFC, que l\u2019Agence a eu recours de mani\u00e8re abusive \u00e0 cette formule et ne s\u2019en est pas seulement servie pour combler ses besoins en dotation, au lieu de s\u2019en servir pour les \u00e9tudiants exceptionnels.\nQ. Et quelle preuve en avez-vous?\nR. Eh bien, j\u2019ai une copie de tous les contrats qu\u2019elle a pass\u00e9s au cours des derni\u00e8res \u2013 depuis 2004 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007. Et elle a embauch\u00e9, je pense, plus d\u2019une centaine de personnes par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du Programme. Et je pense qu\u2019il y en a eu une poign\u00e9e au cours des quatre ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\nQ. [\u2026] Quand vous dites \u00ab une poign\u00e9e \u00bb, de quelle p\u00e9riode s\u2019agit-il?\nR. Quand c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019ADRC qui avait le contr\u00f4le, elle utilisait tr\u00e8s rarement cette fonction et elle embauchait des employ\u00e9s par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de processus externes qui comportaient une norme de comp\u00e9tence sup\u00e9rieure. Quand l\u2019ASFC l\u2019a remplac\u00e9e, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 embaucher de tr\u00e8s nombreux \u00e9tudiants et, pour \u00eatre un \u00e9tudiant, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de satisfaire \u00e0 une norme aussi stricte pour le devenir; ensuite l\u2019Agence les a en quelque sorte embauch\u00e9s par la porte arri\u00e8re, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de ce programme de transition, selon moi.\nQ. [\u2026] Mais quand ce mouvement a-t-il commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre de l\u2019ampleur?\nR. \u00c0 la fin de 2004, au d\u00e9but de 2005.\nQ. Cela aurait donc eu lieu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte?\nR. Non, si vous jetez un coup d\u2019\u0153il \u00e0 [\u2026] si Levan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit dans le r\u00e9pertoire comme il aurait d\u00fb l\u2019\u00eatre, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible \u00e0 une embauche un an et demi, deux ans apr\u00e8s cela.\nQ. Exact. Mais ce que je veux dire c\u2019est tout simplement que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser plus souvent le Programme de transition \u00e0 l\u2019intention des \u00e9tudiants apr\u00e8s la fin de ces p\u00e9riodes de plainte. Nous parlons de concours qui ont commenc\u00e9 en 2003 et ont pris fin en \u2013 au printemps 2004.\nR. Eh bien, l\u2019Agence n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 de le faire avant le milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2007, apr\u00e8s les mesures correctives.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Je suis donc en d\u00e9saccord avec vous.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 151, ligne 22 \u00e0 25; page 152, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 153, lignes 1 \u00e0 16.\n[60] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hughes comment il avait \u00e9tabli que 50 % du personnel d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient des \u00e9tudiants. Il a r\u00e9pondu que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son exp\u00e9rience personnelle, \u00e0 Victoria, de nombreux quarts de travail comportaient plus de 50 % d\u2019\u00e9tudiants.\n[traduction]\nQ. Avez-vous tenu des relev\u00e9s de cela, ou s\u2019agit-il simplement d\u2019un chiffre que vous avez \u00e9tabli mentalement?\nR. Non. J\u2019ai tenu des feuilles de temps de 2002 et de 2004 qui le montrent.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Et pourquoi avez-vous tenu ces feuilles de temps, M. Hughes?\nR. Apr\u00e8s mon exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 l\u2019Imp\u00f4t en 2001 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir des documents sur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s n\u2019importe quoi.\nQ. Serait-il juste de dire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s votre exp\u00e9rience aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ADRC vous vous \u00eates mis \u00e0 tenir des documents sur tout parce que vous vous pr\u00e9occupiez de votre situation d\u2019emploi?\nR. Je m\u2019inqui\u00e9tais du fait que des gens essaieraient peut-\u00eatre de changer les choses plus tard. Je voulais donc tenir un compte rendu exact et factuel de ce qui se passait.\nQ. Croyiez-vous que vos employeurs en avaient contre vous?\nR. Pas \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC. Non, je n\u2019ai eu ce sentiment qu\u2019apr\u00e8s mon \u00e9chec \u00e0 Vancouver, alors que j\u2019avais presque termin\u00e9 mon troisi\u00e8me contrat.\nQ. Et pourquoi avez-vous eu cette impression? Pourquoi cela vous est-il venu \u00e0 l\u2019esprit?\nR. Parce que, comme je l\u2019ai dit plus t\u00f4t, les entrevues et les portefeuilles \u00e9crits \u00e9taient exactement les m\u00eames. J\u2019ai utilis\u00e9 exactement les m\u00eames pr\u00e9sentations. Je me suis dit, si j\u2019ai r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 Victoria et s\u2019ils savent que je suis un agent des douanes \u00e0 Victoria inscrit dans un r\u00e9pertoire, pourquoi me feraient-ils \u00e9chouer \u00e0 Vancouver? Cela n\u2019avait tout simplement aucun sens.\n[\u2026]\nQ. [\u2026] Et vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit dans le r\u00e9pertoire, mais vous n\u2019avez jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de celui-ci?\nR. Non, je ne l\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 154, lignes 24 \u00e0 25; page 155, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 156, lignes 1 \u00e0 12.\nc) L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 concernant le concours Vancouver 1002 [61] M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 au sujet de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 concernant le concours Vancouver 1002 et on lui a demand\u00e9 comment il interpr\u00e9tait cette restriction.\n[traduction]\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Maintenant, vous dites que, selon vous, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une discussion, cela voulait dire que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait que les personnes qui avaient pos\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement leur candidature \u00e0 des concours \u00e0 Vancouver qui n\u2019\u00e9taient plus \u2013 ou qui ne seraient pas admissibles?\nR. C\u2019est ainsi que je l\u2019ai compris, oui.\nQ. Pouvez-vous pr\u00e9ciser, comment dire, pourquoi cela vous est venu \u00e0 l\u2019esprit?\nR. Parce que Vancouver mettait toujours sur pied ses propres jurys et que les concours n\u2019\u00e9taient toujours ouverts qu\u2019au Lower Mainland, nous ne pouvions jamais poser notre candidature dans le pass\u00e9. Et pour Victoria, c\u2019\u00e9tait un peu la m\u00eame chose, les concours n\u2019\u00e9taient ouverts qu\u2019\u00e0 Victoria, ils ne laissaient personne du Lower Mainland s\u2019inscrire. Nous \u00e9tions donc toujours s\u00e9par\u00e9s. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019on ouvrait le concours jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ouest des Rocheuses. Et, de ce fait, jamais nous n\u2019avions pos\u00e9 auparavant notre candidature aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un jury de Vancouver. C\u2019est ainsi que nous avons interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la situation.\nQ. Vous a-t-il sembl\u00e9 \u00e9trange, cependant, qu\u2019on ouvre un processus dans le cadre duquel on rejetterait des candidats qui avaient peut-\u00eatre pos\u00e9 auparavant leur candidature \u00e0 Vancouver, mais pas des candidats qui avaient peut\u2011\u00eatre pos\u00e9 auparavant leur candidature ailleurs?\nR. Non. Parce que des gens avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver et que je peux comprendre pourquoi ils ne voudraient pas r\u00e9\u00e9valuer une personne qui, comme ils l\u2019auraient eux-m\u00eames d\u00e9termin\u00e9, ne faisait pas l\u2019affaire. Mais, s\u2019ils ne nous avaient jamais \u00e9valu\u00e9s auparavant, nous aurions d\u00fb pouvoir \u2013 pouvoir leur montrer ce que nous valions.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Donc, \u00e0 part la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils aient voulu jeter un coup d\u2019\u0153il \u00e0 des candidats de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver, rien n\u2019explique vraiment pourquoi ils auraient fait cette distinction?\nR. Oui, je ne m\u2019expliquais pas pourquoi ils avaient fait cela. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, il y avait \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait ambigu, c\u2019est \u00e7a que je voulais dire. Je sais ce qu\u2019ils voulaient.\nQ. Que voulaient-ils?\nR. Eh bien, comme les jurys ant\u00e9rieurs, ils avaient l\u2019intention d\u2019exclure les gens du Lower Mainland qui avaient pos\u00e9 leur candidature.\nQ. N\u2019est-il pas plus logique de dire que ce qu\u2019ils essayaient de faire, c\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019exclure les candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment \u00e9valu\u00e9s par rapport aux m\u00eames qualifications par d\u2019autres jurys de s\u00e9lection?\nR. Pas forc\u00e9ment. Parce que, comme j\u2019ai entendu des gens des Ressources humaines le dire, un processus diff\u00e9rent, des questions diff\u00e9rentes, cela pouvait mener \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent.\nQ. Qui a dit cela?\nR. J\u2019ai entendu Barbara Lennox le dire, Shaliva Sharma le dire, et je crois que Ron Tarnawski l\u2019a dit.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 164, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 165, lignes 1 \u00e0 4 et 10 \u00e0 25; page 166, lignes 1 \u00e0 5.\nLe nouvel interrogatoire de M.

Avez-vous \u00e9voqu\u00e9 cette question aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence au moment de ces concours ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0?\nR. Je l\u2019ai fait, oui.\nQ. Et qu\u2019est-ce que l\u2019Agence a fait \u00e0 ce sujet?\nR. Je pense que l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours \u2013 je ne pense pas avoir \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la question directement. C\u2019\u00e9tait au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\nQ. Voulez-vous dire cette enqu\u00eate de la Commission de la fonction publique?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Et vous dites avoir relev\u00e9 de nombreuses lacunes dans leur \u2013 leurs demandes, je suppose?\nR. Je l\u2019ai fait.\nQ. De quoi parliez-vous?\nR. Je parlais des notes que Karen Morin avait prises pour Brianna Houston, qui indiquaient qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au jury que sa surintendante lui avait dit qu\u2019elle devrait envisager une autre carri\u00e8re, et il y a aussi de nombreuses notes n\u00e9gatives au sujet de son aptitude \u00e0 communiquer; pourtant, elle avait r\u00e9ussi sur le plan de l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 communiquer et, avant d\u2019\u00eatre embauch\u00e9e, elle travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel comme pompiste de sorte que, non \u2013 elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application de la loi, et elle \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de dix-huit ou dix-neuf ans.\nQ. Et mon coll\u00e8gue vous a pos\u00e9 un certain nombre de questions, surtout sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9, et vous vous souviendrez peut-\u00eatre que, dans votre t\u00e9moignage vous, souvent, vous avez fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 1-0-5 et vous avez dit, oui il fallait lire tout cela ensemble; et au paragraphe 1-0-5 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur d\u00e9clare : \u00ab Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas donc n\u00e9cessaire que le soussign\u00e9 examine plus avant cette partie de l\u2019all\u00e9gation, ou tire une conclusion sur l\u2019affaire \u00bb.\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, une autre personne ou un autre organisme ont-ils fait une enqu\u00eate plus pouss\u00e9e sur cette all\u00e9gation ou sont-ils arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 une conclusion au sujet de l\u2019affaire?\nR. Non, cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, \u00e0 part la Commission des droits de la personne qui a effectivement conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 de l\u2019une des raisons pour renvoyer l\u2019affaire ici.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : De quelle affaire s\u2019agit-il?\nR. L\u2019affaire soumise au Tribunal.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : donc, votre all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 est le fondement, l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles M. Turner [\u2026]\nR. Non, la fa\u00e7on dont Brianna Houston a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e lors du concours.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Y a-t-il une raison pour laquelle la plainte de M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal?\nR. L\u2019une des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans le \u2013 oui \u2013 parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de dix-huit ou dix-neuf ans, pas tr\u00e8s qualifi\u00e9e; les notes indiquaient qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb \u00e9chouer, mais sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 9, lignes 7 \u00e0 25; page 10, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 11, lignes 1 \u00e0 11.\nLes d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s de M. Hughes avec Revenu Canada [63] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a interrog\u00e9 M. Hughes sur les griefs qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9s contre Revenu Canada.\n[traduction]\nQ. Pendant ce temps, avez-vous eu des probl\u00e8mes et des d\u00e9saccords avec Revenu Canada au sujet de votre emploi [\u2026] au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de 2003-2004?\n[\u2026]\nR. Il y a une enqu\u00eate en cours pour harc\u00e8lement, un certain nombre de griefs et une enqu\u00eate des affaires internes que j\u2019avais demand\u00e9e (en) [\u2026] au d\u00e9but de 2004. [\u2026] \u00c0 la fin de 2004, au d\u00e9but de 2005, il y a eu une plainte relative aux droits de la personne que j\u2019ai d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ARC [\u2026] pour cause de d\u00e9ficience [\u2026] d\u00e9pression et stress.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 138, lignes 14 \u00e0 25.\nQ. Faisons un retour en arri\u00e8re. Pour ce qui des premiers griefs, quand la relation d\u2019emploi avec Revenu Canada a-t-elle commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 tourner au vinaigre?\nR. Eh bien, les choses ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mal tourner en 2001. Et, ensuite, elles se sont calm\u00e9es au cours des ann\u00e9es 2002 et 2003, puis elles ont empir\u00e9 de nouveau. [\u2026] Il faut en fait remonter \u00e0 septembre 2000, c\u2019est la date o\u00f9 cela a commenc\u00e9. Et c\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 j\u2019ai mis fin \u00e0 un acte ill\u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC [\u2026] un agent de recouvrement avait fait saisir par erreur le compte d\u2019un administrateur d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 cause des dettes de cette derni\u00e8re, ce qu\u2019il est interdit de faire.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 139, lignes 1 \u00e0 25.\nEt cette personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [\u2026] sous le coup de la saisie pendant pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an, une somme de 5 000 $ probablement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur son revenu d\u2019emploi. Et un certain nombre de chefs d\u2019\u00e9quipe le savaient, mais ils n\u2019y avaient pas mis fin.\nQ. Et qu\u2019avez-vous fait?\nR. J\u2019ai mis \u00e0 contribution mon chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et l\u2019agent des relations avec les m\u00e9dias afin de m\u2019assurer que l\u2019on mette fin \u00e0 la saisie et que l\u2019argent soit rembours\u00e9.\nQ. Est-ce que cela est vraiment arriv\u00e9?\nR. Oui, effectivement.\nQ. Maintenant, qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 et pourquoi les griefs ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s?\nR. Eh bien, quatre ou cinq mois plus tard, tout \u00e0 coup, on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire obstacle \u00e0 des promotions et \u00e0 me traiter de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative. Et je crois que c\u2019\u00e9tait en guise de repr\u00e9sailles pour la d\u00e9nonciation.\nQ. Avez-vous une preuve quelconque de cela?\nR. Pas avec moi. Il y en a des tonnes devant d\u2019autres tribunaux administratifs et commissions.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 140, lignes 3 \u00e0 22.\n[\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr de comprendre ce \u2013 vers o\u00f9 l\u2019on se dirige. On peut consid\u00e9rer cela comme un signe de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Hughes. Mais je n\u2019ai rien entendu \u2013 dans le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui qui ne soit pas cr\u00e9dible en ce sens que \u2013 et il peut dire que cette personne en particulier a obtenu un emploi et \u2013 que le processus n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi pour cette personne en particulier ou que des \u00e9tudiants ont obtenu un emploi et ont ensuite \u00e9chou\u00e9 ou font partie de ce programme particulier, etc.\n[\u2026]\n[\u2026] Je crois que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Hughes ne pose pas vraiment probl\u00e8me pour ce qui est d\u2019une grande part du t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il a fait. Ce que je veux dire c\u2019est qu\u2019il a peut-\u00eatre contest\u00e9 ses employeurs et que ceux-ci ne l\u2019ont pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9, de sorte qu\u2019ils lui ont fait subir toutes sortes de choses, ou bloqu\u00e9 ses promotions, etc. Mais cela n\u2019est pas un point litigieux dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\nTranscription : volume I, section I, page 141, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 142, ligne 25; page 142, lignes 1 \u00e0 6\n[64] Je partage l\u2019avis du pr\u00e9sident que M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible dont le t\u00e9moignage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9branl\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire. Le compte rendu d\u00e9taill\u00e9 qu\u2019il a fait des m\u00e9thodes d\u2019embauche et du processus de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a servi de contexte utile pour examiner la plainte de M. Turner.\nD. Le t\u00e9moin Levan Turner [65] M. Turner, originaire de Toronto, a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 avec son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 Victoria en d\u00e9cembre 1995, \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il souhaitait devenir inspecteur des douanes ou agent de conservation; cependant, son premier emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui de gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au Centre Eaton de Victoria. Son travail de gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comportait une formation en mati\u00e8re de recours \u00e0 la force, de techniques \u00e0 appliquer en vue d\u2019effectuer une arrestation appropri\u00e9e, ainsi que de menottage d\u2019un suspect en ne recourant qu\u2019au degr\u00e9 de force pouvant \u00eatre raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\n[66] La disposition de M. Turner \u00e0 travailler comme gardien de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait une progression logique par rapport aux services b\u00e9n\u00e9voles ant\u00e9rieurs qu\u2019il avait fournis \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de police auxiliaire aupr\u00e8s du Service de police de Toronto. Il a expliqu\u00e9 le processus de s\u00e9lection que suivait le Service en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir les aptitudes d\u2019\u00e9ventuels agents auxiliaires, ainsi que la formation qu\u2019il avait suivie en vue de devenir un tel agent : une formation polici\u00e8re de base comprenant les techniques de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 mains nues, les arrestations tactiques, le menottage ainsi que l\u2019utilisation appropri\u00e9e d\u2019un b\u00e2ton. Il a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019agent auxiliaire, il portait un uniforme semblable \u00e0 l\u2019uniforme ordinaire de la police et qu\u2019il donnait un coup de main lors d\u2019activit\u00e9s publiques et, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, il accompagnait des agents ordinaires dans leur v\u00e9hicule : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai donc pris part \u00e0 toutes sortes d\u2019appels, des appels ordinaires au Service de police, en compagnie d\u2019un agent de police ordinaire, et j\u2019ai acquis en leur compagnie une exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9cieuse \u00bb.

Turner a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une annonce de recrutement d\u2019\u00e9ventuels agents des douanes en envoyant son curriculum vit\u00e6 par la poste. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 passer un examen \u00e9crit, le Test d\u2019inspecteur des douanes (le TID), qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s; il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 et a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit au 10e rang sur une liste d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. L\u2019avocat a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il se souvenait qui l\u2019avait interview\u00e9, et M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Oui, croyez-le ou non, oui je m\u2019en souviens. Cela fait longtemps. Il s\u2019agissait de Joanne Deans (ph.) qui \u00e9tait inspectrice des douanes, ainsi que de Catherine Pringle, qui \u00e9tait surintendante. \u00bb Transcription : volume I, section II, page 53, lignes 7 \u00e0 9.\n[70] M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, au poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes P\u20111, au sein de la Section du secteur maritime, pour la p\u00e9riode de mai 1998 au 15 octobre 1998.\nLa premi\u00e8re saison en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, de mai \u00e0 octobre 1998 [71] Au cours de sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de travail saisonnier \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, M. Turner a travaill\u00e9 au 816, rue Government, \u00e0 Victoria, au sein de la Section du secteur maritime. Cette derni\u00e8re, selon lui, \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e des navires faisant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la navette entre Victoria et Port Angeles (le Coho) et Seattle (le Clipper). Il a d\u00e9crit ses longues journ\u00e9es de travail, qui consistaient \u00e0 parler avec beaucoup de gens, en tenant \u00e0 la main une planchette \u00e0 pince sur laquelle \u00e9taient not\u00e9s des d\u00e9tails concernant certaines personnes et certains v\u00e9hicules pour lesquels on avait pr\u00e9venu la Section du secteur maritime de fallait garder l\u2019\u0153il ouvert, une t\u00e2che appel\u00e9e famili\u00e8rement [traduction] \u00ab avis de surveillance \u00bb. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9douanement des personnes arrivant \u00e0 Victoria \u00e9tait un processus en deux \u00e9tapes : une inspection primaire et une inspection secondaire :\n[traduction]\nQ. J\u2019ai entendu ces termes auparavant, mais pourriez-vous simplement nous d\u00e9crire tout d\u2019abord ce qu\u2019est l\u2019inspection primaire?\nR. Fort bien, pas de probl\u00e8me. La ligne primaire ou la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire comme on l\u2019appelle \u2013 c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle la LIP. Cette ligne, c\u2019est le premier contact qu\u2019ont les gens lorsqu\u2019ils descendent du traversier. Il s\u2019agirait donc de la premi\u00e8re gu\u00e9rite d\u2019inspection primaire, tout comme on le ferait si l\u2019on arrive en automobile \u00e0 un poste frontalier, la gu\u00e9rite de la LIP serait l\u2019inspection primaire ou la premi\u00e8re ligne de contact avec les Douanes. Et ce serait \u00e0 cet endroit que vous feriez votre d\u00e9claration, ou l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 les Douanes vous poseraient des questions, de sorte que ce serait le premier agent avec lequel vous entreriez en contact.\nEt au moment o\u00f9 vous atteindriez cette gu\u00e9rite [\u2026] l\u2019agent des douanes d\u00e9terminerait \u00e0 ce moment si vous seriez admis au Canada ou si vous seriez orient\u00e9 vers la ligne secondaire en vue d\u2019un examen plus approfondi.\nQ. Quel crit\u00e8re utilisiez-vous pour prendre cette d\u00e9cision?\nR. Eh bien, nous sommes form\u00e9s pour poser essentiellement, vous savez, des questions types [\u2026] d\u2019o\u00f9 venez-vous, depuis combien de temps avez-vous quitt\u00e9 le Canada, quelle est votre destination. Et nous sommes \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019indices, vous savez, si nous croyons ce que d\u00e9clarent les visiteurs, la rapidit\u00e9 avec laquelle ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la question, s\u2019ils paraissent \u00e9vasifs, ce qui, en quelque sorte, am\u00e8nerait \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019il serait justifi\u00e9 de les renvoyer \u00e0 un examen secondaire ou qu\u2019il suffirait simplement de les admettre au Canada.\nEt, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, nous prenons, vous savez, cela d\u00e9pend bien s\u00fbr des circonstances, mais je pr\u00e9sume que nous essayons de faire passer les gens le plus rapidement possible.\nQ. Et quand vous travailliez au niveau secondaire, quelles \u00e9taient vos fonctions?\nR. L\u2019examen secondaire serait, ce que nous faisions si une personne \u00e9tait renvoy\u00e9e au secondaire, c\u2019\u00e9tait remplir une feuille de renvoi, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une feuille de papier jaune. Et, sur cette feuille jaune, nous inscrivions la d\u00e9claration de la personne, ce qu\u2019elle avait dit et depuis combien de temps elle avait quitt\u00e9 le Canada, ce qu\u2019elle apportait au Canada. Parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un document juridique disant : eh bien, voici ce que la personne que vous avez vue a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au sujet du contenu de son v\u00e9hicule. C\u2019est cela que nous devions faire.\nEt, une fois rendu au secteur secondaire, l\u2019agent de la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire prenait cette feuille de renvoi, l\u2019examinait et v\u00e9rifiait ensuite ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la gu\u00e9rite d\u2019inspection primaire par rapport \u00e0 ce qui figurait sur la feuille de renvoi. Et, ensuite, nous prenions les mesures n\u00e9cessaires, s\u2019il y avait quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre que nous trouvions, nous prenions les mesures qui s\u2019imposaient.\nQ. Et quand vous dites prendre les mesures qui s\u2019imposaient, de quel type de mesure pourrait-il s\u2019agir?\nR. Tout d\u00e9pend de quoi il s\u2019agit. Il pourrait s\u2019agir de percevoir des droits et des taxes, pour l\u2019Immigration, si nous trouvions des documents qui \u00e9taient dissimul\u00e9s et qui prouveraient que ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire \u00e9tait inexact, dans ce cas nous prendrions les mesures qui convenaient.\nQ. Vous venez tout juste de mentionner l\u2019Immigration. [\u2026] Quels \u00e9taient les cas dont vous vous occupiez?\nR. Si nous trouvions, disons que des personnes se pr\u00e9sentaient, ou des voyageurs arrivaient au Canada, et que ces personnes disaient qu\u2019elles ne venaient ici qu\u2019en visite, mais que, entre-temps, nous avions des documents montrant que ces personnes poss\u00e9daient une maison ici au Canada; en fait, elles ne venaient pas en visite, en fait il se pouvait qu\u2019elles viennent ici vivre dans leur maison \u2013 au Canada, il s\u2019agirait l\u00e0 du genre de situation que nous renvoyions \u00e0 l\u2019Immigration, parce que ces personnes, peut-\u00eatre, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des visiteurs v\u00e9ritables ou valides. Il se pouvait que ces personnes vivent en fait ici au Canada, mais, vous savez, qu\u2019elles d\u00e9clarent qu\u2019elles venaient ici simplement en visite. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc l\u00e0 une situation que nous renvoyions \u00e0 l\u2019Immigration.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Vous avez aussi dit que vous faisiez des fouilles et que vous arr\u00eatiez des personnes.

Cette agence avait besoin d\u2019employ\u00e9s temporaires pour faire face \u00e0 une situation d\u2019urgence : une \u00e9pid\u00e9mie de spongieuse. M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, embauch\u00e9 et form\u00e9, et il avait pour t\u00e2che d\u2019inspecter et de certifier des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s foresti\u00e8res de production d\u2019arbres de No\u00ebl. Cependant, ce travail hivernal a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompu par une nouvelle offre d\u2019emploi temporaire aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ADRC.\n[73] \u00c0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre 1998, Diana Kavalaars, chef de l\u2019ADRC \u00e0 Victoria, a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

C\u2019est exact.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 55, lignes 8 \u00e0 14.\n[74] Au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me saison pass\u00e9e au service de l\u2019ADRC, M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au CDT, o\u00f9 il s\u2019occupait du d\u00e9douanement de bateaux et d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e. Il a d\u00e9crit ce travail comme un service de communication fonctionnant 24 heures sur 24, qui permet aux capitaines de bateau et aux pilotes d\u2019a\u00e9ronef de demander par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone l\u2019autorisation d\u2019entrer au Canada. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un inspecteur des douanes travaillant au CDT poserait \u00e0 ces capitaines et \u00e0 ces pilotes les m\u00eames questions qu\u2019\u00e0 un point d\u2019entr\u00e9e au Canada et qu\u2019il d\u00e9ciderait si ces personnes \u00e9taient autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 entrer au pays ou pas. S\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une inspection secondaire, les a\u00e9ronefs arrivants \u00e9taient orient\u00e9s vers un a\u00e9roport d\u00e9sign\u00e9, dot\u00e9 d\u2019un bureau des Douanes, et ils y restaient jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un inspecteur des douanes.\n[75] M. Turner a expliqu\u00e9 que le manque de contacts directs avec les arriv\u00e9es \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par le recours \u00e0 des syst\u00e8mes informatiques de l\u2019ADRC qui permettaient de d\u00e9terminer si la personne en question avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e auparavant au niveau secondaire, ou si l\u2019a\u00e9ronef ou le bateau en question avait eu des probl\u00e8mes ant\u00e9rieurement. M. Turner a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait la comp\u00e9tence requise pour utiliser le Syst\u00e8me int\u00e9gr\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution des douanes (le SIED) ainsi que le syst\u00e8me du Centre d\u2019information de la police canadienne (le CIPC) de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir d\u00e9terminer si un voyageur quelconque faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019un mandat d\u2019arrestation non ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, ou \u00e0 relever d\u2019autres renseignements relatifs \u00e0 des questions juridiques ant\u00e9rieures les concernant.\n[76] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, chaque fois que la Section du secteur maritime manquait d\u2019effectifs, ou que l\u2019on attendait l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un nombre exceptionnellement \u00e9lev\u00e9 de passagers \u00e0 bord d\u2019un navire, des agents du CTD aidaient \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les inspections primaires et secondaires.\n[77] Me Yazbeck a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 7, une lettre dat\u00e9e du 27 f\u00e9vrier 1998 confirmant qu\u2019il avait pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s le test d\u2019inspecteur des douanes. Selon M. Turner, les r\u00e9sultats de cet examen \u00e9taient toujours valables \u00e0 la fin de son dernier emploi saisonnier.\n[78] Me Yazbeck a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 8, un document de l\u2019ADRC. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un examen du rendement de M. Turner pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1999. Ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019auteur de cet examen \u00e9tait le surintendant int\u00e9rimaire Todd Perry, du CDT. M. Turner s\u2019est souvenu que M. Perry \u00e9tait un excellent formateur. Le formulaire d\u2019examen \u00e9num\u00e8re un certain nombre de [traduction] \u00ab Buts et objectifs \u00bb, et le surintendant doit pr\u00e9ciser s\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 atteints ou non.

[\u2026] Vous avez bien travaill\u00e9 avec le reste des membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe du CDT. [\u2026] Levan, je n\u2019ai aucune critique \u00e0 formuler au sujet de votre travail. Vous avez accept\u00e9 de bon gr\u00e9 les conseils que je vous ai donn\u00e9s. [\u2026] Je vous remercie de votre aide pour les activit\u00e9s de formation et pour les conseils que vous avez dispens\u00e9s aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s que le CDT a accueillis. \u00bb Transcription : volume I, section II, page 64, lignes 12 \u00e0 15, pages 66 et 67, ligne 25 \u00e0 ligne 12.\n[79] Des commentaires semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de M. Turner concernant la saison de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2000, \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 9 : [traduction] \u00ab Le travail et la collaboration ont \u00e9t\u00e9, dans votre cas, des points tr\u00e8s solides. Vous m\u2019avez beaucoup aid\u00e9 \u00e0 former de nouveaux employ\u00e9s. Vous \u00eates toujours \u00e0 la recherche de moyens d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le service et vous en faites part au reste de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. \u00bb\n[80] M. Perry a signal\u00e9 que l\u2019apparence de M. Turner \u00e9tait toujours professionnelle et qu\u2019elle respectait les directives de l\u2019Agence. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on il aidait \u00e0 former les nouveaux employ\u00e9s, M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il leur enseignait comment utiliser les services informatiques et qu\u2019il concevait des sc\u00e9narios fictifs simulant les contacts avec un a\u00e9ronef arrivant. Cette arriv\u00e9e simul\u00e9e donnait \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail une occasion de parfaire leurs comp\u00e9tences en informatique et d\u2019am\u00e9liorer leurs aptitudes en tant qu\u2019interrogateurs.\nLa troisi\u00e8me saison en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, d\u2019avril 2001 \u00e0 octobre 2002 [81] Le troisi\u00e8me emploi saisonnier d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e que M. Turner a exerc\u00e9 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 prendre fin \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2001; mais l\u2019attaque terroriste du 11 septembre de cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0 a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une prolongation de son contrat et \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 la Section du secteur maritime au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2002. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaillait depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, on l\u2019avait inscrit automatiquement dans un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats en vue d\u2019\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 un rappel.\n[82] Me Yazbeck a produit la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 12, une \u00e9valuation d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, faite au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2002, \u00e9tablie par le surintendant Trevor Baird de la Section du secteur maritime et portant la signature de M. Turner. \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re page de ce document, il est indiqu\u00e9 que M. Turner se pr\u00e9sente de mani\u00e8re professionnelle, m\u00eame quand les circonstances sont difficiles. M. Turner s\u2019est souvenu que ces [traduction] \u00ab circonstances difficiles \u00bb se rapportaient \u00e0 un incident impliquant un voyageur am\u00e9ricain agit\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du Coho et dont il avait pu s\u2019occuper comme il faut. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait servi de cet incident pour illustrer l\u2019une de ses comp\u00e9tences dans le cadre d\u2019un concours affich\u00e9.\n[83] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner si les fonctions qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9es en 2001 et 2002 au CDT ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la Section du secteur maritime \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes de ses fonctions ant\u00e9rieures, et il a r\u00e9pondu que la diff\u00e9rence \u00e9tait qu\u2019il avait plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de formation :\n[traduction]\nR. Il n\u2019y avait pas beaucoup de diff\u00e9rences, sauf qu\u2019en \u00e9tant l\u00e0 plus longtemps, j\u2019avais plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et je me chargeais d\u2019un plus grand nombre de t\u00e2ches, des d\u00e9douanements, des navires \u00e0 partir du comptoir avant de la Salle des comptoirs, des v\u00e9rifications dans (inaudible) le syst\u00e8me du CIPC et le SIED, j\u2019avais maintenant plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience apr\u00e8s avoir suivi ma formation, pour effectuer des contr\u00f4les aupr\u00e8s du CIPC, des contr\u00f4les de casier judiciaire. J\u2019\u00e9tais maintenant capable de le faire.\nCe qui arrivait donc dans ce cas c\u2019est que, lorsque j\u2019\u00e9tais au [CDT], des navires arrivaient et, si un agent de la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire avait besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires sur quelqu\u2019un ou voulait que l\u2019on fasse un contr\u00f4le de casier judiciaire, il pouvait t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au [CDT] et il n\u2019y avait qu\u2019un tr\u00e8s petit nombre d\u2019entre nous qui avions acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me. Et j\u2019\u00e9tais donc assez chanceux d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s au syst\u00e8me. Et je pouvais faire des v\u00e9rifications concernant des personnes pour le compte du personnel qui se trouvait aux quais.\nQ. Et vous indiquez \u00e9galement ici que vous fouilliez et que vous arr\u00eatiez des personnes. Avez-vous, pouvez-vous nous en donner quelques exemples?\nR. Certainement. Nous \u2013 je donnais un coup de main chaque fois qu\u2019il y avait, chaque fois que je me trouvais \u00e0 la Section du secteur maritime; j\u2019\u00e9tais en mesure de donner un coup de main si quelqu\u2019un avait besoin d\u2019aide pour fouiller des personnes peu coop\u00e9ratives [\u2026] C\u2019est donc dire que j\u2019ai \u2013 aid\u00e9 bien s\u00fbr \u00e0 faire ce travail, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 arr\u00eater des personnes lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de le faire.\nJe me souviens d\u2019avoir aid\u00e9 un jour Terry Klassen [\u2026] \u00e0 arr\u00eater une personne, \u00e0 la fouiller et \u00e0 la mettre sous garde. J\u2019ai aussi donn\u00e9 un coup de main pour l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019appareil de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9, un appareil que l\u2019on utilise, que m\u00eame la police utilise maintenant dans la rue, pour v\u00e9rifier si une personne est en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou non. Et j\u2019\u00e9tais en mesure de le faire par moi-m\u00eame quand je travaillais \u00e0 la Section du secteur maritime. J\u2019ai pu faire passer le test de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne qui avait d\u00e9barqu\u00e9 du Coho et qui, selon moi, \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Et j\u2019ai soumis cette personne \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire primaire et je l\u2019ai renvoy\u00e9e vers la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire \u2013 o\u00f9 j\u2019ai soumis la personne \u00e0 un interrogatoire primaire. Cette personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 orient\u00e9e vers la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire et, pendant que je fouillais le v\u00e9hicule, j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que l\u00e0, dans le v\u00e9hicule, il y avait une odeur d\u2019alcool et j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que, dans l\u2019un des gobelets, il y avait un r\u00e9sidu d\u2019alcool.\nJ\u2019ai donc pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il valait mieux soumettre cette personne \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le. Je l\u2019ai donc fait et je me suis rendu compte que cette personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle a souffl\u00e9, mais le r\u00e9sultat n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019un avertissement. Je l\u2019ai donc essentiellement mise en garde et je lui ai fait savoir que, vous savez, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une chose intelligente \u00e0 faire, il y avait des enfants dans l\u2019automobile. [\u2026] [\u00c0] cause des indices que j\u2019avais relev\u00e9s dans le v\u00e9hicule, j\u2019avais pu faire passer un test de d\u00e9tection approuv\u00e9.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 85, lignes 16 \u00e0 25, page 86, lignes 1 \u00e0 25, page 87, lignes 1 \u00e0 24.\n[84] Dans le m\u00eame volet de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Turner a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait suivi un cours portant sur le recours \u00e0 la force \u00e0 l\u2019Administration centrale de l\u2019ADRC, un cours qu\u2019il a d\u00e9crit comme une activit\u00e9 de formation d\u2019une semaine sur le menottage, les techniques de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 mains nues, ainsi que l\u2019utilisation du b\u00e2ton et du vaporisateur de poivre, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi. M. Turner a \u00e9galement suivi un cours sur les pouvoirs des agents, qui portait sur l\u2019arrestation de personnes et leurs droits, ainsi qu\u2019un cours sur le maniement des armes \u00e0 feu, offert la fin de semaine sur un champ de tir et o\u00f9 il avait appris comment manier diff\u00e9rentes armes \u00e0 feu, tirer avec ces derni\u00e8res et charger et d\u00e9charger des munitions en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[85] \u00c0 la fin de ce volet du t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019avocat a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

Oh oui, assur\u00e9ment, oui. Pour ma toute premi\u00e8re entrevue, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en 1998, on m\u2019a inform\u00e9 que ces postes pour lesquels nous postulions \u2013 \u00e9taient des postes permanents, \u00e0 temps plein. Et, une fois que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, on m\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agirait plus de postes \u00e0 temps plein, mais juste de postes \u00e0 dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 102, lignes 4 \u00e0 10.\n[86] M.

Les postes annonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis du 11 octobre 2003 concernant le concours Victoria 7003 \u00e9taient des postes permanents, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou de dotation anticip\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, \u00e0 Victoria \/ Sidney (C.-B.) (y compris le port de Bedwell), et il fallait que les demandes soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au plus tard le 30 octobre 2003 (voir la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, onglet 41).\n[90] M. Turner a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le concours Victoria 7003; il a pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s les \u00e9tapes \u00ab pr\u00e9alables \u00bb du processus et a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003 par le pr\u00e9sident du jury de s\u00e9lection, Trevor Baird, surintendant, Section du secteur maritime de Victoria, ainsi que par les membres du jury de s\u00e9lection Kathryn Pringle, surintendante, Centre de d\u00e9claration t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Victoria, et Janet Sabo, surintendante, Sidney (voir la pi\u00e8ce C\u20112, onglet 43 ainsi que la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, onglets 42 \u00e0 48 et 51). Le 5 mars 2004, M. Baird a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner une lettre l\u2019informant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 au concours, car on n\u2019avait pas trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il satisfaisait \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab tous les crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation qu\u2019exige[ait] le poste \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, onglet 50).\n[91] Le concours Victoria 7003 est l\u2019un des trois processus de dotation concernant des postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Victoria pour lequel M. Turner a pos\u00e9 sa candidature et, apr\u00e8s une entrevue, a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 non qualifi\u00e9 pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes. Les autres \u00e9taient : 1) le processus de s\u00e9lection 2001-CCRA-PAC-3961-7009 (le concours Victoria 7009), dans le cadre duquel M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 le 2 avril 2002 (voir la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglets 67 et 69), et 2) le processus de s\u00e9lection 2002-1060-PAC-3961-7012 (le concours Victoria 7012), dans le cadre duquel M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003 (voir la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglets 62 \u00e0 64).\n[92] Bien que les circonstances entourant les concours Victoria 7009 (2001) et Victoria 7012 (2002) ne soient pas en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, celles qui s\u2019appliquent au concours Victoria 7012 ont peut-\u00eatre une certaine pertinence pour ce qui est d\u2019\u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du surintendant Paul Tarnawski. Ce dernier pr\u00e9sidait le comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevues dans le cadre des concours Vancouver 1002 et Victoria 7012. Nous analyserons ces circonstances plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\ne) Le concours Vancouver 1002 [93] L\u2019avis relatif au concours Vancouver 1002 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 9 juin 2003; il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi d\u00e9crite en ces termes : [traduction] \u00ab ce poste [\u2026] PM\u201102, inspecteur des douanes, district de l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, district Metro Vancouver, district Pacific Highway [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[94] L\u2019annonce contenait une restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Les candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours. \u00bb\n[95] Le 26 avril 2004, M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 par un jury de trois membres \u2013 Ron Tarnawski, Mark Northcote et Karen Morin \u2013 pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes annonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi du 9 juin 2003.\n[96] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour le concours Vancouver 1002, il avait examin\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 figurant dans l\u2019avis de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi et avait conclu que cette mesure avait pour but d\u2019exclure les personnes qui, depuis le 1er janvier 2002, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9es \u00e0 Vancouver pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102. Comme il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 auparavant \u00e0 Vancouver pour le poste PM\u201102 et il souhaitait acc\u00e9der \u00e0 un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes permanent, il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature et a re\u00e7u \u00e0 remplir un portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences (pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 23). Apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un relev\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9 \u00e9crit de ses comp\u00e9tences, M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue, qui a eu lieu le 26 avril 2004. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une br\u00e8ve entrevue, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le surintendant Ron Tarnawski; les autres membres du jury \u00e9taient M. Northcote et Mme Morin. M. Turner a dit de la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 64 \u00bb (volume 3) qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de notes des membres du jury M. Northcote et Mme Morin sur le processus d\u2019entrevue, disant qu\u2019il avait obtenu une note de passage de 70 et [traduction] \u00ab atteint \u00bb le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis. Ces notes \u00e9taient biff\u00e9es et une inscription disait : [traduction] \u00ab non qualifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019entrevue, vis\u00e9 par la restriction sur l\u2019affiche \u00bb. Transcription : volume I, section II, page 125, lignes 7 \u00e0 11.\n[97] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019ASFC a admis que, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, M. Turner aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit dans un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats potentiels qualifi\u00e9s.\n[traduction]\nMe Stark : [\u2026] Loin de moi l\u2019id\u00e9e de mettre des mots dans la bouche de mes t\u00e9moins, mais, pour ce qui est de la position g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019intention de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019emp\u00eacher des candidats qui avaient eu de bons r\u00e9sultats, par exemple, \u00e0 Victoria ou ailleurs, de pr\u00e9senter leur candidature \u00e0 Vancouver.\nL\u2019intention \u00e9tait d\u2019exclure les personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es auparavant non qualifi\u00e9es dans \u2013 dans les concours concernant le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes. Et, dans ce cas particulier, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que M. Turner n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 Victoria, il enfreignait cette restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9.\nEt cela s\u2019explique tout simplement par le fait que, si quelqu\u2019un avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 au cours des deux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, ce \u2013 ce n\u2019est pas \u2013 l\u00e0 encore, je m\u2019exprime en termes tr\u00e8s simples, mais essentiellement cela ne vaut pas la peine de soumettre quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 tout le processus de concours quand cette personne a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9 sa candidature et n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu aux crit\u00e8res. Le sentiment, la conviction, c\u2019est qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que ces personnes acqui\u00e8rent davantage d\u2019exp\u00e9rience afin de pouvoir se pr\u00e9senter de nouveau et, apr\u00e8s un certain temps pendant lequel elles ont pu parfaire leurs comp\u00e9tences, les am\u00e9liorer, acqu\u00e9rir plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, alors elles peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9es plus tard. [\u2026]\nIl n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu; il s\u2019agit de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Il y a quelques autres facteurs contextuels aussi, qui ne concernent pas la raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 non qualifi\u00e9, mais il s\u2019agit de certains faits dont le jury de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait au courant.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nMe Yazbeck : Tr\u00e8s bien. Donc, juste pour que ce soit clair, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu uniquement \u00e0 cause de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, mais vous dites qu\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres faits dont le jury \u00e9tait au courant et qui auraient pu avoir une incidence sur la mani\u00e8re dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9.\nMe Stark : Exact.\nMe Yazbeck : Tr\u00e8s bien. Je crois que je sais de quoi il s\u2019agit. C\u2019est parfait.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 121, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page 122, lignes 1 \u00e0 15; page 123, lignes 1 \u00e0 13.\n[98] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a produit la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 66 \u00bb, des notes que M. Tarnawski avait prises au cours de l\u2019entrevue et qui indiquent : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] nous avons constat\u00e9 que Levan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 moins d\u2019un an plus t\u00f4t et, \u00e0 cause de la restriction que comportent nos processus, Levan n\u2019avait pas le droit de poser sa candidature pour ce concours \u00bb.\n[99] L\u2019avocat a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019entrevue.\n[traduction]\nR. Non. Il n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question. Voulez-vous dire le fait que je serais exclu?\nQ. Non [\u2026] la question de votre participation \u2013 la restriction [\u2026]?\nR. Oh, oui, ils me l\u2019ont mentionn\u00e9e en disant que, vous savez, en me demandant si j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t pour ce poste.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Est-il vrai que vous aviez \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 moins d\u2019un an plus t\u00f4t?\nR. Oui, parce que j\u2019avais pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour le concours de Victoria, mais pas pour \u2013 quand ils disent ce poste, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du concours de Victoria, et c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la raison de l\u2019avis.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 127, lignes 2 \u00e0 18.\n[100] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, quand il \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 dans la salle d\u2019entrevue, il avait reconnu M. Tarnawski, le pr\u00e9sident du jury qu\u2019il l\u2019avait interview\u00e9 \u00e0 Victoria au printemps de 2003, et il avait dit \u00e0 M. Tarnawski qu\u2019ils s\u2019\u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 vus auparavant.\n[traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] et il a dit oui, je me souviens de la voix et de la pr\u00e9sence.\nR. Oui, et c\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont il l\u2019a dit : \u00ab Oui, je me souviens de la voix et de la pr\u00e9sence \u00bb.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Vous avez mentionn\u00e9 que vous \u00e9tiez le seul agent noir \u00e0 Victoria. Est-ce l\u00e0 votre t\u00e9moignage \u00e9galement?\nR. Oui.\nQ. De quelle fa\u00e7on la question de votre entrevue ant\u00e9rieure est-elle venue sur le tapis? Par exemple, quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la nature de l\u2019\u00e9change?\nR. Eh bien, quand je me suis assis pour l\u2019entrevue on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si j\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9, et Ron Tarnawski a mis la main sur la table : \u00ab pour ce poste \u00bb. Et j\u2019ai dit que non, et il a ensuite dit : okay, et nous avons poursuivi l\u2019entrevue. (Transcription : volume I, section II, page128, lignes 22 \u00e0 25; page 129, lignes 1 \u00e0 12.)\n[101] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une semaine apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, il avait re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de Mme Karin Morin, membre du jury, qui lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que le jury s\u2019\u00e9tait pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019affaire et avait constat\u00e9 qu\u2019on l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 interview\u00e9 \u00e0 Victoria et que, de ce fait, le processus prendrait fin.\n[traduction]\nR. Et c\u2019est environ 15 minutes plus tard, je crois, que j\u2019ai re\u00e7u un appel de Ron Tarnawski, le pr\u00e9sident du jury, qui m\u2019a dit : permettez-moi d\u2019expliquer exactement ce que je voulais dire; c\u2019est uniquement parce que vous avez \u00e9chou\u00e9 au concours de Victoria, o\u00f9 l\u2019on vous a exclu parce que vous aviez \u00e9chou\u00e9. Et nous avons ensuite parl\u00e9 du fait que cela n\u2019avait aucun sens parce que si vous avez \u00e9chou\u00e9 ce n\u2019est pas ce que \u2013 ce n\u2019est pas ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 sur l\u2019avis. [\u2026]\n[\u2026] Mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que j\u2019ai pu comprendre, c\u2019\u00e9tait, si vous \u00e9tiez \u00e0 Victoria et si vous r\u00e9ussissiez, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il voulait que je croie, alors vous pouviez [\u2026] poser votre candidature et \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de nouveau pour Vancouver, mais, selon moi, cela n\u2019avait aucun sens. [\u2026] et j\u2019ai dit : \u00ab eh bien, cela n\u2019a aucun sens, parce qu\u2019il y a des gens qui se pr\u00e9sentent et qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9ussi, dans ce cas pourquoi leur feriez-vous subir de nouveau un test \u00e0 Vancouver? \u00bb Et il a dit : \u00ab eh bien, jury diff\u00e9rent, questions diff\u00e9rentes \u00bb.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 132, lignes 1 \u00e0 9 et 13 \u00e0 18.\n[102] \u00c0 la suite de cette conversation, M. Turner a re\u00e7u une lettre, la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 68 \u00bb, dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2004, de la part de M. Tarnawski et de M. Northcott, disant : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] si vous avez pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour le poste susmentionn\u00e9 depuis le 1er janvier 2002, vous n\u2019avez pas le droit de vous pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce concours \u00bb.\n[traduction]\nQ. Et, juste pour que les choses soient claires, le \u00ab poste susmentionn\u00e9 \u00bb est le poste de Metro Vancouver. Aviez-vous \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 pour ce poste auparavant?\nR. Non [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Puis-je juste clarifier quelque chose ici? Vous avez dit que M. Tarnawski avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique que, parce que vous aviez \u00e9chou\u00e9 au concours de Victoria, vous n\u2019aviez pas le droit de pr\u00e9senter votre candidature pour le poste de Vancouver.\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et cela s\u2019est pass\u00e9 en avril 2004?\nR. De 2004.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et vous avez re\u00e7u cette lettre [\u2026] le 1er juin 2004.\nR. Oui.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et si l\u2019on examine le premier paragraphe, comment l\u2019avez-vous compris?\nR. J\u2019ai compris que, si j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 pour le concours susmentionn\u00e9, o\u00f9 il est dit, o\u00f9 l\u2019on mentionne express\u00e9ment Metro Vancouver, Pacific Highway et l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, que je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas admissible \u00e0 ce concours. Et je n\u2019avais pas pass\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue pour ce poste\u2011l\u00e0 et c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle je me posais des questions. M\u00eame si cela est indiqu\u00e9, que c\u2019est ce que c\u2019est, c\u2019est quand m\u00eame la m\u00eame chose que sur l\u2019avis. Je n\u2019avais pas pass\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue pour ce poste-l\u00e0.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et ensuite, vous avez \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 \u2013\nR. Oui, effectivement, parce que je voulais \u00eatre s\u00fbr de recevoir quelque chose par \u00e9crit. On dit ici que, si j\u2019ai besoin de renseignements, je devais pr\u00e9senter une demande par \u00e9crit. J\u2019ai donc envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u2013\nMe Yazbeck : Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019onglet 69.\nR. L\u2019onglet 69, merci. Je remerciais les membres du jury de m\u2019avoir donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de poser ma candidature et je voulais, je leur ai dit que j\u2019avais re\u00e7u ma lettre d\u2019exclusion et que je voulais qu\u2019ils mettent par \u00e9crit ce dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question lors de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique que j\u2019avais eue avec eux. Et je voulais qu\u2019ils v\u00e9rifient, et j\u2019ai dit que je ne m\u2019\u00e9tais pas inscrit pour les endroits indiqu\u00e9s dans le concours. [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Je devine que leur r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9, j\u2019imagine que le poste \u00e9tait celui d\u2019inspecteur des douanes et que le lieu importait peu? Est-ce l\u00e0 l\u2019explication qu\u2019ils vous dont donn\u00e9e?\nR. Ils ont dit, oui, c\u2019est le poste. Mais pas d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qui est indiqu\u00e9 sur l\u2019avis. Ce dernier, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019on m\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire, l\u2019avis porte sur ce qu\u2019il y est dit, qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un poste \u00e0 Metro Vancouver. Et le poste, m\u00eame si c\u2019est un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent dans un a\u00e9roport de grande taille qu\u2019ici, dans un port maritime. Il ne me viendrait m\u00eame pas \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que (inaudible) on dit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit du m\u00eame poste exactement.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 135, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page 136,\nlignes 1 \u00e0 2 et 12 \u00e0 25; page 137, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 140, lignes 1 \u00e0 23.\n[103] Le pr\u00e9sident a pos\u00e9 d\u2019autres questions \u00e0 M. Turner afin de v\u00e9rifier si ce dernier croyait que l\u2019avis concernait la cat\u00e9gorie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des inspecteurs des douanes ou les inspecteurs des douanes \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Turner a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa conviction que la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi concernait le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Metro Vancouver.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et ensuite, si je passe \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 75, dans la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019Agence \u00e0 votre plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des droits de la personne, \u00e0 la page 566, on dit : \u00ab Lors de votre entrevue du 26 avril 2004, on vous a inform\u00e9 de la restriction indiqu\u00e9e sur l\u2019avis : les candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue s\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002, M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu que non. \u00bb\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : \u00c0 l\u2019entrevue, vous a-t-on demand\u00e9 si vous aviez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 votre candidature pour le poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002?\nR. Oui, on me l\u2019a demand\u00e9.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Que vous a-t-on demand\u00e9 exactement?\nR. On m\u2019a dit : avez-vous jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 votre candidature, et Ron Tarnawski a dit : pour \u00ab ce poste \u00bb, et il avait une copie du poste, de l\u2019avis, sur son bureau; il a dit : pour \u00ab ce poste \u00bb. Quand on fait cela, je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il s\u2019agit, vous savez, qu\u2019il est question du poste de Vancouver. Jamais je n\u2019avais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ma candidature pour Vancouver auparavant \u2013 ou plut\u00f4t, excusez-moi, jamais je n\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 auparavant pour Vancouver. [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et comment avez-vous compris la question?\nR. C\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019il faisait simplement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au poste \u00e0 l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver de Metro Vancouver. Parce qu\u2019avant cela, les postes \u00e9taient toujours distincts.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 155, lignes 4 \u00e0 25;\npage 156, lignes 1 et 8 \u00e0 12.\n[104] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a aussi pos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner d\u2019autres questions sur le sujet :\n[traduction]\nQ. M. Turner, passons maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 80. [\u2026] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une autre lettre \u00e0 (sic) [de] l\u2019Agence \u00e0 la Commission, qui d\u00e9crit le poste. Cette lettre date de f\u00e9vrier 2007. Et j\u2019aimerais vous amener \u00e0 la page 624, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la seconde page de la lettre. Le second paragraphe, le paragraphe complet, qui commence par : \u00ab Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que M. Turner ne disait parfois pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Par exemple, lorsqu\u2019il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 candidat lors d\u2019un concours r\u00e9cent, on a conclu qu\u2019il ne disait pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. \u00bb Je m\u2019arr\u00eate ici. Avant d\u2019avoir vu cette lettre, \u00e9tiez-vous au courant que l\u2019Agence avait conclu que ce que vous aviez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au sujet de la pr\u00e9sentation de votre candidature pour le poste n\u2019\u00e9tait pas v\u00e9ridique?\nR. Non, pas du tout. Cela ne m\u2019\u00e9tait pas venu \u00e0 l\u2019esprit avant que j\u2019obtienne ceci au moyen de ma (inaudible) demande.\nQ. Et l\u2019Agence vous a-t-elle jamais donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer, de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle vous ne disiez pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 (sic)?\nR. Non.\nQ. Et, dans le m\u00eame paragraphe, on dit que vous avez enjoliv\u00e9 votre curriculum vit\u00e6 au sujet de vos fonctions d\u2019agent de police, que l\u00e0 encore ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vrai. Tout d\u2019abord, avez-vous jamais indiqu\u00e9 dans votre curriculum vit\u00e6, ou ailleurs, que vous \u00e9tiez agent de police?\nR. Non, pas du tout.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, qu\u2019avez-vous dit que vous \u00e9tiez?\nR. J\u2019ai dit que j\u2019\u00e9tais un agent de police auxiliaire, avec plus de 2 000 heures d\u2019exp\u00e9rience b\u00e9n\u00e9vole.\nTranscription : volume I, section II, page 164, lignes 16 \u00e0 25;\npage 165, lignes 1 \u00e0 19.\nLe contre-interrogatoire de Levan Turner [105] En contre-interrogeant M. Turner, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait pour t\u00e2che de trouver une explication logique pour la d\u00e9cision, prise par un comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen de la direction dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7003, selon laquelle M. Turner n\u2019avait pas les comp\u00e9tences et les aptitudes requises pour \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 comme inspecteur des douanes, une fonction qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9e pendant les quatre ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Cette conclusion, \u00e0 savoir que M. Turner n\u2019avait pas pu d\u00e9montrer ses comp\u00e9tences, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e apr\u00e8s une entrevue de deux heures au cours de laquelle les membres du jury menant l\u2019entrevue ont fait abstraction du fait qu\u2019ils savaient personnellement que M. Turner avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e et avait obtenu des examens du rendement positifs pendant les quatre ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 il avait travaill\u00e9 comme inspecteur des douanes dans le cadre d\u2019un contrat saisonnier.\n[106] Le contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait pour but d\u2019essayer de montrer que les gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, du fait de leurs examens positifs concernant M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, n\u2019auraient pas pu exercer \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Turner des actes contemporains de discrimination ou de traitement diff\u00e9rent, tant avant que pendant le processus d\u2019entrevue.\n[107] \u00c0 son point culminant, le contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas parvenu \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination du fait de la race, de l\u2019\u00e2ge et de la d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Turner. Transcription : volume 2, section 3, pages 137 \u00e0 145.\n[108] Au sujet des [traduction] \u00ab Objectifs \u00bb et des [traduction] \u00ab Attentes en mati\u00e8re de rendement \u00bb :\n[traduction]\nQ. Le premier est de \u00ab fournir un service de qualit\u00e9 \u00e0 nos clients internes et externes \u00bb et voici l\u2019\u00e9valuation que l\u2019on a faite de vous, M. Turner : \u00ab Levan continue de fournir, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e, un service de qualit\u00e9 au public voyageur ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ses pairs. Un exemple de cela est la formation en cours d\u2019emploi de nouveaux employ\u00e9s. Levan fait preuve de courtoisie et de savoir aupr\u00e8s du public voyageur afin que celui-ci sache quels sont ses droits et ses obligations. \u00bb\nMaintenant, M. Turner, vous avez dit, et le fondement de votre plainte, est qu\u2019il y avait quelque chose qui clochait. Votre employeur avait quelque chose \u00e0 vous reprocher, est-ce exact, sur le plan du poids \u2013\nR. Oui.\nQ. \u2013 de l\u2019\u00e2ge? \u2013\nR. Exact.\nQ \u2013 de la race?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Ce n\u2019est certainement pas ce qui ressort de vos examens du rendement, n\u2019est\u2011ce pas?\nR. Non.\nQ. De fa\u00e7on syst\u00e9matique, dans tous ces examens du rendement, ils vous ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 favorablement?\nR. Oui. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 stup\u00e9fait de recevoir en fin de compte ce courriel de Terry.\nQ. Donc, s\u2019il y avait une intention calcul\u00e9e de vous traiter de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9quitable, vous vous attendiez \u00e0 tout le contraire? Vous vous attendriez \u00e0 ce que ces \u2013 ces \u2013 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement, la discrimination, qu\u2019elle commence \u00e0 appara\u00eetre sous la forme d\u2019\u00e9valuations n\u00e9gatives dans vos examens du rendement, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nMe Yazbeck : Non, je vais formuler une objection. Je ne \u2013 mon coll\u00e8gue demande au t\u00e9moin de pr\u00e9sumer ce que les gestionnaires de l\u2019Agence ont pu faire pour se livrer \u00e0 cette tentative calcul\u00e9e.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question valable, Me Stark.\nM. Turner : D\u00e9sol\u00e9, pourriez-vous la r\u00e9p\u00e9ter?\n[\u2026]\nQ. Ne pensez-vous pas que, s\u2019il y avait une intention calcul\u00e9e, ils auraient commenc\u00e9 par faire des remarques d\u00e9favorables sur vous \u00e0 propos de votre rendement?\nR. Non, et la raison pour cela est que, vu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un organisme gouvernemental, je ne pense pas qu\u2019on voudrait inscrire quelque chose comme cela, surtout par rapport \u00e0 la race, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou le poids, dans un document \u00e9crit quelconque. Ce serait suicidaire.\nQ. Absolument, mais, pour ce qui est de l\u2019\u00e9valuation globale de vos aptitudes et de vos comp\u00e9tences, elle n\u2019est pas neutre, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Non.\nQ. Elle est tr\u00e8s nettement favorable.\nR. Correct.\nQ. S\u2019il y avait eu une intention calcul\u00e9e de leur part de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 votre endroit, ils auraient pu faire des commentaires neutres \u2013\nR. Et ensuite, j\u2019aurais pu contester.\nQ. Mais ils ne l\u2019ont pas fait, n\u2019est-ce pas? Ils vous ont donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences tr\u00e8s \u00e9logieuses dans presque toutes les cat\u00e9gories?\nR. Oui, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019ils ont fait.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Oui.\nQ. Les seules pr\u00e9occupations que \u2013 les deux pr\u00e9occupations, celles que je vous ai mentionn\u00e9es au sujet du fait de \u2013 la mani\u00e8re dont vous portez les questions \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la direction et comment vous demandez de le faire de mani\u00e8re constructive, et il y a ensuite les probl\u00e8mes avec Terry Klassen dont nous allons parler dans une seconde? Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 des seules pr\u00e9occupations port\u00e9es \u00e0 votre attention.\nR. Eh bien, l\u2019autre ne l\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, pas que je m\u2019en souvienne, mais oui.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Mais M. Klassen n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 votre attention?\nR. Eh bien, pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci. Il devait en parler apr\u00e8s mon examen du rendement. Oui, nous avons eu cette discussion.\nQ. Bien. Tr\u00e8s bien, et, si nous passons au second objectif sur cette premi\u00e8re page, page 2\u201133 du recueil des documents, l\u2019objectif est \u2013 le but est : \u00ab prendre des d\u00e9cisions appropri\u00e9es qui cadrent avec les priorit\u00e9s des douanes dans un milieu en constante \u00e9volution \u00bb, et l\u2019\u00e9valuation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite est : \u00ab Levan continue d\u2019apprendre et d\u2019appliquer ses connaissances. Il est donc en mesure de fournir aux clients un meilleur service et de meilleures options. Il est capable de fonctionner seul dans le secteur commercial BBO et Clipper. Il lui est arriv\u00e9 de jouer un r\u00f4le de chef de file lorsque le surintendant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sur les lieux \u00bb.\nL\u00e0 encore, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une \u00e9valuation tr\u00e8s favorable, n\u2019est-ce pas \u2013 une \u00e9valuation de votre travail?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Ce n\u2019est pas neutre?\nR. Non.\nQ. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un message clair que la direction, pour ce qui est de votre rendement, est satisfaite de la fa\u00e7on dont vous faites votre travail?\nR. Oui, avec \u2013 Terry l\u2019est en tout cas, oui.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Parce que, ne l\u2019oubliez pas, ce n\u2019est sign\u00e9 que par une seule personne.\nQ. Maintenant, vous avez mentionn\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est sign\u00e9 que par une seule personne. Je ne vais pas contester cela. Je veux juste que vous confirmiez et reconnaissiez qu\u2019au-del\u00e0 de ces objectifs, on y voit les noms ou le nom d\u2019un gestionnaire, et il y a trois personnes ici. Il y a M. Gibbons.\nR. Exact.\nQ. T. Klassen et R. Pinninger.\nR. Oui.\nQ. Ils \u00e9taient, en fait, votre \u00e9quipe de direction, celle qui vous supervisait?\nR. Eh bien, Terry \u00e9tait surintendant int\u00e9rimaire, et les deux autres \u00e9taient \u2013 je crois que Mara \u00e9tait surintendante int\u00e9rimaire et que Rick \u00e9tait surintendant, alors, oui. J\u2019ignore s\u2019ils ont r\u00e9ellement lu cela ou s\u2019ils l\u2019ont sign\u00e9 \u2013 ou quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre, je ne peux donc pas le certifier.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Vous aller devoir le leur demander.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, et sous ce troisi\u00e8me objectif, on peut lire : \u00ab Communique efficacement avec les clients et les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00bb, et votre \u00e9valuation est la suivante : \u00ab Apr\u00e8s avoir observ\u00e9 Levan, ce dernier a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est capable d\u2019\u00eatre clair et concis avec les voyageurs et les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe. Les communications avec les surintendants, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du Rapport \u00e9clair, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 minimes \u00bb.\nR. Exact.\nQ. Et je consid\u00e8re que \u00ab les communications avec les surintendants par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du Rapport \u00e9clair ont \u00e9t\u00e9 minimes \u00bb, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un commentaire favorable, plut\u00f4t que d\u00e9favorable \u2013\u2013\nR. Oui.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, l\u00e0 encore, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un commentaire favorable, d\u2019une \u00e9valuation positive, sur ce plan?\nR. Oui.\nQ. L\u2019objectif suivant est le num\u00e9ro 4, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la page. Il indique : \u00ab Travaille en collaboration avec les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe et d\u2019autres \u00e9quipes \u00bb, et ensuite, la r\u00e9ponse et elle se rapporte \u00e0 vous : \u00ab Apr\u00e8s avoir observ\u00e9 Levan, j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il donnait souvent un coup de main pour les navires de croisi\u00e8re, ainsi que pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des tableaux de service quotidiens. Levan s\u2019est montr\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer un r\u00f4le de chef de file quand on lui en faisait la demande et il a fourni des conseils aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s. \u00bb\nR. Oui, cela montre que je travaillais pas mal fort, oui.\nQ. Et est-ce l\u00e0 une repr\u00e9sentation juste de votre travail?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Pas une repr\u00e9sentation injuste? Elle repr\u00e9sente le rendement dont vous faisiez preuve?\nR. Oui. On y dit que j\u2019\u00e9tais un bon employ\u00e9 et que je travaillais fort, et j\u2019\u00e9tais vraiment occup\u00e9.\nQ. Maintenant, en dernier lieu, sur cette page et dans ce document, on dit : \u00ab 5; assure l\u2019application \u00e9quitable, responsable et efficace de nos programmes \u00bb et, ensuite, votre \u00e9valuation est : Levan a une bonne connaissance de l\u2019application des mesures douani\u00e8res ainsi que du processus de P.O. C\u2019est ce que d\u00e9notent les mentions suivantes : saisies 8-1-1, \u2013 trait d\u2019union \u2013 6002 \u2013 6063 et 2 mandats OP et \u00ab avertissement DDA \u00bb?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une bonne \u00e9valuation, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Oui \u2013 effectivement. Cela montre que j\u2019\u00e9tais un bon inspecteur des douanes.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, maintenant, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la page, c\u2019est l\u00e0 \u2013 il s\u2019agit essentiellement de la page de signature.\nR. Oui.\nQ. Il y a quelques derniers \u2013 et on donne comme \u00e9valuation que vous r\u00e9pondez aux objectifs d\u2019\u00e9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9raux?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien, il y a une autre cat\u00e9gorie au-dessus qui, je le suppose, elle exc\u00e8de, mais on a certainement jug\u00e9 que vous r\u00e9pondiez aux crit\u00e8res appropri\u00e9s?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Et, ensuite, le gestionnaire a \u00e9crit quelques commentaires ici. Il dit : \u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019\u00e9valuation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, r\u00e9digez un bref \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00bb, et il a r\u00e9pondu ceci, il a essentiellement dit : \u00ab admissible \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 \u00bb?\nR. Exact.\nQ. Donc, \u00e0 en juger par cet examen du rendement, et il s\u2019agissait en fait du dernier, je suppose, que vous \u00e9tiez \u2013 cet examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pendant que vous travailliez \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC?\nR. Oui.\nQ. S\u2019agit-il d\u2019un examen tr\u00e8s favorable?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Et, il est clairement indiqu\u00e9 ici que vous \u00eates admissible \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une indication claire, au moins, que la direction veut vous ravoir la saison suivante?\nR. Eh bien, c\u2019est une indication claire que je peux \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de mes qualifications.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Cela ne dit pas que la direction veut me ravoir.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. \u00c7a dit juste que je peux \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9. Il y a une diff\u00e9rence.\nLa preuve prima facie \u2013 le seuil en mati\u00e8re de preuve [109] Je conclus que le t\u00e9moignage que M. Turner a fait en contre-interrogatoire a \u00e9tay\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage direct et digne de foi; que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 lui seul, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination, tel qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[110] Par ailleurs, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Turner se renforce lorsqu\u2019on le consid\u00e8re dans le contexte du long t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019a fait M. Chris Hughes au sujet des pratiques et des proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\nE. Le t\u00e9moin Terry Berent Klassen [111] M. Klassen a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il exer\u00e7ait les fonctions d\u2019agent des services frontaliers et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au service de l\u2019ASFC depuis 18 ans. Il avait pass\u00e9 les huit derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es \u00e0 Victoria, o\u00f9 il avait appris \u00e0 conna\u00eetre M. Turner en tant que coll\u00e8gue de travail, surtout au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2003 quand, \u00e0 titre de surintendant int\u00e9rimaire au sein de la Section du secteur maritime, il le supervisait.\n[112] Quand l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019on explique le processus suivi pour \u00e9valuer le rendement d\u2019un employ\u00e9, M. Klassen a d\u00e9crit les buts et les objectifs qui sont expos\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 et que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, nous les rencontrions de nouveau et jetions un coup d\u2019\u0153il aux buts et aux objectifs, et nous leur faisions savoir ce que nous pensions; soit ils les atteignaient, soit ils ne les atteignaient pas \u00bb. Transcription : 19 janvier 2009 : page 15, lignes 15 \u00e0 18.\n[113] M. Klassen a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 77 \u00bb (dans le volume 3 \u2013 Recueil des pi\u00e8ces de l\u2019intim\u00e9e), un document dat\u00e9 du 26 septembre 2003, comme \u00e9tant le rapport sur le rendement de M. Turner qu\u2019il avait pass\u00e9 en revue avec ce dernier ce soir-l\u00e0.\n[traduction]\nMe Stark : Avez-vous eu une longue discussion avec M. Turner au sujet de son rendement cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0?\nR. L\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement que nous avons ici devant nous aurait probablement dur\u00e9, je ne sais pas, 10 \u00e0 15 minutes peut-\u00eatre, apr\u00e8s quoi Levan et moi y aurions appos\u00e9 notre signature, je lui en aurais donn\u00e9 une copie, et ensuite nous aurions parl\u00e9 un peu plus [\u2026] quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont Levan \u00e9tait per\u00e7u, comment les surintendants de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 Victoria consid\u00e9raient son \u00e9thique du travail.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009 : page 24, lignes 3 \u00e0 8 et 14 \u00e0 16.\n[114] Lors du t\u00e9moignage de M. Klassen sur l\u2019\u00e9thique du travail de M. Turner, le pr\u00e9sident est intervenu, a dit \u00e0 M. Klassen qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore tr\u00e8s vague et a enjoint l\u2019avocat de l\u2019amener sur la bonne voie. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a ensuite produit la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 80 \u00bb, que M. Klassen a identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame et portant sur la discussion qu\u2019il avait eue avec M. Turner apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue et sign\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation. Le texte de ce courriel est en partie le suivant :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Je suis alors entr\u00e9 dans le vif du sujet et j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler de la fa\u00e7on dont il est per\u00e7u, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il se soustrait parfois aux t\u00e2ches plus difficiles, ou qu\u2019il conna\u00eet la bonne proc\u00e9dure (une t\u00e2che difficile) \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter, mais demande \u00ab conseil \u00bb au surintendant dans l\u2019espoir que ce dernier se serve de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et choisisse la voie la plus facile. Je lui ai aussi fait remarquer que d\u2019autres inspecteurs s\u2019\u00e9taient plaints du fait qu\u2019il laissait les d\u00e9caissements \u00e0 d\u2019autres au lieu de s\u2019en occuper lui-m\u00eame durant son quart. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s bienveillante, et Levan a r\u00e9agi avec stupeur, mais pas de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9fensive. Il a pass\u00e9 son temps \u00e0 dire que cela va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son \u00e9thique de travail ou de sa nature, ainsi que de la fa\u00e7on dont il voit le monde. Il a demand\u00e9 pourquoi on ne lui en avait pas parl\u00e9 auparavant et j\u2019ai r\u00e9pondu que je l\u2019ignorais et que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas inclus dans son \u00e9valuation parce qu\u2019on ne le lui avait pas dit et qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas y r\u00e9pondre ou prendre des mesures correctives. Il a estim\u00e9 que, si les surintendants lui avaient fait part \u00e0 ce moment de leurs pr\u00e9occupations, il aurait pu expliquer ses gestes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme une personne que les t\u00e2ches difficiles rebutent.\nJ\u2019ai ensuite expliqu\u00e9 que cette perception existait depuis quelques \u00e9t\u00e9s et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un aspect qu\u2019il devrait am\u00e9liorer l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante en ex\u00e9cutant ces t\u00e2ches difficiles et en \u00e9tant conscient de ses d\u00e9cisions, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter d\u2019opter pour la voie facile. Je lui ai rappel\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ainsi qu\u2019on le percevait tout le temps, mais que je le consid\u00e9rais plut\u00f4t comme un excellent communicateur qui travaillait bien avec le public et qui continuait d\u2019approfondir ses connaissances. [\u2026]\n[115] Quand on l\u2019a interrog\u00e9 sur le courriel, M. Klassen a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nM. Klassen : L\u2019information que l\u2019on trouve ici ne se refl\u00e8te pas dans son \u00e9valuation parce que Levan n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ces points. Il est donc injuste de fonder son \u00e9valuation sur ces perceptions ou ces observations, parce qu\u2019on n\u2019en avait pas discut\u00e9 avec lui \u00e0 ce stade, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle vous ne voyez aucune de ces observations, pr\u00e9occupations ou perceptions dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement de 2003, de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2003.\nJ\u2019ai donc eu cette conversation avec Levan en pr\u00e9vision de son retour chez nous en 2004, car j\u2019avais recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit r\u00e9embauch\u00e9. Ensuite, le surintendant qui serait le sien l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante pourrait avoir \u2013 pourrait voir que cette conversation avait eu lieu avec Levan et, comment dire, il aurait pu travailler avec lui afin de s\u2019assurer que ces objectifs, ces points d\u2019apprentissage, \u00e9taient atteints l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e : Tr\u00e8s bien. Maintenant, qui \u2013 est-ce que quelqu\u2019un, peut\u2011\u00eatre l\u2019un des autres surintendants, vous a demand\u00e9 d\u2019avoir cette conversation avec M. Turner?\nM. Klassen : Je crains de ne pas m\u2019en souvenir. Ce serait \u2013 je pense que c\u2019\u00e9tait une initiative de ma part, mais je crains qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse que d\u2019une supposition.\nTranscription : page 26, lignes 5 \u00e0 25, page 27, lignes 1 \u00e0 3.\n[116] Le pr\u00e9sident est intervenu de nouveau et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Klassen si son courriel avait trait \u00e0 la discussion qu\u2019il avait eue avec M. Turner apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen du rendement.\n[traduction]\nR. J\u2019ai soulev\u00e9 ces questions, oui, \u00e0 partir de ce courriel \u2013 d\u00e9sol\u00e9, j\u2019ai soulev\u00e9 \u2013 j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 avec Levan de ces probl\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents, des perceptions que l\u2019on avait au sujet de lui; j\u2019ai ensuite r\u00e9sum\u00e9 le tout et j\u2019en ai fait part au chef dans ce courriel.\nTranscription : page 1764, lignes 2 \u00e0 6.\n[117] Le pr\u00e9sident a persist\u00e9 et a demand\u00e9 pourquoi le courriel, la pi\u00e8ce \u00ab onglet 80 \u00bb, n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner. La r\u00e9ponse de M. Klassen para\u00eet valable; cependant, en contre\u2011interrogatoire, elle s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00eatre une exag\u00e9ration irresponsable et non une r\u00e9ponse factuelle.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous avez \u00e9crit ceci, selon ceci, vous l\u2019avez r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le 3 octobre et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Diane Cavalaars et aux autres surintendants le lendemain.\nR. Oui, c\u2019est \u2013 je crois que j\u2019avais probablement le courriel sous forme d\u2019\u00e9bauche depuis un certain temps et que \u2013 je m\u2019excuse, je ne me souviens pas si j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 le r\u00e9diger aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s m\u2019\u00eatre entretenu avec Levan ou s\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 quelques jours avant que je commence \u00e0 le faire.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, le courriel qui expose les d\u00e9tails, nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu auparavant, je crois, et sans le passer en revue en d\u00e9tail, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 des pr\u00e9occupations que d\u2019autres avaient exprim\u00e9es, et le courriel refl\u00e9tait aussi quelques-unes de vos propres pr\u00e9occupations?\nR. C\u2019est exact, avec certaines des pr\u00e9occupations des autres surintendants et certaines de mes pr\u00e9occupations. [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Pourquoi ne pas lui avoir transmis ce courriel et l\u2019avoir port\u00e9 \u00e0 sa connaissance [\u2026]\nR. [\u2026] Je crains de ne pas savoir pourquoi il n\u2019en a pas re\u00e7u une copie, pourquoi je ne lui ai pas transmis une copie du courriel \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nTranscription : page 29, ligne 25, page 29, lignes 1 \u00e0 25, page 33, lignes 22 \u00e0 25, page 34, lignes 8 \u00e0 10.\n[118] \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir de M. Klassen qu\u2019il clarifie son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de l\u2019origine des perceptions concernant M. Turner.\n[traduction]\nMe Stark : Tr\u00e8s bien. Vous dites l\u00e0 aussi que c\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont il est per\u00e7u. S\u2019agit-il de la perception d\u2019autres personnes, ou de la v\u00f4tre?\nM. Klassen : La perception de la fa\u00e7on dont il \u00e9tait per\u00e7u \u00e9tait \u2013 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 celle d\u2019autres surintendants, ainsi que de certains de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : [\u2026] o\u00f9 est-ce que cela est dit, la fa\u00e7on dont il est per\u00e7u?\nMe Stark : Nulle part. Je lui pose de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale une question sur le sujet. Ce n\u2019est pas dans son courriel, m\u00eame si je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, en un sens je suppose, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re ligne, qui dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 dans le vif du sujet et qu\u2019il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 parler de la fa\u00e7on dont il \u00e9tait per\u00e7u?\n[119] M. Klassen a qualifi\u00e9 de table ronde la r\u00e9union des surintendants tenue \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, mais il n\u2019a nomm\u00e9 comme participants que lui-m\u00eame, Rick Penneger et Mara Gibbons; c\u2019\u00e9tait Rick Penneger qui [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] [avait] fait des commentaires li\u00e9s \u00e0 certaines de ces perceptions selon lesquelles il cherchait une solution facile, [\u2026] qu\u2019il n\u2019aidait peut\u2011\u00eatre pas autant que certaines des autres agents \u00bb. Transcription : 21 janvier 2009 : page 36, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 37, lignes 1 \u00e0 6 et 24 \u00e0 25; page 38, lignes 1 \u00e0 6.\n[120] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Klassen a admis que le seul incident dans lequel M. Turner avait cens\u00e9ment opt\u00e9 pour une voie facile n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un incident li\u00e9 \u00e0 des mesures d\u2019application de la loi. Il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une situation de nature proc\u00e9durale, concernant des documents \u00e0 remplir, une t\u00e2che qui aurait pu prendre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une heure \u00e0 accomplir. M. Klassen a convenu avec Me Champ, l\u2019avocat du plaignant, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait vraisemblable que M. Turner avait \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les int\u00e9r\u00eats du voyageur. M. Klassen a convenu que M. Turner avait proactivement mis au point un moyen permettant aux agents d\u2019exp\u00e9rience de prendre part \u00e0 des cercles d\u2019apprentissage avec de nouveaux agents, un exemple positif de l\u2019\u00e9thique du travail de M. Turner. N\u00e9anmoins, il a obstin\u00e9ment persist\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que ce seul incident impliquant un voyageur tardif \u00e9tait un raccourci, et que cela cadrait avec la perception que les surintendants avaient de M. Turner.\n[121] Malgr\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re parfois h\u00e9sitant et vague du t\u00e9moignage de M. Klassen, il \u00e9tablit hors de tout doute que les surintendants de Victoria avaient tendance \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer, sans preuve, que M. Turner \u00e9vitait d\u2019accomplir la totalit\u00e9 de ses fonctions \u2013 des pr\u00e9somptions qu\u2019ils intellectualisaient comme des \u00ab perceptions \u00bb n\u00e9gatives \u2013 sachant fort bien que le fait de percevoir M. Turner comme un fain\u00e9ant \u00e9tait diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs propres \u00e9valuations \u00e9logieuses, mises par \u00e9crit dans des examens du rendement, dans chacune des cinq ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 il avait travaill\u00e9 comme inspecteur des douanes nomm\u00e9 pour une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\n[122] Le fait que M. Klassen ait envoy\u00e9 son courriel au surintendant en chef et \u00e0 d\u2019autres surintendants le 4 octobre 2003, une semaine seulement avant la publication d\u2019un avis, dat\u00e9 du 11 octobre 2003, annon\u00e7ant la tenue du concours Victoria 7003, met en doute l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 des membres du jury qui ont interview\u00e9 M. Turner, ainsi que celle de leur conclusion selon laquelle il ne poss\u00e9dait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises pour continuer \u00e0 travailler comme inspecteur des douanes.\nF. Le t\u00e9moin Trevor Baird [123] Au moment de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Baird travaillait pour l\u2019ASFC et l\u2019agence qui l\u2019avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, l\u2019ADRC, depuis quinze ans et il exer\u00e7ait les fonctions de chef des op\u00e9rations au port de Prince Rupert. M. Baird avait pass\u00e9 auparavant quelque temps au sein du secteur des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC dans le Lower Mainland, y compris au sein de l\u2019\u00c9quipe d\u2019intervention mobile, qui s\u2019occupait de l\u2019application de la loi, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 Victoria, de 1999 \u00e0 2004, et il avait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au poste de surintendant en 2002.\n[124] Affectations de travail des inspecteurs des douanes au point d\u2019entr\u00e9e de Victoria.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Lorsque vous \u00eates surintendant dans le secteur maritime, vous \u00eates charg\u00e9 d\u2019un quart particulier; est-ce juste l\u2019agent qui d\u00e9cide o\u00f9 il va aller? Et, si vous travaillez au CDT et s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas grand-chose \u00e0 faire, eh bien, je me dis : je vais aller faire un tour au secteur maritime, ou je vais aller faire un tour \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire, dans les traversiers, ou alors je vais simplement rester assis ici et ne rien faire, ou je vais juste aller me promener un peu. Les choses sont-elles aussi souples que cela?\nR. [\u2026] La fa\u00e7on dont c\u2019est structur\u00e9, c\u2019est que nous nous sommes scind\u00e9s \u2013 Victoria est scind\u00e9e en des unit\u00e9s de travail pr\u00e9cises. [\u2026] Le Centre de d\u00e9claration t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a donc un surintendant qui est charg\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment-l\u00e0 de l\u2019op\u00e9ration.\nLa Section du secteur maritime, qui est charg\u00e9e de toutes les op\u00e9rations de traitement ext\u00e9rieures, ce qui englobe les navires de croisi\u00e8re, les traversiers, les a\u00e9ronefs, les bateaux de plaisance, les hydravions, etc., compte parfois jusqu\u2019\u00e0 trois surintendants qui en sont responsables parce que ce secteur fonctionne sept jours sur sept et comporte un quart de jour et un quart de soir.\nLa salle des comptoirs, notre comptoir de services, comporte habituellement deux membres du personnel qui y travaillent et ceux-ci rel\u00e8vent du surintendant du secteur commercial. Il y a donc trois unit\u00e9s de travail distinctes.\nPour ce qui est des activit\u00e9s maritimes, il y a tous les jours un tableau de service, et l\u2019on attribue au personnel des t\u00e2ches pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 accomplir durant la journ\u00e9e. Et, s\u2019il y a un certain nombre de traversiers qui arrivent, par exemple le Clipper, qui accoste plusieurs fois par jour; le Coho qui accoste, je crois, deux fois par jour \u2013 ou au moins une fois par jour \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u2013 le tableau de service indiquera quels employ\u00e9s seront affect\u00e9s aux traversiers et quelle fonction pr\u00e9cise ils auront \u00e0 effectuer, que ce soit au niveau primaire ou au niveau secondaire.\nMaintenant, vous savez, le tableau de service peut faire l\u2019objet de modification, mais il vous donne un aper\u00e7u de ce que vous ferez cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0.\nPar contre, le CDT est un endroit tr\u00e8s statique. Si vous travaillez au CDT vous savez que vous allez \u00eatre l\u00e0 toute la journ\u00e9e, sauf si votre t\u00e2che consiste \u00e0 sortir et \u00e0 faire d\u2019autres choses.\nLes surintendants en fin de compte, ce dont ils sont responsables, et mon exemple est tr\u00e8s simpliste, c\u2019est d\u2019essayer de g\u00e9rer les ressources dont ils disposent de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 toutes les pressions qui peuvent s\u2019exercer au cours d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Et, s\u2019ils se heurtent \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes au cours de la journ\u00e9e, s\u2019il survient une arriv\u00e9e impr\u00e9vue, ou s\u2019il y a peut-\u00eatre une saisie en cours qui requiert une certaine attention, ils puiseront dans les ressources disponibles afin de \u2013 de faire en sorte que les choses avancent. Il est donc possible qu\u2019un surintendant du secteur maritime t\u00e9l\u00e9phone au CDT et dise : envoyez-moi quelques ressources, nous en avons besoin.\nC\u2019est donc un milieu tr\u00e8s souple et je soup\u00e7onne que, parfois, on a vraiment le sentiment qu\u2019il y a un manque de contr\u00f4le, mais les surintendants sont aux prises avec un nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 de facteurs qui causent des interruptions au cours de leur journ\u00e9e, et ils essaient r\u00e9ellement de faire face \u00e0 tout cela.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 93, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page 94, lignes 1 \u00e0 25;\npage 95, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 96, lignes 1\u00e0 6.\n[125] M.

Baird a fait la description d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e qui suit :\n[traduction]\nEt je crois que mon impression premi\u00e8re date de l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je supervisais Levan et, vous savez, l\u00e0 encore, il y a des choses qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 j\u2019appr\u00e9ciais au sujet de Levan et qu\u2019il fait bien, mais je ne dirais pas de lui qu\u2019il avait atteint son plein potentiel dans toutes les fonctions que l\u2019on attend d\u2019un inspecteur des douanes. Et, lorsqu\u2019on parle d\u2019une partie du travail, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le ou les rapports avec les mandataires ou les courtiers ou, vous savez, le travail au Centre de d\u00e9claration t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ou ces sortes de \u2013 ces parties du travail qui sont davantage ax\u00e9es sur le service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, je crois, vous savez, que Levan a les comp\u00e9tences qu\u2019il faut pour le faire et je pense qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019aise lorsqu\u2019il le fait et qu\u2019il fait, sur ce plan, un excellent travail.\nPour ce qui est des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du travail qui sont plus proactifs sur le plan de l\u2019application de la loi, ainsi que du fait d\u2019essayer de rep\u00e9rer les cas d\u2019inobservation chez les voyageurs, de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen secondaire, de s\u2019occuper des mesures d\u2019application de la loi, comme les saisies, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, selon moi, l\u2019une des forces de Levan.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 97, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 98, lignes 1 \u00e0 13.\n[126] M. Baird a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 75 (recoupement : C\u20111, onglet 12) comme \u00e9tant l\u2019examen du rendement qu\u2019il avait fait de M. Turner au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, un examen qui comprenait les commentaires suivants \u00e0 propos de la comp\u00e9tence organisationnelle.\n[traduction]\nJe vous ai toujours trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s poli et courtois dans vos rapports avec le public et vos coll\u00e8gues de travail. Vous vous pr\u00e9sentez toujours de mani\u00e8re professionnelle, m\u00eame dans des circonstances difficiles. Vous avez une bonne connaissance des r\u00e8glements des Douanes et \u00eates en mesure d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les fonctions financi\u00e8res et commerciales au terminal des traversiers.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 100, lignes 8 \u00e0 15.\n[127] L\u2019examen contenait l\u2019addenda suivant : [traduction] \u00ab Les questions et les pr\u00e9occupations relatives au travail devraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re constructive de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir trouver une solution positive. \u00bb Transcription : 21 janvier 2009; page 101, lignes 8 \u00e0 11.\n[128] Ce commentaire concernait les moments o\u00f9, en dehors des heures de travail, on avait remarqu\u00e9 que M. Turner et d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s entretenaient des discussions \u00e0 b\u00e2tons rompus au cours desquelles ils se plaignaient de choses qui se passaient au travail. M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si les plaintes \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes, il fallait que ces probl\u00e8mes soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re constructive.\n[129] Dans cet examen du rendement effectu\u00e9 au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 (pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 12), apr\u00e8s l\u2019addenda, M. Baird a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nVous avez la capacit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente de communiquer efficacement avec les clients et vos coll\u00e8gues de travail. Vous \u00eates capable de r\u00e9diger des rapports d\u00e9taill\u00e9s et bien \u00e9crits ainsi que de remplir avec exactitude les formulaires des Douanes. Vous \u00eates capable de poser efficacement des questions, d\u2019\u00e9couter les r\u00e9ponses et de r\u00e9agir en cons\u00e9quence. Vous avez ce qu\u2019il faut pour devenir un interrogateur tr\u00e8s efficace.\nDepuis que nous avons discut\u00e9 du besoin de pr\u00e9senter les probl\u00e8mes de mani\u00e8re constructive, j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que vous avez imm\u00e9diatement entrepris de rectifier ce probl\u00e8me. Je suis conscient des efforts que vous avez faits et je vous encourage \u00e0 continuer d\u2019aborder de fa\u00e7on constructive les probl\u00e8mes non r\u00e9solus. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nJe vous encourage aussi \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l\u2019application de la loi en effectuant des examens secondaires.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 106, ligne 25; page 107, lignes 1 \u00e0 8; page 108, lignes 13 \u00e0 19; page 109, lignes 22 \u00e0 25.\n[130] Dans son contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat du plaignant, Me Champ, a mis l\u2019accent sur les pr\u00e9occupations qu\u2019avait M. Baird quant au manque d\u2019exp\u00e9rience de M. Turner concernant l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019examens secondaires.\n[traduction]\nR. \u00c0 la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire, il faut entre autres faire des interrogatoires. Il faut aussi inspecter des v\u00e9hicules, examiner des bagages, faire affaire avec des personnes qui sont en d\u00e9tention ou sous garde, effectuer des fouilles personnelles ou \u2013 les fouilles personnelles sont un terme technique \u2013 des fouilles \u00e0 nu. Ce que je veux donc dire c\u2019est qu\u2019il a une excellente connaissance de nos proc\u00e9dures au niveau primaire et au niveau secondaire, mais je ne parle pas express\u00e9ment des interrogatoires.\nQ. Un interrogatoire serait-il un examen?\nR. Cela ferait partie d\u2019un examen.\nQ. Parce que le dernier est : \u00ab Vous faites \u00e9galement preuve d\u2019un bon jugement dans le cadre des activit\u00e9s relatives aux examens secondaires et aux mesures d\u2019application de la loi \u00bb. Je pr\u00e9sume que cela comprendrait les interrogatoires?\nR. Effectivement.\nQ. Donc, je suppose dans l\u2019ensemble, ce que j\u2019essaie de dire, M. Baird, c\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 mi-terme, vous avez remarqu\u00e9 que M. Turner, selon vous, ne participait pas \u00e0 beaucoup d\u2019examens secondaires; est-ce exact?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Donc, en d\u2019autres mots, votre opinion, une fois que vous avez r\u00e9ellement commenc\u00e9 \u2013 une fois que vous lui avez fait remarquer que vous vouliez qu\u2019il en fasse davantage, il a pris les mesures qui convenaient. En fait, vous \u00e9tiez tr\u00e8s satisfait de ce qu\u2019il avait fait.\nR. Exact. Entre le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e0 mi-terme a eu lieu au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt \u2013 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re \u00e9valuation, effectu\u00e9e en octobre.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Et, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, vous dites : \u00ab Vous avez pris part \u00e0 de nombreux examens secondaires \u00bb; est-ce exact?\nQ. Oui.\nQ. [\u2026] et dans un grand nombre de ces examens secondaires, je pr\u00e9sume que M. Turner aurait fait preuve d\u2019initiative, ou qu\u2019il n\u2019essayait pas de se d\u00e9filer, qu\u2019il intervenait et donnait un coup de main?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Parce que, plus t\u00f4t, vous aviez laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019\u00e0 en juger par ce que vous aviez observ\u00e9, il semblait ne pas vraiment s\u2019impliquer?\nR. Oui, c\u2019est le cas.\nQ. Et je crois comprendre qu\u2019il en a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 question \u00e0 la fin de ce contrat?\nR. Oui, effectivement.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 38, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page 39, lignes 1 \u00e0 25;\npage 40, lignes 1 \u00e0 24.\n[131] Quand on lui a parl\u00e9 du concours Victoria 7003, M. Baird a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20111, onglet 47 (recoupement : C\u20112, onglet 43) comme \u00e9tant une feuille ma\u00eetresse concernant l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019il avait fait passer \u00e0 M. Turner \u00e0 Victoria, en compagnie de Mme Pringle et de Mme Zabos. M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les inscriptions apparaissant sur cette feuille avaient trait aux comp\u00e9tences \u00ab Communication interactive efficace \u00bb et \u00ab Travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et collaboration \u00bb; que, dans ces comp\u00e9tences, M. Turner obtenait des notes insuffisantes de 60 et de 40.\n[132] M. Baird a identifi\u00e9 des commentaires \u00e9crits par l\u2019une des membres du jury, Catherine Pringle, que cette derni\u00e8re avait faits apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Turner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9. Mme Pringle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Turner n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clair et concis au sujet de sa relation avec le Service de police de Toronto, ce qui les avait amen\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions d\u2019agent aupr\u00e8s de ce service, plut\u00f4t que celles d\u2019auxiliaire. La pr\u00e9somption du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen d\u00e9coulait du fait que ses membres n\u2019avaient pas examin\u00e9 le curriculum vit\u00e6 de M. Turner, qui indiquait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agent auxiliaire. N\u00e9anmoins, M. Baird et Mme Pringle ont jug\u00e9 que M. Turner n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clair dans ce qu\u2019il avait dit; ipso facto, il avait enjoliv\u00e9 son r\u00e9cit et n\u2019avait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[133] En r\u00e9pondant aux questions de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Baird a plut\u00f4t g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 ses r\u00e9ponses. Par exemple, cela s\u2019est produit lorsque l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird d\u2019indiquer \u00e0 quel endroit, dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite de M. Turner au portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences, ce dernier avait fait des commentaires d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres personnes.\n[traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] Revenons une fois de plus \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 47, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation, nous sommes \u00e0 [\u2026] ensuite, sous \u00ab commentaires \u00bb il y a une autre note : \u00ab Documents \u00e9crits. D\u00e9peint les autres de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable \u00bb. [\u2026] \u00e0 quel endroit, dans les documents de M. Turner, ce dernier d\u00e9peint-il les autres n\u00e9gativement?\nDans un certain nombre des comp\u00e9tences, il y avait des endroits qui semblaient d\u00e9peindre d\u2019autres personnes sous un jour n\u00e9gatif ou critique quant \u00e0 leur participation dans les exemples. La mani\u00e8re de traiter les situations difficiles en \u00e9tait certainement un exemple. Le travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et la collaboration, nous avons \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 dans nos notes certains des commentaires qui, \u00e0 notre avis, \u00e9taient n\u00e9gatifs ou d\u00e9sobligeants \u2013 pas d\u00e9sobligeants, mais critiques quant \u00e0 la participation; il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un exemple, et un autre exemple est la prise de d\u00e9cisions. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 173, lignes 21 \u00e0 25; page 174, lignes 1 \u00e0 5.\n[134] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird de donner un exemple pr\u00e9cis se trouvant dans les documents \u00e9crits de M. Turner, et M. Baird a choisi \u00ab Traitement des situations difficiles \u00bb.\n[traduction]\nR. Dans cet exemple il est question d\u2019un voyageur agit\u00e9. Notre chien d\u00e9tecteur, le ma\u00eetre-chien et le chien tentent de v\u00e9rifier le v\u00e9hicule. Le surintendant y participe, cette fois-l\u00e0 il s\u2019agissait de Nina Patel. Et, essentiellement, le voyageur est agit\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s agressif. Dans l\u2019exemple, il semble que l\u2019individu va retourner aux \u00c9tats-Unis, \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0, il n\u2019est pas admissible.\nEt, dans l\u2019exemple, Levan donne l\u2019exemple d\u2019une fois o\u00f9 il a pris part \u00e0 un certain moment \u00e0 l\u2019examen secondaire et a, selon lui, calm\u00e9 le voyageur et lui a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui se passait, ce qui a essentiellement permis de r\u00e9gler la situation. Et, dans cet exemple, dans les documents \u00e9crits, il y a certaines choses que je voudrais souligner \u2013 et j\u2019\u00e9tais revenu pour les souligner \u2013 qui att\u00e9nuent la participation d\u2019autres personnes. Et il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un point qui est ressorti \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue quand on a voulu l\u2019approfondir, approfondir ces d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis qu\u2019il avait tendance \u00e0 exag\u00e9rer, ou \u00e0 enjoliver son r\u00f4le aux d\u00e9pens des autres personnes en cause.\nSi vous me donnez quelques instants, je vais simplement passer en revue le document \u00e9crit en question. Par exemple : \u00ab Nina est rest\u00e9e derri\u00e8re moi et a tenu d\u2019autres agents \u00e0 distance pendant que je parlais \u00e0 l\u2019individu. Quand elle a pu voir que j\u2019avais r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 le calmer, elle s\u2019est approch\u00e9e et a pris part \u00e0 la conversation. \u00c0 partir de ce moment-l\u00e0, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul agent \u00e0 qui cette personne voulait parler. \u00bb\nDans ce sc\u00e9nario, Nina Patel agissait comme surintendante int\u00e9rimaire. Et, vous savez, une agente qui avait beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience pour ce qui \u00e9tait de faire face \u00e0 des voyageurs hostiles et agressifs dans des situations tr\u00e8s tendues. Et \u2013 selon ma propre exp\u00e9rience, elle n\u2019aurait pas pris du recul et elle n\u2019aurait pas tenu d\u2019autres agents \u00e0 distance pour que quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre puisse intervenir et r\u00e9gler la situation. Donc, m\u00eame si c\u2019\u00e9tait subtil, on ne peut pas dire : je suis arriv\u00e9 et j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 un coup de main, je suis intervenu et j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de calmer la personne. Mais, dans la phrase, il dit : je suis arriv\u00e9 et j\u2019ai pris les choses en main et elle a pris du recul et a tenu les autres \u00e0 distance pendant que je r\u00e9glais la situation. Et cela \u2013 m\u00eame si, en soi, ce n\u2019est pas important, c\u2019est un indice que nous avons not\u00e9.\nTranscription : 21 janvier 2009; page 174, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 175, lignes 1 \u00e0 23;\npage 176, lignes 1 \u00e0 12.\n[135] Avec une prolixit\u00e9 non retenue et confuse, M. Baird a poursuivi sa r\u00e9ponse \u2013 elle s\u2019est \u00e9tendue sur cinq autres pages de transcription \u2013 disant de M. Turner qu\u2019il ne s\u2019exprimait pas clairement et qu\u2019il avait tendance \u00e0 enjoliver les choses. En agissant ainsi, il a fait preuve d\u2019une partialit\u00e9 subjective. Je conclus qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inacceptable de la part de M. Baird de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite de M. Turner au portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences, qui devait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 et \u00e9valu\u00e9 par l\u2019un des surintendants de M. Baird et auquel on avait donn\u00e9 des notes de passage.\n[136] M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le r\u00e9cit que M. Turner avait fait de l\u2019incident avec un voyageur difficile \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il savait lui-m\u00eame quant \u00e0 l\u2019aptitude de Mme Patel \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 des voyageurs hostiles et agressifs dans des situations tr\u00e8s tendues; il avait donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le r\u00e9cit que M. Turner avait fait de l\u2019incident \u00e9tait un enjolivement et il l\u2019avait rejet\u00e9.\n[137] Environ deux semaines apr\u00e8s que le comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen eut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Turner n\u2019\u00e9tait plus qualifi\u00e9 pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes, M. Baird est entr\u00e9 en contact avec Mme Patel pour obtenir sa version de l\u2019incident.\n[138] M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec Mme Patel le 22 janvier 2004 et, se fondant sur ses notes, il avait fait part \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re du r\u00e9cit que M. Turner avait fait de son \u00e9change avec le voyageur difficile; il lui avait demand\u00e9 si ce r\u00e9cit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit de mani\u00e8re exacte. M. Baird s\u2019est report\u00e9 aux notes qu\u2019il avait prises au sujet de sa discussion avec Mme Patel :\n[traduction]\nElle a reconnu que Levan avait bel et bien eu affaire \u00e0 ce voyageur et que, comment dire, il s\u2019\u00e9tait bien d\u00e9brouill\u00e9 avec lui. Elle a fait remarquer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, comment dire, jovial comme \u00e0 l\u2019accoutum\u00e9e, mais elle a ensuite exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord au sujet de la mani\u00e8re dont il avait d\u00e9crit son intervention dans l\u2019exemple, et elle a signal\u00e9 que, disons, il s\u2019arrange pour que les autres aient l\u2019air pire que lui afin de se mettre en valeur. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle est rest\u00e9e ma\u00eetre de la situation. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, selon ses propres paroles, le r\u00e9cit \u00e9tait \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait enjoliv\u00e9 \u00bb. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9, et cela concordait en fait aussi avec le reste, qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas l\u2019impression que son intervention \u00e9tait \u2013 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les \u00e9changes avec ce voyageur. Elle a aussi not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pensait que Levan, selon son point de vue \u00e0 lui, il pouvait penser que c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui \u00e9tait intervenu dans l\u2019exemple.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 22; lignes 7 \u00e0 24.\n[139] En contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird pourquoi il avait jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de communiquer avec Mme Patel alors que Mme Pringle et lui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 exclu M. Turner du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Alors, pourquoi l\u2019avez-vous appel\u00e9e?\nM. Baird : Eh bien, parce que, en fait, je voulais savoir si l\u2019exemple \u2013 parce que, dans l\u2019exemple, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9peint et d\u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, cela m\u2019apparaissait si incoh\u00e9rent que je voulais faire un suivi.\nMe Champ : \u00c0 ce stade, M. Baird, quelle diff\u00e9rence cela faisait-il pour vous? [\u2026]\nR. Eh bien, pour r\u00e9pondre bri\u00e8vement, cela ne faisait aucune diff\u00e9rence, mis \u00e0 part le fait que je voulais y donner suite.\nQ. \u00c0 part le fait de vouloir prouver que M. Turner \u00e9tait un menteur?\nR. Non, je voulais valider si l\u2019exemple, tel qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, \u00e9tait exact ou non.\nQ. Vous vouliez valider son exactitude. Vous vouliez prouver que M. Turner \u00e9tait un menteur, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Je pense, Me Champ, que \u00ab menteur \u00bb c\u2019est un peu fort.\nQ. Nous sommes un mois plus tard. Le processus est maintenant bien avanc\u00e9. M. Turner est d\u00e9j\u00e0 exclu du concours. Pourquoi avez-vous jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de valider l\u2019exactitude des renseignements \u00e0 ce stade?\nR. Parce que, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019entrevue, j\u2019avais des questions et je voulais y trouver une r\u00e9ponse, mais, vous avez bien raison, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que je le fasse.\nQ. Et quel \u00e9tait votre but, qu\u2019alliez-vous en faire?\nR. Aucun but.\n[\u2026]\nQ. [\u2026] Vous avez pris beaucoup d\u2019initiative pour retrouver Mme Patel au Qu\u00e9bec afin d\u2019obtenir ses souvenirs des faits, je me demande tout simplement pourquoi?\nR. [\u2026] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ces faits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, j\u2019avais des questions et j\u2019ai conclu que sa description cadrait si peu avec ce que je savais sur le lieu de travail, c\u2019\u00e9tait, mes observations, je voulais valider cet exemple, ce qui, \u00e0 titre de membre du jury, est une option qui est \u00e0 ma disposition.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 93, lignes 18 \u00e0 25; page 94, lignes 1 \u00e0 22;\npage 96, lignes 2 \u00e0 13.\n[140] \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours du contre-interrogatoire de M. Baird, le pr\u00e9sident et l\u2019avocat du plaignant ont entrepris une discussion sur l\u2019objet des questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Baird.\n[traduction]\nL\u2019avocat du plaignant : Tout d\u2019abord, il (M. Turner) est invit\u00e9 par sa surintendante (Mme Patel). Et sa surintendante se heurte \u00e0 un voyageur difficile. Donc, Mme Patel est l\u00e0, sur place, face \u00e0 ce voyageur difficile. Elle a invit\u00e9 ou elle demande \u00e0 M. Turner de donner un coup de main, d\u2019entrer dans la discussion, de parler \u00e0 cette personne. Ensuite, il a affaire au ma\u00eetre-chien [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Venons-en au fait, Me Champ. Il me semble que je puis poser cette question \u2013 si vous vous pr\u00e9occupiez seulement de la fa\u00e7on dont M. Turner s\u2019\u00e9tait exprim\u00e9 et avait d\u00e9peint ses coll\u00e8gues, mais vous \u00eates all\u00e9 plus loin que cela, n\u2019est-ce pas? Vous dites : en jugeant cet exemple particulier et en le notant, je vais faire des d\u00e9ductions au sujet de ce que je sais de ces deux coll\u00e8gues et je ne crois pas que ceux-ci agiraient de cette fa\u00e7on. Et, ensuite, je mets en doute la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019exemple, ce qui est une chose diff\u00e9rente du simple fait de noter la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9. Vous avez donc fait des d\u00e9ductions au sujet de connaissances externes qui allaient au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019exemple que M. Turner avait donn\u00e9. Est-ce exact?\nM. Baird : C\u2019est exact, mais nous n\u2019avons pas not\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence \u00ab Traitement des situations difficiles \u00bb. Pour ce qui \u00e9tait du travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et de la collaboration, nous nous occupions \u2013 la question de \u2013 ce qui m\u2019a incit\u00e9 \u2013 ce qui m\u2019a incit\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec Nina Patel [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Non, avant cela, parce que vous avez dit qu\u2019avant que vous communiquiez avec \u2013 je comprends ce qui vous a incit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire, parce que c\u2019est elle qui pouvait valider. Et dans votre t\u00e9moignage principal \u2013 principal en particulier, vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que vous ne pensiez pas que Nina Patel ou Ken Moore agiraient de cette fa\u00e7on, parce que vous aviez travaill\u00e9 avec eux pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es.\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous avez donc tenu compte de renseignements externes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans \u2013 dans l\u2019exemple de M. Turner, et vous les avez utilis\u00e9s en partie, ou [inaudible] comme motif pour exclure la candidature de M. Turner. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une partie des raisons pour lesquelles vous ne l\u2019avez pas jug\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9. Tandis que vous dites : je n\u2019ai examin\u00e9 que ce qu\u2019il y avait dans le portefeuille, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont les renseignements \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s, je lui ai pos\u00e9 quelques questions \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue et je n\u2019ai pas aim\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont il communiquait, ou dont il d\u00e9crivait la situation, parce qu\u2019il semble qu\u2019il se donnait le beau r\u00f4le et que toutes les autres personnes en cause avaient le mauvais r\u00f4le. Il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un bon travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe ni d\u2019une bonne collaboration. Exact? Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de vous fonder sur les connaissances que vous aviez de ces deux autres personnes, ni sur la fa\u00e7on dont vous pensiez qu\u2019elles auraient r\u00e9agi, parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une consid\u00e9ration externe. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans la documentation.\nR. C\u2019est exact, Monsieur?\n[\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : M. Baird, si vous aviez t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Patel et si celle-ci avait dit qu\u2019il (Turner) avait tout \u00e0 fait raison dans ce qu\u2019il avait dit, auriez-vous dans ce cas chang\u00e9 votre note?\nR. Non.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 89, lignes 15 \u00e0 22; page 90, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 91, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 92, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 93, lignes 14 \u00e0 25; page 94, lignes 1 \u00e0 23; page 96, lignes 21 \u00e0 23.\n[141] Je conclus que les r\u00e9ponses de M. Baird qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent au sujet de la communication qu\u2019il a eue avec Mme Patel apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue sont peu plausibles. M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant des comp\u00e9tences croissantes de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, il \u00e9tait r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de la part de M. Baird de pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il avait un choix, qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que le jury de s\u00e9lection eut pris sa d\u00e9cision, soit celle de recourir aux pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es connaissances personnelles qu\u2019il avait au sujet de Mme Patel, de M. Moore et du lieu de travail.\n[142] Dans son t\u00e9moignage direct, M. Baird a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il avait pens\u00e9 de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite de M. Turner au portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences :\n[traduction]\nPour ce qui est du portefeuille \u00e9crit, nous avons remarqu\u00e9 que, pas le portefeuille tout entier, mais s\u00fbrement une partie importante du portefeuille qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, nous avons parl\u00e9 du traitement des situations difficiles; nous avons parl\u00e9 de l\u2019adaptabilit\u00e9, nous avons parl\u00e9 du travail d\u2019\u00e9quipe et de la collaboration et c\u2019\u00e9tait dans la pr\u00e9sentation de ses exemples qu\u2019il exag\u00e9rait ou enjolivait son intervention et qu\u2019il d\u00e9crivait sous un jour d\u00e9favorable ou critique le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par d\u2019autres personnes. Donc, essentiellement, il se faisait bien para\u00eetre aux d\u00e9pens des autres personnes en cause, et il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un aspect qui est revenu tout au long de l\u2019entrevue et que le jury a relev\u00e9. Et, l\u00e0 encore, d\u2019apr\u00e8s mes notes plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, on le rel\u00e8ve dans tous les exemples qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 16, lignes 5 \u00e0 19.\nLa pertinence des examens du rendement positifs de M. Turner [143] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a mis en doute la d\u00e9cision du jury selon laquelle M. Turner ne remplissait pas les conditions requises pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes, une d\u00e9cision qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du dossier professionnel favorable de cinq ans de M. Turner, qui comportait des examens du rendement positifs que M. Baird avait effectu\u00e9s en 2003.\n[traduction]\nR. Je n\u2019irais pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire que c\u2019\u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait incoh\u00e9rent; cependant, il y avait une certaine incoh\u00e9rence en ce sens qu\u2019il avait contribu\u00e9 au fil des ans \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe, mais, l\u00e0 encore, nous notions l\u2019exemple pr\u00e9sent\u00e9.\nQ. Et cela faisait abstraction de toutes les autres consid\u00e9rations?\nR. Oui. Nous devons noter ce qu\u2019on nous pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 28, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 29, lignes 1 \u00e0 2.\n[144] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird que les normes d\u2019\u00e9valuation figurant dans l\u2019avis affich\u00e9 au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Victoria informaient les candidats qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s au moyen de tests uniformis\u00e9s, d\u2019examens \u00e9crits, d\u2019entrevues, de v\u00e9rifications des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences ainsi que de rapports sur le rendement au travail.\n[traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] il \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis que les candidats savaient que l\u2019on pouvait prendre en consid\u00e9ration leurs \u00e9valuations du rendement?\nR. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un outil d\u2019\u00e9valuation que nous pouvions utiliser.\nQ. Mais vous avez d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. Pourquoi pas?\nR. Nous n\u2019avons demand\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun candidat de fournir un rapport de la direction sur le rendement de l\u2019employ\u00e9.\nQ. Pourquoi pas?\nR. Eh bien, parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tous les employ\u00e9s ou tous les candidats dont le rendement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9, et nous avions suffisamment d\u2019outils d\u2019\u00e9valuation parmi les autres qui \u00e9taient inscrits, ce qui fait que nous n\u2019avons m\u00eame pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser ce dernier outil.\nQ. Parce qu\u2019en fait, il y a des gens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s et qui n\u2019avaient aucune exp\u00e9rience aux Douanes, dans le cadre de ce processus; est-ce exact?\nR. Je crois que oui.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 58, lignes 4 \u00e0 20.\nQ. Pensez-vous qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable que M. Turner s\u2019attende \u00e0 ce que vous teniez compte de ses \u00e9valuations du rendement?\nR. Non.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 57, lignes 6 \u00e0 9.\n[145] Me Champ a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, onglet 52, qui \u00e9num\u00e9rait les personnes jug\u00e9es qualifi\u00e9es dans le cadre du concours de Victoria. Me Champ a nomm\u00e9 cinq personnes; deux d\u2019entre elles n\u2019avaient jamais travaill\u00e9 auparavant aux Douanes, et deux n\u2019y avaient travaill\u00e9 qu\u2019un seul \u00e9t\u00e9.\n[traduction]\nQ. Juste en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, M. Baird, vous vous souvenez toutefois qu\u2019il y a quelques personnes qui avaient r\u00e9ussi au concours et qui n\u2019avaient peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019un seul \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, sinon aucun dans ce r\u00e9pertoire?\nR. J\u2019\u00e9tais bien s\u00fbr conscient que, parmi les candidats ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature, certains avaient des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail diversifi\u00e9s et certains n\u2019avaient pas travaill\u00e9 pour les Douanes ou ne l\u2019avaient fait que pendant peu de temps.\nQ. Et pourtant \u2013 vous \u00e9tiez convaincu que ces personnes \u00e9taient plus qualifi\u00e9es que M. Turner, qui avait cinq ann\u00e9es [\u2026] d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes.\nR. Dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des comp\u00e9tences que nous demandions, oui.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Et, dans le cas de M. Turner, vous \u00e9tiez bien s\u00fbr que ce dernier n\u2019avait aucune des qualifications requises?\nR. J\u2019\u00e9tais absolument s\u00fbr qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas atteint la norme de qualification que nous recherchions, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les documents qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et les outils d\u2019\u00e9valuation que nous utilisions.\n[\u2026]\nQ., Mais, en fin de compte, nous avons ici une personne qui avait travaill\u00e9 comme inspecteur des douanes pendant cinq ans, une personne que vous aviez supervis\u00e9e pendant une saison, aviez-vous \u2013 aviez-vous des doutes quelconques sur la validit\u00e9 ultime du processus?\nR. Non.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 103, lignes 1 \u00e0 14; page 104, lignes 3 \u00e0 19.\n[146] Lorsqu\u2019on le consid\u00e8re dans le contexte de sa supervision personnelle ainsi que de ses \u00e9valuations \u00e9logieuses du travail de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, le simple \u00ab non \u00bb de M. Baird n\u2019est pas digne de foi.\nLe courriel de M. Klassen [147] M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rare que les surintendants se r\u00e9unissent et discutent de diverses questions touchant le lieu de travail, y compris de divers employ\u00e9s. Mais, quand on lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il se souvenait de discussions tenues concernant M. Turner lors des tables rondes des surintendants et s\u2019il se rappelait si M. Penneger, M. Klassen ou Mme Kavalaars avaient formul\u00e9 des avis d\u00e9favorables au sujet de M. Turner, M. Baird a r\u00e9pondu dans chaque cas : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne m\u2019en souviens pas. \u00bb\n[148] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird le courriel de M. Klassen (pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 80). Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir lu, M. Baird a ni\u00e9 l\u2019avoir re\u00e7u et a ensuite dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inusit\u00e9 de recevoir un tel message d\u2019un autre surintendant; il a admis avoir vu auparavant des courriels semblables. M. Baird a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] il y a bien des points soulev\u00e9s qui concordent avec les observations que j\u2019ai faites \u00bb. Transcription : 22 janvier 2009; page 45, ligne 1; page 46, lignes 1 et 2.\n[149] Quand l\u2019avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 si le courriel de M. Klassen avait suscit\u00e9 quelques doutes au sujet de M. Turner, M. Baird a r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re illogique, jetant le discr\u00e9dit sur son t\u00e9moignage : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne sais m\u00eame pas, Monsieur, si j\u2019ai lu ce courriel. J\u2019en re\u00e7ois des centaines et des centaines et je ne les lis pas tous. \u00bb Transcription : 22 janvier 2009; page 47, lignes 21 \u00e0 23.\n[150] M. Baird a aggrav\u00e9 son discr\u00e9dit quand il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[\u2026] Si j\u2019\u00e9tais affect\u00e9 au Portcullis, il y a probablement de grandes chances que je ne l\u2019aie pas lu parce que cela ne me concernait pas du tout. Si je travaillais au secteur maritime cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0 \u2013 et l\u00e0 encore, d\u00e9sol\u00e9 pour ma confusion \u2013, mais si j\u2019\u00e9tais, vous savez, il est fort possible que j\u2019aie lu le courriel, je ne l\u2019ai peut-\u00eatre pas fait, mais je re\u00e7ois un nombre tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 de courriels et il est certain que je ne les lis pas tous en d\u00e9tail. Je ne peux donc pas dire, avec une conviction quelconque, que j\u2019ai lu ce courriel. J\u2019ignore si je l\u2019ai fait.\n[\u2026]\nMe Champ : Eh bien, monsieur, ce courriel est dat\u00e9 du 4 octobre 2003 et le concours pour lequel vous pr\u00e9sidiez le jury de s\u00e9lection a \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9 environ une semaine apr\u00e8s cela [\u2026] \u00e0 la fin d\u2019octobre 2003, il fallait que toutes les demandes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, ce qui signifie que vous les aviez toutes re\u00e7ues. Vous les avez toutes lues \u00e0 un certain moment en novembre et, ensuite, vous avez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir les entrevues en d\u00e9cembre 2003. Est-ce \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s exact?\nM. Baird : Je le crois, oui.\nMe Champ : Je me demande simplement [\u2026] lorsque vous avez pass\u00e9 en revue la demande de M. Turner peut-\u00eatre moins d\u2019un mois plus tard, un mois plus tard, si vous avez song\u00e9 que, dans votre bo\u00eete de courriels, il y en avait un qui disait : \u00ab Objet : Discussion avec Levan apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00bb?\nM. Baird : Non, je ne me rappelle m\u00eame pas avoir vu ce courriel. Donc ma r\u00e9ponse est non, uniquement dans la mesure o\u00f9 je ne me souviens pas de l\u2019avoir vu.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 48, lignes 1 \u00e0 12; page 49, lignes 11 \u00e0 25; page 50, lignes 1 \u00e0 2.\n[151] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Baird s\u2019il se souvenait du second courriel que M. Klassen avait envoy\u00e9 aux surintendants au sujet des cong\u00e9s de maladie (pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 81) et M. Baird a r\u00e9pondu que non.\n[traduction]\nMe Champ : Avez-vous pass\u00e9 en revue ces documents afin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00eat pour aujourd\u2019hui?\nM. Baird : Non, je ne l\u2019ai pas fait.\nMe Champ : Ces deux courriels? Vous ne l\u2019avez pas fait? Y a-t-il une chance quelconque que ces courriels aient eu une influence sur la fa\u00e7on dont vous avez trait\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation du jury de s\u00e9lection dans le cas de M. Turner?\nM. Baird : Je ne le crois pas.\nMe Champ : Et pourquoi dites-vous cela?\nM. Baird : Parce que je ne me souviens pas d\u2019avoir vu les courriels.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 53, lignes 1 \u00e0 12.\n[152] Je conclus que l\u2019affirmation de M. Baird selon laquelle il n\u2019a jamais lu les courriels de M. Klassen \u00e9tait \u00e9vasive et indigne de foi. Je conclus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent en ne passant pas en revue les courriels de M. Klassen quand il les a re\u00e7us ou, ce qui est plus probable, qu\u2019il les a pass\u00e9s en revue et, constatant \u00e0 quel point cet aveu serait dommageable, il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 tenir des propos \u00e9vasifs; ce faisant, ses gestes suscitent une question importante \u00e0 propos du bien-fond\u00e9 du processus que le jury de s\u00e9lection a suivi relativement \u00e0 la demande de candidature de M. Turner \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC.\nM. Baird, sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de M.

Juste au sujet du travail d\u2019agent auxiliaire dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation relative \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue du jury de s\u00e9lection, vous avez dit qu\u2019\u00e0 votre avis M. Turner vous induisait en erreur et qu\u2019il avait laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agent de police \u00e0 Toronto?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Est-ce possible que c\u2019\u00e9tait juste la fa\u00e7on dont vous l\u2019aviez interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, ce qu\u2019il avait dit?\nR. C\u2019est possible. Mais, en fin de compte, c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 c\u2019\u00e9tait lui qui d\u00e9crivait son exp\u00e9rience. Et celle-ci aurait pu \u00eatre expos\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on plus claire. Et, vous avez raison, c\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre ma fa\u00e7on \u00e0 moi d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ce qu\u2019il disait, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait mon interpr\u00e9tation.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 clairement dans son curriculum vit\u00e6 qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions d\u2019agent de police auxiliaire. Croyez-vous qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de vous induire en erreur? [\u2026] Je vous pose simplement la question, vous paraissiez avoir tendance, au moment de noter M. Turner, que chaque fois que vous aviez des doutes au sujet d\u2019une chose qu\u2019il disait, vous sautiez \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi; cette affirmation est-elle juste?\nR. Non.\nQ. Non? Ou que vous avez simplement dout\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il disait?\nR.

Le t\u00e9moin Nina Patel [153] En novembre 2008, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le Tribunal instruisait la plainte de M. Turner, Mme Patel \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e f\u00e9d\u00e9rale depuis treize ans. Elle avait tout d\u2019abord travaill\u00e9 pour Revenu Canada, ensuite pour l\u2019ADRC et, apr\u00e8s 2003, pour l\u2019ASFC. Elle avait pass\u00e9 deux \u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 Victoria, de mai \u00e0 septembre en 1995 ainsi qu\u2019en 1996 en tant qu\u2019agente de douanes \u00e9tudiante; elle avait ensuite fait la transition vers un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 Stewart (C.-B.), de 1996 \u00e0 1999 \u2013 p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle avait obtenu le statut d\u2019employ\u00e9e nomm\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u2013 pour ensuite revenir \u00e0 Victoria jusqu\u2019en 2002, apr\u00e8s quoi elle avait obtenu un contrat d\u2019enseignement \u00e0 Rigaud (Qu\u00e9bec) pendant un an et quatre mois, p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle avait form\u00e9 de futurs inspecteurs des douanes; par la suite, elle \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 Victoria en tant que surintendante int\u00e9rimaire et, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un concours, avait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au poste de surintendante.

[traduction] \u00ab Je ne me souviens pas des d\u00e9tails de ce que je lui ai dit.

Turner a fait de son intervention lors de l\u2019incident :\n[traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] Cet homme hurlait des insultes racistes \u00e0 l\u2019intention d\u2019autres agents.

Mais je sais qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 la douane. Je ne connais pas les circonstances de la situation.\nQ. Maintenant, dans la phrase qui suit, il y en a une, elle dit : je sais que ce n\u2019est que Nina qui essaie de lui parler et de le calmer. Mais il ne l\u2019appr\u00e9ciait pas du tout. Que diriez-vous en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cela?\nR. [\u2026] Je ne m\u2019en souviens pas du tout. \u00c0 mon avis, dans cette situation, je suis entr\u00e9e en contact avec cette personne et j\u2019ai r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 communiquer avec lui. Alors, ce n\u2019est pas du tout cela que je vois.\nQ. [\u2026] la phrase suivante dit : Nina s\u2019est ensuite approch\u00e9e de moi et m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de parler \u00e0 l\u2019individu. Avez-vous demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner d\u2019intervenir?\nR. Je ne m\u2019en souviens pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment. Mais ce ne serait pas inusit\u00e9 de ma part d\u2019avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner de le faire.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Et pourquoi cela? Pourquoi n\u2019aurait-il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inusit\u00e9 que vous lui demandiez de le faire?\nR.

Turner a et a toujours eu une attitude apaisante et il est capable de s\u2019adresser aux gens. J\u2019ai donc probablement \u2013 je ne me souviens pas des d\u00e9tails de la situation. Mais je ne vois pas pourquoi je ne le lui aurais pas demand\u00e9.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Et il y a ensuite la ligne suivante : Nina est rest\u00e9e derri\u00e8re moi et a tenu les autres agents \u00e0 distance pendant que je parlais \u00e0 la personne. Est-ce l\u00e0 une chose que vous auriez faite?\nR. Je ne me souviens pas. Je ne me souviens pas exactement.\nJe ne me vois pas me dissocier enti\u00e8rement de la situation.

Turner avait prises au sujet de l\u2019incident.\n[traduction]\nQ. Maintenant, vous rappelez-vous ne pas avoir valid\u00e9 l\u2019incident?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Maintenant, dans les notes ici \u2013 il est indiqu\u00e9 ici que vous dites que Levan s\u2019\u00e9tait bien comport\u00e9 face \u00e0 cette personne?\nR. Mm-hmm.\nQ. Et Levan a \u00e9crit que vous \u00e9tiez extr\u00eamement satisfaite de la fa\u00e7on dont il s\u2019\u00e9tait comport\u00e9; cette affirmation est-elle juste?\nR. \u00c7a aussi c\u2019est quelque chose qui fait partie de mon caract\u00e8re.

Lorsque vous avez fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au commentaire (de M. Baird) \u00e0 propos du fait de faire para\u00eetre les autres moins bien que soi-m\u00eame, c\u2019est [\u2026]\nR. Mm-hmm.\nQ. Donc, \u00e9tait-ce de cette fa\u00e7on que vous interpr\u00e9tiez ce que M. Baird vous a dit? Quels que soient les renseignements qu\u2019il vous a fournis, les avez-vous interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de cette fa\u00e7on, est-ce exact?\nR. Exact, au sujet de l\u2019incident.\nQ. Cependant, vous ne savez pas que M. Turner essayait de mieux se faire para\u00eetre, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Je ne sais pas.\nQ. Quelle \u00e9tait votre relation avec lui \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, sur le plan des rapports, des relations de travail?\nR. Pour cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, M. Turner \u00e9tait un agent et j\u2019\u00e9tais une surintendante int\u00e9rimaire.\nQ. Exerciez-vous donc une forme quelconque de supervision sur lui?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Est-ce qu\u2019un aspect quelconque de son rendement lors de cet incident \u2013 avez\u2011vous fait un commentaire n\u00e9gatif sur un aspect quelconque de ce qu\u2019il avait fait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0?\nR. Non.\n[\u2026]\nQ. [\u2026] vous souvenez-vous de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante si, en fait, vous ne vous \u00eates pas tenue derri\u00e8re M. Turner?\nR. Non.\nQ. Donc, le souvenir qu\u2019a M. Turner ici est peut-\u00eatre exact, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. [\u2026] M. Baird dit que vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait exag\u00e9r\u00e9?\nR. Mm-hmm.\nQ. Et vous avez dit il y a quelques instants que c\u2019\u00e9tait dans votre nature d\u2019avoir dit cela \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, est-ce exact?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Et pouvez-vous dire avec une certitude quelconque que vous avez employ\u00e9 ces mots lors de la conversation avec M. Baird?\nR. Non.\nQ. Mais vous n\u2019avez en ce moment aucun souvenir ind\u00e9pendant de ce \u00e0 quoi vous faisiez r\u00e9f\u00e9rence quand vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cela?\nR. Non.\nQ. Et pouvez-vous dire avec une certitude quelconque que vous avez employ\u00e9 ces mots-l\u00e0 lors de la conversation avec M. Baird?\nR. Non.\n[159] \u00c0 l\u2019issue du contre-interrogatoire, Mme Patel a admis que M. Turner avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change avec le voyageur; [traduction] \u00ab [t]outefois, sa version de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 \u00e9tait, selon moi, exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, pour mieux se faire para\u00eetre dans la situation. \u00bb\n[traduction]\nQ. Et aujourd\u2019hui, vous dites que cela vous a d\u00e9peint sous un mauvais jour, exact, c\u2019est ce que vous pensiez?\nR. \u00c0 mon avis, oui.\nQ. Avez-vous parl\u00e9 avec M. Turner de ce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9crit dans [\u2026]\nR. Non.\nQ. Cela ne vous d\u00e9rangeait pas assez pour aller lui parler?\nR. Non.\nQ. Selon vous, M. Turner a-t-il d\u00e9j\u00e0 induit des gens en erreur?\nR. Pas \u00e0 ma connaissance.\nQ. Ou ne dit-il pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9?\nR. Non.\nQ. Est-il franc et amical?\nR. Oui.\nQ. A-t-il une personnalit\u00e9 ouverte?\nR. Mm-hmm.\nLes conclusions d\u00e9coulant du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Patel [160] Je conclus que Mme Patel a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible; que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019\u00e9taye pas l\u2019avis de M. Baird selon lequel M. Turner ne disait pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9crit l\u2019incident impliquant un voyageur agit\u00e9.\n[161] Le fait que M. Baird ait imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Turner avait enjoliv\u00e9 son intervention lors de l\u2019incident au point o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un compte rendu d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment faux le discr\u00e9dite. Le fait que M. Baird ait communiqu\u00e9 par la suite avec Mme Patel en vue de corroborer son opinion selon laquelle M. Turner n\u2019avait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est une preuve importante \u00e0 partir de laquelle il est possible d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que M. Baird avait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avance, de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9judiciable, qu\u2019on ne consid\u00e9rerait pas que M. Turner avait les comp\u00e9tences requises pour \u00eatre un agent des services frontaliers. Les souvenirs de Mme Patel contredisent l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019avait M. Baird de M. Turner car, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019attitude apaisante de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, elle lui avait demand\u00e9 d\u2019interc\u00e9der aupr\u00e8s du voyageur.\n[162] La pr\u00e9somption de M. Baird selon laquelle M. Turner avait menti lors de l\u2019entrevue en disant qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions d\u2019agent de police aupr\u00e8s du Service de police de Toronto illustre \u00e9galement son parti pris \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Turner. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est que M. Turner avait inclus un curriculum vit\u00e6 dans son portefeuille \u00e9crit, et que ce curriculum indiquait clairement qu\u2019il avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions d\u2019agent de police auxiliaire aupr\u00e8s du Service de police de Toronto.\nH. Le t\u00e9moin Shalina Sharma L\u2019origine de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 dans le concours Vancouver 1002 [163] Mme Shalina Sharma, gestionnaire int\u00e9rimaire des ressources aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ASFC, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle supervisait sept conseillers en ressources qui aidaient les gestionnaires recruteurs dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection, et que ses fonctions consistaient aussi \u00e0 fournir une aide et des conseils lors d\u2019une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e sur une plainte.\n[164] Mme Sharma a entrepris sa carri\u00e8re en 1994 \u00e0 Revenu Canada. Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, lorsque le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a cr\u00e9\u00e9 l\u2019ASFC, Mme Sharma aidait les gestionnaires recruteurs des douanes qui \u00e9taient en poste dans le district de Pacific Highway, \u00e0 l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver (l\u2019AIV) ainsi que dans le district du secteur maritime de Metro Vancouver, de m\u00eame que dans des divisions sp\u00e9ciales charg\u00e9es du renseignement, de l\u2019observation de la loi, des activit\u00e9s commerciales ainsi que des enqu\u00eates. [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait mes clients et, pour eux, je leur donnais un coup de main pour les comit\u00e9s de s\u00e9lection ainsi que pour les activit\u00e9s de formation dont les membres de ces comit\u00e9s avaient besoin; je leur fournissais aussi des conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en mati\u00e8re de dotation. \u00bb Transcription : volume 2, section 4, Page 101, lignes 17 \u00e0 20.\n[165] Dans son t\u00e9moignage direct ainsi qu\u2019en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des questions pos\u00e9es en contre\u2011interrogatoire, Mme Sharma a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le texte de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 concernant le concours Vancouver 1002 en sa qualit\u00e9 de conseill\u00e8re en renouvellement du personnel aupr\u00e8s de Ron Tarnawski et de Mark Northcott, deux membres de la Section du recrutement.\n[traduction]\nMe Yazbeck : [\u2026] Maintenant, vous avez d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, je crois que vous avez employ\u00e9 le mot \u00ab erreur \u00bb, que, m\u00eame si cela ne fait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux candidats qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s qualifi\u00e9s \u2013 jug\u00e9s non qualifi\u00e9s, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait bien l\u00e0 l\u2019intention vis\u00e9e.\nR. L\u2019intention \u00e9tait oui, de ne pas interviewer de nouveau les candidats qui, tout r\u00e9cemment, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s non qualifi\u00e9s.\nQ. Vous convenez donc avec moi que cela est des plus ambigus?\nR. C\u2019est ambigu, oui.\nQ. Et, si un employ\u00e9 estimait que cela voulait dire qu\u2019il devait pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour ce poste m\u00eame s\u2019il l\u2019avait fait, disons, \u00e0 Victoria, est-ce l\u00e0 une affirmation raisonnable, une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable?\n[\u2026]\nR. Je ne le crois pas. Le poste, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un poste type. Ce poste, le m\u00eame poste existe \u00e0 Vancouver comme \u00e0 Victoria. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers ou, d\u00e9sol\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, d\u2019un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, il y avait une description de t\u00e2ches nationale [\u2026]\nQ. [\u2026] Si un employ\u00e9 lisait cela et venait \u00e0 la conclusion que cela ne concernait que Vancouver, vous dites qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable.\nR. C\u2019est mon avis. [\u2026]\nQ. Et donc, Mme Sharma, si l\u2019on montrait cet avis \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 et si la personne qui le montrait \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 le pointait du doigt et disait : avez-vous pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 votre candidature pour ce poste auparavant, trouveriez-vous raisonnable que l\u2019employ\u00e9 pense qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait uniquement du poste de Vancouver dont la personne parlait?\nR. L\u00e0 encore, je ne pense pas que ce serait le cas.\nQ. [\u2026] Maintenant, qui exactement a demand\u00e9 que cette ligne soit incluse dans cet avis?\nR. Quand j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 les membres de la Section de recrutement, ils ont mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient l\u2019impression de revoir syst\u00e9matiquement les m\u00eames candidats, et est-il n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9valuer quelqu\u2019un que l\u2019on a jug\u00e9 non qualifi\u00e9 il y a deux mois de cela \u00e0 peine, mais dans le cadre d\u2019un autre processus. Parce qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, nous menions plusieurs processus de front de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 combler la p\u00e9nurie d\u2019inspecteurs des douanes. Nous avons donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que non, ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s non qualifi\u00e9s peu de temps plus t\u00f4t, et cela voulait dire depuis le 1er janvier 2002, ne seraient pas pris en consid\u00e9ration pour ce processus, car il ne se serait pas \u00e9coul\u00e9 assez de temps pour qu\u2019ils puissent am\u00e9liorer leurs comp\u00e9tences [...] J\u2019ai eu l\u2019impression que cela pouvait \u00eatre fait.\nQ. Et avez-vous \u00e9crit cette phrase?\nR. Oui.\nQ. L\u2019ont-ils approuv\u00e9e?\nR. Oui, ils l\u2019on fait.\nTranscription : volume 2, section 5, page 140, lignes 19 \u00e0 25; page 141,\nlignes 1 \u00e0 9 et 24 \u00e0 25; page 142, lignes 1 \u00e0 4 et 16 \u00e0 25; page 143, ligne 8; page 144, lignes 7 \u00e0 20; page 145, lignes 7 \u00e0 10.\nLes concours de dotation sont soumis \u00e0 leurs propres r\u00e8gles [166] Le pr\u00e9sident a pos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sharma une s\u00e9rie de questions sur la mani\u00e8re dont fonctionnent les r\u00e9pertoires de dotation. Ses r\u00e9ponses sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question de savoir si, par inf\u00e9rence, \u00ab le poste \u00bb d\u2019inspecteur des douanes se limite aux besoins en dotation de Vancouver, ce qui limite donc la port\u00e9e de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9es depuis le 1er janvier 2002 pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes au sein du district de Metro Vancouver.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Avant que vous poursuiviez, si quelqu\u2019un s\u2019\u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour ce poste dans un concours \u00e0 Victoria (et) si cette personne \u00e9tait inscrite dans le r\u00e9pertoire. Vancouver aurait-elle pu puiser dans ce r\u00e9pertoire?\nR. Cela d\u00e9pend de ce que disait l\u2019avis. Si le processus de Victoria pr\u00e9voyait que la dotation aurait lieu \u00e0 Victoria et dans le Lower Mainland, alors Vancouver aurait pu puiser dans ce r\u00e9pertoire. Mais s\u2019il ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019\u00e0 des secteurs particuliers, non, alors Vancouver \u2013 et Vancouver n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019un de ces secteurs particuliers, Vancouver ne pouvait pas puiser dans ce r\u00e9pertoire.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous parlez donc du r\u00e9pertoire ant\u00e9rieur qui \u00e9tablissait le secteur \u00e0 partir duquel il \u00e9tait possible de poser sa candidature; est-ce l\u00e0 ce que vous dites?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Si vous avez quelqu\u2019un qui est qualifi\u00e9 pour un poste PM\u201102 et si cette personne occupe un poste \u00e0 Victoria, elle est maintenant qualifi\u00e9e. Est-ce que Vancouver pourrait simplement dire, le gestionnaire recruteur \u00e0 Vancouver pourrait dire : \u00ab J\u2019ai besoin de trois PM\u201102, y a-t-il quelqu\u2019un qui s\u2019est r\u00e9cemment qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Victoria? \u00bb et simplement les choisir s\u2019ils sont dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 y aller?\nR. Non. [\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc les r\u00e9pertoires sont distincts.\nR. Les r\u00e9pertoires sont distincts pour les endroits pour lesquels ils sont \u00e9tablis.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Et, dans le cas de Vancouver, cela aurait-il inclus le secteur de Victoria?\nR. Dans ce processus de Vancouver, dites-vous : est-ce que nous aurions pu r\u00e9pondre aux besoins en dotation pour le \u2013 \u00e0 Victoria? C\u2019est PM\u201102, inspecteur des douanes, Vancouver.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : S\u2019il y avait quelqu\u2019un \u2013 oh, je vois; donc chaque r\u00e9pertoire est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l\u2019avis et le secteur \u2013\nR. C\u2019est indiqu\u00e9 sur l\u2019avis.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc ce r\u00e9pertoire s\u2019applique uniquement \u00e0 ce secteur.\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nTranscription : volume 2, section 5, page 164, lignes 10 \u00e0 25; page 165,\nlignes 1 \u00e0 21.\nLes \u00e9l\u00e9ments de comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019un comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue devrait prendre en consid\u00e9ration [traduction]\nQ. [\u2026] (onglet 28 du volume 1). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des exigences en mati\u00e8re de dotation qui s\u2019applique au poste de Vancouver, le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Vancouver. Et j\u2019essaie simplement de convertir cette approche fond\u00e9e sur des valeurs en un exemple concret et pr\u00e9cis. Je constate au bas de la page qu\u2019il y a des normes d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Et cela indique tr\u00e8s clairement que l\u2019Agence pourrait utiliser un ou plusieurs des outils suivants.\nR. Oui.\nQ. Le jury de s\u00e9lection aurait-il le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider quels outils utiliser?\nR. Oui.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Examen \u00e9crit, entrevue, contr\u00f4le des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, tous se passent d\u2019explications. Je consid\u00e8re, cela dit, qu\u2019on peut les utiliser. Y a-t-il d\u2019autres facteurs ou d\u2019autres renseignements que l\u2019on pourrait \u00e9galement utiliser, comme le rendement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 le poste?\nR. Habituellement non. C\u2019est \u2013 surtout dans le cas d\u2019un processus externe, nous ne tenions pas compte du rendement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 parce que cela ne serait pas juste pour les personnes ayant pos\u00e9 leur candidature qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas des employ\u00e9es.\nQ. Et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s vous, vous dites \u2013 n\u2019arrive-t-il jamais que l\u2019on tienne compte du rendement d\u2019un employ\u00e9?\nR. Non. Habituellement, dans un processus externe, cet aspect n\u2019est pas pris en compte. Dans un processus interne, il est possible qu\u2019on le fasse. Tous les candidats sont sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, mais c\u2019est \u2013 je n\u2019ai jamais pris part \u00e0 un processus o\u00f9 l\u2019on tenait compte de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement.\n[\u2026]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, ils pr\u00e9sentent ce questionnaire, qui fait partie du portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences. Maintenant, quand Me Yazbeck dit : aurait-on pu aussi d\u00e9cider, le jury de s\u00e9lection applicable \u00e0 cet avis \u2013 aurait-il pu d\u00e9cider de prendre en compte quelque chose d\u2019autre que, par exemple, le \u2013 quand il a fait \u00e9tat du rendement de la personne au travail?\nR. Non. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une chose qu\u2019ils lui conseilleraient de faire, uniquement parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un processus externe. Et on ne peut pas tenir compte du rendement d\u2019un individu \u2013 d\u2019un seul individu et non \u2013 tous ceux qui ont pos\u00e9 leur candidature dans ce cas-ci \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s, alors nous ne pouvions pas \u2013 nous ne pouvions pas faire cela. Nous ne pouvions pas nous servir des \u00e9valuations du rendement. Ce que nous pouvions faire, c\u2019\u00e9tait v\u00e9rifier les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, en nous basant sur ce que les candidats disaient \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue ainsi que dans les comp\u00e9tences \u00e9crites. Mais on n\u2019utilise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas les \u00e9valuations du rendement dans le cas d\u2019un processus externe pour \u00e9valuer un candidat.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Quand quelqu\u2019un (donne) des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, faites-vous une v\u00e9rification de ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, on pose souvent des questions au sujet du rendement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 au sein du poste, est-ce exact?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Il s\u2019agit donc l\u00e0 d\u2019une autre fa\u00e7on d\u2019examiner le rendement, est-ce exact?\nR. Certainement.\nQ. C\u2019est donc dire que le rendement est pertinent dans ces genres de processus, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Oui. Mais, l\u00e0 encore, cet aspect est \u00e9valu\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\nQ. Il n\u2019y a rien \u2013 vous dites que vous n\u2019avez pas \u2013 rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le jury de s\u00e9lection d\u2019utiliser une \u00e9valuation du rendement, est-ce exact?\nR. L\u00e0 encore, il s\u2019agit d\u2019un syst\u00e8me bas\u00e9 sur des valeurs; dans la mesure o\u00f9 le jury de s\u00e9lection peut justifier pourquoi il le ferait.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Et, si j\u2019ai bien compris, l\u2019une des valeurs du Programme de dotation de l\u2019ADRC \u00e9tait de s\u2019assurer que n\u2019importe quel processus de s\u00e9lection qu\u2019il utilisait \u00e9valuait de mani\u00e8re juste et exacte les qualifications des employ\u00e9s. Est\u2011ce l\u00e0 une affirmation juste?\nR. Oui.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Quand vous dites \u00ab crit\u00e8res stricts \u00bb, \u00e0 quoi faites-vous r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u2013 les huit comp\u00e9tences?\nR. Chacune de ces comp\u00e9tences est assortie de crit\u00e8res [\u2026] Et c\u2019est en fonction de ces crit\u00e8res que le jury de s\u00e9lection \u00e9value le candidat. Maintenant, ce que \u2013 si un gestionnaire donne \u00e0 un candidat \u2013 d\u00e9sol\u00e9e, un employ\u00e9 \u2013 une \u00e9valuation du rendement ou dit : \u00ab vous faites du bon travail \u00bb, eh bien, c\u2019est parfait, mais il y a un autre gestionnaire qui si\u00e8ge au jury de s\u00e9lection.\nQ. Donc, si le gestionnaire si\u00e8ge au jury de s\u00e9lection, ce gestionnaire aurait une certaine id\u00e9e du rendement de l\u2019employ\u00e9, est-ce exact?\nR. Oui, effectivement.\nQ. Et cela pourrait donc l\u2019amener \u00e0 se demander pourquoi l\u2019employ\u00e9 a des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue?\nR. C\u2019est possible.\nQ. Et cela pourrait \u00eatre \u2013 cela pourrait \u00eatre un facteur pertinent \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer les qualifications du candidat?\nR. Non.\nQ. Non, ce ne serait pas pertinent?\nR. Je ne crois pas parce que, l\u00e0 encore, il y a des crit\u00e8res stricts \u00e0 respecter. Si \u2013 le processus de s\u00e9lection, je veux dire, n\u2019est pas parfait, mais nous devons nous en servir. Les crit\u00e8res sont l\u00e0, sous les qualifications. Si le candidat ne respecte pas ces crit\u00e8res, le jury de s\u00e9lection ne peut arriver qu\u2019\u00e0 un seul r\u00e9sultat \u2013 une personne non qualifi\u00e9e. Cela arrive. Cela arrive souvent \u2013 tout le temps. Cela m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9.\nQ. Mais vous venez tout juste de dire que, si le gestionnaire de l\u2019employ\u00e9 si\u00e8ge au jury de s\u00e9lection, il peut avoir une certaine id\u00e9e du rendement r\u00e9el de l\u2019employ\u00e9, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Et si le gestionnaire savait que l\u2019employ\u00e9 avait eu un bon rendement \u2013 et qu\u2019ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, l\u2019employ\u00e9 ne semble pas d\u00e9montrer la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019une mani\u00e8re jug\u00e9e satisfaisante par le jury de s\u00e9lection, dites-vous que vous ne mettriez jamais en doute la conclusion du jury de s\u00e9lection, \u00e0 savoir que la personne n\u2019est pas qualifi\u00e9e?\nR. Non, ce n\u2019est pas ce que je dis.\nQ. Cela jetterait donc un doute sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation du jury de s\u00e9lection?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Et, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Mme Sharma, lorsqu\u2019un homme \u2013 nous avons vu une preuve d\u2019\u00e9valuation; et lorsqu\u2019un gestionnaire entreprend d\u2019\u00e9valuer un employ\u00e9, il examine l\u2019ensemble du rendement de cet employ\u00e9, est-ce exact?\nR. Je le suppose. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que je ne peux pas le dire pour tous les gestionnaires, mais c\u2019est s\u00fbr qu\u2019on le fait.\nQ. Mais si c\u2019\u00e9tait vous, examineriez-vous l\u2019ensemble du \u2013 et si c\u2019\u00e9tait \u2013 vous examineriez l\u2019ensemble du rendement?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Parce que vous \u2013 et s\u2019il y avait des probl\u00e8mes pr\u00e9cis, vous en parleriez \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9?\nR. J\u2019en aurais parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 le probl\u00e8me se posait.\n[\u2026]\nQ. Maintenant, hier vous avez parl\u00e9 de ce qui se passe quand le jury de s\u00e9lection \u2013 d\u00e9sol\u00e9, quand un candidat pourrait \u00e9chouer et le jury de s\u00e9lection pourrait arr\u00eater. Et vous y avez fait allusion, ce matin aussi, je crois, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question de M. Sinclair. Hier, vous avez dit que le jury de s\u00e9lection doit indiquer tr\u00e8s clairement qu\u2019il ne peut faire rien de plus pour faire passer la personne. En d\u2019autres mots, l\u2019erreur de l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit \u00eatre flagrante, je pense que c\u2019est le mot que vous avez employ\u00e9. Est-ce que vous vous en souvenez?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Je d\u00e9duis donc de votre t\u00e9moignage que, quand vous avez dit \u00ab des plus clairs \u00bb, que le jury de s\u00e9lection est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre s\u00fbr que le candidat n\u2019est pas qualifi\u00e9?\nR. C\u2019est bien cela.\nQ. Et, s\u2019il ne le fait pas, le processus comporte dans ce cas une lacune, est-ce exact?\nR. Oui.\nL\u2019analyse du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Sharma [167] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Sharma situe le contexte dans lequel \u00e9valuer la fa\u00e7on dont M. Tarnawski et M. Baird, \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sidents de leur comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen respectif, ont interview\u00e9 de vive voix M. Turner.\n[168] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Sharma m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que le processus de dotation, qui a exclu M. Turner parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes \u2013 manquait totalement de rigueur. Il \u00e9tait bas\u00e9 sur un instrument grandiloquent, le portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences (un nom impropre), une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite du candidat qui, si ce dernier obtenait la note de passage, d\u00e9bouchait sur une entrevue. Le processus d\u2019entrevue \u00e9tait men\u00e9 au petit bonheur et subjectif; il d\u00e9terminait pompeusement si un candidat \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent pour devenir inspecteur des douanes. Le fait est que, par d\u00e9finition, \u00ab comp\u00e9tent \u00bb veut dire suffisamment qualifi\u00e9 ou apte; devenir qualifi\u00e9 ou apte oblige \u00e0 apprendre en cours d\u2019emploi et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un degr\u00e9 de comp\u00e9tence.\n[169] Il convient de noter que c\u2019est un commentaire du directeur de la section de l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver de l\u2019ASFC, M. Flagel, qui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 du processus de dotation, un commentaire que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Flagel lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire de M. Hughes :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 cause du nombre croissant des plaintes de voyageurs, dont un grand nombre concernait les gestes et le comportement d\u2019inspecteurs des douanes relativement nouveaux, il estimait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, au moment de l\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats, de traiter de certains crit\u00e8res qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas inclus dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des exigences. Comme il l\u2019a fait remarquer, il estimait que la mani\u00e8re de traiter les situations difficiles devait \u00eatre l\u2019une des qualifications.\nI. Le t\u00e9moin Ronald Paul Tarnawski [170] Au moment de son t\u00e9moignage dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal le 22 janvier 2009, M. Tarnawski exer\u00e7ait les fonctions de surintendant du secteur du passage des camions du district de Pacific Highway, dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique (Lower Mainland) de l\u2019ASFC. La carri\u00e8re de M. Tarnawski dans le domaine des services frontaliers a commenc\u00e9 en 1990, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 divers points d\u2019entr\u00e9e, dont Peace Arch, Pacific Highway et Huntingdon (C.-B.).\n[171] En 2000, M. Tarnawski a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019AIV, o\u00f9 lui et le surintendant Mark Northcott ont mis sur pied et dirig\u00e9 une section r\u00e9gionale de recrutement au cours des six ann\u00e9es suivantes. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que chaque district de la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de ses propres activit\u00e9s de recrutement, ce qui avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des processus d\u2019embauche incoh\u00e9rents et, malheureusement, \u00e0 une certaine concurrence entre les divers districts, comme l\u2019avait illustr\u00e9, \u00e0 une reprise, un district qui avait attendu qu\u2019un autre district cr\u00e9e un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pour ensuite faire du maraudage et mettre la main sur des candidats qualifi\u00e9s. Ce degr\u00e9 de dysfonctionnement a amen\u00e9 les directeurs des activit\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC dans le Lower Mainland \u00e0 regrouper les Op\u00e9rations maritimes, les Op\u00e9rations routi\u00e8res et les Op\u00e9rations de l\u2019AIV de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles rel\u00e8vent d\u2019une section de recrutement r\u00e9gionale.\n[172] M. Tarnawski a expliqu\u00e9 que, parall\u00e8lement, l\u2019ADRC faisait \u00e9galement face \u00e0 d\u2019\u00e9normes changements sur le plan des exigences professionnelles.\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] Douanes et Revenu, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, subissaient aussi de tr\u00e8s gros changements sur le plan des exigences professionnelles, des choses qu\u2019on nous autorisait maintenant \u00e0 faire, car nous nous transformions nettement plus en un organisme du type application de la loi. Et les directeurs se souciaient \u00e9galement de ce que nous faisions sur le plan du recrutement pour attirer les bons candidats, ou du fait que nous fassions en sorte que les activit\u00e9s de recrutement favorisent la carri\u00e8re [inaudible] et des facteurs comme ceux-l\u00e0, et, ensuite, de ce que nous faisions pour \u00e9valuer ces candidats afin de nous assurer qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient r\u00e9ellement capables d\u2019accomplir les t\u00e2ches [\u2026] Nous avons examin\u00e9 ce que d\u2019autres organismes d\u2019application de la loi faisaient; nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 leurs techniques de recrutement.\nQ. Et ensuite que faisiez-vous pour \u00e9valuer ces candidats, pour v\u00e9rifier s\u2019ils pouvaient r\u00e9ellement accomplir les t\u00e2ches?\nR. Cela faisait partie int\u00e9grante de la cr\u00e9ation des sections de recrutement. Nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 ce que faisaient d\u2019autres organismes d\u2019application de la loi. Nous avons examin\u00e9 leurs techniques de recrutement, le genre de mat\u00e9riel publicitaire dont ils disposaient, et nous avons ainsi commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre part \u00e0 des salons de recrutement. Nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 des banni\u00e8res, des toiles de fond et de la documentation; ils s\u2019appliquaient exclusivement \u00e0 la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique.\n[\u2026]\nEt, l\u00e0 encore, en nous inspirant de ce que faisaient nos partenaires sur le plan de l\u2019application de la loi, nous avons con\u00e7u en fin de compte un processus permettant aux candidats de poser leur candidature en ligne. [\u2026]\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 122, lignes 14 \u00e0 25; page 123, lignes 1 \u00e0 8; page 124, lignes 12 \u00e0 15.\n[173] M. Tarnawski et M. Northcott ont con\u00e7u en fin de compte un processus d\u2019entrevue uniformis\u00e9 qui comprenait les \u00e9tapes suivantes : la pr\u00e9sentation de demandes en ligne, la s\u00e9lection des demandes par des personnes ayant une exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine, l\u2019envoi aux candidats ayant franchi l\u2019\u00e9tape de la s\u00e9lection d\u2019un \u00ab portefeuille \u00bb de sept comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 remplir par \u00e9crit et \u00e0 renvoyer, et, pour finir, une entrevue des candidats ayant obtenu la note de passage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs comp\u00e9tences.\n[174] En d\u00e9crivant le processus de dotation que M. Northcott et lui avaient \u00e9tabli, M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tout ce qu\u2019ils cherchaient dans le portefeuille que les candidats r\u00e9digeaient \u00e9tait un niveau de connaissances de base qui permettrait aux membres du jury de s\u00e9lection de parler avec eux au moment de l\u2019entrevue. M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9crit la premi\u00e8re de deux entrevues, qui portait sur les communications interactives efficaces; elle durait de 30 \u00e0 40 minutes et le taux d\u2019\u00e9chec \u00e9tait de 50 %.\n[175] M. Tarnawski a dit de M. Turner qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un candidat qu\u2019il avait interview\u00e9 dans le cadre de deux processus de dotation : la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver ainsi que le concours Victoria 7012, tenu plus t\u00f4t.\n[176] Pour ce qui est du concours Victoria 7012, M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Victoria organisait ses propres processus et avait besoin qu\u2019on lui fasse une d\u00e9monstration de la mani\u00e8re d\u2019utiliser le guide d\u2019entrevue et le guide de notation dont on se servait \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Tarnawski a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 62, comme \u00e9tant la feuille ma\u00eetresse, ou le guide de notation, dont on s\u2019\u00e9tait servi lors d\u2019une entrevue de M. Turner, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00e0 Victoria le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003, dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7012.\n[177] M. Tarnawski a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 63, comme \u00e9tant ses notes concernant l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019il avait men\u00e9e avec M. Turner. Les autres membres du groupe \u00e9taient le surintendant Mark Northcott et les surintendants de Victoria et de l\u2019\u00eele de Vancouver, Kathy Pringle et Rob Farrell, respectivement. Selon les souvenirs qu\u2019avait M. Tarnawski de l\u2019entrevue, Mme Pringle et M. Farrell \u00e9taient des observateurs qui n\u2019avaient pas pris part \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation proprement dite de M. Turner.\n[178] M. Tarnawski a identifi\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 63, comme \u00e9tant ses notes concernant l\u2019entrevue, et on lui a demand\u00e9 si ces derni\u00e8res lui rafra\u00eechissaient la m\u00e9moire au sujet de cette occasion.\n[traduction]\nEh bien, je me souviens d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent \u2013 je me souviens d\u2019avoir interview\u00e9 M. Turner. Je me souviens d\u2019avoir pris des notes. Est-ce que je me rappelle les d\u00e9tails complexes de cette entrevue? Non, je ne m\u2019en souviens pas.\n[\u2026]\nCe que mes notes me disent, c\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s quelques questions portant sur le traitement des situations difficiles et apr\u00e8s quelques commentaires dans ses questions d\u2019entrevue au sujet de la prise de d\u00e9cisions, j\u2019ai inscrit ceci : \u00ab Il n\u2019obtient pas tous les renseignements requis avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision. P\u00eache par exc\u00e8s de prudence en faveur de l\u2019importateur ou du voyageur. M\u00eame si le candidat fait de nombreuses pr\u00e9somptions \u00e0 propos de la personne \u00e0 qui il a affaire et de la mani\u00e8re de la traiter \u2013 ou dont il devrait la traiter. Compare comment faire affaire avec les voyageurs am\u00e9ricains en raison de la situation raciale. Dit : J\u2019\u00e9value les gens et je prends des d\u00e9cisions pendant qu\u2019ils s\u2019avancent vers moi ou en examinant quel genre de v\u00e9hicule ils conduisent. \u00bb\nJ\u2019ai inscrit ici : \u00ab Doutes au sujet de la connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019a l\u2019agent du TSD \u00bb. Cela signifie : traitement des situations difficiles.\nDonc, ce qui ressort essentiellement de mes notes, c\u2019est qu\u2019il fait des pr\u00e9somptions et qu\u2019il s\u2019en sert pour prendre des d\u00e9cisions, et cela, ce n\u2019est pas une bonne chose, en ce sens que cela peut faire pencher la balance dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre. Vous savez, parfois, c\u2019est s\u00fbr que vos pr\u00e9somptions peuvent \u00eatre bonnes, mais bien souvent cela peut se solder par une plainte au comptoir avant si quelqu\u2019un a le sentiment de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 comme il faut ou peut-\u00eatre d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e, ou vice versa. Il se peut que vous ne rep\u00e9riez pas une menace ou un risque alors que cette menace ou ce risque est l\u00e0, directement devant vous.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nTranscription : 29 janvier 2009; page 131, lignes 20 \u00e0 23; page 134, lignes 1 \u00e0 25; page 135, lignes 1 \u00e0 6.\n[179] L\u2019entrevue que M. Turner a pass\u00e9e \u00e0 Victoria le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003 est troublante, et ce, pour deux raisons.\n[180] Premi\u00e8rement, M. Tarnawski s\u2019est servi de M. Turner, sans autorisation, comme outil p\u00e9dagogique, en vue de faire une d\u00e9monstration de ses capacit\u00e9s d\u2019entrevue devant Mme Pringle et M. Farrel. Cela a clairement perturb\u00e9 M. Turner.\n[traduction]\nMe Yazbeck : M. Turner, vous venez tout juste de dire qu\u2019on ne vous a pas rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2004. Votre plainte \u2013 et nous parlions du concours de Victoria et du concours de Vancouver. Est-ce que vos pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de ces derniers sont les m\u00eames?\nR. Oui, mes pr\u00e9occupations sont les m\u00eames. Je pense qu\u2019avec tous les membres suppl\u00e9mentaires qui assistaient au processus, les quatre que j\u2019ai eus pour \u2013 en 2002 et les trois que j\u2019ai eus \u00e0 la fin de 2003 et les trois membres de comit\u00e9 que j\u2019ai eus lors du processus de Vancouver. J\u2019ai certes \u00e9t\u00e9 intimid\u00e9.\nJe crois que celui auquel Janet Sabo a particip\u00e9, elle est l\u2019\u00e9pouse de Trevor Baird, et je crois qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e juste pour voir Trevor Baird mettre mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise un homme noir \u00e2g\u00e9 et corpulent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019entrevue.\nTranscription : volume 2, section 3; page 25, lignes 6 \u00e0 25.\n[181] Deuxi\u00e8mement, M. Tarnawski a conclu de mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9cieuse que M. Turner, en d\u00e9crivant de quelle fa\u00e7on il accueillait les voyageurs \u00e0 l\u2019examen primaire, faisait des pr\u00e9somptions plut\u00f4t que de prendre des d\u00e9cisions raisonn\u00e9es. Que l\u2019explication de M. Turner : [traduction] \u00ab [j]\u2019\u00e9value les gens et je prends des d\u00e9cisions pendant qu\u2019ils avancent vers moi ou en examinant quel genre de v\u00e9hicule ils conduisent \u00bb \u00e9tait un processus d\u00e9cisionnel qui reposait sur des pr\u00e9somptions. Il m\u2019appara\u00eet clairement que la mani\u00e8re dont M. Turner \u00e9valuait les gens pendant qu\u2019ils s\u2019approchaient de la gu\u00e9rite d\u2019inspection primaire \u00e9tait un processus d\u2019estimation, une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape permettant de d\u00e9cider quelles questions il fallait poser au voyageur. De plus, le t\u00e9moignage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Turner a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019il avait fait son \u00e9valuation initiale, et suivant la nature des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es \u00e0 ses questions, alors, et alors seulement, il prenait-il, \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019autoriser la personne \u00e0 entrer au pays ou d\u2019exiger qu\u2019elle subisse un examen secondaire.\n[182] Me Stark est revenu sur le concours de Vancouver et a fait identifier par M. Tarnawski un avis de processus s\u00e9lection relatif au concours de Vancouver portant le num\u00e9ro 2003 1727 PACK 39611002 (concours Vancouver 1002). M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] avis de possibilit\u00e9 de carri\u00e8re concernant des postes qui seraient affich\u00e9s pour l\u2019AIV, le district de Metro Vancouver ou le district de Pacific Highway dans le cadre d\u2019un concours men\u00e9 par le surintendant Mark Northcott et moi-m\u00eame. \u00bb Transcription : 29 janvier 2009; page 135, ligne 25, page 136, lignes 1 \u00e0 4.\n[183] La restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 indiquait que [traduction] \u00ab Les candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours. \u00bb\nLe contre-interrogatoire de M. Tarnawski [184] Dans le cadre d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire rigoureux, M. Tarnawski a reconnu avoir appliqu\u00e9 une restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait vici\u00e9e pour exclure tout candidat qui, au cours de la p\u00e9riode de deux ans post\u00e9rieure au 1er janvier 2002, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 non qualifi\u00e9 dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002, un processus de dotation qui visait \u00e0 embaucher des inspecteurs des douanes.\n[traduction]\nMe Champ : Tout d\u2019abord, soyons clairs, l\u2019avis, lui-m\u00eame indique : si vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 auparavant.\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Il ne dit rien au sujet du fait d\u2019avoir r\u00e9ussi ou non?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Donc, nous pouvons pr\u00e9sumer que les personnes qui ont lu ceci n\u2019auraient pas compris qu\u2019il y avait une restriction quelconque \u00e0 la qualification [\u2026]\nR. Tr\u00e8s bien. Je ne vais pas \u2013 je ne pr\u00e9sume absolument rien. Vous pouvez le pr\u00e9sumer. Je ne pr\u00e9sume pas cela, parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intention vis\u00e9e. Je suis s\u00fbr que cela peut avoir caus\u00e9 quelques probl\u00e8mes, et je pense l\u2019avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t cet apr\u00e8s-midi.\nQ. C\u2019est exact.\nR. Parce que je sais que le libell\u00e9 \u00e9tait inexact et je savais que nous \u2013 il y avait probablement des lacunes lorsque nous l\u2019avons vu sur l\u2019avis. Mais je ne vais pas tirer une conclusion h\u00e2tive et dire que des gens avaient pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 quoi que ce soit.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 174, lignes 8 \u00e0 25; page 175, ligne 1.\n[traduction]\nQ. Tant qu\u2019\u00e0 parler de cet avis, vous verrez ici, on peut lire le num\u00e9ro du processus de s\u00e9lection et le num\u00e9ro de l\u2019avis, vient ensuite la mention \u00ab inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102, Vancouver et district de l\u2019A\u00e9roport international, district de Metro Vancouver et district de Pacific Highway \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit donc de trois districts diff\u00e9rents, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Donc, lorsque vous avez cr\u00e9\u00e9 ce r\u00e9pertoire, ces trois districts pouvaient puiser dans le r\u00e9pertoire?\nR. C\u2019est exact.\nQ. Et cela \u2013 n\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation juste de ce poste? Ce poste veut dire inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 ces trois endroits.\nR. Je ne vais pas vous dire ce qu\u2019il faut croire ou non. Ce que cela vous dit, c\u2019est que ces postes s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 cet avis. C\u2019est \u00e7a que cela vous dit.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 178, lignes 20 \u00e0 25; page; page 179,\nlignes 1 \u00e0 15.\n[traduction]\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, si j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 en vue d\u2019un poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes \u2013 et on n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces endroits \u2013\nR. Exact.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous auriez donc dit, si j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9, tout candidat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 en vue du poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sera pas admissible \u00e0 ce concours?\nR. C\u2019est ce que dit l\u2019avis.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Aucun candidat ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 ne sera admissible?\nR. C\u2019est ce que dit l\u2019avis, oui monsieur.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Vous ne l\u2019avez pas appliqu\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR. Non, ce n\u2019est pas ainsi que nous l\u2019avons appliqu\u00e9. Maintenant, je ne peux pas vous dire combien de gens de Victoria nous avons interview\u00e9s, mais, si nous avons trouv\u00e9 des gens \u2013 si des gens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme qualifi\u00e9s au cours du processus ant\u00e9rieur, nous n\u2019appliquions pas cette restriction.

Tarnawski, une lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2004, sign\u00e9e par M. Tarnawski et envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Turner, disant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] se pouvait fort bien que la lettre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e express\u00e9ment pour Levan Turner. \u00bb Transcription : 22 janvier 2009; page 204, lignes 9 \u00e0 11.\n[186] Me Champ a laiss\u00e9 entendre que M. Turner avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier candidat \u00e9limin\u00e9 par la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, et M. Tarnawski a convenu que c\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] tout \u00e0 fait possible \u00bb, et il a convenu aussi qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab fort possible \u00bb que M.

Que voulez-vous dire par \u00ab marquant \u00bb?\nQ. Pourquoi \u00e9tait-il le seul? Sur sept \u2013 six ou sept, huit \u2013 six ou sept cents candidats pour le concours de Vancouver, pourquoi est-il le seul \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 pour ce motif?\nR. Eh bien, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du premier processus dans le cadre duquel nous appliquions la restriction; d\u2019accord?\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nR. Et il y a eu manifestement une reconnaissance quelconque.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Donc, vous l\u2019avez reconnu lui, mais personne d\u2019autre?\nR. Je dirais que oui.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 205, lignes 6 \u00e0 7 et lignes 5 \u00e0 18.\n[187] Dans le t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il a fait en contre-interrogatoire, M. Tarnawski a [traduction] \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait \u00bb convenu qu\u2019un candidat qui n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi au concours Victoria 7003 aurait pu r\u00e9ussir au concours Vancouver 1002, m\u00eame si les portefeuilles des comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient les m\u00eames. Il a pourtant aussi reconnu que l\u2019exclusion pour cause d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de M. Turner du concours de Vancouver, au beau milieu du processus d\u2019entrevue, \u00e9tait, comme le pr\u00e9sident l\u2019a dit, [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] une sorte de g\u00e2chis \u00bb.\n[188] Pour ce qui est de la pi\u00e8ce R\u20112, onglet 33, la lettre type dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2004 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Turner pour l\u2019aviser qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu \u00e0 cause de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, M. Tarnawski a convenu qu\u2019on n\u2019avait envoy\u00e9 cette lettre \u00e0 aucun autre candidat; qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab tout \u00e0 fait possible \u00bb que, sur les six ou sept cents candidats, il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab fort possible \u00bb que M. Turner ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul exclu.\n[189] La pi\u00e8ce R\u20113, onglet 91, une liste ma\u00eetresse de candidats au concours Vancouver 1002, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tarnawski et, dans un contre-interrogatoire passablement long, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que la grande majorit\u00e9 des candidats n\u2019avaient aucune exp\u00e9rience en tant qu\u2019inspecteurs des douanes. De plus, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que plusieurs candidats ayant un minimum de qualifications avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme qualifi\u00e9s et inscrits dans le r\u00e9pertoire de dotation, alors que M. Turner, un inspecteur des douanes chevronn\u00e9, un candidat qui avait obtenu la note de passage lors du processus d\u2019entrevue, avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une exclusion illogique. Il est donc n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner les circonstances entourant l\u2019exclusion afin de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019exclusion technique de M. Turner \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte utilis\u00e9 pour le priver de la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c9tait-ce un pr\u00e9texte pour dissimuler le fait qu\u2019un homme noir d'\u00e2ge m\u00fbr ayant une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue \u2013 l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u2013 ne correspondait pas \u00e0 l\u2019image d\u2019un agent des services frontaliers charg\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer la loi? Si oui, cela a fait subir \u00e0 M. Turner une diff\u00e9rence de traitement en tant qu\u2019ancien employ\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP.\n[190] Me Champ a conclu son contre-interrogatoire en mettant en doute l\u2019explication de M. Tarnawski selon laquelle c\u2019\u00e9taient la voix et la pr\u00e9sence de M. Turner qui lui avaient permis de se souvenir de leur contact ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue relative au concours Victoria 7012.\n[traduction]\nQ. Donc M. Tarnawski, vous comprenez maintenant pourquoi M. Turner se sent un peu l\u00e9s\u00e9, car, manifestement, il est le seul \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu de ce concours \u00e0 cause de cette restriction?\nR. D\u2019accord.\nQ. Et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019il semble, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le moins parce que tous les deux \u2013 parce que vous avez reconnu sa voix et sa pr\u00e9sence en raison d\u2019une rencontre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente?\nR. Oui. \u00c0 vous entendre, je comprends qu\u2019il a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 vu sous un mauvais jour. Si je puis peut-\u00eatre sugg\u00e9rer quelque chose ici : Levan entre dans la pi\u00e8ce, c\u2019est un gars positif, \u00e7a va?\nQ. Oui.\nR. Et Levan souriait, d\u2019accord? Et Levan aimait faire des choses qui le faisaient remarquer, et vous saviez que Levan \u00e9tait l\u00e0. Et Levan avait inscrit son nom sur des cartes et les avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant eux \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, parce qu\u2019il voit tout le temps le c\u00f4t\u00e9 positif des choses. Levan semblait toujours \u00eatre positif. Maintenant, si vous dites que j\u2019ai dit m\u2019\u00eatre souvenu de lui \u00e0 cause de sa pr\u00e9sence et si vous essayez de sous-entendre quelque chose qui pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9, ce n\u2019est pas dans ma nature, Monsieur, \u00e7a va? Si j\u2019ai dit cela, ce serait \u00e0 cause des aspects positifs que j\u2019ai not\u00e9s chez Levan, et non \u00e0 cause de quelque chose de d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr de ce que vous essayez de \u2013 de ce que vous voulez que l\u2019on en d\u00e9duise.\nQ. M. Tarnawski, disons les choses simplement : sans aucune mauvaise intention de votre part, loin de l\u00e0 \u2013\u2013\nR. Tr\u00e8s bien.\nQ. \u2013\u2013 est-il possible que ce soit juste parce que M. Turner est un homme corpulent et un homme noir que vous vous \u00eates souvenu de lui, que vous l\u2019avez tout simplement reconnu plus que d\u2019autres?\nR. Eh bien, je n\u2019ai pas interview\u00e9, je ne pense pas, un tas de gens qui correspondaient aux m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques physiques que celles de M. Levan Turner. Mais j\u2019ai interview\u00e9 bien des gens qui \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s optimistes, tout comme M. Turner, \u00e7a va? Donc, M. Turner, vous savez, chaque fois que nous nous rencontrons, nous avons une conversation parce qu\u2019il est du genre positif, et qu\u2019il est facile de lui parler. Et c\u2019est de cela que je me souvenais au sujet de M. Turner. Et il \u00e9tait facile de se souvenir d\u2019une personne sur les quatre ou six qui se trouvaient dans la pi\u00e8ce ce jour-l\u00e0. Je n\u2019avais pas \u00e0 me souvenir des 500 ou des 600 que j\u2019allais devoir voir dans le Lower Mainland et interviewer.\nTranscription : 22 janvier 2009; page 244, lignes 3 \u00e0 25; page 245, lignes 1 \u00e0 25.\nL\u2019analyse de la derni\u00e8re question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tarnawski en contre-interrogatoire [191] La question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Tarnawski (\u2013est-il possible que ce soit juste parce que M. Turner est un homme corpulent et un homme noir que vous vous \u00eates souvenu de lui, que vous l\u2019avez tout simplement reconnu plus que d\u2019autres?) est une question \u00e0 laquelle M. Tarnawski aurait pu r\u00e9pondre \u00ab oui \u00bb ou \u00ab non \u00bb; au lieu de cela, il est devenu r\u00e9ticent, ce qui, en soi, m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 me demander s\u2019il \u00e9tait craintif et avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dire : \u00ab Oui, je me souviens de M. Turner parce que c\u2019est un homme noir et corpulent qui a une personnalit\u00e9 positive \u00bb. La r\u00e9ticence de M. Tarnawski est envelopp\u00e9e dans les circonstances concomitantes selon lesquelles : 1) le concours Vancouver 1002 \u00e9tait assorti d\u2019une restriction, dont M. Tarnawski \u00e9tait l\u2019un des auteurs, qui excluait les personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9es dans le cadre de n\u2019importe quel avis d\u2019emploi ant\u00e9rieur au cours des deux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes; 2) la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait vici\u00e9e par une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dont M. Tarnawski s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu compte aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l\u2019annonce du concours; 3) m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 que pr\u00e9sentait la restriction, M. Tarnawski ne l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 la candidature de M. Turner aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s que ses coll\u00e8gues du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen et lui ont jug\u00e9 que M. Turner \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour \u00eatre inscrit dans un r\u00e9pertoire d\u2019\u00e9ventuels inspecteurs des douanes; 4) l\u2019exclusion a effectivement mis un terme aux aspirations qu\u2019avait M. Turner de devenir agent des services frontaliers.\nV. Analyse A. Pr\u00e9face aux motifs de d\u00e9cision [192] Dans ses remarques pr\u00e9liminaires, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a demand\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nPourquoi? Pourquoi est-ce arriv\u00e9? Pourquoi un employ\u00e9, qui avait un bon rendement, qui n\u2019avait pas de lacunes sur le plan du rendement, pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 n\u2019est-il tout \u00e0 coup plus qualifi\u00e9? Le plaignant, Monsieur, est Levan Turner. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un homme noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, et il est d\u2019avis que ces facteurs, de m\u00eame que sa taille, sont les raisons pour lesquelles on lui a refus\u00e9 cet emploi. [\u2026] une preuve prima facie de discrimination sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, laquelle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9fut\u00e9e. [\u2026] il n\u2019y a aucune explication autre que la race ou l\u2019\u00e2ge de l\u2019employ\u00e9, ou sa d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire son poids.\n[193] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nEn droit, la question est de savoir s\u2019il est per\u00e7u par d\u2019autres comme ayant une forme de d\u00e9ficience, et si, de ce fait, il est trait\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. Les gens qui font de l\u2019embonpoint sont souvent confront\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019opinion st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e selon laquelle l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 est synonyme de paresse.\nL\u2019avis de M. Turner sur la raison pour laquelle on l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler [194] Lors de l\u2019instruction, le pr\u00e9sident, M. Sinclair, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner quelles conclusions il avait tir\u00e9es en apprenant que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s saisonniers avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s au travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2004, mais pas lui; et l\u2019avocat du plaignant a pos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner une question semblable au sujet des processus de dotation de Victoria et de Vancouver qui sont en litige ici. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nR. Il s\u2019agissait pour la plupart d\u2019\u00e9tudiants et \u2013 il s\u2019agissait en grande partie du personnel qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Donc, quand vous avez entendu cela, vous avez conclu [\u2026] vous \u00e9tiez en col\u00e8re et vous avez conclu quoi?\nR. J\u2019\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s en col\u00e8re et extr\u00eamement contrari\u00e9. \u00c0 cause de tout le travail que j\u2019y avais investi et de toutes les ann\u00e9es que j\u2019y avais consacr\u00e9es, je veux dire, mes qualifications \u00e9taient, pour moi, elles \u00e9taient parfaites. Et ils avaient \u2013 pour avoir travaill\u00e9 pour le gouvernement, je sais maintenant qu\u2019il y a de nombreux recours ou d\u2019autres voies qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019utiliser pour embaucher quelqu\u2019un.\nIl faut donc croire qu\u2019ils ne voulaient vraiment pas me ravoir et je me suis dit, \u00e7a doit \u00eatre \u00e0 cause de ma race et, vous savez, je ne parais pas aussi bien dans un uniforme qu\u2019ils le voudraient, et je suis trop \u00e2g\u00e9. Ils se sont probablement dit que je serais un fardeau pour le syst\u00e8me.\nTranscription : volume 2, section 3; page 24, lignes 1 \u00e0 21.\nLes d\u00e9cisions : les concours Vancouver 1002 et Victoria 7003 [195] Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je suis convaincu que les comit\u00e9s d\u2019examen respectifs, tant dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002 que dans celui du concours Victoria 7003, ont priv\u00e9 M. Turner d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 d\u00e9cisionnelle. Je conclus que ces deux processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9s sans l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 et incorrectement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes que M. Turner a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vue de devenir un employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC, une agence de services policiers et frontaliers dont la culture s\u2019orientait vers l\u2019application de la loi, et travaillant en synergie avec d\u2019autres organismes canadiens d\u2019application de la loi. La principale question \u00e0 laquelle doit r\u00e9pondre le Tribunal dans le cas pr\u00e9sent consiste \u00e0 savoir si la partialit\u00e9 d\u00e9cisionnelle et sa corollaire, le traitement d\u00e9favorable que M. Turner a subi \u2013 qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019inf\u00e9rence selon laquelle un homme noir, ob\u00e8se et d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr ne correspond pas \u00e0 l\u2019image ou n\u2019entre pas dans le moule d\u2019un service de police frontalier \u2013 sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite au sens de la LCDP. J\u2019analyserai cette question plus en d\u00e9tail, plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nLa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins [196] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. R.E.M., 2008 CSC 51 (R.E.M.), la juge en chef McLachlin a fait remarquer, au paragraphe 49, que les conclusions de fait concernant la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 peuvent mettre en cause des facteurs qui sont difficiles \u00e0 expliquer :\nBien qu\u2019il soit utile que le juge tente d\u2019exposer clairement les motifs qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 croire un t\u00e9moin plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un autre, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou sur un point en particulier, il demeure que cet exercice n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement purement intellectuel et peut impliquer des facteurs difficiles \u00e0 \u00e9noncer. De plus, pour expliquer en d\u00e9tail pourquoi un t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9, il se peut que le juge doive tenir des propos peu flatteurs sur le t\u00e9moin. Or, le juge voudra peut\u2011\u00eatre \u00e9pargner \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour nier le crime, la honte de subir des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs sur son comportement, en plus de celle de voir son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9cart\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable. Bref, l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 est un exercice difficile et d\u00e9licat qui ne se pr\u00eate pas toujours \u00e0 une \u00e9nonciation compl\u00e8te et pr\u00e9cise.\n[197] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat F.H. c. McDougall, 2008 CSC 53 (McDougall), au paragraphe 76, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019arr\u00eat R.E.M., l\u2019observation suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e :\nEn fin de compte, ajouter foi \u00e0 un t\u00e9moignage et non \u00e0 un autre est affaire de jugement.\n[198] Dans la d\u00e9cision Van Berkel v. MPI Security Ltd (1997) 28 C.H.R.R. D\/504 (B.C.H.R.C.), le membre instructeur Kenneth Attafuah, se reportant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat McDougall, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces principes juridiques, la coh\u00e9rence du t\u00e9moignage de chacun des t\u00e9moins a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e en regard de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve compte tenu des circonstances actuelles entourant l\u2019emploi de la plaignante avec [de l\u2019entreprise intim\u00e9e]. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 la preuve sous l\u2019angle de la plausibilit\u00e9 dans les circonstances et \u00e9valu\u00e9 les motifs des t\u00e9moins. En outre, j\u2019ai port\u00e9 attention \u00e0 leur sens de l\u2019observation et \u00e0 leur m\u00e9moire, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 leur attitude et \u00e0 leur comportement sous serment, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Enfin, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 si leur t\u00e9moignage manquait de coh\u00e9sion interne ou s\u2019il y avait des incoh\u00e9rences et des contradictions importantes.\na) Le t\u00e9moin du plaignant Christopher Hughes [199] M. Hughes a parl\u00e9 des efforts infructueux qu\u2019il a faits pour retrouver son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lors du concours Vancouver 1002, affich\u00e9 le 9 juin 2003, et du concours Victoria 7003, affich\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2003. Comme premier t\u00e9moin dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, M. Hughes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise sur le traitement de ses demandes dans le cadre de ces deux concours; il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de questions qui, selon lui, constituaient de la manipulation de concours de la part de la direction.\n[200] En 1995, M. Hughes \u00e9tait au service de Revenu Canada \u00e0 Victoria (C.-B.) \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de recouvrement. Tout d\u2019abord employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, il a acquis le statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e en 1996. En mars 2001, il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, et, en 2002, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes saisonnier (de mai \u00e0 octobre), ce qui lui a permis de continuer \u00e0 travailler l\u2019hiver \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de services aux entreprises aupr\u00e8s de Revenu Canada. M. Hughes a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019une d\u00e9pression et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9 le 30 septembre 2004. M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ouvertement qu\u2019il avait contest\u00e9 son employeur, tout d\u2019abord comme d\u00e9nonciateur, ensuite par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un grief concernant des processus d\u2019embauche, puis au moyen d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de la part de l\u2019employeur et, enfin, de plaintes de discrimination au titre de la LCDP.\n[201] Conform\u00e9ment aux principes juridiques pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, j\u2019ai pris en consid\u00e9ration le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes en mettant particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019accent sur sa vraisemblance et sa coh\u00e9rence. Enfin, je suis convaincu que le t\u00e9moignage direct de M. Hughes est demeur\u00e9 intact en contre\u2011interrogatoire.\n[202] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes montrait qu\u2019il avait une connaissance d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des processus de dotation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, une connaissance qu\u2019il avait acquise au cours de ses propres d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s avec la direction de son employeur. En particulier, il avait fait preuve de diligence en mettant au jour une grande quantit\u00e9 de documents qui lui avaient procur\u00e9 des renseignements sur d\u2019autres personnes qui avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature avec succ\u00e8s en vue d\u2019un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[203] Je conclus que M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi. Son t\u00e9moignage peut situer un contexte dans lequel examiner le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant ainsi que celui des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nb) Le plaignant Levan Turner [204] J\u2019ai port\u00e9 une attention particuli\u00e8re au t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019a fait M. Turner au cours de son long contre-interrogatoire. Ce t\u00e9moignage est demeur\u00e9 nettement compatible avec le t\u00e9moignage principal qu\u2019il avait fait sur les questions principales qui \u00e9taient en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et il a confirm\u00e9 les comp\u00e9tences qu\u2019il avait acquises au cours de ses cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019emploi saisonnier au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Je conclus que M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi.\nc) Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Shalina Sharma [205] Mme Sharma a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re plausible au sujet des processus de dotation de l\u2019ASFC, ainsi que des changements que ces processus ont subis au fil des ans, particuli\u00e8rement des difficult\u00e9s caus\u00e9es par la cr\u00e9ation inopin\u00e9e de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 la fin 2003. Dans son t\u00e9moignage principal, Mme Sharma s\u2019est exprim\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re manifestement partiale au sujet de la question principale qu\u2019\u00e9tait la clause ambigu\u00eb de restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9e pour le processus de dotation du concours Vancouver 1002. Cependant, dans le cadre d\u2019un vigoureux contre-interrogatoire, Mme Sharma a admis que l\u2019on aurait pu consid\u00e9rer que la restriction vici\u00e9e, qui figurait sur l\u2019avis de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux personnes qui avaient pos\u00e9 leur candidature en vue d\u2019un emploi d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102 afin de travailler \u00e0 l\u2019endroit pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis, soit le district de l\u2019AIV, le district de Metro Vancouver ainsi que le district de Pacific Highway.\nd) Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Ron Tarnawski [206] Pour ce qui est de la question principale que constitue la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 lors du processus de dotation de Vancouver et de la mani\u00e8re dont il a interview\u00e9 le plaignant, le t\u00e9moignage principal de M. Tarnawski en apparence vraisemblable est devenu incoh\u00e9rent et argumentatif lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un rigoureux contre-interrogatoire, notamment au sujet de son application intraitable et incompr\u00e9hensible de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sur une vaste \u00e9chelle. Le r\u00e9sultat \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable, M. Turner a dit \u00ab non \u00bb en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pr\u00e9liminaire pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue (soit celle de savoir s\u2019il avait pos\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement sa candidature en vue de devenir inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 Vancouver), en ne faisant aucunement mention d\u2019une demande ant\u00e9rieure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion de Victoria. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une impasse, cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision de M. Tarnawski d\u2019appliquer sans vergogne une restriction ambigu\u00eb qu\u2019il avait con\u00e7ue conjointement et qu\u2019il avait appliqu\u00e9e uniquement \u00e0 M. Turner, jetant ainsi sur lui l\u2019ombre du mensonge.\ne) Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Terry Klassen [207] M\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on souvent vague et incoh\u00e9rente, M. Klassen, un surintendant int\u00e9rimaire, a relat\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re v\u00e9ridique une rencontre avec le plaignant ainsi que les discussions qu\u2019ils avaient eues au sujet d\u2019un examen du rendement annuel qu\u2019il avait fait pour le plaignant. Je suis convaincu que M. Klassen a relat\u00e9 avec franchise une autre conversation qu\u2019il avait eue avec le plaignant \u00e0 la suite de leur discussion concernant l\u2019examen du rendement, une discussion dans laquelle M. Klassen avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 au plaignant que les surintendants de Victoria avaient \u00e0 son sujet des perceptions n\u00e9gatives : il \u00e9tait paresseux et avait tendance \u00e0 se soustraire aux t\u00e2ches plus complexes difficiles qu\u2019un inspecteur des douanes est cens\u00e9 accomplir. J\u2019admets aussi qu\u2019apr\u00e8s ces discussions, M. Klassen ait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 deux courriels \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, dans lesquels il a consign\u00e9 les discussions qu\u2019il avait eues avec le plaignant, courriels qu\u2019il a transmis par la suite \u00e0 tous les autres surintendants, dont Trevor Baird et Catherine Pringle.\nf) Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Trevor Baird [208] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Baird a \u00e9t\u00e9 paradoxal, et verbeux plut\u00f4t que direct. Trop souvent, quand on lui posait une question simple, M. Baird y r\u00e9pondait par des arguments plut\u00f4t que par une r\u00e9ponse objective et impartiale.\n[209] Je conclus que M. Baird n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi au sujet des questions principales que le plaignant a soulev\u00e9es.\n[210] En particulier, en refusant d\u2019inclure dans le processus d\u2019entrevue le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on favorable le rendement de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, et en tentant par la suite de faire en sorte que Mme Patel admette que le r\u00e9cit fait par M. Turner au sujet du traitement d\u2019un voyageur difficile ait \u00e9t\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9 et mensonger, M. Baird s\u2019est montr\u00e9 sans scrupule. Ce qui soul\u00e8ve la question suivante : le processus d\u2019entrevue \u00e9tait-il un pr\u00e9texte, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avance par une perception discriminatoire st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e du plaignant, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait paresseux et ne disait pas la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un homme d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, noir et cliniquement ob\u00e8se et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait donc inacceptable qu\u2019on l\u2019embauche comme agent des services frontaliers?\ng) Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Nina Patel [211] Les souvenirs qu\u2019avait Mme Patel de l\u2019incident au cours duquel M. Turner l\u2019avait aid\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u2019occuper d\u2019un voyageur contrari\u00e9 et difficile \u00e9taient att\u00e9nu\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9coulement du temps, et cela est compr\u00e9hensible. Elle a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 digne de foi, m\u00eame si elle s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e coinc\u00e9e entre l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique que M. Baird lui avait fait inopin\u00e9ment, dans lequel celui-ci avait fait pression sur elle pour qu\u2019elle \u00e9value n\u00e9gativement la version des faits de M. Turner, et la propre opinion qu\u2019elle avait de M. Turner en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, une opinion qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait form\u00e9e au cours d\u2019un \u00e9t\u00e9 durant lequel ce dernier avait travaill\u00e9 sous sa supervision. \u00c0 l\u2019issue du contre-interrogatoire, Mme Patel a admis qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner de s\u2019occuper du voyageur, mais, \u00e0 son avis, il avait enjoliv\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit qu\u2019il avait fait au comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen afin de mieux se faire para\u00eetre. Mme Patel a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance, M. Turner n\u2019avait jamais induit de gens en erreur ou ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais exprim\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re mensong\u00e8re, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait franc, amical et ouvert.\nB. L\u2019analyse du concours Victoria 7003 [212] L\u2019entrevue de M. Turner en vue de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Victoria a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par M. Baird, \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a emp\u00each\u00e9 que l\u2019on se prononce sur ses comp\u00e9tences en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, une d\u00e9cision qui lui aurait permis de continuer \u00e0 chercher du travail aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans un contre-interrogatoire rigoureux, M. Baird a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019entrevue \u00e9tait devenue extr\u00eamement d\u00e9raisonnable \u2013 il s\u2019agissait en fait d\u2019une absurdit\u00e9 \u2013 \u00e0 cause du refus du comit\u00e9 de prendre en compte le dossier d\u2019emploi favorable de M. Turner \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, un dossier que M. Baird avait lui-m\u00eame r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en partie. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re cela \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les circonstances connexes, j\u2019en d\u00e9duis que M. Baird avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 au d\u00e9part que M. Turner \u2013 un homme noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, per\u00e7u comme souffrant d\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u2013 ne correspondait pas aux attentes qu\u2019avait M. Baird \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un agent des services frontaliers apte \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les nouvelles fonctions prescrites d\u2019application de la loi de l\u2019ASFC dans le cadre des services fournis aux voyageurs passant par les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e du Canada.\n[213] L\u2019argument de Me Champ, l\u2019avocat de M. Turner, \u00e0 savoir que les surintendants de Victoria avaient le sentiment que M. Turner \u00e9tait paresseux et malhonn\u00eate, d\u2019apr\u00e8s leur \u00e9valuation st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e de ce dernier, celle d\u2019un Noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr et ob\u00e8se, m\u2019a convaincu. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les deux courriels que M. Klassen a transmis \u00e0 tous les surintendants, dont M. Baird et Catherine Pringle, \u00e9tablissent cette attitude raciste des surintendants de Victoria. Aucun autre candidat n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un courriel semblable.\n[214] Les courriels de M. Klassen ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis aux surintendants les 4 et 12 octobre 2003. Le concours de Victoria \u00e9tait ouvert du 11 au 30 octobre 2003. M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2003 par le pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 Trevor Baird, ainsi que par les deux autres membres, Catherine Pringle et Cathy Zabo.\n[215] Confront\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire au sujet des courriels de M. Klassen, M. Baird a ni\u00e9 \u00eatre au courant de ces derniers, disant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9 pour avoir jet\u00e9 un coup d\u2019\u0153il dans sa bo\u00eete de messages \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 lui et aux autres surintendants. L\u2019invraisemblance de son explication a balay\u00e9 les derniers vestiges de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[216] Environ dix jours apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d\u2019entrevue, M. Baird a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Patel afin qu\u2019elle corrobore son opinion selon laquelle M. Turner avait relat\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re mensong\u00e8re les mesures qu\u2019ils avaient tous deux prises lors de l\u2019incident avec un voyageur difficile. Au vu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Patel, je suis convaincu que celle-ci a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner de parler au voyageur agit\u00e9, sachant, par exp\u00e9rience, qu\u2019il serait en mesure d\u2019amener l\u2019homme \u00e0 se calmer, ce qu\u2019il avait fait. Cette mesure extraordinaire de la part de M. Baird, pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen, une mesure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, est une circonstance aggravante qui souligne ma conclusion selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision de dire que M. Turner n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019un homme noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, ob\u00e8se et paresseux, dont M. Turner \u00e9tait le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, ne serait pas embauch\u00e9 par l\u2019ASFC, une agence nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e et ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019application de la loi.\n[217] Je conclus que la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a prise le comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen de juger les comp\u00e9tences en se fondant uniquement sur la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e par M. Turner au moment de l\u2019entrevue a fait en sorte que le processus d\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 arbitraire et discriminatoire et a constitu\u00e9 un pr\u00e9texte.\n[218] Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que le processus d\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 un pr\u00e9texte, qu\u2019il a expos\u00e9 M. Turner \u00e0 de la discrimination du fait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, ainsi que du fait de sa race et de son \u00e2ge, de sorte que M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement en tant qu\u2019ancien employ\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nC. L\u2019analyse du concours Vancouver 1002 [219] L\u2019avis relatif au concours de Vancouver indiquait : [traduction] \u00ab Les candidats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours \u00bb. L\u2019avis d\u00e9finissait aussi \u00ab ce poste \u00bb de la mani\u00e8re suivante : [traduction] \u00ab inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102, district de l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, district de Metro Vancouver, district de Pacific Highway, anglais \u00bb.\n[220] Je conclus que la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait vici\u00e9e par une ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 latente. Elle a deux sens \u2013 un large et un l\u2019autre \u00e9troit. Dans son sens large, la restriction s\u2019appliquerait aux candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s n\u2019importe o\u00f9 en Colombie\u2011Britannique et au Yukon depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ou, d\u2019ailleurs, n\u2019importe o\u00f9 au Canada pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102. Dans son sens \u00e9troit ou litt\u00e9ral, la restriction s\u2019appliquerait aux candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver depuis le 1er janvier 2002, pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes PM\u201102, district de l\u2019A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, district de Metro Vancouver et district de Pacific Highway.\n[221] \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sident a soumis cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 simple et \u00e9vidente \u00e0 M. Tarnawski, en laissant entendre qu\u2019on aurait pu consid\u00e9rer que la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux personnes ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9es pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes dans la r\u00e9gion de Metro Vancouver. M. Tarnawski a reconnu que le libell\u00e9 \u00e9tait ambigu :\n[traduction]\nM. Tarnawski : [\u2026] le libell\u00e9 cause des cauchemars, je crois.\nLe pr\u00e9sident : Eh bien, il aurait caus\u00e9 des cauchemars aux candidats aussi, n\u2019est\u2011ce pas?\nM. Tarnawski : Oui.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nTranscription : Page 2126, lignes 21 \u00e0 24.\n[222] Je conclus que la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, que Mme Sharma a con\u00e7ue \u00e0 la demande de M. Tarnawski et de son coll\u00e8gue de la Section du recrutement, M. Northcote, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e par ces derniers, de mani\u00e8re ni individuelle ni collective, afin de garantir qu\u2019elle avait un sens clair et unique aux yeux des personnes qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ASFC.\n[223] Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019affichage public de l\u2019avis de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver que M. Tarnawski s\u2019est rendu compte que la restriction \u00e9tait ambigu\u00eb. Le bon sens aurait d\u00fb le mettre en garde contre les risques qu\u2019il y avait d\u2019appliquer la restriction aux candidats r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 l\u2019annonce \u2013 cela n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas. Au lieu de cela, il a poursuivi le processus de dotation, d\u00e9cidant de demander \u00e0 chaque candidat s\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 pour le poste en question au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la restriction, en se disant que cette personne pr\u00e9sumerait que cela voulait dire n\u2019importe o\u00f9 en Colombie-Britannique.\n[224] \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation contractuelle selon laquelle un terme ambigu doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la partie qui en est l\u2019auteur devrait s\u2019appliquer aux processus de dotation pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 un emploi qu\u2019ex\u00e9cute l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ASFC. De ce fait, selon la r\u00e8gle du contra proferentem, il aurait fallu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e interpr\u00e8te la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 l\u2019avis, dont faisait partie M. Turner. Si M. Tarnawski l\u2019avait fait, cela n\u2019aurait pas perturb\u00e9 le processus de dotation concernant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[225] Lors de l\u2019entrevue relative au concours de Vancouver, M. Tarnawski a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le 1er janvier 2002 pour [traduction] \u00ab ce poste \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le poste des Douanes d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019avis annon\u00e7ant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu que non, s\u2019appuyant sur son interpr\u00e9tation de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, et il n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019il avait pass\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement dans le cadre d\u2019un processus de dotation \u00e0 Victoria.\n[226] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait examin\u00e9 avec soin la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux candidats ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9 leur candidature \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes dans le district de Metro Vancouver de l\u2019ASFC. Quand M. Tarnawski a demand\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Avez-vous jamais pos\u00e9 votre candidature pour ce poste? \u00bb, M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu que non.\n[227] Quelques jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue (et s\u2019appuyant sur le fait qu\u2019il avait reconnu M. Turner parce qu\u2019il avait pris part \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue relative au concours Victoria 7012), M. Tarnawski a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 la date de l\u2019entrevue du concours de Victoria, en a aussit\u00f4t exclu M. Turner et a ensuite aggrav\u00e9 la situation en pr\u00e9sumant que M. Turner avait menti en omettant de faire \u00e9tat de l\u2019entrevue pass\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 Victoria.\n[228] Plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai trait\u00e9 de l\u2019entrevue pass\u00e9e le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003 dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7012 et j\u2019ai jug\u00e9 que M. Tarnawski avait conclu trop rapidement que M. Turner avait \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de faire des pr\u00e9somptions, quand ce dernier avait d\u00e9crit au cours de l\u2019entrevue de quelle fa\u00e7on il faisait affaire avec les voyageurs. J\u2019ai conclu que M. Tarnawski, en \u00e9valuant M. Turner ainsi, a fait montre de sa propre propension \u00e0 faire des pr\u00e9somptions, et je conclus que cette propension a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur lors de l\u2019entrevue r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver. Confront\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation restrictive de M. Turner, M. Tarnawski a inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9ment appliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re large le libell\u00e9 ambigu de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et a estim\u00e9 que la r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative de M. Turner \u00e9tait mensong\u00e8re, et aussi qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une tentative pour induire en erreur le jury de Vancouver.\n[229] Lors de l\u2019instruction, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a reconnu que, si l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas appliqu\u00e9 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, on aurait conclu que M. Turner \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, qu\u2019il avait montr\u00e9, lors de sa premi\u00e8re entrevue, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait suffisamment comp\u00e9tent pour \u00eatre inscrit dans un r\u00e9pertoire de dotation, ce qui impliquait la possibilit\u00e9 de recevoir une offre d\u2019emploi de l\u2019ASFC. L\u2019avocat a n\u00e9anmoins soutenu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de M. Tarnawski, de m\u00eame que l\u2019application du libell\u00e9 ambigu de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ambigu\u00eb, avaient mis fin au processus de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e.\n[230] Je signale qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9tabli lors du contre-interrogatoire de M. Tarnawski qu\u2019aucun autre candidat au concours de Vancouver n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au traitement dont M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime : il \u00e9tait le seul candidat \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu \u00e0 cause de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, m\u00eame si l\u2019application uniforme de cette disposition aurait \u00e9galement exclu d\u2019autres candidats; par ailleurs, il \u00e9tait le seul candidat \u00e0 avoir re\u00e7u apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue une lettre indiquant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu.\n[231] Compte tenu du fait que c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Tarnawski qui avait reconnu M. Turner, ce qui l\u2019avait amen\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier la date de l\u2019entrevue ant\u00e9rieure de ce dernier et \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 lui seul une interpr\u00e9tation large de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, le fait de ne pas avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des autres candidats en se basant sur cette m\u00eame interpr\u00e9tation discr\u00e9dite M. Tarnawski. Cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un manquement grave \u00e0 l\u2019obligation qu\u2019avait le comit\u00e9 d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re impartiale envers M. Turner.\n[232] Pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une entrevue devant un jury de s\u00e9lection en vue de d\u00e9terminer la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019un candidat qui souhaite obtenir un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ASFC, il est n\u00e9cessaire que les membres des comit\u00e9s d\u2019examen de la direction changent de mode, qu\u2019ils d\u00e9laissent toute partialit\u00e9 sur le plan de la gestion et qu\u2019ils adoptent une position d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 sur le plan d\u00e9cisionnel.\n[233] Au lieu de cela, M. Tarnawski, \u00e0 titre de pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen concernant le concours Vancouver 1002, a fait preuve d\u2019intransigeance et d\u2019un comportement vexatoire en d\u00e9cidant d\u2019exclure M. Turner parce que, aux yeux de ce dernier, la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019aux candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver pour le poste d\u2019inspecteur des douanes dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver de l\u2019ASFC. Je conclus que M. Tarnawski aurait pu \u2013 et d\u00fb \u2013 interpr\u00e9ter la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e9troite, sans que cela cr\u00e9e de probl\u00e8mes pour le concours Vancouver 1002.\n[234] Il est incontestable que M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement ayant des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9favorables dans le cadre du processus de Vancouver. Le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer si ce traitement d\u00e9favorable est assimilable \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur des motifs illicites.\nD. L\u2019application du droit pertinent La d\u00e9cision Shakes a) L\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision Shakes au concours Vancouver 1002 [235] Ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les d\u00e9cisions Shakes et Israeli \u00e9tablissent un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets pour ce qui est d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination :\n1) le plaignant \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour occuper l\u2019emploi en question;\n2) le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9;\n3) une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e que le plaignant, mais qui ne pr\u00e9sentait pas les caract\u00e9ristiques sur lesquelles ce dernier avait fond\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne, a obtenu le poste.\n[236] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a reconnu que, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, M. Turner se serait qualifi\u00e9 pour le r\u00e9pertoire de dotation dans le cadre du processus de Vancouver; ce fait, de pair avec les rapports du rendement positifs de M. Turner, \u00e9tablit que celui-ci \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour travailler comme inspecteur des douanes. Cela satisfait au premier crit\u00e8re du volet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes.\n[237] M. Turner satisfait \u00e9galement au deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9.\n[238] Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes rev\u00eat un aspect unique dans le cas du concours Vancouver 1002, parce que la raison pour laquelle l\u2019employeur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas inscrire M. Turner dans le r\u00e9pertoire des candidats comp\u00e9tents \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur son inadmissibilit\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que sur son manque de comp\u00e9tences.\n[239] Les t\u00e9moignages de MM. Hughes, Turner, Tarnawski et Baird me convainquent que l\u2019on a clairement \u00e9tabli que d\u2019autres candidats n\u2019ayant pas les caract\u00e9ristiques sur lesquelles M. Turner a fond\u00e9 sa plainte, soit l\u2019\u00e2ge, la race ainsi qu\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue due \u00e0 l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre exclus si cette restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re uniforme, et qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, cela satisfait au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes.\n[240] Par ailleurs, en me fondant sur le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tarnawski, je conclus que la grande majorit\u00e9 des candidats au concours Vancouver 1002, contrairement \u00e0 M. Turner, n\u2019avaient aucune exp\u00e9rience de travail ant\u00e9rieure aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ADRC ou de l\u2019agence qui lui a succ\u00e9d\u00e9, l\u2019ASFC. Cela renforce ma conclusion quant au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes.\nb) L\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision Shakes au concours Victoria 7003 [241] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Turner, \u00e9tay\u00e9 par celui de M. Hughes et, dans une large mesure, par ce que M. Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire rigoureux, \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis dont il est question dans la d\u00e9cision Shakes. Le plaignant \u00e9tait : 1) qualifi\u00e9 pour occuper l\u2019emploi d\u2019inspecteur des douanes\/agent des services frontaliers; 2) n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9; 3) d\u2019autres candidats, n\u2019ayant pas les qualifications du plaignant et ne pr\u00e9sentant pas les caract\u00e9ristiques sur lesquelles ce dernier a fond\u00e9 sa plainte, ont obtenu par la suite un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nc) L\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision Basi aux concours Vancouver 1002 et Victoria 7003 [242] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que les d\u00e9cisions des comit\u00e9s d\u2019entrevue respectifs constituaient un exercice appropri\u00e9 du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la direction; que, dans le cas du concours de Vancouver, M. Turner, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 cause de la restriction publi\u00e9e dans l\u2019avis d\u2019emploi; que, dans le cas du concours de Victoria, M. Turner, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait par ailleurs comp\u00e9tent en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas parvenu \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer sa comp\u00e9tence en tant qu\u2019inspecteur des douanes au cours du bref processus d\u2019entrevue. L\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est mal fond\u00e9 et trompeur.\n[243] Compte tenu de la totalit\u00e9 des circonstances entourant les deux concours, et que, dans les deux cas, des pr\u00e9textes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s, je suis convaincu que le caract\u00e8re subtil de la discrimination a impr\u00e9gn\u00e9 les deux processus de dotation, et que ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre de ces derniers n\u2019\u00e9tait aussi innocent qu\u2019on le pr\u00e9tendait. Comme il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une affaire de preuves circonstancielles, cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 me demander s\u2019il y a lieu de tirer une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination. Je conclus qu\u2019il ressort du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant et de celui de M. Hughes qu\u2019une telle inf\u00e9rence est nettement plus probable que l\u2019inf\u00e9rence possible d\u2019une conduite circonspecte de la part des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e : MM. Tarnawski et Baird.\nd) L\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision Radek aux concours de Vancouver et de Victoria [244] La d\u00e9cision Radek pr\u00e9vient les tribunaux administratifs d\u2019\u00eatre conscients de l\u2019effet de la discrimination compos\u00e9e, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter de se fonder sur un mode singulier d\u2019analyse. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je suis conscient que la plainte de discrimination de M. Turner repose sur plusieurs motifs de discrimination et que l\u2019article 3.1 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que les actes discriminatoires comprennent les actes fond\u00e9s sur un ou plusieurs motifs de distinction illicite, ce qui soul\u00e8ve la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un motif principal de discrimination puisse, de mani\u00e8re synergique, recouper d\u2019autres motifs de discrimination moins \u00e9vidents et \u00eatre aggrav\u00e9 par ceux-ci.\n[245] Je conclus que la plainte de M. Turner comporte des motifs de discrimination interd\u00e9pendants, qu\u2019il y a effectivement eu une discrimination compos\u00e9e et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un facteur dans ma d\u00e9cision selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis des actes discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Turner.\nE. La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019employeur \u00e0 la preuve prima facie Le concours Vancouver 1002 [246] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle donn\u00e9 une explication ad\u00e9quate \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire plus probable \u2013 pour ce qui est de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement que le plaignant a subie dans le cadre du concours Vancouver 1002? Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019explication raisonnable.\n[247] Par ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large du libell\u00e9 ambigu de la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, ni donn\u00e9 la raison pour laquelle cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 un candidat autre que M. Turner. En fait, au vu du dossier dont dispose le Tribunal, il semble que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e du tout.\n[248] Le fait d\u2019avoir reconnu M. Turner et d\u00e9clench\u00e9 ainsi une recherche sur son admissibilit\u00e9 contraste vivement avec l\u2019aveu de M. Tarnawski selon lequel aucun autre candidat n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu, son excuse \u00e9tant que cela aurait caus\u00e9 trop de travail, d\u2019o\u00f9 sa d\u00e9cision de demander \u00e0 chaque candidat s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interview\u00e9 lors d\u2019un concours ant\u00e9rieur et d\u2019accepter qu\u2019une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative suffisait pour que l\u2019entrevue se poursuive.\n[249] Cependant, il me faut aller au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019explication de M. Tarnawski, relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen selon laquelle M. Turner avait enfreint la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, et examiner la probabilit\u00e9 que des attitudes st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9es aient eu une incidence sur la candidature de M. Turner au concours Vancouver 1002. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les probabilit\u00e9s entourant cette affaire m\u2019am\u00e8nent inexorablement \u00e0 conclure que M. Tarnawski a consid\u00e9r\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e et n\u00e9gative, que M. Turner \u00e9tait un Noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr et ob\u00e8se, probablement paresseux et menteur, et qu\u2019il serait donc inacceptable en tant qu\u2019\u00e9ventuel employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC, une agence nouvellement \u00e9tablie et ax\u00e9e sur l\u2019application de la loi.\n[250] Je conclus que le fait que M. Tarnawski a impos\u00e9 la restriction \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9texte, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un moyen arbitraire et exp\u00e9ditif de mettre un terme \u00e0 la candidature de M. Turner dans le cadre du processus de dotation, privant ainsi ce dernier d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 de devenir un employ\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC.\nLe concours Victoria 7003 [251] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination par une explication ad\u00e9quate \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire plus probable \u2013 pour la diff\u00e9rence de traitement que le plaignant a subie dans le cadre du concours Victoria 7003? Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019explication raisonnable.\n[252] Il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi M. Baird, le pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 d\u2019examen, un surintendant qui avait travaill\u00e9 avec M. Turner et r\u00e9dig\u00e9 des rapports du rendement positifs sur son travail \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes, exclut de mani\u00e8re dogmatique de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de M. Turner, faite par le comit\u00e9, que ce dernier avait travaill\u00e9 avec comp\u00e9tence comme inspecteur des douanes au cours des ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures. Ce processus tout \u00e0 fait inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9 par la tentative amorale de M. Baird, peu apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue, pour obtenir de la surintendante Nina Patel qu\u2019elle atteste que M. Turner avait menti dans sa fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9crire au comit\u00e9 comment il avait r\u00e9agi face \u00e0 un voyageur agit\u00e9, une intervention qu\u2019il avait faite \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de Mme Patel.\n[253] Ce comportement inacceptable et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u2019explique pas de mani\u00e8re raisonnable l\u2019\u00e9valuation du comit\u00e9 selon laquelle M. Turner n\u2019avait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises pour \u00eatre inspecteur des douanes; il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019un motif pour tirer l\u2019inf\u00e9rence de fait selon laquelle M. Baird consid\u00e9rait M. Turner, de mani\u00e8re st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e et n\u00e9gative, comme un Noir d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, ob\u00e8se et paresseux, et avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le priver de la possibilit\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019ASFC en tant qu\u2019agent des services frontaliers en uniforme.\n[254] Compte tenu des conclusions ant\u00e9rieures que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9es au sujet du concours Vancouver 1002 et du concours Victoria 7003, dans le contexte des circonstances connexes dont M. Turner a fait \u00e9tat, et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence applicable, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Turner, en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, du fait de l\u2019\u00e2ge, de la race et de la d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue \u2013 l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u2013 de M. Turner, et qu\u2019il a soumis M. Turner \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[255] En terminant, je suis guid\u00e9 par la d\u00e9cision Sinclair, dans laquelle l\u2019arbitre s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Spence, une d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, et a cit\u00e9, en partie, le passage suivant :\n[traduction] Une couche importante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 professe ouvertement des vues racistes. Une couche plus large encore est inconsciemment influenc\u00e9e par des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux n\u00e9gatifs. De surcro\u00eet, nos institutions, y compris la justice p\u00e9nale, refl\u00e8tent ces st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes n\u00e9gatifs qu\u2019elles perp\u00e9tuent. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments se conjuguent pour propager le fl\u00e9au du racisme dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re. Les Noirs sont parmi les principales victimes de ce fl\u00e9au.\nVI. Les conclusions [256] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Turner a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie que les surintendants Ron Tarnawski et Trevor Baird de l\u2019ASFC lui ont s\u00e9par\u00e9ment fait subir des actes discriminatoires en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, des actes fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, la couleur et une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue \u2013 l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9.\n[257] En me fondant sur les motifs expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019ensemble de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances connexes, je suis arriv\u00e9 aux conclusions de fait suivantes : M. Tarnawski et M. Baird n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins dignes de foi; leurs caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9taient semblables : ils \u00e9taient souvent r\u00e9ticents et se sont exprim\u00e9s \u00e0 maintes reprises avec une certaine prolixit\u00e9 afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 donner des r\u00e9ponses directes et impartiales. Tous deux ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire. Chaque fois que leur t\u00e9moignage diff\u00e9rait de celui de M. Turner, j\u2019ai souscrit au t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier.\n[258] Ni M. Tarnawski ni M. Baird n\u2019ont expliqu\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas eu lieu ou que la conduite \u00e9tait en quelque sorte non discriminatoire.\n[259] Je conclus que les entrevues que M. Tarnawski (concours Vancouver 1002) et M. Baird (concours Victoria 7003) ont fait passer \u00e0 M. Turner \u00e9taient vici\u00e9es et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9es, qu\u2019elles se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a priv\u00e9 M. Turner de la possibilit\u00e9 de poser sa candidature en vue d\u2019un emploi d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e au sein de l\u2019ASFC et que, dans chaque cas, la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 arbitraire et a servi de pr\u00e9texte, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle constituait un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[260] L\u2019article 7 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il et fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[261] L\u2019article 10 de la LCDP est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\nVII. La d\u00e9cision [262] Je conclus que le plaignant a justifi\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle, du fait de son \u00e2ge, de sa race et d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience per\u00e7ue, soit l\u2019ob\u00e9sit\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019actes discriminatoires au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP \u00e0 cause du refus de l\u2019ASFC de continuer de l\u2019employer, ainsi que de l\u2019utilisation discriminatoire des m\u00e9thodes de dotation appliqu\u00e9es dans le cadre des concours Vancouver 1002 et Victoria 7003 comme pr\u00e9texte, avec le r\u00e9sultat que le plaignant s\u2019est vu priver d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi.\n[263] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP dispose qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ le plaignant qui a souffert d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice moral en tant que victime d\u2019un acte discriminatoire. Apr\u00e8s une audience ult\u00e9rieure sur la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder, j\u2019ordonnerai \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant la juste somme qui l\u2019indemnisera du pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre vu priver d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi.\n[264] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP dispose que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s\u2019il est conclu que l\u2019acte discriminatoire en question \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Je conclus que les gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e Ron Tarnawski et Trevor Baird ont agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e en privant le plaignant d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi. En temps utile, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder, je rendrai une ordonnance qui indemnisera le plaignant du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de leur geste.\n[265] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une victime peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte commis. Je conclus que le plaignant a effectivement perdu le salaire qu\u2019il aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent des services frontaliers. Le montant de la perte sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 accorder. La perte sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en calculant le total des gains que le plaignant aurait acquis \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent des services frontaliers et en d\u00e9duisant de cette somme le salaire que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de tirer d\u2019un autre emploi att\u00e9nuant. Le revenu que le plaignant a gagn\u00e9 dans le cadre de ses efforts pour att\u00e9nuer sa perte de salaire en tant qu\u2019agent des services frontaliers doit \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9 par des d\u00e9tails et des d\u00e9clarations de revenus personnelles.\n[266] Aux termes du paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, des int\u00e9r\u00eats peuvent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s sur toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s sur une base annuelle, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats seront calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte pour ce qui est de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux.\n[267] Lors de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 ordonner, j\u2019examinerai si le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent pour ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019offrir un emploi au plaignant.\n[268] Le Tribunal se d\u00e9clare comp\u00e9tent pour r\u00e9gler toutes les questions qui d\u00e9couleront de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, et ce, pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle elle est rendue.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 entre autres mesures correctives qu\u2019elle soit indemnis\u00e9e en totalit\u00e9 pour le salaire qu\u2019elle aurait gagn\u00e9 et les avantages sociaux auxquels elle aurait eu droit entre le 1er mars 2007 et le 29 septembre 2010, si elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Il a ordonn\u00e9 en particulier ce qui suit :\n[183] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu'elle a perdus, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j'ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d'avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2007 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. J'ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu'elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n'avait pas d'absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n[2] Dans une autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 2 octobre 2013, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur deux questions :\na) Quelle est la bonne m\u00e9thode pour calculer le salaire (\u00ab montants suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb compris) qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 la plaignante?\nb) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu des avantages sociaux qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7us, et si oui, \u00e0 quel montant d\u2019indemnisation a-t-elle droit?\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des parties, le Tribunal est maintenant pr\u00eat \u00e0 rendre sa d\u00e9cision, en esp\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle pourra mettre un terme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[4] L\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 juste n\u2019est pas une science exacte. Le caract\u00e8re complexe de la convention collective le complique d\u2019autant plus en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en particulier \u00e0 propos du paiement du salaire et des montants suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il importe \u00e9galement de se rappeler \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que les parties ont eu amplement l\u2019occasion \u00e0 l\u2019audience de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs arguments concernant \u00e0 la fois la question de la discrimination et celle des dommages. Je dois de plus traiter avec prudence les questions dont je suis saisi. La pr\u00e9sente instance ne doit pas \u00eatre abord\u00e9e comme s\u2019il y a eu disjonction de ces deux questions. Tel n\u2019est pas le cas. Je dois aussi veiller \u00e0 ne pas permettre aux parties de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur la question des dommages. Il s\u2019agit de trancher les questions dont je suis saisi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce avec les preuves qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de l\u2019audience.\n[5] Il est possible, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H-6, d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable de l\u2019acte discriminatoire \u00ab d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte \u00bb. Il faut donc autant que possible replacer la plaignante dans la situation qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la sienne si elle avait travaill\u00e9 chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[6] La plaignante all\u00e8gue dans son m\u00e9moire que son salaire devrait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9 en multipliant par le chiffre de 4 300 milles par mois le taux de millage applicable pr\u00e9vu par la convention collective. S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 22.10a) de celle-ci, elle soutient essentiellement qu\u2019elle avait un salaire garanti de 4 300 milles par mois. Cet alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] 22.10 a) Le personnel affect\u00e9 aux op\u00e9rations, qui est en situation de disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler pendant son mois-millage entier, et dont le nom figure au tableau de remplacement vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la clause 36.2, ou du service de ligne ou commun dans les gares incluant un territoire de service prolong\u00e9 :\n\u2022 a droit \u00e0 4 300 milles s\u2019il travaille comme chef de train;\n\u2022 la pr\u00e9sente garantie est \u00e9tablie au prorata, par p\u00e9riode de 14 jours de rajustement du tableau.\n[7] Certes, la Compagnie a l\u2019obligation de permettre au personnel d\u2019accumuler 4 300 milles en fournissant des possibilit\u00e9s de travailler en nombre suffisant, mais le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 22.10a) pr\u00e9cise que la garantie des 4 300 milles s\u2019applique uniquement aux chefs de train [traduction] \u00ab en situation de disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler pendant leur mois-millage entier \u00bb. Si donc un chef de train d\u00e9cide, pour quelque raison que ce soit, de ne pas \u00eatre disponible pendant une partie du mois, elle ou il n\u2019aura pas droit \u00e0 la garantie des 4 300 milles pour ce mois-l\u00e0. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 22.10b) pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que cette garantie [traduction] \u00ab est proportionnellement r\u00e9duite du nombre de milles parcourus pendant le service de ligne pour chaque p\u00e9riode de service pendant laquelle l\u2019employ\u00e9 aurait gagn\u00e9 un salaire s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 disponible et pour chaque appel manqu\u00e9 \u00bb. Cet alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9voit aussi que l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui manque plus de deux appels pendant une p\u00e9riode de 14 jours [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a plus droit \u00e0 aucune garantie \u00bb, et n\u2019est alors r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 que pour les milles parcourus pendant son travail. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 22.10c) pr\u00e9voit la r\u00e9duction de la garantie dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 se r\u00e9serve du repos pendant plus de 14 heures cons\u00e9cutives. Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que ces dispositions r\u00e9unies \u00e9tablissent que le droit des chefs de train \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s 4 300 milles ne vaut pas pour chaque mois de leur emploi. Diverses d\u00e9cisions de leur part peuvent avoir pour effet de r\u00e9duire leur salaire garanti ou m\u00eame de le supprimer enti\u00e8rement.\n[8] Il faudrait que la plaignante \u00e9tablisse, pour \u00e9tayer sa demande de salaire calcul\u00e9 au taux de 4 300 milles par mois, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en situation de disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler chaque mois entier entre le 1er mars 2007 et le 17 octobre 2010. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019a appuy\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention. Les deux parties ont fait \u00e9tat dans leur m\u00e9moire d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s 2010, afin de tenter d\u2019appuyer leurs arguments respectifs concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette clause. Je ne tiendrai pas compte de ces preuves, puisque le Tribunal n\u2019y a pas eu acc\u00e8s quand il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision.\n[9] J\u2019appliquerai le crit\u00e8re de la fa\u00e7on dont le Tribunal aurait tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire en 2010 si on lui avait demand\u00e9 de rendre une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9cise sur la perte de salaire. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les arguments des deux parties en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de 2010 ainsi que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, je conclus que c\u2019est la d\u00e9marche de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Le Tribunal aurait privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 le mode de la comparaison et puisque lors de l\u2019audience, les parties avaient \u00e9voqu\u00e9 M. Thom et aucun autre employ\u00e9, M. Thom aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le facteur de comparaison idoine. La plaignante fait \u00e9tat dans son m\u00e9moire d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s qui, selon elle, auraient mieux permis la comparaison, mais comme elle n\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 aucune de ces personnes \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je ne tiendrai pas compte de celles-ci dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[10] M. Thom \u00e9tait chef de train et travaillait pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00e0 la gare d\u2019attache de la plaignante, Jasper, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il avait alors la m\u00eame anciennet\u00e9 que celle-ci. Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que, du fait de leur anciennet\u00e9 semblable, la plaignante aurait pu recevoir le m\u00eame nombre de possibilit\u00e9s de travailler que M. Thom. Pour les p\u00e9riodes d\u2019absence de celui-ci, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a utilis\u00e9 le salaire du travailleur pr\u00e9sent qui \u00e9tait le subalterne imm\u00e9diat de M. Thom pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e. En examinant le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par celui-ci quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent et le travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par le chef de train qui \u00e9tait le subalterne imm\u00e9diat de M. Thom pendant que celui-ci n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est ainsi arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une repr\u00e9sentation du travail qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante. Ceci n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas aussi pr\u00e9cis ou exact qu\u2019elle le souhaiterait, mais en l\u2019absence de dons de clairvoyance particuliers, ce calcul est aussi pr\u00e9cis que possible, et je ne vois pas comment le Tribunal serait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente si la question lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience.\n[11] \u00c0 propos des \u00ab montants suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb, l\u2019intim\u00e9e les calcule selon la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode que pour le salaire. De fait, elle a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante une somme \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de ce que M. Thom a gagn\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, salaire et \u00ab montants suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb compris. De m\u00eame que pour le salaire, le Tribunal estime que la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour calculer ces montants est la plus exacte possible. Si le Tribunal avait d\u00fb les calculer, en tenant compte de la preuve dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, il aurait \u00ab employ\u00e9 \u00bb la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode.\n[12] \u00c0 propos des avantages sociaux, le Tribunal \u00e9nonce dans sa d\u00e9cision que la plaignante doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e de la perte totale de ceux-ci, sans pr\u00e9ciser de mode sp\u00e9cial de calcul de cette perte. La plaignante fait valoir qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu des avantages sociaux qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7us, et que la bonne m\u00e9thode pour calculer le montant de l\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 lui verser est la comparaison, fond\u00e9e sur la valeur des cotisations annuelles vers\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour obtenir le r\u00e9gime d\u2019avantages sociaux. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend quant \u00e0 elle que la plaignante n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu des avantages sociaux, car elle a continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre couverte par le r\u00e9gime de son mari. L\u2019intim\u00e9e emploie \u00e9galement son mari.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les arguments des parties sur ce point, le Tribunal conclut que la position de la plaignante est la plus sens\u00e9e. Il conclut donc qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu d\u2019avantages sociaux, d\u2019un montant \u00e9gal \u00e0 la valeur des cotisations annuelles que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a vers\u00e9es pour obtenir le r\u00e9gime d\u2019avantages sociaux, diminu\u00e9 des sommes pay\u00e9es pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par le prestataire du r\u00e9gime pour les avantages sociaux de la plaignante dans le r\u00e9gime de son mari. Selon les chiffres \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre les parties au cours des n\u00e9gociations pr\u00e9liminaires pour r\u00e9soudre l\u2019affaire, le montant des cotisations annuelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 2 965,90 $, soit un montant total de 10 627,88 $. La plaignante a donc droit \u00e0 ce montant de 10 627,88 $, diminu\u00e9 du montant net en dollars des avantages sociaux pay\u00e9 pour elle dans le r\u00e9gime de son mari. Pour que ce montant soit calcul\u00e9, la plaignante consentira \u00e0 ce que le prestataire du r\u00e9gime divulgue ces renseignements simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[14] J\u2019apporte donc les r\u00e9ponses suivantes aux deux questions :\na) Quelle est la bonne m\u00e9thode pour calculer le salaire (\u00ab montants suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb compris) qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 la plaignante?\nLe Tribunal conclut que la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e a calcul\u00e9 le salaire, montants suppl\u00e9mentaires compris, est la bonne m\u00e9thode.\nb) La plaignante a-t-elle droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu des avantages sociaux qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7us, et si oui, \u00e0 quel montant d\u2019indemnisation a-t-elle droit?\nOui, la plaignante a droit \u00e0 des indemnit\u00e9s qui tiennent lieu des avantages sociaux qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7us. Le montant total de ces derniers est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 10 627,88 $, moins le co\u00fbt des avantages sociaux vers\u00e9s pour elle dans le r\u00e9gime de son mari. La plaignante consentira \u00e0 ce que le prestataire du r\u00e9gime divulgue ces renseignements simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 14 mars 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1355\/8505\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Denise Seeley c.

Contexte [1] En date du 17 janvier 2005, madame Yanick Lindor, plaignante au dossier, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) en vertu des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C.(1985), ch. H-6 (la Loi), \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada, soit l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sentes.\n[2] En date du 17 mars 2010, la Commission, en vertu de l\u2019article 44(3)a) de la Loi a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) sous la portion de la plainte qui touchait \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la plaignante et par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 la portion de la plainte en ce qui a trait aux motifs de distinction illicite quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge, la couleur, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la situation familiale de la plaignante.\nA. Position de la plaignante [3] Au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait requise en premier par le Tribunal et, selon la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, une deuxi\u00e8me audition en ce qui a trait aux dommages pourrait alors \u00eatre requise.\n[4] Dans son argumentation, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ferait entendre deux t\u00e9moins : madame Yanick Lindor, la plaignante ainsi que madame Isabelle Borr\u00e9, une agente des relations de travail pour l\u2019Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s professionnels.\n[5] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante indique qu\u2019il existe une d\u00e9ficience qui sera prouv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audition, que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, que la plaignante a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et cela \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Finalement, il all\u00e8gue les dispositions de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement.\nB. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [6] Dans sa pr\u00e9sentation, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique au Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de preuve prima facie de discrimination bas\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience telle qu\u2019all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la plaignante.\n[7] De plus, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique au Tribunal que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 les exigences \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires du programme auquel elle avait accept\u00e9 de souscrire et qu\u2019il y avait toujours eu des lacunes importantes dans le travail effectu\u00e9 par la plaignante.\n[8] Il indique au Tribunal que la d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante fut prise uniquement sur des motifs selon lesquels la plaignante ne pouvait pas respecter les exigences \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires du programme et n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la plaignante.\n[9] Cons\u00e9quemment, il indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a mis fin au programme d\u2019apprentissage auquel la plaignante avait accept\u00e9 de souscrire uniquement en raison de son rendement insatisfaisant qui s\u2019est manifest\u00e9 tout au long de la p\u00e9riode pertinente et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019aurait donc commis aucun acte discriminatoire.\n[10] Au niveau de sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait entendre les sept (7) t\u00e9moins suivants :\n\u2212 Madame Louise Caron, traductrice au sein du service du Bureau de la traduction, Service Criminologie qui rel\u00e8ve du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et Service gouvernementaux Canada ;\n\u2212 Madame Manon Boucher, superviseuse de la plaignante ;\n\u2212 Madame C\u00e9line Marchand, encadreuse de la plaignante ;\n\u2212 Monsieur Simon Audy, traducteur au sein du Bureau de la traduction, service de criminologie ;\n\u2212 Madame Micheline Audet, gestionnaire de cas dans le dossier de la plaignante ;\n\u2212 Madame Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, agente des relations de travail dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier ;\n\u2212 Madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, directrice de la Direction de la traduction multilingue, r\u00e9gions et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale au Bureau de la traduction.\nII. Les faits A. Preuve de la plaignante - T\u00e9moin Yanick Lindor [11] Au d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 en date du 10 octobre 2002 de suivre un cours de traduction en vertu du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR (Traduction socio-\u00e9conomique, politique et juridique \/ Criminologie) \u00e0 Ottawa. Cette acceptation faisait suite \u00e0 une offre qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 septembre 2002 dans laquelle la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 suivre une formation afin de devenir traductrice dans le cadre du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR \u00e0 compter du 18 novembre 2002.\n[12] Au soutient de cette lettre se trouvait un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conditions d\u2019emploi qui faisait \u00e9tat du traitement, de la p\u00e9riode de stage et de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019apprentissage. La p\u00e9riode d\u2019apprentissage devait permettre \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019obtenir une Norme de comp\u00e9tence (niveau TR-02) en une p\u00e9riode maximale de deux (2) ans avec possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9e plus rapidement au niveau op\u00e9rationnel, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au niveau TR-02.\n[13] Tel qu\u2019en fait foi ledit r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conditions d\u2019emploi, les objectifs du programme d\u2019apprentissage devaient permettre \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019obtenir la \u00ab formation en vue d\u2019atteindre la Norme de comp\u00e9tence (niveau TR-02) \u00bb, avec une \u00ab mise en place d\u2019une culture d\u2019entreprise dans le cadre d\u2019une administration publique \u00bb et un \u00ab d\u00e9veloppement du sens du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-3).\n[14] Le m\u00eame r\u00e9sum\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de travailler dans des conditions stressantes, avec une \u00ab mise de l\u2019avant de qualit\u00e9s comme la souplesse et la disponibilit\u00e9 dans un contexte d\u2019optimisation des ressources \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-3 des documents de la Plaignante).\n[15] Cons\u00e9quemment, \u00e0 l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019offre qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, un plan d\u2019encadrement fait au nom de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ann\u00e9es allant du 18 novembre 2002 au 18 novembre 2004.\n[16] Il est \u00e0 noter que dans le plan d\u2019encadrement soumis \u00e0 la plaignante, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il faut compter deux (2) ann\u00e9es avant qu\u2019un dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 en traduction soit au niveau de travail, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire :\n\u2022 [Q]u\u2019il satisfasse pleinement aux exigences qualitatives de l\u2019employeur, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il puisse traduire en autonomie toutes les cat\u00e9gories de texte de son service ou de son \u00e9quipe, selon la situation particuli\u00e8re du service dans lequel il est affect\u00e9, peu importe le niveau de difficult\u00e9 et le degr\u00e9 d\u2019urgence; l\u2019autonomie signifie que la grande majorit\u00e9 des textes ne n\u00e9cessite aucune r\u00e9vision;\n\u2022 qu\u2019il satisfasse pleinement aux exigences quantitatives de l\u2019employeur, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il atteigne le rendement quantitatif attendu, lequel est mesur\u00e9 sous forme de revenus g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n(Pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-5)\n[17] Dans le m\u00eame plan, il est not\u00e9 :\n[I]l est raisonnable de penser que deux ann\u00e9es d\u2019encadrement se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement n\u00e9cessaires avant qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 recrut\u00e9 au niveau TR-01 dans le cadre du Programme d\u2019apprentissage TR du Bureau de la traduction atteigne l\u2019autonomie et qu\u2019il fournisse un rendement \u00e0 la hauteur de l\u2019objectif de revenu fix\u00e9.\n(Pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-5)\n[18] En d\u2019autres termes, ce plan d\u2019encadrement pr\u00e9voyait une p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ans d\u2019encadrement, laquelle s\u2019av\u00e8rera fatidique pour la plaignante, tel que la preuve le d\u00e9montrera.\n[19] De m\u00eame, il est utile de rappeler qu\u2019en vertu du m\u00eame plan d\u2019encadrement, il est not\u00e9 que :\n[C]ependant, le Bureau de la traduction n\u2019est nullement tenu de garder l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode maximale pr\u00e9vue de deux ann\u00e9es et peut mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi en cours de programme n\u2019importe quand, s\u2019il est clairement \u00e9tabli que l\u2019employ\u00e9 n\u2019atteindra pas le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis pendant la dur\u00e9e du Programme, ce qui est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 quand l\u2019employ\u00e9 n\u2019atteint pas enti\u00e8rement tous les objectifs applicables pour une \u00e9tape donn\u00e9e. Exception : les employ\u00e9s recrut\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieure de la fonction publique.\n(Pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-5)\n[20] Pour les faits de l\u2019accomplissement de ce plan d\u2019encadrement, une encadreuse a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante, soit madame C\u00e9line Marchand.\n[21] De m\u00eame, madame Manon Boucher \u00e9tait alors en charge de ce service.\n[22] Tout au cours de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019encadrement, des p\u00e9riodes d\u2019\u00e9valuation devaient avoir lieu \u00e0 tous les trois (3) mois.\n[23] Or, peu de temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du plan d\u2019encadrement, juste avant la p\u00e9riode du cong\u00e9 de No\u00ebl 2002, son encadreuse, madame C\u00e9line Marchand, a alors demand\u00e9 de la rencontrer dans la salle de conf\u00e9rence du Bureau de la traduction sans savoir exactement le pourquoi de cette rencontre.\n[24] \u00c0 ce moment, madame Marchand a alors inform\u00e9 la plaignante qu\u2019on ne voulait pas la garder et qu\u2019elle devait prendre une d\u00e9cision durant la p\u00e9riode des f\u00eates qui s\u2019annon\u00e7ait et selon madame Marchand, on lui aurait alors dit : \u00ab Je ne vois pas ton avenir dans le bureau. \u00bb\n[25] Il va s\u2019en dire qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment, la plaignante est tomb\u00e9e \u00ab des lunes \u00bb. La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019attendait pas \u00e0 ce genre de remarque. Elle fut \u00e9tonn\u00e9e, d\u00e9\u00e7ue et perdue. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elle a pass\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s mauvaises f\u00eates et malgr\u00e9 le fait que madame Marchand lui avait demand\u00e9 de prendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son avenir dans le Bureau de la traduction, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pris la d\u00e9cision de revenir avec de meilleures intentions, soit de traduire plus vite, avec certains outils. Cons\u00e9quemment, au mois de janvier 2003, la plaignante a alors continu\u00e9 son programme d\u2019apprentissage.\n[26] Subs\u00e9quemment, la plaignante a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9valuation dat\u00e9e du 4 mars 2003, qui lui fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence de son encadreuse, madame Marchand ainsi que de madame Boucher en date du 4 mars 2003.\n[27] Selon la Plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle \u00ab y arrivait \u00bb et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elle \u00e9tait satisfaite et voyait la possibilit\u00e9 de sa progression au sein du Bureau de la traduction.\n[28] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, un deuxi\u00e8me rapport d\u2019\u00e9tape a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en date du 12 juin 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-8).\n[29] Ce rapport fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats \u00ab partiellement atteints \u00bb et, dans les autres commentaires \u00e0 la fin du rapport, il est indiqu\u00e9 que :\nYanick est une employ\u00e9e d\u00e9sireuse d\u2019apprendre et de bien faire. Les nombreuses recommandations contenues dans ces \u00e9valuations ne sont pas \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouve \u00e0 remettre ses traductions \u00e0 temps. En apprenant \u00e0 mieux organiser son temps, en s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 bien rendre le texte de d\u00e9part, en choisissant des termes justes et pertinents et en relisant attentivement le produit final, Yanick prendra graduellement confiance en ses moyens et acc\u00e9l\u00e9rera son rythme de travail.\n(Pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-8)\n[30] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante indique qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation, elle \u00e9tait positive, mais que sa superviseuse, madame Boucher, lui aurait alors annonc\u00e9 un transfert dans un autre service. Son \u00e9tonnement \u00e9tait alors grand et elle ne comprenait pas ce qui se passait. Selon la plaignante, madame Boucher lui aurait mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019un ami lui aurait demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide dans un autre service. Bien qu\u2019elle se disait d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9e par cette intervention, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune inqui\u00e9tude et a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler d\u2019arrache pied. Elle a toutefois not\u00e9 que madame Boucher \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9e contre elle.\n[31] Puis survint la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation dat\u00e9e du 16 septembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A9).\n[32] Dans les objectifs de rendement qualitatif, on note des objectifs partiellement atteints, de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres qui sont enti\u00e8rement atteints.\n[33] Dans la section \u00ab autres commentaires \u00bb, on peut noter ce qui suit : \u00ab Yanick semble avoir atteint un plateau pour le moment. Il est vrai que les points \u00e0 corriger sont nombreux et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas facile de tout am\u00e9liorer rapidement, mais ces aspects repr\u00e9sentent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels du travail du traducteur \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A\u20119).\n[34] C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que la situation se serait d\u00e9grad\u00e9e rapidement selon la plaignante.\n[35] Elle note que son encadreuse, madame Marchand, n\u2019avait plus autant de temps pour l\u2019encadrer. On la prenait en faute, mais la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle redoublait d\u2019\u00e9nergie, de plus, elle indique au Tribunal qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup trop de stress. Elle en a parl\u00e9 alors \u00e0 madame Boucher, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait trop. La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle sentait trop de pression et elle a alors mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle subissait madame Marchand. Elle est donc retourn\u00e9e voir madame Boucher, mais presqu\u2019\u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019elle allait voir madame Marchand, c\u2019\u00e9tait une situation de panique. De m\u00eame, elle sentait se faire reprocher tout ce qu\u2019elle faisait et madame Marchand lui indiquait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus le temps de travailler avec elle. La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle sentait subir un processus. Elle fait mention qu\u2019elle tremblait \u00e0 quelques reprises sans savoir ce qui se passait effectivement.\n[36] Devant une telle pression, la plaignante indique qu\u2019un certain matin, elle a senti un mal de t\u00eate, mal de c\u0153ur, elle tremblait, elle aurait alors perdu conscience et c\u2019est son mari qui l\u2019aurait ramass\u00e9. Une visite effectu\u00e9e chez son m\u00e9decin en date du 26 septembre 2003 a alors conduit au billet m\u00e9dical qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit sous la cote P\u20111, onglet A10, dans laquelle il fait mention qu\u2019\u00e0 cause d\u2019une situation personnelle, la plaignante devait s\u2019absenter de son travail et \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans trois (3) semaines.\n[37] Subs\u00e9quemment, une autre ordonnance m\u00e9dicale est dat\u00e9e du 14 octobre 2003 est fournie par la plaignante \u00e0 son employeur, l\u2019ordonnance fait indication d\u2019un prolongement de cong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 4 novembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-11).\n[38] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante indique que madame Boucher lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonait presqu\u2019\u00e0 tous les jours pour des informations sur des documents, des mots-de-passe et \u00e9galement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de son travail. La plaignante indique qu\u2019au tout d\u00e9but, elle a collabor\u00e9 avec madame Boucher et elle informe qu\u2019elle devait travailler sur certains documents \u00e0 la maison et les retourner par la suite \u00e0 madame Boucher apr\u00e8s un certain temps. Elle se sentait envahie jusque dans son domicile. \u00c9galement, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle ne savait pas ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait une d\u00e9pression, mais son m\u00e9decin l\u2019aurait inform\u00e9 de cela. Son m\u00e9decin lui aurait dit de ne faire aucun travail et de ne plus r\u00e9pondre au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ce qu\u2019elle a fait.\n[39] De m\u00eame. la plaignante indique que son m\u00e9decin ne lui aurait pas sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 qu\u2019elle subissait ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9pression nerveuse mais, selon elle, il s\u2019agissait du genre d\u2019information qui ne se divulgue pas. Elle n\u2019aurait pas discut\u00e9 avec son m\u00e9decin de l\u2019inclusion ou non de ce diagnostic dans les diff\u00e9rents billets m\u00e9dicaux qui furent produits \u00e0 son employeur. Face aux absences mentionn\u00e9es dans les diff\u00e9rents billets m\u00e9dicaux, un plan d\u2019intervention fut donc instaur\u00e9 par madame Manon Boucher \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante. Dans un premier courriel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante par madame Boucher en date du 26 novembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P\u20111, onglet A-14), il fait \u00e9tat que le plan d\u2019intervention \u00e9tait pr\u00eat et qu\u2019une rencontre devait avoir lieu le mercredi 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003 en pr\u00e9sence du repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante, madame Isabelle Borr\u00e9, ainsi qu\u2019avec madame Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, agente des relations de travail au sein de Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada.\n[40] Il est \u00e0 noter que dans les diff\u00e9rents billets m\u00e9dicaux soumis \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, une reprise graduelle du travail par la plaignante \u00e9tait envisag\u00e9e \u00e0 raison soit de deux (2) jours, trois (3) jours et, plus tard, \u00e0 quatre (4) jours par semaine.\n[41] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la plaignante qualifie cette rencontre du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003 en pr\u00e9sence de mesdames Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, Isabelle Borr\u00e9 et Manon Boucher comme \u00e9tant orageuse, ou durant laquelle elle indique qu\u2019elle avait besoin de quitter la pi\u00e8ce, qu\u2019elle voulait dispara\u00eetre et qu\u2019elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 supporter le climat de ladite r\u00e9union. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un rapport de consultation m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9 du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2003 et sign\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin de famille, la docteure Janet Seale, adress\u00e9 \u00e0 madame Mich\u00e8le Delisle, la psychologue consultante de la plaignante \u00e0 ce moment. On y retrouve le diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. La plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elle ne se souvenait pas de l\u2019avoir remis \u00e0 son employeur.\n[42] Toujours au sujet de la note m\u00e9dicale du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2003, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elle avait entrepris des d\u00e9marches afin de rencontrer un psychiatre et un psychologue avec l\u2019aide de son m\u00e9decin traitant d\u2019o\u00f9 le billet m\u00e9dical du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[43] De m\u00eame, la plaignante indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle a suivi un stage de ressourcement du 26 au 30 janvier 2004. Elle mentionne qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment, elle \u00e9tait en p\u00e9riode de retour progressif pour les fins de son travail \u00e0 raison de deux (2) \u00e0 trois (3) jours par semaine suivant l\u2019avis de son m\u00e9decin. Elle a donc inform\u00e9 madame Boucher qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas suivre plus de trois (3) jours par semaine. Toutefois, la plaignante mentionne que madame Boucher aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait imp\u00e9ratif de suivre la formation \u00e0 ces dates. Puis survint une quatri\u00e8me \u00e9valuation de son rendement \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de son programme d\u2019apprentissage, dat\u00e9e du 12 janvier 2004 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-20).\n[44] Encore une fois, la plaignante obtient des r\u00e9sultats qui ne d\u00e9notent pas qu\u2019elle a enti\u00e8rement atteint les objectifs du programme d\u2019apprentissage. Le rapport est sign\u00e9 encore une fois par madame C\u00e9line Marchand, encadreuse, ainsi que madame Manon Boucher, gestionnaire, ainsi que par la plaignante.\n[45] Dans une autre note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2004 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-21) laquelle fut remise \u00e0 madame Manon Boucher, on indique que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 cent pour cent (100%) de son \u00e9tat normal, mais qu\u2019un retour progressif en raison de trois (3) jours semaine, avec des p\u00e9riodes de pauses, \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 avant son retour complet \u00e0 son emploi.\n[46] Puis survinrent les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9valuations relativement au plan d\u2019action qui fut instaur\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[47] Dans une \u00e9valuation dat\u00e9e du mois de janvier 2004, on peut lire que la plaignante fait encore r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des fautes de distraction, des sigles parfois mal accord\u00e9s, des phrases lourdes et qui manquent de clart\u00e9, ainsi que des passages mal compris et qui manquent de logique (voir le rapport \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A22).\n[48] On y rel\u00e8ve \u00e9galement ce qui suit : \u00ab [a]pr\u00e8s un an de travail dans notre service, Yanick ne devrait plus commettre aussi souvent ces erreurs dans ses textes, mais avoir seulement besoin de se faire guider dans la compr\u00e9hension de nos domaines de travail \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A22, paragraphe 4).\n[49] D\u2019autres rapports font \u00e9galement \u00e9tat de progr\u00e8s peu enviables dans la performance de la plaignante. Cette derni\u00e8re attire \u00e9galement l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur d\u2019autres notes m\u00e9dicales o\u00f9 l\u2019on fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une augmentation de trois (3) \u00e0 quatre (4) jours dans une semaine de travail (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-26 (note m\u00e9dicale du 1er avril 2004)).\n[50] Une autre note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 16 avril 2004 laquelle d\u00e9montre que, de toute \u00e9vidence, la plaignante est affect\u00e9e par la condition qui l\u2019afflige \u00e0 ce moment, qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouve beaucoup de stress, des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 dormir ainsi que des maux de t\u00eate.\n[51] Puis survint une note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 16 avril 2004, laquelle fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical du 19 avril 2004 au 19 juillet 2004 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-28).\n[52] Durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de temps, une lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 avril 2004 sign\u00e9e par madame Manon Boucher du Bureau de la traduction (Service Criminologie), informe la plaignante de la fin de sa participation au programme d\u2019apprentissage TR et cela en date du 6 avril 2004, soit la fin de la journ\u00e9e de travail indiqu\u00e9e. Cette lettre de Manon Boucher est accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une autre lettre sign\u00e9e par madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, directrice, traduction multilingue, r\u00e9gions et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, laquelle confirme dans les termes suivants ce qui suit : \u00ab vous n\u2019avez pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que vous \u00e9tiez en mesure d\u2019atteindre la norme de comp\u00e9tences requise li\u00e9e \u00e0 votre poste. Par cons\u00e9quent, je vous avise que nous allons mettre fin \u00e0 votre participation au Programme d\u2019apprentissage TR le 6 avril 2004 \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e de travail \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-29).\n[53] Avec ces lettres, une \u00e9valuation du mois de mars 2004 en ce qui a trait au plan d\u2019action qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9 indique que la plaignante aurait accus\u00e9 un recul dans ses performances et que cons\u00e9quemment, la qualit\u00e9 du travail de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment \u00e0 la hauteur des attentes du Bureau de la traduction.\n[54] Suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre de madame Boucher, de m\u00eame que l\u2019\u00e9valuation du mois de mars 2004 ainsi que la lettre de madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, la plaignante indique au Tribunal que \u00ab ce fut le n\u00e9ant, le dernier clou enfonc\u00e9 dans le cercueil. \u00bb\n[55] La plaignante indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des sentiments de honte, de rejet, de douleur, de peine et m\u00eame de d\u00e9go\u00fbt. Elle confirme au Tribunal que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le d\u00e9but de sa d\u00e9pression grave.\n[56] La plaignante indique \u00e9galement au Tribunal que suite aux recommandations de son m\u00e9decin, elle aurait communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur, soit madame Manon Boucher, les diff\u00e9rentes informations relativement \u00e0 sa condition, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es d\u2019apr\u00e8s les diff\u00e9rentes notes m\u00e9dicales vers\u00e9es au dossier.\n[57] Finalement, la plaignante a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un courriel dat\u00e9 du 25 mai 2004 de la part de madame Manon Boucher adress\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les membres du personnel du Bureau de traduction (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-30). Dans ce courriel, madame Boucher informe le personnel du d\u00e9part de madame Yanick Lindor, alors m\u00eame que la Plaignante \u00e9tait malade \u00e0 son domicile et qu\u2019elle ne travaillait pas. La plaignante qualifie ce courriel de la fa\u00e7on suivante : \u00ab Il faut qu\u2019elle abatte l\u2019animal. \u00bb\n[58] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante confirme qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2003, soit vers la fin du mois de juillet 2003, sa situation au sein du Bureau a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 mal tourner. Elle confirme que madame Marchand l\u2019encadrait toujours, mais lui demandait d\u2019arr\u00eater de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les m\u00eames erreurs.\n[59] \u00c9galement, en date du 16 septembre 2003, soit au moment d\u2019une rencontre \u00e0 propos de son \u00e9valuation avec mesdames C\u00e9line Marchand et Manon Boucher, les relations devinrent tr\u00e8s difficiles.\n[60] Lors du contre-interrogatoire, \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir si elle se souvenait que madame Boucher lui demandait de travailler plus que ce que le m\u00e9decin lui demandait, la plaignante indique que madame Boucher lui demandait une production qu\u2019elle n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 atteindre.\n[61] Elle confirme \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de probl\u00e8me financier pressant qui pouvait la rendre malade. Elle indique que son mari poss\u00e9dais \u00e9galement un emploi.\n[62] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par le procureur \u00e0 savoir si, entre la p\u00e9riode allant du mois de novembre 2002 au mois de janvier 2006, l\u2019employeur de la plaignante l\u2019avait accommod\u00e9 en fonction des certificats m\u00e9dicaux fournis, la plaignante confirme positivement que tel \u00e9tait le cas \u00ab si c\u2019\u00e9tait respect\u00e9 dans les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019art. \u00bb\n[63] Finalement, lors du contre-interrogatoire, elle confirme qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u un courriel d\u2019excuses de Manon Boucher dat\u00e9 du 1er juin 2004 en ce qui a trait au courriel fatidique dat\u00e9 du 25 mai 2004, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des employ\u00e9s du Bureau de la traduction.\n[64] La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mortifi\u00e9e par l\u2019envoi de ce courriel, qui fut re\u00e7u par son fils et que m\u00eame si les intentions \u00e9taient louables, \u00ab tuer \u00bb une personne n\u2019est pas louable selon elle, et que madame Manon Boucher a de cette fa\u00e7on gifl\u00e9 sa famille.\n- T\u00e9moin Isabelle Borr\u00e9 [65] Dans sa preuve, la plaignante fait \u00e9galement entendre madame Isabelle Borr\u00e9, l\u2019agente des relations de travail pour l\u2019Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s professionnels.\n[66] Madame Borr\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a assist\u00e9 la plaignante lors des diff\u00e9rentes rencontres qui ont eu lieu entre la direction et la Plaignante en ce qui a trait au suivi du programme d\u2019apprentissage ainsi que du plan d\u2019action qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en vigueur suite aux billets m\u00e9dicaux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s par la plaignante aux repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[67] Madame Borr\u00e9 confirme que les rencontres en pr\u00e9sence madame Lindor et les repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas amicales, que la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s affect\u00e9e, elle pleurait et tremblait et que la micro gestion \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s difficile pour la plaignante. Elle a constat\u00e9 du stress important qui \u00e9tait \u00e9vident chez la plaignante.\n[68] Madame Borr\u00e9 informe \u00e9galement le Tribunal qu\u2019elle a constat\u00e9 que le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante voulait qu\u2019elle arr\u00eate de travailler, que la plaignante vivait de l\u2019angoisse importante qui \u00e9tait devenue une maladie, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident \u00ab qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait malade, cern\u00e9e et \u00e9puis\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[69] Elle confirme au Tribunal que l\u2019envoi du courriel du 25 mai 2004 par madame Manon Boucher \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du personnel du Bureau de la traduction ne l\u2019a pas impressionn\u00e9 et que cela n\u2019excusait pas le geste ou le noircissement de la plaignante qui apparaissait dans ce courriel.\n[70] Madame Borr\u00e9 informe \u00e9galement le Tribunal que la p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ann\u00e9es indiqu\u00e9e dans la p\u00e9riode d\u2019apprentissage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un d\u00e9lai fixe ou repr\u00e9sentant une limite qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9pla\u00e7able, selon elle.\n[71] En contre-interrogatoire, madame Borr\u00e9 indique qu\u2019en ce qui a trait au plan d\u2019action instaur\u00e9 afin de permettre \u00e0 madame Lindor de pouvoir r\u00e9aliser les objectifs du plan d\u2019apprentissage TR, les chances de r\u00e9adaptation de la plaignante \u00e9taient nulles. \u00c9galement, elle constate la volont\u00e9 de madame Lindor \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 travailler m\u00eame si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas certaine qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 saisir l\u2019ampleur de sa propre maladie.\n[72] Madame Borr\u00e9 confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait soulag\u00e9e de l\u2019arr\u00eat de travail complet qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 par le psychiatre de la plaignante dans une note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 16 avril 2004. Elle a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ses propres notes dat\u00e9es du 7 avril 2004 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet B-12), o\u00f9 elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que le m\u00e9decin de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle continue de travailler \u00e0 raison de quatre (4) jours semaine.\n[73] Toujours dans la m\u00eame note, on retrouve une mention que la plaignante avait besoin d\u2019argent, ce qu\u2019elle a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nB. Preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [74] Dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait compara\u00eetre sept (7) t\u00e9moins soit :\n\u2212 Madame Louise Caron, traductrice de formation depuis 1975 et au moment de l\u2019effet du pr\u00e9sent dossier, directrice de la Direction de la traduction juridique et \u00e9conomique ;\n\u2212 Madame Micheline Audet, conseill\u00e8re en gestion d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ;\n\u2212 Madame Manon Boucher, chef, Service Criminologie du Bureau de la traduction au moment de l\u2019effet du pr\u00e9sent dossier ;\n\u2212 Madame C\u00e9line Marchand, traductrice avec31 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience au Bureau de la traduction, service de criminologie, et encadreuse de la plaignante ;\n\u2212 Monsieur Simon Audy, traducteur au Bureau de la traduction et correcteur des textes de la plaignante ;\n\u2212 Madame Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, conseill\u00e8re en relations de travail pour le Bureau de la traduction ;\n\u2212 Madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, au moment de l\u2019effet du pr\u00e9sent dossier, madame Doyle-Rodrigue \u00e9tait directrice de la Direction de la traduction multilingue, r\u00e9gions et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale au Bureau de la traduction.\n- T\u00e9moin Louise Caron [75] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, madame Louise Caron, alors directrice de la Direction de la traduction juridique et \u00e9conomique au moment des faits, informe le Tribunal que le programme d\u2019apprentissage dont \u00e9tait sujet la plaignante et dont une offre a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e afin d\u2019inviter la Plaignante d\u2019y participer, ledit programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en fonction des besoins du Bureau de la traduction, lequel \u00e9tait en concurrence \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque avec le secteur priv\u00e9.\n[76] Cons\u00e9quemment, le mode de recrutement alors en vigueur devait permettre de renflouer les effectifs du Bureau de la traduction. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que le programme TR devait s\u2019\u00e9chelonner sur deux (2) ans et que ce d\u00e9lai devait permettre de reprendre les objectifs fix\u00e9s pour la formation des nouveaux traducteurs. En cela, ce d\u00e9lai de deux (2) ans respectait une norme de l\u2019industrie et il s\u2019av\u00e9rait que ledit d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait suffisant.\n[77] Madame Caron fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence que la formation de deux (2) ann\u00e9es devait s\u2019effectuer \u00e0 temps plein et que le travail \u00e0 temps partiel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accept\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, les traducteurs devaient travailler en raison de cinq (5) jours semaine. Si des accommodements devaient avoir lieu, la date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance pouvait \u00eatre report\u00e9e au regard d\u2019une p\u00e9riode d\u2019absence.\n[78] Elle confirme au Tribunal que le travail de l\u2019encadreur \u00e9tait de s\u2019occuper de l\u2019aspect du travail plus que de l\u2019aspect m\u00e9dical. Elle confirme aussi que chaque cas est diff\u00e9rent et qu\u2019un encadreur doit parler au gestionnaire de toute difficult\u00e9. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la discipline et aux accommodements, ce sont les relations de travail qui devaient alors prendre la rel\u00e8ve. Le gestionnaire avait la responsabilit\u00e9 ultime de la r\u00e9ussite ou non du plan d\u2019apprentissage pour un candidat.\n[79] Elle confirme \u00e9galement que le d\u00e9lai de deux (2) ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9vu dans le plan d\u2019apprentissage pouvait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019accommodement, par exemple pour des cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 ou de maladie.\n- T\u00e9moin Micheline Audet [80] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, madame Micheline Audet confirme que depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2001, elle est conseill\u00e8re en gestion d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et cela afin de faciliter le retour au travail d\u2019employ\u00e9s malades. Chaque situation devait donc \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e au cas par cas.\n[81] Madame Audet explique que la r\u00e9ception d\u2019un certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e9tait donc primordiale dans cette \u00e9valuation. Elle confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u un appel de madame Manon Boucher en date du 26 septembre 2003, durant lequel cette derni\u00e8re l\u2019a inform\u00e9 que madame Yanick Lindor devait avoir un arr\u00eat de travail pour trois (3) semaines. Madame Audet confirme qu\u2019elle a vu le certificat m\u00e9dical produit sous la cote P-1, onglet A-10, qui fait mention d\u2019une situation personnelle en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante. Elle n\u2019a pos\u00e9 aucune question au m\u00e9decin de la plaignante au regard de ce certificat m\u00e9dical.\n- T\u00e9moin Manon Boucher\n[82] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ensuite fait entendre madame Manon Boucher, la gestionnaire dans le dossier de madame Yanick Lindor.\n[83] Madame Boucher confirme que les textes de la plaignante comportaient des \u00ab \u00e9tranget\u00e9s \u00bb, et cela, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Elle confirme qu\u2019il y avait des choses inattendues, des virgules, des mots mal utilis\u00e9s et que cela ne ressemblait pas \u00e0 des travaux finis. Elle indique au Tribunal que les \u00e9valuations de rendement de la plaignante comportent des annotations d\u2019objectifs partiellement atteints et confirme que madame Lindor a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9prouver des probl\u00e8mes d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019apprentissage.\n[84] Madame Boucher informe le Tribunal que lors de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du 16 septembre 2003, soit la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, les objectifs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas atteints et qu\u2019il y avait des am\u00e9liorations assez nombreuses, mais les m\u00eames erreurs \u00e9taient toujours pr\u00e9sentes lesquels \u00e9tait des \u00ab choses de la base. \u00bb\n[85] Cons\u00e9quemment, elle a envisag\u00e9 de faire un plan d\u2019action et de cibler les am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 obtenir de la plaignante.\n[86] Elle confirme au Tribunal que le lendemain de cette r\u00e9union, soit le 17 septembre 2003, la plaignante a entam\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 de maladie. Subs\u00e9quemment, en date du 26 septembre 2003, un billet m\u00e9dical fut produit (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A\u201110).\n[87] Le t\u00e9moin informe le Tribunal qu\u2019elle a pens\u00e9 que la plaignante r\u00e9agissait au plan d\u2019action qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9. Elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 une question de stress chez la plaignante.\n[88] Madame Boucher confirme que le billet m\u00e9dical lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en personne par la plaignante sans fournir aucun d\u00e9tail en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la nature de la condition de la plaignante.\n[89] Madame Boucher confirme que le plan d\u2019action envisag\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 confectionn\u00e9 par elle et madame C\u00e9line Marchand et qu\u2019il fut soumis \u00e0 la rencontre du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003 en pr\u00e9sence de madame Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, madame Isabelle Borr\u00e9 ainsi que de la plaignante. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend madame Lindor, madame Boucher informe le Tribunal que cette rencontre a dur\u00e9 entre une heure (1h) et une heure trente (1h30). Il n\u2019y a pas eu de cris et elle n\u2019a pas vu madame Lindor pleurer. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 madame Lindor que, malheureusement, elle avait des bouch\u00e9es doubles \u00e0 faire. De m\u00eame, elle informe le Tribunal que la condition m\u00e9dicale de madame Yanick Lindor ne lui a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e, mais elle doutait bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de stress. Elle informe le Tribunal que selon elle, elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de demander la nature exacte de la condition de la plaignante. Elle confirme au Tribunal que la situation au Bureau de traduction est tr\u00e8s stressante et que cela n\u00e9cessite une concentration \u00e0 chaque instant.\n[90] Finalement, elle constate que les objectifs pr\u00e9vus ne sont pas atteints et que, subs\u00e9quemment, madame Lindor s\u2019exprimait de moins en moins, tout en \u00e9tant consciente qu\u2019il y avait plus de recul que de progr\u00e8s dans sa situation.\n[91] Madame Boucher indique au Tribunal que lors de la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9valuation du mois de mars 2004, il y a eu constatation d\u2019un recul dans la situation de la plaignante et que l\u2019\u00e9valuation en question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s positive. Devant cette situation, elle en a discut\u00e9 avec madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue, sa patronne imm\u00e9diate, et que finalement, comme il s\u2019agissait toujours des m\u00eames points qui accrochaient, il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que la poursuite du programme d\u2019apprentissage pour la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait plus une bonne id\u00e9e. Cons\u00e9quemment, une lettre officielle fut donc r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en date du 6 avril 2004 par madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue afin de mettre un terme au programme d\u2019apprentissage de la plaignante.\n[92] En ce qui a trait au courriel qui fut envoy\u00e9 en date du 25 mai 2004 \u00e0 tout le personnel du Bureau de traduction, madame Boucher a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une lettre d\u2019excuses qui fut subs\u00e9quemment produite (pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 3).\n[93] En contre-interrogatoire, madame Boucher confirme qu\u2019en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une possibilit\u00e9 de suspendre le projet d\u2019apprentissage pour la plaignante, cette situation n\u2019est pas dans la normalit\u00e9 des choses et que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. De plus, elle confirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question de prolonger le sursis o\u00f9 le prolonger d\u2019une ann\u00e9e additionnelle. Elle confirme \u00e9galement au Tribunal que dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de madame Lindor, le maximum de ressources et d\u2019aide ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[94] Toutefois, elle a constat\u00e9 que madame Lindor devenait de plus en plus silencieuse et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de discuter avec elle, puisqu\u2019elle ne lui r\u00e9pondait pas. Madame Boucher informe \u00e9galement le Tribunal que madame Lindor avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de lui dire si la situation ne lui convenait pas. En ce qui a trait aux autres mesures d\u2019accommodements possibles, elle informe le Tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019informations sur les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de madame Lindor et que les certificats m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient ceux fournis par la plaignante elle-m\u00eame.\n- T\u00e9moin C\u00e9line Marchand [95] Dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait entendre madame C\u00e9line Marchand, Madame Marchand ayant plus de 31 ann\u00e9es de service au sein du Service Criminologie. Cette derni\u00e8re est devenue l\u2019encadreuse de la plaignante au regard des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[96] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, madame Marchand fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu\u2019elle a constat\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes chez la plaignante qui d\u00e9notaient que son travail n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 la hauteur, puisqu\u2019il y avait beaucoup d\u2019erreurs. Elle constate que la marche sera tr\u00e8s haute au regard du travail de la plaignante versus les objectifs \u00e0 atteindre pour cette derni\u00e8re. Elle indique au Tribunal ce qui suit : \u00ab on s\u2019en va vers la catastrophe. \u00bb\n[97] Elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du mois de janvier 2004 en ce qui a trait au plan d\u2019action qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 suite aux probl\u00e8mes constat\u00e9s, ainsi qu\u2019aux absences not\u00e9es de la plaignante. Elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux erreurs r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement commises suite \u00e0 des fautes de distraction, des sigles parfois mal accord\u00e9s, des phrases lourdes et qui manquent de clart\u00e9, des passages mal compris et qui manquent de logique. Elle confirme que l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 pauserait encore un probl\u00e8me. Elle affirme \u00e9galement que monsieur Simon Audy, qui revoit toutes les r\u00e9visions de madame Marchand rel\u00e8ve tr\u00e8s souvent des coquilles qui ont, malgr\u00e9 tout, \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[98] Elle confirme qu\u2019apr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e de travail dans le service du Bureau de traduction, la plaignante ne devrait plus commettre ce genre d\u2019erreurs dans ses textes, mais devrait seulement avoir besoin de se faire guider dans la compr\u00e9hension des domaines de travail.\n[99] Elle trouve anormal de toujours cr\u00e9er un environnement particulier autour de la plaignante \u00e0 cause de ses difficult\u00e9s.\n[100] Au mois de d\u00e9cembre 2003, elle indique : \u00ab les choses vont mal.\u00bb\n[101] Elle retrouve m\u00eame des textes dans les archives qui reprennent mot pour mot un texte qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour fin de traduction.\n[102] Il s\u2019agit donc du m\u00eame texte pris par la plaignante dans un autre endroit afin d\u2019effectuer cette traduction. Elle constate que madame Lindor prend deux fois le temps requis afin d\u2019effectuer une traduction. En ce qui a trait au premier cong\u00e9 de maladie de la plaignante, en contre-interrogatoire, madame Marchand indique que, bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait jamais dout\u00e9 de la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante, elle n\u2019avait toutefois aucune id\u00e9e de ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait cette condition. Elle a suppos\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause du travail.\n[103] Lors de l\u2019audience, madame Marchand a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un aide m\u00e9moire de d\u00e9cembre 2002 \u00e0 avril 2004 (pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 22).\n[104] On y retrouve notamment des mentions \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rapide, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9sorganis\u00e9e et qu\u2019il y avait une autre chose qui pouvait la pr\u00e9occuper, mais sans autres d\u00e9tails.\n[105] Elle constate de fa\u00e7on claire que le travail de la plaignante n\u2019est pas \u00e0 la hauteur des attentes, sans savoir de la part de la plaignante quelles pouvaient \u00eatre les causes de ses probl\u00e8mes. Elle indique : \u00ab c\u2019\u00e9tait des non-dits tout le long, peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s 10 ans elle aurait pu atteindre ses objectifs, mais le programme \u00e9tait de deux (2) ans, je ne pouvais pas lui accorder plus. \u00bb\n- T\u00e9moin Simon Audy [106] Dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement fait entendre monsieur Simon Audy, qui est \u00e9galement un traducteur de niveau TR-02, mais qui \u00e9tait un traducteur de niveau TR-03 au moment des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[107] Monsieur Audy informe le Tribunal que les fautes qui apparaissent dans les documents produits par l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous la cote I-2 \u00e9taient des fautes \u00ab qui surprenaient pour un TR en formation. \u00bb\n[108] Il constate qu\u2019il existe beaucoup d\u2019erreurs assez graves dans le travail de la plaignante et normalement, elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plus avanc\u00e9 tenant compte du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9.\n- T\u00e9moin Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher [109] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement fait entendre madame Genevi\u00e8ve Durocher, conseill\u00e8re en relations de travail pour la p\u00e9riode des faits mentionn\u00e9s dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. Son travail consistait \u00e0 donner des avis et conseils \u00e0 la gestion.\n[110] Madame Durocher a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines rencontres, dont celle du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003, qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 la production d\u2019un plan d\u2019action qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le but de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de corriger des lacunes et atteindre les \u00e9tapes requises dans le programme d\u2019apprentissage. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tendue, mais plut\u00f4t d\u00e9licate et, \u00e0 tout le moindre, cordiale.\n[111] Elle constate en ce qui a trait aux limitations m\u00e9dicales de la plaignante qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait que certaines annotations sur son retour progressif, sans plus.\n[112] En contre-interrogatoire, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la prolongation possible du programme d\u2019apprentissage, madame Durocher mentionne au Tribunal que cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du retour de la plaignante et que si une suspension de sept (7) semaines au total avait eu lieu, la fin du programme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e pour autant. Elle confirme qu\u2019une fois le sursis accord\u00e9 et pris, il y avait un recommencement, mais qu\u2019il fallait toutefois rester dans la p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ans qui est pr\u00e9vue dans le programme. Madame Durocher indique au Tribunal que le travail devait \u00eatre fait en fonction du programme et que les attentes demeuraient les m\u00eames, mais que la quantit\u00e9 de travail et les d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s en fonction du nombre d\u2019heures de travail accord\u00e9s en vertu des certificats m\u00e9dicaux. La charge de travail \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e en fonction du nombre d\u2019heures, consid\u00e9rant les certificats m\u00e9dicaux.\n- T\u00e9moin Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue [113] Finalement, en tant que dernier t\u00e9moin, madame Jocelyne Doyle-Rodrigue a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, madame Doyle-Rodrigue est directrice de la Direction de la traduction multilingue, r\u00e9gions et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale au Bureau de la traduction.\n[114] Elle confirme au Tribunal que la fin du programme \u00e9tait immuable, mais que la gestion avait tenu compte de la maladie de la plaignante apr\u00e8s une \u00e9valuation de toutes les \u00e9tapes franchies et, consid\u00e9rant les retards qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0 et qui ne pouvaient \u00eatre combl\u00e9s, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin au programme.\nIII. Droit [115] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante mentionne au Tribunal que les dispositions des articles 7b), 14 et 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont invoqu\u00e9s et il indique qu\u2019il y aurait eu une adaptation d\u00e9ficiente d\u00fb \u00e0 la condition de la plaignante par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[116] Pour une bonne compr\u00e9hension du pr\u00e9sent dossier, il est donc utile de rappeler les dispositions des articles 7b), 14 et 14.1, qui se lisent comme suit :\nArticle 7 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nArticle 14 : (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\nNote marginale : Harc\u00e8lement sexuel\n(2) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu\u2019en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\nArticle 14.1 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[117] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu\u2019il y aurait eu du harc\u00e8lement caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante par les diff\u00e9rentes actions commises par les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[118] En r\u00e9plique, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique au Tribunal que seul le rendement de la plaignante fut pris en cause dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre un terme au programme de formation TR.\n[119] Il mentionne \u00e9galement que le Tribunal doit effectivement constater que la d\u00e9ficience fut un motif de renvoi dans l\u2019application des dispositions l\u00e9gales mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus.\n[120] Les principes juridiques sous-adjacents dans l\u2019application de la Loi sont maintenant bien connus.\n[121] Il appartient \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir sur une base prima facie un cas de discrimination ou au moins un des fondements all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le seuil requis afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve de discrimination est extr\u00eamement bas. Ainsi, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada indique que : \u00ab la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558). Cette r\u00e9ponse ou explication de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre cr\u00e9dible.\n[122] De m\u00eame, la r\u00e9ponse ou l\u2019explication doit \u00eatre suffisante et ne pas \u00eatre un pr\u00e9texte (Basi v. Canadian National Railway (no1), (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), au paragraphe 38474).\n[123] Une fois que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, elle est donc sujet \u00e0 obtenir une compensation en l\u2019absence de justification de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, aux pages 202 \u00e0 208).\n[124] Il est utile de noter que cette preuve de la part de l\u2019employeur peut se faire par balance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[125] Une fois que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de preuve est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 sur l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui doit d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est, soit non produite ou que cette conduite appara\u00eet comme \u00eatre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9e.\n[126] Afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrairement \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. De plus, la plaignante n\u2019a pas besoin de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination n\u2019est pas intentionnelle (voir Bhinder c. CN, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 561, \u00e0 la page 57).\n[127] Dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019est pas survenue ou n\u2019origine pas d\u2019une conduite en soit qui serait discriminatoire. Pour se faire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer sur la balance des probabilit\u00e9s que :\n[Q]u\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause [\u2026] qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail [\u2026] que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n(Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, \u00e0 la page 5)\n[128] Une fois ces principes l\u00e9gaux \u00e9tablis, le Tribunal doit donc r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, \u00e0 savoir si effectivement la plaignante s\u2019est bien d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de son fardeau de preuve en \u00e9tablissant de fa\u00e7on prima facie une cause de discrimination ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, un de ses fondements.\n[129] Apr\u00e8s avoir attentivement r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la preuve au dossier et tenu compte des diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages, ainsi que des pi\u00e8ces qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re effectivement que la plaignante s\u2019est d\u00fbment d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de son fardeau de preuve.\n[130] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le Tribunal note effectivement une condition m\u00e9dicale connue de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et m\u00eame si cette condition m\u00e9dicale n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9e au d\u00e9part par les certificats m\u00e9dicaux produits par la plaignante, les dispositions de l\u2019article 7b) de la Loi apparaissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enfreintes par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[131] Finalement, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la preuve est suffisante et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir effectivement les conditions de l\u2019article 7b) de la Loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00fbment \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que la plaignante souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, laquelle d\u00e9finition serait l\u2019une des d\u00e9finitions de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi.\n[132] De plus, m\u00eame si le diagnostic n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part et communiqu\u00e9 aux repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9, soit madame Boucher ainsi que madame Marchand, d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res manifestations de la condition de la plaignante, les t\u00e9moignages de madame Boucher et de madame Marchand indiquent que ces derni\u00e8res se doutaient bien que le stress pouvait \u00eatre la cause de ladite condition chez la plaignante.\n[133] Tenant compte de l\u2019existence d\u2019une condition, m\u00eame non d\u00e9finie aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9, de la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un plan d\u2019action instaur\u00e9 par l\u2019employeur pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la plaignante et, subs\u00e9quemment, de la mise \u00e0 pied ou de la terminaison du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR dont la plaignante faisait partie, il appert au Tribunal que toutes les conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on prima facie l\u2019existence de conditions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019application des disposition de l\u2019article 7b) de la Loi.\n[134] Tenant compte du renversement du fardeau de preuve sur l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est-elle d\u00e9charg\u00e9e d\u2019un tel fardeau et cela, en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence?\n[135] Apr\u00e8s avoir longuement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la preuve au dossier, plus particuli\u00e8rement les t\u00e9moignages de la plaignante, ainsi que de madame Manon Boucher et madame C\u00e9line Marchand, lesquelles sont les principaux t\u00e9moins dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, le Tribunal arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019effectivement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de son fardeau de preuve, et cela, pour les raisons exprim\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. Th\u00e9orie de la cause de la plaignante [136] Dans le cadre de son analyse, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 deux (2) th\u00e9ories. La premi\u00e8re th\u00e9orie est celle de la plaignante qui repose essentiellement sur la connaissance par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019une condition m\u00e9dicale ou d\u00e9ficience chez la plaignante, laquelle connaissance aurait d\u00fb engendrer chez l\u2019intim\u00e9 une obligation de faire enqu\u00eate sur la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante (Mackenzie v. Jace Holdings and another (No. 4), 2012 BCHRT 376 ; Wall v. Lipp\u00e9 Group, 2008 HRTO 50 ; Fendick v. Lakes District Maintenance (No2), 2005 BCHRT 573 ; Martin v. Carter Chevrolet Oldsmobile, 2001 BCHRT 37).\n[137] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, apr\u00e8s une analyse plus approfondie de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante, l\u2019employeur aurait d\u00fb adopter un processus d\u2019accommodement aupr\u00e8s de la plaignante et cela en fonction de l\u2019analyse plus approfondie sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[138] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante consid\u00e8re que ce processus d\u2019accommodement doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 et cela, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive tel que l\u2019a \u00e9tabli la jurisprudence et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, dans les d\u00e9cisions : Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970 ; Gordy v. Painter\u2019s Lodge (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225 ; Machado v. Terrace Ford Lincoln Sales, 2011 HRTO 544 (CanLII) ; Conte c. Rogers Cablesystems Ltd., 1999 CanLII 1022 (TCDP) ; Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10 (CanLII).\n[139] De fait, la plaignante reproche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00ab savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir \u00bb que la condition m\u00e9dicale ou la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante devait entra\u00eener d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019accommodements lesquelles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, la plaignante reproche de fa\u00e7on directe \u00e0 madame Manon Boucher de ne pas avoir demand\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate par Sant\u00e9 Canada sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et consid\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait une obligation de ce faire et de s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir plus \u00e0 fond de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[140] De plus, la plaignante reproche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ne pas avoir envisag\u00e9 de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ans pr\u00e9vue dans le plan d\u2019apprentissage et indique qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de preuve de contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019effet de prolonger ledit programme d\u2019apprentissage TR. La plaignante all\u00e8gue que le d\u00e9lai de deux (2) ans pr\u00e9vu dans le programme d\u2019apprentissage TR pr\u00e9voyait une limite de deux (2) ann\u00e9es laquelle \u00e9tait une limite interne pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 seule et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de preuve a contrario que le d\u00e9lai de deux (2) ann\u00e9e ou que l\u2019extension du d\u00e9lai de deux (2) ann\u00e9es pouvait comporter une contrainte excessive.\nB. Th\u00e9orie de la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [141] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me th\u00e9orie, soit celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tend que la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un motif de renvoi, mais que seule la performance d\u00e9ficiente de la plaignante fut la cause premi\u00e8re de son renvoi du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR.\n[142] Certes, dans la preuve, le Tribunal a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun rapport ou expertise m\u00e9dicale d\u00e9crivant les incapacit\u00e9s de la plaignante eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer son travail, sans compter qu\u2019une telle analyse aurait peut-\u00eatre pu permettre d\u2019analyser plus \u00e0 fond les accommodements requis en fonction de la condition de la plaignante.\n[143] Sous-jacent \u00e0 cette lacune, il y a lieu d\u2019analyser les comportements tant de la plaignante que celui des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[144] En d\u2019autres termes, les seuls manquements d\u2019obtenir une pareille expertise m\u00e9dicale reposent-ils uniquement sur l\u2019employeur, ou \u00e9galement, y a-t-il lieu de tenir compte des comportements de la plaignante dans la divulgation des informations m\u00e9dicales qu\u2019elle avait sous son contr\u00f4le? Cette analyse doit \u00eatre faite en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, dans lequel l\u2019honorable juge Sopinka s\u2019exprime comme suit :\nLa recherche d\u2019un compromis fait intervenir plusieurs parties. Outre l\u2019employeur et le syndicat, le plaignant a \u00e9galement l\u2019obligation d\u2019aider \u00e0 en arriver \u00e0 un compromis convenable. La participation du plaignant \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un compromis a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par notre Cour dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley. Le juge McIntyre y affirme, \u00e0 la p. 555:\nCependant, lorsque ces mesures ne permettent pas d\u2019atteindre compl\u00e8tement le but souhait\u00e9, le plaignant, en l\u2019absence de concessions de sa propre part, comme l\u2019acceptation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel, doit sacrifier soit ses principes religieux, soit son emploi.\nPour faciliter la recherche d\u2019un compromis, le plaignant doit lui aussi faire sa part. \u00c0 la recherche d\u2019un compromis raisonnable s\u2019ajoute l\u2019obligation de faciliter la recherche d\u2019un tel compromis. Ainsi, pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, il faut examiner la conduite du plaignant.\nCela ne signifie pas qu\u2019en plus de porter \u00e0 l\u2019attention de l\u2019employeur les faits relatifs \u00e0 la discrimination, le plaignant est tenu de proposer une solution. Bien que le plaignant puisse \u00eatre en mesure de faire des suggestions, l\u2019employeur est celui qui est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on dont il est possible de composer avec le plaignant sans s\u2019ing\u00e9rer ind\u00fbment dans l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise. Lorsque l\u2019employeur fait une proposition qui est raisonnable et qui, si elle \u00e9tait mise en \u0153uvre, remplirait l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, le plaignant est tenu d\u2019en faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre. Si l\u2019omission du plaignant de prendre des mesures raisonnables est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019\u00e9chec de la proposition, la plainte sera rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019autre aspect de cette obligation est le devoir d\u2019accepter une mesure d\u2019accommodement raisonnable. C\u2019est cet aspect que le juge McIntyre a mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley. Le plaignant ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite. S\u2019il y a rejet d\u2019une proposition qui serait raisonnable compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, l\u2019employeur s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation.\n(Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux pages 994 et 995)\n[145] Or, dans la preuve qui est soumise dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que le comportement de la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans reproche.\n[146] En effet, en vertu de la preuve soumise, le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame de constater une demande de renseignement d\u2019assurance-invalidit\u00e9 qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-40). Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par le m\u00e9decin traitant de la plaignante, la docteure Janet Seale, qui a corrig\u00e9 le document en date du 17 octobre 2003 pour modifier la date au 24 octobre 2003.\n[147] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est utile de rappeler que des sympt\u00f4mes de la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante se seraient manifest\u00e9s d\u00e8s le 17 septembre 2003, soit le lendemain de la r\u00e9union qui a eu lieu en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation des performances de la plaignante avec les responsables du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR (voir la section \u00ab renseignements sur l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00bb, compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e par la plaignante le 21 octobre 2003, document \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-40).\n[148] Subs\u00e9quemment, on y retrouve diff\u00e9rentes dates de consultations avec la docteure Seale \u00e0 compter du 26 septembre 2003 et \u00e9galement avec madame Mich\u00e8le Delisle, psychologue de la plaignante, en date du 10 novembre 2003.\n[149] Dans les diff\u00e9rentes rencontres qui ont suivi, et plus particuli\u00e8rement celle du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003, lors de laquelle un plan d\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 par mesdames Manon Boucher et C\u00e9line Marchand \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la plaignante en consid\u00e9rant sa condition m\u00e9dicale, la plaignante n\u2019a, en aucun temps, fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette demande d\u2019assurance-invalidit\u00e9, ni au diagnostic qu\u2019on y retrouvait.\n[150] De m\u00eame, dans une note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A\u201116), adress\u00e9e \u00e0 madame Mich\u00e8le Delisle, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante, le m\u00eame diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 appara\u00eet. Encore une fois, cette note m\u00e9dicale n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[151] Fort curieusement, la premi\u00e8re note m\u00e9dicale adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019employeur et dat\u00e9e du 26 septembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-10) fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00ab personal situation \u00bb, laquelle ne contient pas plus de pr\u00e9cision en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante.\n[152] Subs\u00e9quemment, dans une deuxi\u00e8me note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 14 octobre 2003 soumise \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, encore une fois, aucune autre information plus pertinente n\u2019appara\u00eet en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante. De m\u00eame, dans une troisi\u00e8me note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 12 novembre 2003 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, aucune autre information plus pertinente n\u2019appara\u00eet \u00e9galement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante. Finalement, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-16), laquelle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, comment interpr\u00e9ter le fait que cette note m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 madame Mich\u00e8le Delisle, psychologue consultante de la plaignante et qu\u2019aucune mention n\u2019en fut faite \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9?\n[153] De fait, comment interpr\u00e9ter le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante lorsqu\u2019elle indique qu\u2019au regard de la note m\u00e9dicale du 12 novembre 2003 (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-13), laquelle note m\u00e9dicale fut remise \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, que son m\u00e9decin ne lui avait pas sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soufrait de d\u00e9pression nerveuse, mais selon elle, \u00ab c\u2019est le genre d\u2019information qui ne se divulgue pas \u00bb?\n[154] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de manquements de la part de la plaignante dans la divulgation de ses informations personnelles viennent miner la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[155] Mais il y a plus \u00e9galement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019attitude de la plaignante dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. En effet, en date du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003, lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec sa repr\u00e9sentante ainsi que ceux de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu d\u2019\u00e9laborer un plan d\u2019action afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier l\u2019avancement des progr\u00e8s de la plaignante (pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet A-15).\n[156] Il est \u00e0 noter que ce plan d\u2019action, dat\u00e9 du mois de novembre 2003, indique, en son premier paragraphe, que :\n[L]\u2019employ\u00e9e a du s\u2019absenter pendant cinq semaines compl\u00e8tes pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et elle est revenue au travail \u00e0 raison de 2 jours par semaine par la suite (sur les conseils de son m\u00e9decin qui l\u2019a jug\u00e9e apte \u00e0 travailler 15 heures par semaine), le programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompu. Il aurait d\u00fb reprendre la semaine du 3 novembre, mais nous avons accord\u00e9 deux semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 Mme Lindor pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 reprendre le travail en douceur. Le programme a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9activ\u00e9 le 17 novembre 2003.\n[157] Le plan d\u2019action repr\u00e9sente de toute \u00e9vidence un accommodement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 la plaignante. Or, la plaignante et sa repr\u00e9sentante ont particip\u00e9 aux r\u00e9unions devant permettre l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un tel plan d\u2019action. En ce sens, la plaignante avait donc toute latitude, tenant compte de sa d\u00e9ficience, qu\u2019elle connaissait (m\u00eame non d\u00e9finie), afin d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration du plan d\u2019action et de pouvoir mentionner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 si un tel plan d\u2019action lui convenait.\n[158] De fait, dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration du plan d\u2019action, la plaignante tenait compte de ses disponibilit\u00e9s, dont son m\u00e9decin faisait \u00e9tat, par des retours progressifs au travail \u00e0 raison de deux (2) jours, trois (3) jours ou quatre (4) jours per semaine. Elle a donc particip\u00e9 de ce fait aux mesures de redressement, et cela, en fonction de sa condition m\u00e9dicale qu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9voil\u00e9e \u00e0 partir des notes m\u00e9dicales fournies par son propre m\u00e9decin.\n[159] Or, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que malgr\u00e9 le plan d\u2019action et les billets m\u00e9dicaux fournis par la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son retour progressif au travail, les performances de la plaignante ne se sont pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9es.\n[160] En cela, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019on ne peut reprocher \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019avoir pris les dispositions qui s\u2019imposaient en tenant compte de la condition m\u00e9dicale, telle que d\u00e9voil\u00e9e par la plaignante, afin d\u2019accommoder cette derni\u00e8re.\n[161] Tenant compte des faits particuliers \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l\u2019obligation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au regard d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur la condition m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante ne serait pr\u00e9valoir sur l\u2019obligation de la plaignante d\u2019informer ad\u00e9quatement l\u2019employeur de sa condition m\u00e9dicale, qu\u2019elle connaissait ou aurait pu savoir facilement avec plus de pr\u00e9cisions quant \u00e0 la nature exacte de sa condition m\u00e9dicale.\n[162] Comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 l\u2019honorable juge Sopinka dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l\u2019omission du plaignant d\u2019informer ad\u00e9quatement son employeur de sa situation m\u00e9dicale, ainsi que de prendre des mesures raisonnables dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, tenant compte de sa condition m\u00e9dicale, qu\u2019elle connaissait ou aurait pu conna\u00eetre dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine \u00e9galement de l\u2019\u00e9chec de la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, le Tribunal note comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, que la plaignante dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier ne pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [163] La plaignante et sa repr\u00e9sentante ont eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter toutes les solutions possibles en fonction de sa condition m\u00e9dicale et de faire en sorte d\u2019obtenir de la part de l\u2019employeur, qui n\u2019a pas refus\u00e9 suivant la preuve au dossier, d\u2019accommoder la plaignante.\n[164] Dans sa recherche de jurisprudence relativement au pr\u00e9sent dossier, le Tribunal a pu prendre connaissance de la d\u00e9cision Butler c. Nenqayni Treatment Centre Society, 2002 CanLII 12274 (TCDP), o\u00f9 la plaignante Butler fut cong\u00e9di\u00e9e apr\u00e8s plusieurs efforts de trouver d\u2019autres fonctions pour la plaignante, lesquelles furent infructueuses.\n[165] Dans cette d\u00e9cision du Tribunal prononc\u00e9e par le membre instructeur Anne L. Mactavish (Butler c Nenqayni Treatment Center Society), on indique en appliquant la d\u00e9cision Meiorin (Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3), ainsi que la d\u00e9cision Grismer (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868), ce qui suit : \u00ab [c]omme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la recherche de mesures d\u2019adaptation afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des employ\u00e9s n\u2019est pas une voie \u00e0 sens unique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que tant l\u2019employ\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur ont certaines responsabilit\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[166] Dans une autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal (Benoit c. Bell Canada (Qu\u00e9bec), 2004 TCDP 32 (CanLII), le membre instructeur Athanasios D. Hadjis a \u00e9galement eu \u00e0 examiner la question de la communication d\u2019informations m\u00e9dicales par un plaignant \u00e0 son employeur.\n[167] Dans cette d\u00e9cision, o\u00f9 le plaignant \u00e9tait aux prises avec un probl\u00e8me d\u2019alcool de fa\u00e7on excessive, le plaignant fut mis \u00e0 pied non seulement pour la question de son l\u2019alcoolisme, mais \u00e9galement en raison du pi\u00e8tre rendement professionnel comparativement aux autres cadres.\n[168] Malgr\u00e9 que les faits diff\u00e8rent du pr\u00e9sent dossier, dans le dossier Benoit, le plaignant a admis de son propre aveu avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment induit en erreur les directeurs dont il relevait en les amenant \u00e0 croire sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un alcoolique.\n[169] Le membre instructeur Hadjis, en reprenant les commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9galement au fait qu\u2019il existe une responsabilit\u00e9 de la part de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de prendre les choses en main et de demander de l\u2019aide.\n[170] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il indique que la recherche de compromis fait intervenir plusieurs parties et exige \u00ab une participation active du plaignant \u00bb (Benoit).\n[171] En conclusion, le membre instructeur Hadjis indique que, bien que n\u2019\u00e9tant pas convaincu que le probl\u00e8me d\u2019alcool du plaignant ait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, l\u2019explication fournie par l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e raisonnable et, en cons\u00e9quence, cette explication n\u2019a pas constitu\u00e9 un pr\u00e9texte.\n[172] Finalement, le Tribunal cite la d\u00e9cision Graham c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 40 (CanLII), d\u00e9cision prononc\u00e9e par le membre instructeur J. Grant Sinclair.\n[173] Dans ce dernier dossier, la plaignante, Sandra Graham, qui travaillait pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e SCP) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 la SCP d\u2019intervenir en son nom aupr\u00e8s des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la SCP afin de tenter de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s qui s\u2019opposaient entre elle et son gestionnaire en raison de son absence.\n[174] Dans cette d\u00e9cision le Tribunal a conclu que la plaignante avait effectivement souffert d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9e de son travail. Le membre instructeur Sinclair a conclu que, malgr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, la plaignante n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[175] De m\u00eame, le membre Sinclair a appliqu\u00e9 les dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada en indiquant que :\nPour faciliter la recherche d\u2019une mesure d\u2019accommodement, le plaignant doit aussi faire sa part. \u00c0 la recherche d\u2019un compromis raisonnable s\u2019ajoute l\u2019obligation de faciliter la recherche d\u2019un tel compromis. Ainsi, pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, il faut examiner la conduite du plaignant.\n(Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe g \u00e0 la page 994).\n[176] Le membre Sinclair a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible pour la SCP de mettre en place des mesures d\u2019accommodements appropri\u00e9es pour la plaignante (paragraphe 93 de la d\u00e9cision).\n[177] Cons\u00e9quemment, la plainte de discrimination de la plaignante Graham contre la SCP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e et finalement sa plainte fut rejet\u00e9e.\nV. Conclusion [178] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que dans les d\u00e9cisions Butler, Benoit et Graham, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la plaignante savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir l\u2019\u00e9tat de sa condition m\u00e9dicale et aurait pu facilement la communiquer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 suivant la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[179] De m\u00eame, le plan d\u2019action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du programme d\u2019apprentissage TR, auquel participait la plaignante, comportait suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019accommodements afin de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de trouver les solutions eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience et dont la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[180] Le Tribunal ne peut supposer que la plaignante a volontairement fait du camouflage en ne d\u00e9voilant pas totalement sa situation m\u00e9dicale comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Benoit mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus, mais certainement l\u2019omission de d\u00e9voiler \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 les billets m\u00e9dicaux ou les notes m\u00e9dicales qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis tant \u00e0 son assureur qu\u2019\u00e0 son psychologue, madame Mich\u00e8le Delisle, affecte de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuse la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[181] Tenant compte des informations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par la plaignante \u00e0 son employeur et des diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages, dont principalement les t\u00e9moignages de madame Manon Boucher et de madame C\u00e9line Marchand, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a effectivement rempli son obligation d\u2019accommodement et que, si de telles mesures d\u2019accommodements n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi dans la situation de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re est en grande partie responsable de l\u2019\u00e9chec de la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[182] Finalement, le Tribunal constate \u00e0 la lueur de la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, les nombreuses difficult\u00e9s que rencontrait la plaignante afin de se conformer au programme d\u2019apprentissage TR, et cela, avant le 16 septembre 2003, date o\u00f9 une premi\u00e8re rencontre a eu lieu avec une mise au point devant permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir et corriger les difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par la plaignante.\n[183] Ce faisant \u00e9galement, le Tribunal s\u2019est interrog\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement sur les capacit\u00e9s de la plaignante \u00e0 pouvoir devenir effectivement une traductrice et de supporter tout le stress qu\u2019une telle fonction peut engendrer.\n[184] Cons\u00e9quemment, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que m\u00eame une prolongation au-del\u00e0 de deux (2) ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9vues, qui appara\u00eet dans programme d\u2019apprentissage TR, n\u2019aurait peut-\u00eatre pas amen\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 devenir une traductrice de niveau TR-02.\n[185] \u00c0 partir de ces constatations, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que d\u2019envisager d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019accommodements dans le contexte particulier de la plaignante, aurait certainement amen\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une contrainte excessive. Il appara\u00eet donc au Tribunal que d\u2019autres mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u2019\u00e9taient pas raisonnables selon toutes les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent dossier. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019honorable juge Sopinka dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud, la plaignante ne pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite (Renaud, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 995).\n[186] Le Tribunal conclut donc que la plainte de discrimination port\u00e9e par la plaignante, madame Yanick Lindor, contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada, n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e.\n[187] Cons\u00e9quemment, sa plainte est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 9 avril 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T1465\/1110\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Yanick Lindor c.

Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2013 TCDP 35 (la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite), le Tribunal a expos\u00e9 le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire en d\u00e9tail (voir les paragraphes 1 \u00e0 10).\n[2] Pour r\u00e9sumer, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la plaignante \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es (voir la d\u00e9cision Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10), au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H-6 (la Loi). Pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire, le Tribunal a rendu une ordonnance relative \u00e0 la pension de retraite de la plaignante, entre autres ordonnances (voir la d\u00e9cision Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 20 (la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens)). Toutefois, dans un premier temps, le Tribunal a laiss\u00e9 aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019application de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite. Les parties en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables et elles sont revenues devant le Tribunal pour obtenir des clarifications. Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 des clarifications au sujet de l\u2019ordonnance concernant la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, mais, avant de rendre une d\u00e9cision finale, il a demand\u00e9 aux parties de produire des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[3] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate r\u00e8gle d\u00e9finitivement la question de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite.\nII. La mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite et son objet [4] En ce qui concerne la pension de retraite de la plaignante, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e replacera les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du licenciement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime de pension la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait faites au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations de retraite perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Je laisserai d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations de retraite que la plaignante a perdues, conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres indiqu\u00e9s dans mes motifs.\n(D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, au paragraphe 22)\n[5] Les parties conviennent du fait qu\u2019aux termes de l\u2019ordonnance reproduite en partie ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u2019obligation de prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour remettre les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement, ainsi que du fait que ces prestations peuvent \u00eatre vers\u00e9es comme le pr\u00e9voit le r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable.\n[6] En ce qui concerne la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi le licenciement, les parties ne se sont pas entendues au sujet de ce qui \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la plaignante : 50 % des cotisations que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait vers\u00e9es; ou 50 % des prestations que la plaignante aurait re\u00e7ues, moins les cotisations que la plaignante aurait vers\u00e9es. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 la clarification suivante :\nPour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, seulement la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite que l\u2019employeur aurait faites a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. La moiti\u00e9, parce que le Tribunal rem\u00e9die au fait que la plaignante partageait la possibilit\u00e9 avec une autre candidate de conserver son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et il ne rem\u00e9die pas \u00e0 la perte d\u2019emploi comme tel. De plus, l\u2019ordonnance ne visait que les cotisations de retraite par l\u2019employeur, parce que la plaignante n\u2019a pas perdu ses propres cotisations. Elle n\u2019a simplement pas cotis\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime de pension apr\u00e8s son licenciement.\n(D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, au paragraphe 23)\n[7] Les parties conviennent du fait que la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations normales de l\u2019employeur pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007 au 1er juin 2013 s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 17 789,72 $. Toutefois, les parties sont en d\u00e9saccord au sujet du calcul des paiements d\u2019amortissement et des int\u00e9r\u00eats et de leur inclusion dans la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite. Apr\u00e8s avoir rendu la d\u00e9cision de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de produire des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet des paiements d\u2019amortissement et des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[8] \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations suppl\u00e9mentaires et les rapports actuariels suppl\u00e9mentaires relatifs aux paiements d\u2019amortissement et aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, j\u2019ai une meilleure compr\u00e9hension du r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable et de son fonctionnement. \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, je vois le d\u00e9saccord qui r\u00e8gne entre les parties au sujet des paiements d\u2019amortissement et des int\u00e9r\u00eats comme un d\u00e9saccord relatif \u00e0 la formulation employ\u00e9e pour \u00e9noncer la mesure de redressement. Autrement dit, le d\u00e9saccord portait sur l\u2019emploi par le Tribunal du terme \u00ab prestations \u00bb pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement de la plaignante, par opposition \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du terme \u00ab cotisations \u00bb pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement.\n[9] En employant ces deux termes distincts, le Tribunal souhaitait simplement \u00e9tablir une distinction entre la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement de la plaignante et la p\u00e9riode suivant ce licenciement. Ainsi, l\u2019expression \u00ab cotisations de retraite faites par l\u2019employeur \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement pour souligner le fait que les cotisations de la plaignante ne devraient pas \u00eatre incluses dans le calcul des sommes vers\u00e9es au titre de la pension qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdues pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Autrement, l\u2019objet de la mesure de redressement \u00e9tait de veiller \u00e0 ce que \u00ab la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS \u00bb (voir la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, au paragraphe 22). Pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, le Tribunal voulait que la plaignante re\u00e7oive tout montant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui aurait donn\u00e9 (50 % de ce montant, moins ses propres cotisations) \u00ab [...] si la plaignante \u00e9t\u00e9 rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service \u00bb (voir la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, au paragraphe 22).\n[10] Bien que, dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, le Tribunal ait affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait \u00e0 juste titre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la mesure de redressement relative \u00e0 la pension pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement comme correspondant \u00e0 50 % des cotisations que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait vers\u00e9es, quand on tient compte des consid\u00e9rations relatives aux paiements d\u2019amortissement et aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la plaignante selon laquelle on devait lui accorder 50 % des prestations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues moins les cotisations qu\u2019elle aurait faites. Ces interpr\u00e9tations sont \u00e9quivalentes parce que le r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par opposition \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 cotisations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. La plaignante a su d\u00e9crire la diff\u00e9rence entre ces deux r\u00e9gimes :\n[Traduction]\n12. Sous un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 cotisations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, les employ\u00e9s et l\u2019employeur versent une certaine somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime. Ces cotisations sont investies sur le march\u00e9 en vue de rapporter davantage d\u2019argent dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite. Les prestations que les pensionn\u00e9s recevront \u00e0 leur retraite d\u00e9pendront du montant des cotisations ainsi que de l\u2019\u00e9tat du march\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 investies. Par exemple, si le march\u00e9 s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien port\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 investies, les prestations seront relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9es. Toutefois, si le march\u00e9 s\u2019est mal port\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 investies, les prestations seront relativement faibles. Sous un tel r\u00e9gime de retraite, les prestations ne sont pas des sommes \u00e9tablies, et elles sont incertaines (\u00ab ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es \u00bb). Un r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es est, \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9gards, le contraire d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 cotisations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es.\n13. Sous un r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, les cotisations de l\u2019employeur ne sont pas \u00e9tablies; elles sont incertaines (\u00ab ind\u00e9termin\u00e9es \u00bb). Toutefois, les prestations de retraite sont certaines et \u00e9tablies (\u00ab d\u00e9termin\u00e9es \u00bb). Par cons\u00e9quent, il importe peu que le march\u00e9 \u00e9volue \u00e0 la hausse ou \u00e0 la baisse, un r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es garantit \u00e0 un pensionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il recevra une somme donn\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de ce r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n14. Dans un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, c\u2019est l\u2019employeur qui assume les risques relatifs aux hauts et aux bas du march\u00e9. Par exemple, quand le march\u00e9 se porte bien, il se peut que l\u2019employeur n\u2019ait absolument aucune cotisation \u00e0 verser pour financer les prestations de retraite promises. Toutefois, quand le march\u00e9 va mal, il se peut que l\u2019employeur doive verser des cotisations bien sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 celles que les employ\u00e9es doivent verser afin de financer les prestations de retraite promises. Dans les deux cas, l\u2019employeur a la responsabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019obligation de veiller au financement suffisant du r\u00e9gime de retraite, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir aux employ\u00e9s le versement de prestations particuli\u00e8res, d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et \u00e9tablies, \u00e0 leur retraite.\n15. Par cons\u00e9quent, comme on peut le voir, sous un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, le montant des cotisations que les employeurs doivent verser \u00e0 tout moment peut varier radicalement. Toutefois, le montant des prestations qu\u2019un pensionn\u00e9 est assur\u00e9 de recevoir est fixe et certain, conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s du r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n16. Ainsi, sous un r\u00e9gime de retraite \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, l\u2019employeur ne verse pas une somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et certaine \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers, et le montant des cotisations devra \u00eatre estim\u00e9 en se fondant sur certaines hypoth\u00e8ses. Ind\u00e9pendamment de ces hypoth\u00e8ses, il se peut que le montant des cotisations, \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, n\u2019ait aucune incidence sur le montant des prestations. Finalement, les prestations de retraite doivent \u00eatre financ\u00e9es, mais les modalit\u00e9s de versement des cotisations visant \u00e0 financer ces prestations peuvent grandement varier.\n(Observations \u00e9crites de la plaignante au sujet de la pension de retraite de la plaignante, dat\u00e9es du 31 juillet 2013, aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 16)\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9e souscrit \u00e0 cette explication g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, dat\u00e9es du 27 septembre 2013, au paragraphe 23).\n[12] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour interpr\u00e9ter et calculer les pensions. Il a \u00e9labor\u00e9 la mesure initiale de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite en se fondant sur les observations des parties ainsi que sur la preuve dont il \u00e9tait saisi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Ce n\u2019est que bien apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la mesure de redressement initiale que les parties ont produit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve actuariels et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs au fonctionnement du r\u00e9gime de retraite. R\u00e9trospectivement, compte tenu du fait que la pension est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus facile pour le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que les prestations de retraite de la plaignante soient r\u00e9tablies \u00e0 un taux de 50 % pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, moins ses cotisations, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, dat\u00e9e du 27 septembre 2013, au paragraphe 27). Toutefois, et encore une fois comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement, il ne s\u2019agit pas de r\u00e9examiner l\u2019ordonnance que le Tribunal a rendue en mati\u00e8re de pension, mais de s\u2019assurer que cette ordonnance est correctement appliqu\u00e9e et qu\u2019une victime de discrimination re\u00e7oit le plein montant qui lui est d\u00fb.\nIII. Le calcul de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement [13] Bien que les parties aient interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les termes de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, heureusement, quand on tient compte des consid\u00e9rations dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question ci\u2011dessus, les deux parties arrivent au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat dans leurs rapports actuariels en ce qui concerne les prestations perdues apr\u00e8s le licenciement.\n[14] \u00c0 l\u2019annexe D du rapport actuariel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 27 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e calcule 50 % des prestations de retraite de la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement et r\u00e9duit la prestation du montant de ce qu\u2019auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 les cotisations de la plaignante pour cette p\u00e9riode. Apr\u00e8s avoir calcul\u00e9 50 % du montant total de la retraite de la plaignante \u00e0 la suite du licenciement et soustrait de cette somme les cotisations de cette derni\u00e8re, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 un total de 98 863,81 $.\n[15] De m\u00eame, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 1 du rapport actuariel de la plaignante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 18 octobre 2013, on calcule les [Traduction] \u00ab cotisations manquantes de l\u2019employeur \u00bb (la somme normale plus les paiements d\u2019amortissement et les int\u00e9r\u00eats) \u00bb pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, et on conclut que les cotisations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se seraient \u00e9lev\u00e9es \u00e0 98 863,81 $.\n[16] Pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, les deux parties sont arriv\u00e9es au m\u00eame total de 98 863,81 $, que le calcul soit fond\u00e9 sur 50 % des cotisations de l\u2019employeur, ou sur 50 % des prestations de retraite moins les cotisations de la plaignante. Encore une fois, cela est d\u00fb au fait que le r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par opposition \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 cotisations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es.\nIV. Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant l\u2019exclusion des paiements d\u2019amortissement et des int\u00e9r\u00eats [17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019il ne convient pas de tenir compte des paiements d\u2019amortissement et des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour l\u2019application de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9e.\n[18] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 le paiement de cotisations pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, et, th\u00e9oriquement, les paiements d\u2019amortissement attribuables \u00e0 la plaignante ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement et ne concernent que la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au licenciement. Autrement dit, les paiements d\u2019amortissement \u00e0 verser apr\u00e8s le licenciement ne se rapportent pas \u00ab \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement \u00bb, mais \u00ab \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement \u00bb, parce qu\u2019ils servent \u00e0 financer, en partie, les prestations acquises au service de l\u2019employeur avant le licenciement. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour que les paiements d\u2019amortissement requis pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement soient th\u00e9oriquement applicables dans le cas de la plaignante, le Tribunal aurait d\u00fb ordonner que les prestations s\u2019accumulent apr\u00e8s la date du licenciement; toutefois, la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite confirme que l\u2019ordonnance allait dans la direction oppos\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, si des paiements d\u2019amortissement \u00e9taient accord\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, cela aboutirait \u00e0 une double indemnisation pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement parce que la plaignante recevrait \u00e0 la fois les prestations et les cotisations finan\u00e7ant cette prestation pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, \u00e0 savoir celle qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le licenciement.\n[19] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, si le Tribunal devait accorder les paiements d\u2019amortissement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que la part de la plaignante des [Traduction] \u00ab paiements d\u2019amortissement r\u00e9els \u00bb exig\u00e9s [Traduction] \u00ab pendant \u00bb la p\u00e9riode ayant suivi le licenciement s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 4 251 $, soit \u00e0 50 % de 8 501 $.\n[20] L\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e relatif \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion des paiements d\u2019amortissement d\u00e9coule d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite et stricte de la distinction \u00e0 op\u00e9rer entre des prestations et des cotisations, ainsi que du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. Vu que le r\u00e9gime de retraite est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, l\u2019exclusion de paiements d\u2019amortissement, ou le fait de n\u2019inclure que les [Traduction] \u00ab paiements d\u2019amortissement r\u00e9els \u00bb exig\u00e9s [Traduction] \u00ab pendant \u00bb la p\u00e9riode ayant suivi le licenciement, s\u2019\u00e9loignerait de l\u2019intention sous\u2011tendant l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, aux termes de laquelle la plaignante s\u2019est vu accorder les prestations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues de l\u2019intim\u00e9e si elle \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. Il n\u2019y a pas de double indemnisation parce que, une fois encore, le r\u00e9gime de retraite est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si les paiements d\u2019amortissement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s avant ou apr\u00e8s le licenciement, les prestations de retraite demeurent inchang\u00e9es. En outre, le fait de n\u2019accorder que les paiements d\u2019amortissement [Traduction] \u00ab effectivement vers\u00e9s \u00bb apr\u00e8s le licenciement ne compenserait que faiblement la perte v\u00e9ritablement subie par la plaignante, et, encore une fois, ce ne serait pas pertinent dans le contexte des prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait \u00e9galement valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour ordonner le versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ou de cotisations de l\u2019employeur. Elle affirme que la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de clarification de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite est venue confirmer que le Tribunal lui avait ordonn\u00e9 de payer des prestations de retraite pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement et 50 % des cotisations de l\u2019employeur pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement. Le Tribunal n\u2019a jamais ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer des int\u00e9r\u00eats, que ce soit sur les prestations ou sur les cotisations. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e renvoie \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, dans laquelle, quand il a accord\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur d\u2019autres mesures de redressement compensatoires, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur la pension de retraite parce que \u00ab les mesures de redressement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pension de retraite [...] de la plaignante ne sont pas des paiements d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 car elles ont pour but de r\u00e9tablir un avantage suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi \u00bb (au paragraphe 21). Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le raisonnement du Tribunal se situe dans le droit fil du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi, qui donne au Tribunal le pouvoir de rendre des ordonnances accordant des int\u00e9r\u00eats uniquement sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9. Vu que la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite n\u2019est pas un paiement d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats. Aux yeux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la d\u00e9cision reste inchang\u00e9e et ne peut plus \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e que par contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[22] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, si le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite, il ne devrait pas accorder les int\u00e9r\u00eats demand\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils sont bien sup\u00e9rieurs aux int\u00e9r\u00eats normalement accord\u00e9s par le Tribunal et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aucune circonstance justifiant qu\u2019on d\u00e9roge \u00e0 la pratique normale (voir le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb)). \u00c0 titre subsidiaire encore, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que, dans son rapport actuariel, la plaignante n\u2019a pas correctement calcul\u00e9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les paiements normaux ou d\u2019amortissement parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas servi des taux de rendement appropri\u00e9s.\n[23] Le fait d\u2019inclure des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les paiements normaux et d\u2019amortissement dans la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite n\u2019est en aucune fa\u00e7on tributaire du pouvoir dont le Tribunal dispose d\u2019accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre du paragraphe 53(4) de la Loi ou du paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats ou le taux de rendement de l\u2019investissement des paiements normaux et d\u2019amortissement se rapportent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 une fonction incluse dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable. Encore une fois, cela s\u2019explique par le fait que le r\u00e9gime de retraite est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, par opposition \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 cotisations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, le point de d\u00e9part pour le calcul de la pr\u00e9sente mesure de redressement est ce que les prestations de retraite de la plaignante auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 si celle\u2011ci \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Si on soustrait de ce montant les cotisations que la plaignante aurait faites, on obtient le montant des cotisations que l\u2019employeur doit verser en vue d\u2019obtenir la prestation d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Bien que le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal aient conduit les deux parties \u00e0 calculer la mesure de redressement de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, elles sont finalement arriv\u00e9es au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat : 98 863,81 $. Toute diff\u00e9rence dans le taux de rendement applicable des paiements normaux et d\u2019amortissement ne change rien \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat final.\n[24] Qu\u2019on qualifie les cotisations de l\u2019employeur au r\u00e9gime de retraite de paiements normaux ou d\u2019amortissement, et quelle que soit la m\u00e9thode employ\u00e9e pour justifier le taux de rendement de ces cotisations, au bout du compte, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit verser des prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s. Bien que les cotisations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e varient, les prestations restent identiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait d\u2019exclure les paiements d\u2019amortissement et les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la pr\u00e9sente mesure de redressement et de n\u2019accorder que les cotisations normales, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e le demande, serait loin de garantir que \u00ab la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS [...] \u00bb si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service (voir la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, au paragraphe 22).\nV. L\u2019application de la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite [25] Pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement de la plaignante, les parties ont confirm\u00e9 que la plaignante avait droit \u00e0 ses pleines prestations de retraite, et ces prestations peuvent lui \u00eatre vers\u00e9es dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime de retraite applicable.\n[26] Pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que les cotisations de l\u2019employeur applicables ne peuvent pas \u00eatre vers\u00e9es directement dans le r\u00e9gime de retraite, comme le pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une violation de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, ce qui pourrait entra\u00eener de graves cons\u00e9quences pour le r\u00e9gime de retraite ainsi que pour ses membres. L\u2019intim\u00e9e propose de verser une somme forfaitaire, que la plaignante pourra alors d\u00e9poser dans un REER.\n[27] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, la plaignante propose que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse acheter une rente pour payer \u00e0 la plaignante une prestation d\u00e9termin\u00e9e garantie de 405,44 $ par mois. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas pour cette solution du fait des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019elle devrait assumer pour la mettre en \u0153uvre, co\u00fbts qu\u2019elle estime \u00eatre entre 24 000 $ et 60 000 $. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le fait de lui imposer une telle solution, alors qu\u2019une solution plus \u00e9conomique est disponible pour fournir la m\u00eame prestation, ne va pas dans le sens de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, dans laquelle le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite ne visait pas \u00e0 sanctionner l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[28] Pour 2013, le maximum d\u00e9ductible au titre du REER de la plaignante est en de\u00e7\u00e0 de 98 863,81 $ (voir l\u2019onglet 5 du Rapport d\u2019expert de Louis Ellement, le 29 juillet 2013). \u00c0 moins que le maximum d\u00e9ductible au titre du REER de la plaignante pour 2014 permette de couvrir le montant, la mesure de redressement en mati\u00e8re de retraite devra \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante sous forme de rente. Les co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par le versement d\u2019une rente ne constituent pas une sanction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit des co\u00fbts n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ne peut pas \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son propre r\u00e9gime de retraite. L\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e9tait ainsi libell\u00e9e :\nS\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations de retraite perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS.\n(D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux mesures de redressement en suspens, au paragraphe 22)\n[29] Aussi, la somme due \u00e0 la plaignante devra \u00eatre rajust\u00e9e en fonction de la date d\u2019application des termes de l\u2019ordonnance.\nVI. Ordonnance [30] Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment aux motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, la d\u00e9cision et ordonnance finale du Tribunal en ce qui concerne la mesure de redressement qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante est la suivante :\n(1) L\u2019intim\u00e9e replacera les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement et lui versera ces prestations par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire du r\u00e9gime de retraite.\n(2) Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du licenciement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 la plaignante la moiti\u00e9 (50 %) des cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait vers\u00e9es dans son r\u00e9gime de retraite si elle ne l\u2019avait pas licenci\u00e9e, moins le montant des cotisations que la plaignante aurait vers\u00e9es (98 863,81 $, rajust\u00e9s en fonction de la date d\u2019application).\n(3) Si la plaignante dispose de suffisamment de droits de cotisation \u00e0 un REER pour la somme totale qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au point (2) de l\u2019ordonnance, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, alors la somme lui sera vers\u00e9e sous la forme d\u2019un paiement forfaitaire.\n(4) Si la plaignante ne dispose pas de suffisamment de droits de cotisation \u00e0 un REER pour la somme totale qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e au point (2) de l\u2019ordonnance, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, alors l\u2019intim\u00e9e ach\u00e8tera une rente qui versera \u00e0 la plaignante une prestation d\u00e9termin\u00e9e garantie \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 (50 %) des cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait vers\u00e9es dans son r\u00e9gime de retraite si elle ne l\u2019avait pas licenci\u00e9e, moins le montant des cotisations que la plaignante aurait vers\u00e9es (405,44 $ par mois, rajust\u00e9s en fonction de la date d\u2019application).\nSign\u00e9 par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\n10 avril 2014",

Plaintes et requ\u00eate [1] La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire deux plaintes relatives \u00e0 de la discrimination et \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e se serait rendue coupable, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] Le 19 janvier 2005, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re plainte, au titre des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. Il y est question de la discrimination dont le plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement victime et des politiques discriminatoires, fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, dans le contexte de diverses proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9lection auxquelles le plaignant a pris part en vue d\u2019obtenir un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[3] La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re plainte en application du paragraphe 44(3) de la Loi. Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision, et, le 27 septembre 2010, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accueilli sa demande. Par suite de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Commission a men\u00e9 une seconde enqu\u00eate au sujet des all\u00e9gations, et, le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[4] Le 9 juillet 2008, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une seconde plainte au titre de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait que, entre 2001 et 2008, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge et la d\u00e9ficience, encore une fois dans le contexte de diverses proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9lection auxquelles il avait pris part en vue d\u2019obtenir un emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Au terme de l\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019elle a men\u00e9e sur la seconde plainte, la Commission a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiellement question des m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes que dans la premi\u00e8re plainte, et, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2011, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\n[5] Le 27 juin 2012, le Tribunal a accueilli la demande du plaignant, qui souhaitait que ses deux plaintes soient entendues conjointement.\n[6] Le 31 janvier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a produit un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, mais elle n\u2019a produit aucun des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans sa liste de documents.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a communiqu\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re s\u00e9rie de documents au moyen d\u2019un DVD, qu\u2019elle a produit le 12 mars 2013. Le plaignant affirme que les pr\u00e9cisions de la communication, y compris les noms des candidats ayant pris part aux proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9lection, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9es. Par la suite, le 1er mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a communiqu\u00e9 le reste des documents. Toutefois, le plaignant affirme que des parties de ces documents ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9es.\n[8] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2013, on a tenu une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, au cours de laquelle on a discut\u00e9 de la question du caviardage. Les parties ont convenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait produire une liste de documents modifi\u00e9e traitant de la question du caviardage, et, en outre, qu\u2019elle devait produire une liste de documents plus pr\u00e9cise, susceptible d\u2019aider l\u2019avocat du plaignant \u00e0 trouver et \u00e0 organiser les documents.\n[9] Le 9 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni \u00e0 l\u2019avocat du plaignant une liste de documents modifi\u00e9e.\n[10] Le 18 octobre 2013, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate au titre de l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), dans lequel il demandait au Tribunal ce qui suit :\n(1) De rendre une ordonnance exigeant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle satisfasse \u00e0 ses obligations aux termes de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles et qu\u2019elle communique les parties caviard\u00e9es de tous les documents susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinents qu\u2019elle a fournis au plaignant;\n(2) De rendre, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, une ordonnance fixant une date pour la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos, au cours de laquelle l\u2019avocat du plaignant pourra examiner les documents non caviard\u00e9s et le membre du Tribunal pourra \u00e9tablir leur pertinence, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties;\n(3) De rendre une ordonnance exigeant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle communique les rapports relatifs aux syst\u00e8mes administratifs d\u2019entreprise (SAE) des personnes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es aux postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes et d\u2019agent des douanes dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique (Colombie\u2011Britannique et Yukon) pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 2001 et 2009, y compris la date de leur embauche et leur \u00e2ge (ou date de naissance);\n(4) De rendre une ordonnance exigeant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle communique les lettres qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9es aux \u00e9tudiants pour les aviser de leur nomination aux postes d\u2019inspecteur des douanes ou d\u2019agent des douanes dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique (Colombie\u2011Britannique et Yukon), dans la contexte de la politique de l\u2019ASFC intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Int\u00e9gration des \u00e9tudiants et \u00e9tudiantes \u2013 Nomination sans avis de concours \u00bb, en plus de tous les documents dont l\u2019ASFC se serait servie pour \u00e9valuer les comp\u00e9tences de ces personnes en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e;\n(5) D\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019expliquer quels sont les fondements de sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle chaque document, ou partie de documents, rel\u00e8ve du privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public;\n(6) De donner au plaignant jusqu\u2019au 8 novembre 2013 pour produire une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate;\n(7) De consentir \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[11] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a produit l\u2019affidavit de Mally McGregor, dat\u00e9 du 17 octobre 2013.\n[12] Le 8 novembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a produit une r\u00e9ponse dans laquelle elle s\u2019opposait \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration demand\u00e9e et demandait le rejet de la requ\u00eate du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement produit l\u2019affidavit de Sheila Anderson, sign\u00e9 le 7 novembre 2013.\nII. Question 1 : Les documents caviard\u00e9s [13] Le plaignant est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il a besoin des noms des personnes qui ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature dans le contexte des proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9lection afin de trouver et d\u2019organiser les documents relatifs \u00e0 ses all\u00e9gations. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a propos\u00e9 de dresser, et a dress\u00e9, une liste dans laquelle elle a attribu\u00e9 un num\u00e9ro \u00e0 chaque candidat. Dans cette liste, chaque candidat se voit associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un seul num\u00e9ro, lequel ne change pas dans le cas o\u00f9 le candidat a postul\u00e9 plusieurs emplois. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la liste comporte 201 noms de candidats. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que le plaignant serait ainsi en mesure de trouver le nom du candidat au moyen du num\u00e9ro correspondant, qui appara\u00eet dans le document en question.\n[14] L\u2019avocat du plaignant a \u00e9crit une lettre dat\u00e9e du 13 janvier 2014, dans laquelle il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la solution propos\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaisante et a fait valoir ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nPremi\u00e8rement, vu que la r\u00e8gle normale consiste \u00e0 communiquer tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents, par principe, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s. S\u2019ils \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle normale, nous disposerions alors de documents pertinents dans lesquels les noms appara\u00eetraient, lesquels nous faciliteraient grandement la t\u00e2che pour nous pr\u00e9parer aux fins de la pr\u00e9sentation de notre cause. En l\u2019absence de ces noms sur les documents en question, il sera n\u00e9cessaire de mener un processus long et laborieux en vue d\u2019associer chaque document \u00e0 un nom. Vu que la r\u00e8gle normale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la production exige la communication, nous ne devrions pas \u00eatre l\u00e9s\u00e9s de la sorte, consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a clairement aucune preuve de pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ce stade.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, le plaignant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 en sa possession une grande partie de ces documents, sur lesquels les noms de ces personnes apparaissent. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e se soucie vraiment du caract\u00e8re confidentiel de ces renseignements, alors le Tribunal devra de toute mani\u00e8re examiner la question dans le contexte d\u2019une ordonnance relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9. Autrement, le plaignant peut tr\u00e8s bien se servir des documents dont il dispose, sur lesquels les noms en cause apparaissent, et il se retrouvera avec certains documents faisant \u00e9tat de noms et d\u2019autres sans noms. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une \u00e9volution tr\u00e8s logique.\nPour finir, dans certains cas, il se peut que le v\u00e9ritable nom de la personne soit pertinent. Par exemple, il se peut que M. Hughes nourrisse des inqui\u00e9tudes pr\u00e9cises au sujet de la mani\u00e8re dont un candidat particulier a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9, ce qui d\u00e9pend du fait qu\u2019il connait le nom de cette personne. En outre, il se pourrait que, lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire, nous souhaitions poser des questions \u00e0 d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, lesquelles auraient trait aux noms de ces candidats. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est in\u00e9vitable que ces noms soient communiqu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 en cause s\u2019av\u00e9rera n\u00e9cessaire quoi qu\u2019il en soit.\n[15] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le Tribunal a aussi entendu les parties pr\u00e9senter de courtes plaidoiries au sujet du caviardage. Notamment, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 que, en plus des recueils de jurisprudence qu\u2019elles ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 produits, les parties traitent des questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9cisions Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2013 TCDP 3; et Emmett c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2013 TCDP 12 (Emmett).\n[16] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2014, les parties ont formul\u00e9 des observations au sujet de la question du caviardage et de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019ordonnances que le Tribunal pourrait rendre. L\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant ont convenu du fait que les noms des candidats ne seraient pas caviard\u00e9s, sous r\u00e9serve du fait que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 appropri\u00e9e, semblable \u00e0 celle dont il est question aux paragraphes 71 \u00e0 74 de la d\u00e9cision Emmett. Les autres renseignements personnels demeureront caviard\u00e9s.\n[17] Consid\u00e9rant que les parties sont parvenues \u00e0 un accord sur cette question, j\u2019ordonne ce qui suit :\nLes parties et leurs repr\u00e9sentants devront assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de tous les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 des candidats aux postes qui \u00e9taient en jeu dans le contexte des processus de s\u00e9lection en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[18] \u00c0 titre de pr\u00e9caution suppl\u00e9mentaire, je voudrais souligner que, pendant l\u2019audience, ces candidats pourront \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s, mais que le Tribunal s\u2019assurera, dans la mesure du possible, que leurs noms n\u2019apparaissent pas dans la d\u00e9cision.\nIII. Questions 2, 6 et 7 : La demande relative \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos; l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une date d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance pour la production d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate; la demande relative \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate [19] Compte tenu de la proc\u00e9dure et de la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la question 1 ci\u2011dessus, il est inutile d\u2019examiner les questions 2, 6 et 7 de la requ\u00eate du plaignant. Autrement, le plaignant devra en aviser le greffier dans les sept jours et demander d\u2019autres \u00e9claircissements. L\u2019intim\u00e9e dispose de cinq jours pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande du plaignant.\nIV. Questions 3 et 4 : La communication des rapports relatifs aux SAE et des lettres de nomination des \u00e9tudiants [20] Dans sa requ\u00eate, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 la communication des rapports relatifs aux SAE et des lettres de nomination des \u00e9tudiants. Le plaignant fait valoir que ces rapports et lettres sont pertinents dans le contexte de l\u2019aspect de la premi\u00e8re plainte relatif \u00e0 l\u2019article 10, et qu\u2019ils constituent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels relatifs \u00e0 la question de l\u2019\u00e2ge, \u00e0 partir desquels le Tribunal pourrait tirer des conclusions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de conduite et d\u2019actes discriminatoires.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la requ\u00eate en communication est le premier avis qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u du fait que le plaignant demandait la production de ces documents. Bien qu\u2019elle ait entam\u00e9 le processus consistant \u00e0 regrouper les documents demand\u00e9s, elle affirme que la production de ces documents exigera un certain temps. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande, et ce, avant que le Tribunal ne rende une ordonnance, \u00e0 pouvoir examiner les documents requis et obtenir les conseils de son avocat, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir ensuite consid\u00e9rer les documents et se forger une opinion quant \u00e0 la pertinence de ces documents et \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il lui est possible d\u2019invoquer des privil\u00e8ges.\n[22] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance qui s\u2019est tenue le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 que la demande relative \u00e0 ces documents restait une question d\u2019actualit\u00e9, ajoutant toutefois qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que ces documents ne lui soient pas n\u00e9cessaires avant la tenue de l\u2019audience, du 21 au 23 mai.\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est au courant du fait que le plaignant a demand\u00e9 ces documents depuis le 18 octobre 2013, elle devrait \u00eatre en mesure de fournir une r\u00e9ponse au plus tard le 1er mai 2014. Si le plaignant souhaite fournir une r\u00e9ponse, il peut le faire au plus tard le 12 mai 2014. Si n\u00e9cessaire, le Tribunal examinera les arguments relatifs \u00e0 cette question au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, le 21 mai 2014.\nV. Question 5 : Le privil\u00e8ge relatif \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public [24] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui s\u2019est tenue le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait \u00e0 cet aspect de la requ\u00eate. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Introduction\n[1] Le plaignant, Pierre Croteau, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (le CN) en 1992, et il a gravi les \u00e9chelons jusqu\u2019au poste de chef de train sans incident. Malheureusement, comme nous le verrons dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs de d\u00e9cision, les choses ont mal tourn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2003. \u00c0 cause d\u2019accidents au d\u00e9part et de l\u2019apparition d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale, M. Croteau n\u2019exerce plus ses fonctions de chef de train depuis 2004. En fait, il est en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9 depuis mai 2008.\n[2] En 2003-2004, la relation entre l\u2019employeur et l\u2019employ\u00e9 s\u2019est rapidement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e. Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne contre deux superviseurs, de pair avec des griefs, une plainte aupr\u00e8s du commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada, ainsi qu\u2019une plainte relative au \u00ab devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste \u00bb au titre du Code canadien du travail \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son syndicat. Il a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la plainte) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), se disant victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement, en violation des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP) pour le motif de distinction illicite que constitue la d\u00e9ficience [1] .\n[3] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2010. Quelque temps avant le d\u00e9but des audiences, soit le 9 janvier 2012, le CN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 limiter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction. \u00c0 part cette requ\u00eate et une requ\u00eate ult\u00e9rieure en non-lieu, la Commission n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 aux audiences. Pour ce qui est de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 limiter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction, je l\u2019ai entendue et rejet\u00e9e sous r\u00e9serve du droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la renouveler \u00e0 la fin de la plaidoirie du plaignant. Des activit\u00e9s de m\u00e9diation ont \u00e9galement eu lieu avant et pendant les audiences.\n[4] La plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comprenait onze all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement entre 2003 et 2007, ainsi qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation continue de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement entre l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004 et la fin des audiences en 2013. Ces derni\u00e8res ont dur\u00e9 36 jours, et cela incluait une requ\u00eate en non-lieu \u00e0 la fin de la plaidoirie du plaignant. Il y a eu de nombreuses interruptions au cours des audiences \u00e0 cause des crises de panique du plaignant. La situation \u00e9tait toutefois g\u00e9rable et le plaignant a pu revenir. Il y a aussi une multitude d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de vive voix et documentaire (dix reliures de pi\u00e8ces) \u00e0 analyser et \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration. Et, bien s\u00fbr, les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations finales et des recueils de jurisprudence.\n[5] Du point de vue des parties et des t\u00e9moins, les souvenirs s\u2019estompent et il devient plus difficile de t\u00e9moigner \u2013 certains faits remontent \u00e0 2003. Du point de vue du Tribunal, cela a rendu l\u2019affaire plus complexe \u00e0 trancher.\n[6] \u00c0 cause des all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre certains particuliers ou de certaines de mes conclusions, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019employer des initiales ou des lettres pour identifier ces personnes, plut\u00f4t que leur nom entier, dans le souci de prot\u00e9ger leur vie priv\u00e9e.\n[7] M. Croteau soutient que le CN a viol\u00e9 les droits que lui conf\u00e8rent les articles 7 et 14 de la LCDP pour cause de d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019article 7 est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\nII. Le contexte\nIII. L\u2019emploi d\u2019initiales\nIV. Le plaignant\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nLe paragraphe 14(1) est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\n[\u2026]\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n[8] La port\u00e9e de la plainte, telle qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9finie par l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et des stipulations additionnelles du plaignant, dans le cadre des observations finales de son avocat, est la suivante :\n[Traduction] Le fondement essentiel de la cause de M. Croteau comporte des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 des actes de harc\u00e8lement et \u00e0 un comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 2003 et qui se poursuivent encore aujourd\u2019hui. M. Croteau pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris pour cible et harcel\u00e9, que sa r\u00e9putation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faussement attaqu\u00e9e et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 celle de sa famille, en violation de ses droits \u00e0 la protection de sa vie priv\u00e9e, par le CN \u00e0 cause du fait qu\u2019il devait prendre cong\u00e9 pour un probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel en 2003 et aussi de deux accidents du travail subis en 2004, le premier \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule et le second au genou. M. Croteau soutient par ailleurs que l\u2019effet cumulatif des agissements du CN l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019un trouble anxieux, d\u2019un trouble de stress post\u2011traumatique ainsi que d\u2019un trouble d\u2019adaptation, troubles pour lesquels le CN ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9rieuse de son obligation d\u2019accommodement, ce qui a exacerb\u00e9 et prolong\u00e9 son \u00e9tat.\nV. Le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire : l\u2019entreprise ferroviaire\n[9] Je souhaite, au d\u00e9but de mes motifs, faire quelques commentaires sur le contexte singulier dans lequel s\u2019inscrit l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u2013 le transport ferroviaire de marchandises. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une entreprise dangereuse quand les choses vont de travers. Les t\u00e9moins du CN et les pi\u00e8ces produites traitent de l\u2019aspect bien particulier qui l\u2019emporte sur tous les autres au CN : la S\u00c9CURIT\u00c9 de ses employ\u00e9s et du grand public. Derrick Colasimone, l\u2019actuel directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Division du Michigan, laquelle englobe Sarnia et Windsor, et un homme de tr\u00e8s grande exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine ferroviaire, au sein duquel il a notamment travaill\u00e9 comme chef de train et comme conducteur de locomotive, a exprim\u00e9 avec \u00e9loquence la nature de ce domaine, l\u2019importance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les dangers inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une entreprise ferroviaire. Il s\u2019agit, pour des raisons \u00e9videntes, d\u2019un secteur tr\u00e8s r\u00e9glement\u00e9 et soucieux de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab notre mot d\u2019ordre est \u201cla s\u00e9curit\u00e9 favorise le rendement\u201d. Quand on exploite une entreprise ferroviaire s\u00e9curitaire, tout le reste est facile [\u2026] C\u2019est une industrie qui ne pardonne pas. Il est impossible de se faire mal \u201cun peu\u201d. \u00bb De plus, les entreprises ferroviaires transportent souvent des mati\u00e8res dangereuses. Toutes les r\u00e8gles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le Livre des r\u00e8gles d\u2019exploitation ferroviaire sont l\u00e0 pour une raison pr\u00e9cise, et un grand nombre d\u2019entre elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites en lettres de sang (\u00e0 la suite d\u2019accidents mortels).\n[10] J\u2019ai entendu des t\u00e9moignages concernant la r\u00e9glementation exhaustive de l\u2019industrie ferroviaire et la supervision qu\u2019exerce Transports Canada. Et, bien s\u00fbr, le CN applique de nombreuses r\u00e8gles et exerce un nombre consid\u00e9rable d\u2019activit\u00e9s de surveillance \u00e0 l\u2019interne, dont des contr\u00f4les d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 r\u00e9guliers. On consid\u00e8re que les chefs de train (qui sont charg\u00e9s du fonctionnement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019un train) et les conducteurs de locomotive (qui sont charg\u00e9s du fonctionnement de la locomotive) occupent un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (ES), qui doit comporter des exigences et des processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019aptitude au travail. Il existe d\u2019autres postes de type ES, tels que ceux de coordonnateur de train, de chef de triage, etc. En de\u00e7\u00e0 de ces postes, sur le plan de la d\u00e9signation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, figurent les postes dits sensibles sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (SS) (p. ex., les surveillants), et ils sont suivis des postes autres que ES ou SS et ne comportant aucune d\u00e9signation sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, comme les postes de bureau.\n[11] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement entendu des t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 propos des r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant la d\u00e9claration des blessures et des accidents par les \u00e9quipes de train. Plus d\u2019un t\u00e9moin du CN a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du fait que [Traduction] \u00ab aucune blessure n\u2019est trop l\u00e9g\u00e8re \u00bb pour \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e (une mesure qui est obligatoire, non facultative) et faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer M. Colasimone, n\u2019importe quel manquement \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 risque de causer la mort. Il a donn\u00e9 comme exemple la [Traduction] \u00ab descente d\u2019un train \u00bb. Un membre de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de train pourrait tomber sous un train.\n[12] Je dis ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de parce que, comme nous le verrons dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, et contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument du plaignant, [Traduction] \u00ab la question de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas [Traduction] \u00ab un faux-fuyant, un \u00e9cran de fum\u00e9e ou une justification pour expliquer les actes de harc\u00e8lement et l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant. Il n\u2019existe pas une loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 un lieu de travail en particulier et une autre \u00e0 l\u2019industrie ferroviaire, mais le contexte est important. En outre, la \u00ab s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb est express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9e comme un facteur dont il faut tenir compte au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer si une mesure d\u2019accommodement propos\u00e9e constituerait une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP. Il m\u2019est apparu tr\u00e8s clairement apr\u00e8s cette longue audition que, pour le CN, pour l\u2019industrie ferroviaire en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ainsi que pour le gouvernement qui la r\u00e9glemente, la \u00ab s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb repr\u00e9sente un aspect pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant et d\u00e9terminant.\n[13] \u00c0 la fin de la plaidoirie du plaignant, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en non-lieu. J\u2019ai re\u00e7u des observations \u00e9crites sur le fait de savoir si, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate serait entendue, le CN aurait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il entendait de ne pas pr\u00e9senter d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. J\u2019ai jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne serait pas oblig\u00e9 de faire ce choix.\n[14] Pour ce qui est de la question du choix \u00e0 faire dans le cas d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu j\u2019ai formul\u00e9 quelques commentaires, que j\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans les motifs de la d\u00e9cision concernant l\u2019affaire Fahmy c. GTAA, 2008 TCDP 12. Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un choix est requis et \u00e0 entendre une requ\u00eate en non-lieu : Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 CF 785. Le juge Hughes a fait remarquer, au paragraphe 22, que le fait d\u2019exiger un choix est une question de proc\u00e9dure, et non de droit ou de justice naturelle : \u00ab Il y a lieu d\u2019accorder une latitude suffisante aux tribunaux administratifs en mati\u00e8re de proc\u00e9dure [\u2026] \u00bb Deuxi\u00e8mement, il existe, au niveau du Tribunal, deux d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies dans le cadre desquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exig\u00e9 et non exig\u00e9 qu\u2019un choix soit fait avant l\u2019audition d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu. Dans les deux d\u00e9cisions, les membres instructeurs respectifs ont convenu qu\u2019il y avait lieu de trancher la question en fonction des circonstances de chaque esp\u00e8ce : Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), [1999] D.C.D.P. no 5, et Filgueira, 2005 TCDP 30 [2] . Dans le contexte civil, la plupart des ressorts au Canada n\u2019exigent pas qu\u2019un choix soit fait [3] . Bien que les deux d\u00e9cisions soient fond\u00e9es sur des raisons de principe et de droit valables, pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Fahmy, je suis davantage convaincu par les arguments en faveur du fait de ne pas exiger un choix.\n[15] Bien qu\u2019il ne faille pas exploiter les ressources d\u2019un d\u00e9fendeur et les fonds publics pour payer des demandes frivoles ou vexatoires, les tribunaux ont mis la barre haute pour qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu soit accueillie. Cela se fait de diverses fa\u00e7ons : le crit\u00e8re de la preuve prima facie, qui oblige \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019on ajoute foi \u00e0 la preuve du demandeur; le fait de forcer un d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 faire un choix (dans les ressorts o\u00f9 cela est exig\u00e9); l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une partie requ\u00e9rante d\u00e9bout\u00e9e. Les tribunaux ont clairement statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas qu\u2019il soit trop facile pour un d\u00e9fendeur de mettre fin \u00e0 une poursuite \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu. On craint peut-\u00eatre de retarder le processus si les requ\u00eates en non-lieu infructueuses deviennent la norme. En revanche, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019arbitre Wildsmith dans la d\u00e9cision Gerin c. IMP Group Ltd., [1994] N.S.H.R.B.I.D. no 4, au paragraphe 21 : [Traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] je signale que la requ\u00eate en non-lieu est une protection potentielle contre les abus \u00bb.\n[16] Le crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante est celui qu\u2019a fix\u00e9 le juge Hughes dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira, aux paragraphes 24 et 25 :\nVI. La requ\u00eate en non-lieu\nA. La question du choix\nB. Le droit relatif aux requ\u00eates en non-lieu\ni. La preuve prima facie dans les requ\u00eates en non-lieu\nUne requ\u00eate en non-lieu exige que la Cour ou le tribunal administratif examine la preuve en se demandant si, en supposant qu\u2019il leur ajoute foi, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont suffisants pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. Ainsi que le juge McIntyre de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019explique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536) au paragraphe 28 :\nDans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire qu\u2019il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9.\nDans l\u2019affaire J.W. Cowie Engineering Ltd. c. Allen (1982), 26 C.P.C. 241, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a, notamment aux paragraphes 12 \u00e0 17, examin\u00e9 la nature et le degr\u00e9 de preuve suffisants pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve contraire. Le juge Jones, qui s\u2019exprimait au nom de la majorit\u00e9, expose succinctement le principe juridique applicable, au paragraphe 14 :\n[Traduction] Il est \u00e9vident que le simple fait qu\u2019il existe certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, aussi t\u00e9nus soient-ils, n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le juge du fond de faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[17] Une requ\u00eate en non-lieu infructueuse ne veut pas dire que le demandeur aura gain de cause \u00e0 la conclusion de l\u2019audience proprement dite. Cela signifie simplement que la \u00ab barre haute \u00bb que l\u2019on a fix\u00e9e pour le rejet d\u2019une demande au stade pr\u00e9liminaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 atteinte.\n[18] Il est important de noter les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019analyse diff\u00e9rentes que l\u2019on utilise pour une rendre une d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de non-lieu et rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00ab sur le fond \u00bb. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le membre instructeur Groarke dans une autre d\u00e9cision : Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 32, au paragraphe 12, dans une requ\u00eate en non-lieu, l\u2019analyse que l\u2019on effectue est diff\u00e9rente de celle que l\u2019on m\u00e8ne \u00ab sur le fond \u00bb \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une audience. Les tribunaux ont tr\u00e8s clairement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu que le juge du proc\u00e8s ou l\u2019arbitre proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation ordinaire de la preuve, y compris la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, que l\u2019on effectue habituellement \u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019une instruction ou d\u2019une audience. Dans le cas d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu, le juge ou l\u2019arbitre \u00e9value l\u2019affaire prima facie \u2013 de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s superficielle \u2013 \u00ab \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00bb, ce que signifie litt\u00e9ralement l\u2019expression latine prima facie. Aucun examen approfondi de la preuve ni aucune appr\u00e9ciation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins n\u2019ont lieu. En fait, la barre est fix\u00e9e si haut que ce n\u2019est que si la cause du plaignant est tout \u00e0 fait invraisemblable ou tir\u00e9e par les cheveux qu\u2019il y a lieu de ne pas y ajouter foi [4] .\n[19] La Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat FL Receivables Trust 2002-A (Administrator of) c. Cobrand Foods Ltd. (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 561, a analys\u00e9 le r\u00f4le que joue le juge du proc\u00e8s dans une requ\u00eate en non-lieu. Elle a conclu que le juge, en faisant droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, avait appliqu\u00e9 le mauvais crit\u00e8re [Traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] en outrepassant son mandat limit\u00e9 [\u2026] \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate. Le juge Laskin a \u00e9crit ce qui suit, aux paragraphes 35 et 36 :\n[Traduction]\nDans une requ\u00eate en non-lieu, le juge du proc\u00e8s proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un examen restreint. Il y a deux principes pertinents qui guident cet examen. Premi\u00e8rement, si le demandeur pr\u00e9sente une preuve quelconque sur tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sa demande, le juge se doit de rejeter la requ\u00eate. Deuxi\u00e8mement, pour \u00e9valuer si le demandeur a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, le juge doit pr\u00e9sumer que cette preuve est v\u00e9ridique et attribuer \u00ab le sens le plus favorable \u00bb aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments susceptibles de donner lieu \u00e0 des inf\u00e9rences oppos\u00e9es [\u2026].\nAutrement dit, dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu, le juge du proc\u00e8s ne devrait pas d\u00e9cider si les inf\u00e9rences oppos\u00e9es dont dispose le d\u00e9fendeur au vu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9futent la preuve prima facie du demandeur. Le juge devrait tirer cette conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019issue du proc\u00e8s, et non dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en non-lieu. Voir John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman et Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2e \u00e9d., Toronto, Butterworths Canada, 1999, \u00e0 la page 139.\nJe pr\u00e9sume que la Cour ne sous-entend pas que la \u00ab pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 \u00bb de la preuve inclut une preuve qui est invraisemblable \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame, ou simplement absurde.\n[20] Je tiens aussi \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019il y a une certaine confusion dans la jurisprudence quant au fait de savoir si le crit\u00e8re exige que la preuve engagerait ou pourrait engager la responsabilit\u00e9. Les tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs ont suivi les deux approches et certains \u00e9vitent carr\u00e9ment le probl\u00e8me. Dans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le juge Hughes cite en y souscrivant, au paragraphe 6, le passage suivant de Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant : \u00ab Le juge doit d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019arbitre des faits pourrait raisonnablement donner gain de cause au demandeur s\u2019il ajoutait foi \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e jusque-l\u00e0 dans le proc\u00e8s. \u00bb (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.) Il semble \u00e9vident que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a opt\u00e9 pour la seconde approche (\u00ab pourrait engager \u00bb), du moins en mati\u00e8re civile et p\u00e9nale, et c\u2019est celle que j\u2019ai suivie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce [5] . Il n\u2019y a pas lieu, selon moi, de s\u2019en \u00e9carter dans les instances devant le Tribunal.\n[21] Les 19 et 20 juillet 2012, j\u2019ai entendu les arguments sur la requ\u00eate en non-lieu. Le 9 octobre 2012, j\u2019ai fait part aux parties de la d\u00e9cision suivante :\nC. Les motifs de la d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en non-lieu\n[Traduction] La requ\u00eate en non-lieu est accord\u00e9e en partie; plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations no 9 (calepin lors du cours de recyclage sur les r\u00e8gles) et no 10 (non-divulgation des bandes de surveillance). La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au paradigme de l\u2019\u00ab examen restreint \u00bb d\u2019une requ\u00eate en non-lieu : c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le juge se doit d\u2019attribuer le sens le plus favorable \u00e0 la preuve du plaignant et ne pas entreprendre d\u2019appr\u00e9cier et de soupeser la preuve et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 comme il le fait d\u2019habitude \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une audience. Le CN peut produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et de \u00ab manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement \u00bb qui restent, mais il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de le faire [\u2026].\n[22] Il ressort de la d\u00e9cision qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que je n\u2019ai fourni essentiellement aucun motif. Cela r\u00e9pond aux commentaires faits dans les diverses affaires de choix et de non-lieu quant \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il y a lieu de fournir des motifs ou non, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 quel moment et dans quelle mesure, lorsqu\u2019un choix n\u2019est pas exig\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision Potocnik c. Thunder Bay (City), [1996] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 16, au paragraphe 16, l\u2019arbitre Slotnick cite en y souscrivant la d\u00e9marche suivie dans la d\u00e9cision Tomen c. O.T.F. (no 3), (1989) 11 C.H.R.R. D\/223, qui a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas donner de motifs. Au paragraphe 10, l\u2019arbitre Slotnick a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] [\u2026] lorsqu\u2019un arbitre n\u2019exige pas un choix et finit par rejeter la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte, la proc\u00e9dure qui convient consiste \u00e0 ne pas fournir de motifs. Sans cela, la partie qui est sur le point de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve aurait l\u2019avantage de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des r\u00e9flexions de l\u2019arbitre sur la preuve de la partie adverse.\nDans la d\u00e9cision Filgueira, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le membre instructeur Groarke fait mention d\u2019une intim\u00e9e qui \u00ab sonderait le terrain \u00bb aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal. Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas qu\u2019une intim\u00e9e tire avantage du fait de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en non-lieu infructueuse en parvenant \u00e0 [Traduction] \u00ab t\u00e2ter le terrain \u00bb aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un tribunal. L\u2019arbitre ne devrait pas fournir de motifs, sinon pour dire si l\u2019on a \u00e9tabli le crit\u00e8re d\u2019une preuve prima facie. Telle est l\u2019approche que j\u2019ai suivie en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\ni. All\u00e9gations et faits particuliers dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en non-lieu\n[23] Je passe maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019application du droit relatif aux requ\u00eates en non-lieu aux all\u00e9gations et aux faits qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le CN soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve qui, si l\u2019on y ajoute foi, est en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tayer une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 son encontre au titre de l\u2019article 7 ou de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP pour le motif de distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Les all\u00e9gations reposent uniquement sur les [Traduction] \u00ab croyances subjectives \u00bb du plaignant. Ce dernier, il va sans dire, plaide le contraire.\n[24] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 avec soin les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, tant de vive voix que documentaire, que le plaignant et ses t\u00e9moins ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Comme je l\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision, j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u2019avis qu\u2019il existait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui, si l\u2019on y ajoutait foi, pourraient engager la responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas de neuf des onze all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement et de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement [6] . Pour deux de ces onze all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, j\u2019ai conclu le contraire et je les ai rejet\u00e9es.\n[25] J\u2019ai effectu\u00e9 l\u2019analyse relative \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en non-lieu en fonction des param\u00e8tres juridiques suivants : donner l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus favorable \u00e0 la preuve du plaignant ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celle de ses t\u00e9moins, et faire abstraction des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Je mettrai l\u2019accent sur les deux all\u00e9gations que j\u2019ai jug\u00e9es irrecevables.\n[26] L\u2019inscription [Traduction] \u00ab je suis gai \u00bb dans le cahier d\u2019exercices sur les r\u00e8gles : M. Croteau all\u00e8gue qu\u2019un superviseur, Don Schenk, a inscrit les mots [Traduction] \u00ab je suis gai \u00bb dans son cahier d\u2019exercices lors d\u2019un cours de recyclage sur les r\u00e8gles qui a eu lieu le 31 mai 2007. Il ne fait aucun doute que ces mots figuraient dans le cahier. Terrence Gallagher, gestionnaire sup\u00e9rieur des Ressources humaines, a fait enqu\u00eate et a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019incident au plaignant dans sa lettre du 12 juin 2007. Il a \u00e9crit que les cahiers sont habituellement [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9utilis\u00e9s d\u2019un cours \u00e0 un autre \u00bb et revus avant d\u2019\u00eatre redistribu\u00e9s. [Traduction] \u00ab Dans ce cas-ci, malheureusement, l\u2019inscription faite dans le cahier est pass\u00e9e inaper\u00e7ue. Et il nous est impossible de d\u00e9terminer qui a inscrit le commentaire dans le document \u00bb. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 content de la recevoir [la lettre] \u00bb. M. Gallagher lui a aussi t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9. Le CN devait prendre des mesures pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019un tel incident ne se reproduise plus jamais.\n[27] M. Croteau croit sans \u00e9quivoque que c\u2019est M. Schenk qui a inscrit ces mots. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait six autres employ\u00e9s dans la classe, mais il ne les connaissait pas. Il avait pass\u00e9 en revue le cahier (d\u2019une longueur de 60 \u00e0 80 pages) avant le cours et n\u2019y avait pas vu les mots en question. Pendant la pause, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 aux toilettes. \u00c0 son retour, seul M. Schenk \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019il avait relev\u00e9 l\u2019inscription en question. Il admet qu\u2019il ne sait pas si quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre est revenu dans la pi\u00e8ce en son absence. Il est devenu visiblement contrari\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une crise de panique. M. Schenk s\u2019en est rendu compte et lui a demand\u00e9 ce qui n\u2019allait pas. Le plaignant a refus\u00e9 de lui remettre le cahier pour qu\u2019il l\u2019examine et a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab je ne suis pas gai et je ne d\u00e9missionne pas \u00bb.\n[28] Lors des audiences M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une [Traduction] \u00ab grave \u00bb crise de panique (\u00e0 un niveau de 9,5 \u00e0 10, selon lui) au cours de l\u2019incident, il avait n\u00e9anmoins un souvenir clair de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 et \u00e9tait s\u00fbr que M. Schenk avait \u00e9crit ces mots. Il a m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il y avait un lien entre l\u2019incident et sa pr\u00e9tendue [Traduction] \u00ab diminution de salaire \u00bb (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019on devrait lui payer la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u2019une journ\u00e9e compl\u00e8te m\u00eame s\u2019il travaillait pour moins que cela). Le plaignant a reconnu plus tard que M. Schenk n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable des [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes de paie \u00bb, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait intervenu dans son r\u00e9gime de retour au travail (le RT), et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9 seulement d\u2019enseigner ce cours sur les r\u00e8gles.\n[29] M. Croteau a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que son fr\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9 par le sida douze ans avant l\u2019incident, que Sarnia est une petite ville et que tous \u00e9taient au courant de la cause du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son fr\u00e8re, qu\u2019il conduisait une Volkswagen Beetle rouge \u2013 qu\u2019il a qualifi\u00e9e de [Traduction] \u00ab voiture peu masculine \u00bb \u2013 et qu\u2019il travaillait de fa\u00e7on [Traduction] \u00ab intermittente \u00bb \u00e0 cause de son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel, il pensait que les gens [Traduction] \u00ab tenaient pour acquis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait gai \u00bb. Il a admis qu\u2019aucun employ\u00e9 du CN n\u2019a jamais fait un commentaire, d\u00e9sobligeant ou autrement, sur le sujet, \u00e0 part l\u2019incident du cahier qui a eu lieu en mai 2007.\n[30] L\u2019avocat du CN soutient que cette all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement est [Traduction] \u00ab absurde [et] bizarre \u00bb et qu\u2019elle repose exclusivement sur la croyance subjective du plaignant. Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si j\u2019en venais \u00e0 conclure que M. Schenk \u00e9tait l\u2019auteur de cette inscription, ce dernier n\u2019est pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9, et le CN peut invoquer l\u2019article 65 (responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui) de la LCDP.\n[31] L\u2019avocat du plaignant r\u00e9pond que le CN n\u2019a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9lev\u00e9 fix\u00e9 pour cette all\u00e9gation soit jug\u00e9e irrecevable et qu\u2019il confond le crit\u00e8re applicable aux requ\u00eates en non-lieu avec le crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique habituellement apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, lequel consiste \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la preuve et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Le plaignant a satisfait au crit\u00e8re peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 que constitue le fait d\u2019\u00e9tablir pour cette all\u00e9gation une preuve prima facie.\n[32] Pour ce qui est de la preuve et de l\u2019argument susmentionn\u00e9s, je conclus que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli, pour cette all\u00e9gation, l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie. L\u2019all\u00e9gation repose uniquement sur la perception et la croyance du plaignant, sans qu\u2019une preuve donne m\u00eame \u00e0 penser que M. Schenk a \u00e9crit cette inscription.\n[33] Subsidiairement, si je n\u2019avais pas rejet\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la requ\u00eate en non\u2011lieu, je l\u2019aurais fait selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion des audiences. Il n\u2019y avait aucune relation ni aucun ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent antagoniste entre le plaignant et M. Schenk. Il n\u2019avait aucune raison de poser ce geste. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, M. Schenk a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par les chim\u00e8res de M. Croteau, il a demand\u00e9 ce qui n\u2019allait pas et il a voulu voir le cahier. La note au dossier de M. Schenk, \u00e9crite quelques jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident, montre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois surpris et pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ainsi que par l\u2019effet que cela avait eu sur M. Croteau. Apr\u00e8s le cours, il avait m\u00eame demand\u00e9 au plaignant s\u2019il voulait qu\u2019il lui appelle un taxi pour rentrer chez lui. Je signale \u00e9galement qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s risqu\u00e9 pour lui d\u2019avoir inscrit ces mots, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Croteau ou les autres employ\u00e9s auraient pu entrer dans la pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 tout moment au cours de la pause.\n[34] De plus, il n\u2019y a aucune responsabilit\u00e9 au titre de la LCDP dans ce cas-ci, car, m\u00eame si M. Schenk avait effectivement \u00e9crit ces mots dans le cahier, la preuve \u00e9tablit que le CN, aux termes du paragraphe 65(2) de la LCDP n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 son \u00ab consentement \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019acte, il a \u00ab pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher \u00bb et, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 \u00ab d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets \u00bb. Le CN dispose de politiques anti-discrimination ou harc\u00e8lement exhaustives. De plus, il devait passer en revue les cahiers relatifs aux r\u00e8gles avant qu\u2019on les r\u00e9utilise dans une autre classe. Enfin, le CN s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur l\u2019affaire quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9. En fait, M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate (non sollicit\u00e9e par lui) que M. Gallagher avait men\u00e9e, ainsi que la r\u00e9ponse (appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et lettre) de ce dernier.\n[35] La non-divulgation des bandes de surveillance : M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que le CN ne lui a pas fourni la totalit\u00e9 des bandes de surveillance d\u2019une enqu\u00eate priv\u00e9e qu\u2019il avait command\u00e9e. La preuve, au cours de la plaidoirie du plaignant, \u00e9tait que le CN lui avait montr\u00e9 les bandes de surveillance de mars 2004 pendant la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate avec le coordonnateur de train Kevin Mau le 11 mars 2004. Le CN avait offert de lui remettre une copie des bandes, mais M. Croteau aurait eu \u00e0 payer des [Traduction] \u00ab frais de copie \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise qui aurait produit les copies. Le CN ne tirait aucun profit des copies qui \u00e9taient faites. M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN offrait de vendre les bandes \u00e0 des [Traduction] \u00ab tiers \u00bb \u00e0 profit. La preuve, dans la plaidoirie du plaignant, montrait aussi qu\u2019on avait dit \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 elle aussi, qu\u2019elle pouvait recevoir une copie des bandes moyennant des frais. M. Croteau a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les bandes, en raison de sa situation financi\u00e8re et [Traduction] \u00ab par principe \u00bb. Il pensait qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb lui remettre les copies gratuitement. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes de surveillance \u00bb faisaient partie des [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes au travail \u00bb qu\u2019il fallait r\u00e9gler pour qu\u2019il puisse se remettre sur pied et revenir au travail. Cela sous-entend que les frais exig\u00e9s pour les copies l\u2019avaient emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir les bandes et de r\u00e9gler les [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes de surveillance \u00bb, lesquels l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le lieu de travail. Je rejette cet argument.\n[36] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve fournie sur cette all\u00e9gation dans la plaidoirie du plaignant, dans le cadre de l\u2019examen limit\u00e9 pour la requ\u00eate en non-lieu, et en lui attribuant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus favorable qui soit sans tomber dans l\u2019absurdit\u00e9, je ne puis laisser cette all\u00e9gation d\u00e9passer le stade de la requ\u00eate en non-lieu. Je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun lien entre la preuve relative \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation et le harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP.\n[37] Apr\u00e8s avoir rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en non-lieu concernant neuf des onze all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement ainsi que l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable (le manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement), j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019il souhaitait pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Il va sans dire que Me McFadden a r\u00e9pondu que oui, et j\u2019ai ensuite entendu les t\u00e9moins du CN ainsi que la br\u00e8ve contre-preuve du plaignant. Voici donc mes motifs pour rejeter la plainte sur le fond apr\u00e8s une audition compl\u00e8te, en soumettant les t\u00e9moins et leurs t\u00e9moignages, la preuve documentaire, etc., \u00e0 l\u2019examen auquel un juge proc\u00e8de habituellement apr\u00e8s cette audition \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, y compris les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[38] Le fardeau initial d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP incombe au plaignant ou \u00e0 la Commission : Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28. Une fois cette preuve \u00e9tablie, il revient alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de justifier ou d\u2019expliquer la pratique ou l\u2019acte discriminatoire : Canada (P.G.) c. Lambie, [1996] A.C.F. no 1695, au paragraphe 16. L\u2019explication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas jouer un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination : Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 22.\n[39] Un autre aspect pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le principe juridique suivant : \u00ab il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la discrimination soient le seul motif de la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un des facteurs qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur \u00bb : Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) (2001), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/443 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 69.\n[40] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est difficile de prouver une all\u00e9gation de discrimination par preuve directe. La discrimination s\u2019exerce souvent de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s subtile et cach\u00e9e. La discrimination flagrante est rare : Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada No 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 5038. Il incombe plut\u00f4t au Tribunal de prendre en compte la totalit\u00e9 des circonstances en vue de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe ce qu\u2019on a appel\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Basi, de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\n[41] Dans les affaires de discrimination, la norme de preuve est la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination lorsque la preuve rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible : Premakumar c. Air Canada (No 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 81.\n[42] Une partie de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comporte des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement. Aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire \u00ab s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu \u00bb. Bien que le mot \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb ne soit pas d\u00e9fini dans la LCDP, la jurisprudence des tribunaux judiciaires et des droits de la personne ont \u00e9tabli une d\u00e9finition admise : il s\u2019agit de n\u2019importe quel mot ou comportement qui est importun ou qui devrait \u00eatre connu comme tel (selon une norme objective) [7] sur le fondement d\u2019un motif de distinction illicite. Bien que la jurisprudence requiert en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019actes r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs ou persistants, les tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs consid\u00e8rent \u00e9galement qu\u2019un fait unique et s\u00e9rieux suffit pour constituer du \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb [8] . Si le crit\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait que la croyance subjective et personnelle des plaignants, les intim\u00e9s auraient bien de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien leur d\u00e9fense.\n[43] \u00c9tablir une d\u00e9finition juridique pratique du \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb en dehors du cadre du harc\u00e8lement sexuel est une t\u00e2che complexe, car la seconde version du crit\u00e8re est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en premier. La majeure partie de la jurisprudence traite du harc\u00e8lement sexuel ou racial. Cela dit, il y a bien s\u00fbr un \u00e9l\u00e9ment commun. Quand on a affaire \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de [Traduction] \u00ab harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience \u00bb, il est important de reconna\u00eetre que cela d\u00e9note plus que le simple fait d\u2019\u00eatre mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise ou d\u2019\u00eatre offusqu\u00e9 lors des entretiens d\u00e9licats, parfois difficiles, entre la direction et les employ\u00e9s. Par exemple, un employeur a le droit de g\u00e9rer ses employ\u00e9s ainsi que les questions qui se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de son entreprise, comme le fait d\u2019\u00e9tablir, de surveiller et de faire appliquer des r\u00e8gles dans le lieu de travail. La cl\u00e9 est d\u2019examiner si la conduite a viol\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 (p. ex., \u00e0 cause d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9nigrant ou d\u00e9gradant de l\u2019employeur qui est li\u00e9 au motif de la d\u00e9ficience) d\u2019un point de vue objectif, de sorte que cette conduite a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un milieu de travail hostile ou malsain [9] . Dans la d\u00e9cision Day c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 43, le membre instructeur Jensen a \u00e9crit, au paragraphe 184 :\nVII. Les motifs de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond : Introduction\nVIII. Le droit applicable\nA. Le harc\u00e8lement\nLa jurisprudence sur le harc\u00e8lement est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019id\u00e9e que la conduite \u00e0 l\u2019examen est, par sa nature, \u00e9trang\u00e8re aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes et aux objectifs \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019employeur. Les remarques d\u00e9sobligeantes ou les remises en question constantes et inutiles de la d\u00e9ficience qui sont humiliantes et vexatoires sont des exemples de conduites jug\u00e9es \u00e9trang\u00e8res aux activit\u00e9s l\u00e9gitimes dans un milieu de travail.\nB. L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement\n[44] J\u2019ai pris en consid\u00e9ration les principes juridiques g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments jurisprudentiels qui suivent (il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une liste exhaustive) :\n(1) l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement est une obligation et une d\u00e9marche multipartite qui mettent en cause : l\u2019employeur, l\u2019employ\u00e9 et, s\u2019il y a lieu, l\u2019agent de n\u00e9gociation. J\u2019ai \u00e9crit dans cette d\u00e9cision ainsi que dans d\u2019autres que le processus devrait ressembler \u00e0 un dialogue, et non \u00e0 un monologue : Jeffrey c. Dofasco Inc., 2004 HRTO 5, conf. par (2007), 230 OAC 96 (C. div.). L\u2019employ\u00e9 peut faire des suggestions quant \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, mais il doit accepter une solution raisonnable (\u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019\u00eatre parfaite) que l\u2019employeur propose et qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 ses besoins. Les limites sont celles de la contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [10] , ou ce que l\u2019on appelle par synonymie l\u2019\u00ab accommodement raisonnable \u00bb : Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970. L\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement n\u2019est ni absolue ni illimit\u00e9e : Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, au paragraphe 38 ;\n(2) il est aussi mentionn\u00e9, dans Renaud, que les plaignants ont le devoir de faciliter le processus d\u2019accommodement. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Environnement), 2003 CAF 133, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que, lorsque l\u2019employeur propose un accommodement raisonnable, le plaignant ne peut pas insister sur l\u2019accommodement subsidiaire qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, m\u00eame si la mesure subsidiaire ne cr\u00e9e pas de contrainte excessive ;\n(3) l\u2019objectif est de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que ce dernier puisse accomplir les t\u00e2ches essentielles de son emploi. \u00c0 cette fin, il faudrait que les employeurs soient [Traduction] \u00ab innovateurs tout en \u00e9tant pratiques \u00bb et fassent preuve d\u2019imagination au moment d\u2019examiner la meilleure fa\u00e7on d\u2019atteindre cet objectif dans chaque cas : Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Comm.) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), au paragraphe 64;\n(4) un employeur n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019offrir un travail improductif de valeur nulle et n\u2019a pas \u00e0 changer les conditions de travail de mani\u00e8re fondamentale. \u00ab [I]l a cependant l\u2019obligation d\u2019am\u00e9nager, si cela ne lui cause pas une contrainte excessive, le poste de travail ou les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour lui permettre de fournir sa prestation de travail \u00bb : Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et al., 2008 CSC 43, aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18;\n(5) \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans le processus d\u2019accommodement ne se limite pas \u00e0 un examen juste de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 accomplir ses t\u00e2ches. La notion d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 comprend plut\u00f4t toutes les facettes du processus d\u2019accommodement [\u2026] dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne cause aucune contrainte excessive \u00bb.

L\u2019affaire Cruden\n[45] Cette affaire rev\u00eat une importance cl\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire qui m\u2019est soumise. Dans la d\u00e9cision Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Cruden et al., 2013 CF 520 (appel r\u00e9cemment plaid\u00e9), le juge Zinn a annul\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal : Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2011 TCDP 13. Mme Cruden avait port\u00e9 plainte contre les parties pour lui avoir refus\u00e9 une affectation en Afghanistan en partie \u00e0 cause d\u2019une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale qui concluait qu\u2019\u00e0 cause du diab\u00e8te de type I dont elle souffrait, elle \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement inapte pour cette affectation.\n[46] M\u00eame si le Tribunal a conclu que le fait de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de Mme Cruden en Afghanistan aurait occasionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ACDI une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb, il a n\u00e9anmoins confirm\u00e9 ses plaintes contre l\u2019ACDI et Sant\u00e9 Canada \u00ab par suite de sa conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019ACDI ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas bien acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation \u201cproc\u00e9durale\u201d quant \u00e0 la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00bb. En d\u2019autres termes, de l\u2019avis du Tribunal, dans l\u2019exigence de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement que pr\u00e9voit la LCDP il existe un \u00e9l\u00e9ment proc\u00e9dural distinct qui peut \u00eatre viol\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante et donner lieu \u00e0 des mesures de r\u00e9paration, \u00ab m\u00eame lorsque [l\u2019]employeur n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019accommodement sans contrainte excessive \u00bb. Le juge Zinn n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP et a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[47] Comme l\u2019avocat du CN, Me McFadden, le fait remarquer avec raison, il existe parmi les tribunaux une certaine divergence quant aux fa\u00e7ons d\u2019aborder cette question (la d\u00e9cision du juge Zinn dans l\u2019affaire qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, ainsi que celle de la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire ADGA Group Consultants Inc. c. Lane et al., 91 O.R. (3d) 649); par des tribunaux des droits de la personne (il a cit\u00e9 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions de la Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne, dont Lane et une du pr\u00e9sent Tribunal datant d\u2019avant l\u2019affaire Cruden \u2013 Day c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 43); ainsi que par des arbitres du travail. L\u2019une des fa\u00e7ons consiste \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour \u00ab pr\u00e9judice moral \u00bb ou des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux pour manquements proc\u00e9duraux \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, et ce, m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9, au fond, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du plaignant sans s\u2019imposer de contraintes excessives. L\u2019autre fa\u00e7on, \u00e9tablie par le juge Zinn dans la d\u00e9cision Cruden, est de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019instruction une fois qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de r\u00e9pondre dans une large mesure aux besoins du plaignant sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive.\n[48] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision tr\u00e8s importante, maintenant en appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et dont les ramifications s\u2019\u00e9tendent bien au-del\u00e0 de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 contraignant et pr\u00e9sent du droit, et je le suivrai et l\u2019appliquerai en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[49] Me Bolter, l\u2019avocat du plaignant, soutient que la d\u00e9cision Cruden \u00e9taye, notamment, la th\u00e8se selon laquelle il n\u2019existe aucun droit proc\u00e9dural distinct apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a satisfait au crit\u00e8re de la contrainte excessive. Cependant, la \u00ab proc\u00e9dure \u00bb est quand m\u00eame importante pour un certain nombre de raisons. Au paragraphe 69, le juge Zinn a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nAu paragraphe 66 de Meiorin [un arr\u00eat cl\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui porte sur la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019EPJ et de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement] [\u2026], la Cour supr\u00eame d\u00e9clare simplement qu\u2019une cour de justice ou un tribunal administratif peut examiner la proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e dans le cadre du processus d\u2019accommodement comme outil pratique qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir si un employeur a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver \u2013 selon la preuve au dossier \u2013 l\u2019existence d\u2019une contrainte excessive : [il cite ensuite le passage de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada]. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nIl poursuit en ajoutant ce qui suit au paragraphe 70 :\nCela ne veut pas dire que la proc\u00e9dure utilis\u00e9e par un employeur lorsqu\u2019il examine la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u2019a jamais d\u2019importance; en fait, dans la pratique, si un employeur n\u2019a effectu\u00e9 aucune analyse sur la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles ou n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder de telles mesures lors de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande en ce sens par un employ\u00e9, il lui sera probablement tr\u00e8s difficile de convaincre un tribunal, \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas pu fournir de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 sans subir une contrainte excessive [\u2026] C\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019effet bien r\u00e9el et tr\u00e8s concret du fait que le fardeau de la preuve en ce qui concerne l\u2019existence d\u2019EPJ incombe \u00e0 l\u2019employeur. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nAutrement dit, comme le soutient l\u2019avocat du CN, un employeur peut ne rien faire et [Traduction] \u00ab avoir vu juste \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit sans nul doute d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie juridique dangereuse, mais il est loisible \u00e0 un employeur d\u2019y recourir, selon la d\u00e9cision Cruden.\n[50] L\u2019exception importante \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de au sujet d\u2019une obligation d\u2019accommodement proc\u00e9durale distincte a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le juge Zinn, au paragraphe 79 :\n[\u2026] la LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019acte discriminatoire ind\u00e9pendant et distinct qui repose uniquement sur le processus relatif \u00e0 l\u2019octroi de mesures d\u2019accommodement ou la fa\u00e7on dont une politique ou une directive est appliqu\u00e9e dans le cadre du processus, sauf bien s\u00fbr si le processus lui-m\u00eame ou l\u2019application de la politique ou de la directive sont mis en \u0153uvre de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9ellement discriminatoire.

De plus, je d\u00e9ciderai si l\u2019exception dont traite le juge Zinn au paragraphe 79 s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi.\n[52] En tant qu\u2019arbitre, je suis conscient que la salle d\u2019audience est un milieu artificiel o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moins r\u00e9agissent de mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re et diff\u00e9rente aux tensions que cr\u00e9e le fait de t\u00e9moigner, etc. C\u2019est donc dire que leur comportement n\u2019est qu\u2019un indice de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 parmi d\u2019autres. Ce qui est le plus important, c\u2019est la teneur de leur t\u00e9moignage et ce qu\u2019ils ont fait, dit et \u00e9crit (car les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire sont importants eux aussi) dans le cadre des faits pass\u00e9s qui constituent le fondement du sujet de la plainte qui m\u2019est soumise, ainsi que la mani\u00e8re dont leur t\u00e9moignage se compare \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Je tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 ajouter que le fait de trouver qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin est cr\u00e9dible ou non ne veut pas dire que tout ce qu\u2019il dit ou \u00e9crit est accept\u00e9 ou rejet\u00e9. J\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de donner un sens \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de tirer des conclusions de fait sur ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9.\n[53] En ce qui concerne ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai fait de mon mieux pour \u00e9tablir si la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du r\u00e9cit du plaignant (et du CN) est [Traduction] \u00ab conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, suivant laquelle une personne inform\u00e9e et dot\u00e9e de sens pratique reconna\u00eetrait volontiers comme raisonnable \u00e0 cet endroit et dans ces conditions \u00bb (Farnya c. Chorny, [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354, \u00e0 la page 357 (B.C.C.A.)).\n[54] Comme dans bien des affaires, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 a jou\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un r\u00f4le important. Dans mes motifs, je fais des commentaires sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de divers t\u00e9moins. Ici plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, je souhaite commenter principalement (mais non exclusivement) la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin le plus important aux audiences : le plaignant. C\u2019est ce dernier qui a introduit la pr\u00e9sente instance (de pair avec d\u2019autres proc\u00e9dures internes\/externes), en se basant sur une multitude de faits qui ont eu lieu au fil d\u2019une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. C\u2019est lui qui a le fardeau de preuve prima facie initial d\u2019\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations.\n[55] La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute pendant toute la dur\u00e9e des audiences, tant en ce qui concerne ce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre que ce qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit dans des courriels et des lettres, le tout juxtapos\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins. Je conclus que, dans bien des cas, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 digne de foi et que son t\u00e9moignage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fiable. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre pendant plusieurs jours. Le contenu d\u2019un grand nombre de ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9tait invraisemblable. Il a r\u00e9pondu souvent de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vasive aux questions que posait l\u2019avocat du CN. M. Croteau n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu initialement \u00e0 de nombreuses questions; il a parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de les reposer \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, surtout en contre-interrogatoire. Souvent, il n\u2019a donn\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse claire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que j\u2019ai reformul\u00e9 la question de l\u2019avocat. Lors des audiences, Me McFadden a comment\u00e9 ce fait. Il lui est parfois arriv\u00e9 de se contredire en l\u2019espace de quelques minutes, et il s\u2019est certainement contredit lors du contre-interrogatoire, par rapport \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il avait dit dans l\u2019interrogatoire principal. La langue n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un probl\u00e8me, car M. Croteau s\u2019exprime couramment en anglais, tant de vive voix que par \u00e9crit. Je ne crois pas que ses troubles li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 posaient probl\u00e8me non plus. Il a sembl\u00e9 comprendre les questions. Quand il lui arrivait de subir une crise de panique, lui ou moi d\u00e9cidions de faire une pause au cours des d\u00e9bats, et il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de reprendre l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on s\u2019\u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9.\n[56] En ce qui concerne les commentaires qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je tiens \u00e0 souligner que je ne crois pas que M. Croteau induisait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment en erreur le Tribunal. Je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il croit v\u00e9ritablement ce sur quoi il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Selon son point de vue et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il croit, le CN l\u2019a harcel\u00e9, le CN n\u2019a pas pris de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa d\u00e9ficience et ne lui a pas permis de retourner au travail, et lui, en revanche, a pris part sans r\u00e9serve et de bonne foi au processus de retour au travail.\n[57] J\u2019exposerai maintenant quelques-uns des exemples les plus frappants d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont une incidence sur sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et sur la fiabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage. Il est important de comprendre que, comme l\u2019a dit Me McFadden, [Traduction] \u00ab le si\u00e8ge de l\u2019irr\u00e9alisme \u00bb commence par la courte conversation du 19 novembre 2003 entre M. Croteau et KS, l\u2019agente de gestion des risques (l\u2019AGR) : [Traduction] \u00ab Tout ce qui lui est arriv\u00e9 par la suite, c\u2019est parce que [KS] \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re contre lui parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas fait \u00e9tat de son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel au cours de cette conversation de deux ou trois minutes \u00bb. C\u2019est l\u00e0 la gen\u00e8se de ses [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb, et cela, du fait de la mani\u00e8re subjective dont il a per\u00e7u KS (et le surintendant TC) ainsi que le CN en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, se r\u00e9percute sur sa cause tout enti\u00e8re. Parfois, M. Croteau a sembl\u00e9 faire preuve de parano\u00efa et a fait une description du CN qui ressemblait presque \u00e0 un complot \u2013 des membres du personnel, nomm\u00e9s et non nomm\u00e9s, qui essayaient de [Traduction] \u00ab ruiner \u00bb sa vie. Cela incluait le syndicat qui l\u2019avait soutenu au d\u00e9part et sur lequel il comptait pour communiquer avec le CN, en agissant notamment comme interm\u00e9diaire pour transmettre des renseignements et des documents. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son alli\u00e9 de nagu\u00e8re, le syndicat, \u00e9tait de connivence avec le CN contre lui.\n[58] Les exemples les plus frappants de la parano\u00efa ou de la peur que KS suscitait chez lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s quand il a fait les d\u00e9clarations suivantes qui ont eu l\u2019effet d\u2019une bombe lors de son t\u00e9moignage :\nIX. Les conclusions relatives \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9\nA. Le plaignant\n(1) depuis 2004, il pense tous les jours (cinq \u00e0 six fois par jour) que KS [Traduction] \u00ab pourrait enlever [ses deux fils] ou leur faire du mal \u00bb. Et ce, m\u00eame si KS, selon ses dires, a quitt\u00e9 Sarnia pour Oakville en avril 2004 et, plus tard, le CN en 2007, qu\u2019il n\u2019a plus eu de contacts avec elle au CN depuis mai 2004, qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas vue depuis son audience d\u2019arbitrage devant le Bureau d\u2019arbitrage et de m\u00e9diation des chemins de fer du Canada (le BAMCFC) en juillet 2008, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais menac\u00e9 de faire du mal \u00e0 lui ou \u00e0 sa famille ;\n(2) il craint, encore maintenant, d\u2019aller \u00e0 Toronto, car KS pourrait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 son domicile, \u00e0 Sarnia, en son absence, se faisant passer pour une vendeuse d\u2019assurances, pour faire du mal \u00e0 sa famille. Il a fait remarquer que son \u00e9pouse ignore de quoi KS a l\u2019air ;\n(3) encore aujourd\u2019hui, ses sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 se d\u00e9clenchent chaque fois qu\u2019il rencontre quelqu\u2019un qui a les m\u00eames nom et pr\u00e9nom que KS, ou une femme aux cheveux blonds. Je signale qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience quand KS a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ;\n(4) il pense souvent \u00e0 KS lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019approche de son domicile ou qu\u2019il le quitte.\n[59] Si j\u2019ai dit ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, ce n\u2019est pas pour d\u00e9nigrer ou minimiser les sentiments de M. Croteau. Ce dernier craint profond\u00e9ment KS, encore aujourd\u2019hui et, par extension, le CN en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Nous verrons cela plus tard au moment d\u2019analyser s\u2019il est r\u00e9aliste de penser que M. Croteau pourrait un jour retourner travailler au CN. M. AB a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les craintes susmentionn\u00e9es pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019un trouble de stress post\u2011traumatique (le TSPT), mais qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas le signe d\u2019un trouble d\u00e9lirant.\n[60] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lors de la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019il a eue avec Kevin Mau et ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux le 11 mai 2004, KS (qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la r\u00e9union) l\u2019a pouss\u00e9 dans le couloir, avec une certaine vigueur. KS a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais produit. M. Mau n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et le plaignant n\u2019a pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner le repr\u00e9sentant syndical qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, M. Scarrow. Selon les t\u00e9moignages que j\u2019ai entendus, M. Scarrow est un dirigeant syndical d\u2019une grande exp\u00e9rience, qui [Traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas froid aux yeux \u00bb. Si KS avait bouscul\u00e9 le plaignant de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite, M. Scarrow ou d\u2019autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes seraient intervenus. Ce pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 incident n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9 par le syndicat. Ce dernier a fait des observations sur des questions moins s\u00e9rieuses, mais pas sur celle\u2011l\u00e0. Je ne crois pas que KS a bouscul\u00e9 M. Croteau.\n[61] Leslie Croteau est l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant. J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moin digne de foi. Elle a admis que ce qu\u2019elle savait au sujet de la plupart des faits ayant eu lieu au CN d\u00e9coulait de ce que son \u00e9poux lui avait dit. Cependant, elle a bel et bien assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 1er mars 2005, en compagnie du gestionnaire des Ressources humaines Terrence Gallagher, de son \u00e9poux et du syndicat. Elle a \u00e9galement eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec KS le 23 avril 2004. Nous traiterons plus loin, dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[62] Mme Croteau a aussi parl\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on dont les faits qui avaient eu lieu avaient transform\u00e9 son \u00e9poux, en tant que personne, \u00e9poux et p\u00e8re. Elle a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 de l\u2019effet qu\u2019avait eu le fait de d\u00e9couvrir qu\u2019on avait surveill\u00e9 son \u00e9poux en mars et en avril 2004, une surveillance qui avait \u00e9galement port\u00e9 sur elle et leurs deux enfants.\n[63] Cheryl Hames est la belle-s\u0153ur du plaignant. Elle a parl\u00e9 d\u2019une br\u00e8ve conversation qu\u2019elle aussi avait eue avec KS le 23 avril 2004. Je conclus qu\u2019elle aussi a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin digne de foi.\n[64] Le CN a produit sept t\u00e9moins :\nB. Leslie Croteau et Cheryl Hames\nC. Les t\u00e9moins du CN\n(5) KS \u2013 anciennement au service du CN \u00e0 des postes diff\u00e9rents, mais \u00e0 titre d\u2019AGR lors des incidents en 2003 et en 2004;\n(6) Vanessa Paquet \u2013 actuellement au service du CN, elle a exerc\u00e9 les fonctions de coordonnatrice des retours au travail et d\u2019AGR entre 2004 et 2008\n(7) Terrence Gallagher \u2013 actuellement au service du CN, et gestionnaire des Ressources humaines s\u2019\u00e9tant occup\u00e9 de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne de M. Croteau ainsi que des questions de retour au travail;\n(8) Derrick Colasimone \u2013 occupe actuellement un poste sup\u00e9rieur : directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division \u00ab Michigan \u00bb du CN (qui comprend Sarnia);\n(9) Suzanne Fusco \u2013 actuellement agente des relations avec les employ\u00e9s au CN, et a travaill\u00e9 aux Ressources humaines entre 2004 et 2008;\n(10) Kathy Smolynec \u2013 cadre sup\u00e9rieure, au Service de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail (SST);\n(11) Laura Waller \u2013 coordonnatrice des retours au travail.\n[65] Je conclus que les t\u00e9moins du CN \u00e9taient dignes de foi et que leurs t\u00e9moignages g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fiables. Ils ont r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re succincte aux questions, et leur t\u00e9moignage de vive voix concordait de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avec la preuve documentaire produite, ainsi qu\u2019avec la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Certains de ces t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s francs, notamment MM. Gallagher et Colasimone. J\u2019analyserai leur t\u00e9moignage sous les diverses rubriques ult\u00e9rieures qui figurent dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[66] Le plaignant a consult\u00e9 M. AB, un psychologue d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, au cours de s\u00e9ances d\u2019une dur\u00e9e totale approximative de 150 heures, depuis le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2004. Il ne fait aucun doute que, parmi tous les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qui ont vu M. Croteau, c\u2019est M. AB qui a entretenu avec lui la relation la plus longue et la plus approfondie.\n[67] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 que M. AB soit reconnu comme qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une preuve d\u2019expert sur les aspects suivants : [Traduction] \u00ab trouble de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9; TSPT; trouble d\u2019adaptation; crises de panique et effets de ces derni\u00e8res sur des individus et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Croteau; causes de ces troubles; capacit\u00e9 des personnes souffrant d\u2019un TSPT \u00e0 revenir au travail de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Croteau; les mesures \u00e0 prendre pour que le plaignant puisse retourner au travail; [et] commentaires sur les EMI du Dr Chad. \u00bb\n[68] L\u2019avocat du CN s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que M. AB soit qualifi\u00e9 comme expert. Il ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que ce dernier t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 titre de psychologue soignant du plaignant, mais il a fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait [Traduction] \u00ab h\u00e9siter \u00e0 se fier aux choses qu\u2019il a dites \u00bb. Les motifs du CN \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard sont les suivants :\nX. M. AB et la preuve d\u2019expert qu\u2019il a produite\n[Traduction]\n(1) le diagnostic que M. [AB] a pos\u00e9 au sujet de M. Croteau est, de son propre aveu, en contradiction avec les exigences du DSM\u2011IV [11] et avec l\u2019opinion pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante dans la profession de la psychiatrie\/psychologie (du moins en ce qui concerne le trouble de stress post-traumatique);\n(2) la relation professionnelle qu\u2019il entretient avec M. Croteau a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les bornes et s\u2019est mu\u00e9e en un r\u00f4le de d\u00e9fense sans r\u00e9serve en faveur de M. Croteau, et il n\u2019a pas l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 que les arbitres exigent des sp\u00e9cialistes en m\u00e9decine;\n(3) dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. [AB] a refus\u00e9 de changer d\u2019avis ou d\u2019opinion, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre rendu compte que les faits sur lesquels reposaient au d\u00e9part son opinion \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents de ce qu\u2019il avait compris.\n[69] Compte tenu des deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me arguments qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je refuse de reconna\u00eetre que M. AB est qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une preuve d\u2019expert sur les questions demand\u00e9es. Cependant, je prendrai en consid\u00e9ration son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 titre de psychologue soignant de M. Croteau, et je lui accorderai le poids qui convient.\n[70] Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue l\u2019arr\u00eat cl\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui porte sur la nature et la recevabilit\u00e9 des preuves d\u2019expert : R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9 \u2013 de m\u00eame que les quatre crit\u00e8res qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. D\u00e9tail int\u00e9ressant, les crit\u00e8res n\u2019incluent pas une exigence distincte d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance et d\u2019impartialit\u00e9. Cependant, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019inf\u00e8rent les tribunaux canadiens : voir, par exemple, R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, au paragraphe 87, note de bas de page no 8, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel rejet\u00e9e par [2010] C.S.C.R. no 125; ainsi qu\u2019Es-Sayyid c. Canada (S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et Protection civile), 2012 CAF 59, au paragraphe 43, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel rejet\u00e9e par [2012] C.S.C.R. no 116.\n[71] Il ne fait aucun doute, selon moi, que M. AB est un psychologue bien inform\u00e9, qui s\u2019exprime clairement. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9crits savants et d\u2019expos\u00e9s pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le cadre de conf\u00e9rences qui, habituellement, figurent dans le curriculum vit\u00e6 d\u2019un expert, cela ne m\u2019a pas pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 pour ce qui \u00e9tait de son aptitude \u00e0 fournir une preuve d\u2019expert sur les questions demand\u00e9es. Il a une vaste exp\u00e9rience de ces derni\u00e8res. Il exerce \u00e0 titre priv\u00e9 depuis 2000 et il a \u00e9galement travaill\u00e9 dans un h\u00f4pital. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9 plus d\u2019un millier d\u2019\u00e9valuations, principalement dans le contexte des accidents de la route, et au moins le tiers de ces \u00e9valuations avaient trait \u00e0 des questions de retour au travail. Une bonne partie de son travail lui vient de compagnies d\u2019assurances et de la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voit habituellement pas ses clients apr\u00e8s un EMI.\n[72] Les points qui me pr\u00e9occupent sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments 2 et 3 des observations de l\u2019avocat du CN. Je conclus effectivement que M. AB a \u00ab d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les limites \u00bb de sa profession et s\u2019est mis dans la peau d\u2019un d\u00e9fenseur, perdant ainsi le degr\u00e9 d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 que l\u2019on exige d\u2019un expert. Peut-\u00eatre que c\u2019\u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable, voire souhaitable, d\u2019un point de vue clinique. En contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. AB a convenu que, pour nouer la relation avec un patient \u2013 et avec M. Croteau en particulier \u2013, il est important que ce dernier croie que l\u2019on ajoute foi \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il dit. M. AB a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans la gu\u00e9rison de M. Croteau, comme ce dernier l\u2019a attest\u00e9.\n[73] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il esp\u00e8re un jour \u00eatre un [Traduction] \u00ab ami \u00bb de M. AB, le jour o\u00f9 il n\u2019aura plus besoin de son aide professionnelle. Notamment, \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008 qui avait pour but de discuter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement avec Mme Fusco, M. Schenk, M. Croteau et M. AB, ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme [Traduction] \u00ab l\u2019ami \u00bb de M. Croteau, qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0 pour l\u2019aider. Cela, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que M. AB, depuis 2004, soignait M. Croteau et que ses honoraires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s au d\u00e9part par l\u2019assureur et ensuite par le CN. Non seulement M. Croteau l\u2019a-t-il pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme son [Traduction] \u00ab ami \u00bb, mais pas une seule fois a-t-il dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait son psychologue; M. AB ne l\u2019a toutefois pas corrig\u00e9 et a omis de faire \u00e9tat du r\u00f4le professionnel qu\u2019il jouait.\n[74] Il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. AB donne l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre plus un d\u00e9fenseur qu\u2019un expert. Par exemple, lors de son contre-interrogatoire sur la perception qu\u2019avait M. Croteau du CN et du conflit au travail, quand on l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 admettre qu\u2019il arrive parfois que les deux parties soient \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer, il a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative. Cependant, quand on lui a demand\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Est-il possible que [M. Croteau] se trompe, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en partie ou totalement \u00e0 bl\u00e2mer? \u00bb, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Oui, c\u2019est possible en th\u00e9orie, mais non probable, pour l\u2019avoir connu pendant plus de 100 heures, en tant qu\u2019observateur qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sur place, il ne semblait pas avoir jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans les incidents [\u2026] et on [ne devrait pas] le bl\u00e2mer pour cela. \u00bb\n[75] Je suis d\u2019accord aussi avec l\u2019avocat du CN pour dire qu\u2019il y a eu plusieurs exemples dans lesquels M. AB a refus\u00e9 de changer son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il avait de la conduite du plaignant, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019on lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de solides preuves contraires. Me McFadden soutient qu\u2019aux yeux de M. AB, [Traduction] \u00ab aucun fait contraire n\u2019importe \u00bb quand il est question de M. Croteau, ce qui d\u00e9note donc l\u2019absence d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et de neutralit\u00e9 dont doit faire preuve un expert qui t\u00e9moigne devant un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif. L\u2019avocat a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. AB du fait que son client lui avait cach\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on moins qu\u2019honn\u00eate, des renseignements cl\u00e9s en avril 2008. \u00c0 la suite du troisi\u00e8me EMI, et des recommandations connexes, du Dr Chad, le CN a propos\u00e9 un r\u00e9gime de travail de transition (le RTT), qui consistait \u00e0 observer le travail du surveillant de nuit. M. Croteau s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9, disant, notamment, que ce qui l\u2019inqui\u00e9tait c\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019il observerait un surveillant diff\u00e9rent dans chaque quart de travail et que ces personnes seraient au courant de renseignements confidentiels sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Mme Paquet a renvoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 M. Croteau le 25 avril 2008, disant que ce ne serait pas le cas. Mais M. Croteau a omis de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler ce renseignement important \u00e0 M. AB quand ils se sont rencontr\u00e9s. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. AB, le 30 avril 2008, d\u2019\u00e9crire au CN une lettre r\u00e9it\u00e9rant ses inqui\u00e9tudes initiales.\n[76] Pour ce qui est de la question qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, lors du contre-interrogatoire, Me McFadden a dit \u00e0 M. AB que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab malhonn\u00eate \u00bb avec lui. M. AB a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Je ne peux pas expliquer pourquoi il m\u2019a dit cela \u00bb. Me McFadden lui a ensuite demand\u00e9 s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inquiet du fait que M. Croteau le prenne [Traduction] \u00ab pour dupe \u00bb. Le t\u00e9moin a fait une pause et a finalement r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Oui, il y a manifestement l\u00e0 une contradiction et je ne peux pas l\u2019expliquer \u00bb. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019on [Traduction] \u00ab se servait de lui \u00bb, ce \u00e0 quoi le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne se souciait pas du fait d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab de mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re parce que je le connais depuis plus de huit ans. Je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il doit y avoir une explication quelconque. \u00bb Me McFadden a alors dit au t\u00e9moin que ce ne serait pas [Traduction] \u00ab hautement \u00e9thique \u00bb de la part de M. Croteau de se servir de M. AB [Traduction] \u00ab pour propager une non-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 propos du CN. M. AB a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab S\u2019il a fait cela, oui, cela me pr\u00e9occuperait \u00bb. Il a ensuite sembl\u00e9 \u00e9vasif et nerveux et a parl\u00e9 de cette question d\u2019une mani\u00e8re abstraite, presque philosophique, dans le contexte d\u2019une [Traduction] \u00ab relation professionnelle \u00bb dans le cadre de laquelle il n\u2019avait aucune raison de douter de cette personne. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il accordait [Traduction] \u00ab aux gens le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute. Il doit y avoir une explication dans ce cas-ci [\u2026] J\u2019ignore ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, mais je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019il existe une explication quelconque \u00bb.\n[77] De plus, il ressort une impression de manque d\u2019objectivit\u00e9 et un ton de d\u00e9fense du sommaire, dat\u00e9 du 4 novembre 2011, que M. AB a fait de son travail avec le plaignant. \u00c0 la page 4, il emploie des phrases comme [Traduction] \u00ab quand le programme [de RT] a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au rancart \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab quand le CN a ferm\u00e9 la porte pour ce qui est du plan [de RT] \u00bb. Aussi, \u00e0 la page 2, il a dit de M. Croteau qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait lanc\u00e9 dans [Traduction] \u00ab une lutte pour obtenir justice \u00bb par rapport au CN [Traduction] \u00ab au cours des sept derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es \u00bb. \u00c0 la page 5, il conclut que son client aurait eu gain de cause [Traduction] \u00ab si on lui avait donn\u00e9 seulement une bonne chance de r\u00e9ussir \u00bb. Dans son t\u00e9moignage et dans sa lettre, M. AB a fait d\u2019autres r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 [Traduction] \u00ab des mesures de soutien appropri\u00e9es \u00bb et \u00e0 [Traduction] \u00ab un soutien appropri\u00e9 \u00bb. Tous ces commentaires am\u00e8neraient quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 penser que M. AB d\u00e9fendait la cause de M. Croteau et en attribuait la faute au CN ou l\u2019en bl\u00e2mait.\n[78] Je signale aussi la perception d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat financier; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le plaignant demande dans le cas pr\u00e9sent une indemnisation pour les s\u00e9ances pass\u00e9es impay\u00e9es et ult\u00e9rieures avec M. AB. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. AB cherchait seulement \u00e0 obtenir un paiement pour les s\u00e9ances pass\u00e9es s\u2019il recevait pour elles une indemnisation par suite d\u2019une ordonnance rendue dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[79] Au vu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que M. AB n\u2019a pas satisfait aux exigences relatives aux t\u00e9moins experts. Cela \u00e9tant, je n\u2019ai pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert. Cependant, celui qu\u2019il a fait en tant que psychologue soignant de M. Croteau, y compris le diagnostic pos\u00e9 et le traitement de ce dernier, l\u2019interaction du psychologue avec le CN dans des r\u00e9unions, les conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, les lettres, etc., au sujet de M. Croteau, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront de la consid\u00e9ration et du poids qui conviennent.\n[80] Je traiterai maintenant des neuf all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement du plaignant qui restent, ainsi que des questions qui en d\u00e9coulent, au regard de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Me Bolter dans sa plaidoirie, et comme l\u2019illustrent le t\u00e9moignage et les documents du plaignant, et cela est compr\u00e9hensible, M. Croteau a parfois employ\u00e9 le mot \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb (dans le sens ordinaire et g\u00e9n\u00e9rique qu\u2019un profane emploierait) comme s\u2019il englobait non seulement le \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb, tel que nous le d\u00e9finirions dans les instances relatives \u00e0 la LCDP, mais aussi le fait de ne pas r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u00e9coulant de sa d\u00e9ficience sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la contrainte excessive dans le cadre de son retour au travail au CN. Ces neuf all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 celles que le plaignant a express\u00e9ment invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience et que son avocat a plaid\u00e9es (et que le CN a d\u00e9fendues et plaid\u00e9es).\n[81] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, le 19 novembre 2003 ou vers cette date, il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau de KS en vue d\u2019obtenir un formulaire d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e (l\u2019ICD) pour son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel. Il soutient qu\u2019elle a insist\u00e9 pour savoir de quel probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel il s\u2019agissait et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impolie et insistante et s\u2019\u00e9tait mise de plus en plus en col\u00e8re quand il avait refus\u00e9 de le lui dire. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle avait claqu\u00e9 son tiroir. La porte de son bureau \u00e9tait apparemment ouverte durant cet \u00e9change, qui a dur\u00e9 cinq \u00e0 dix minutes environ. Il a fini par s\u2019en aller, car KS n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la personne qui d\u00e9tenait les formulaires de demande de cong\u00e9 non li\u00e9 au travail de la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 professionnelle et de l\u2019assurance contre les accidents du travail (la CSPAAT), et la raison de son cong\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e au travail. Il ne lui a jamais r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel.\n[82] KS a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et a ni\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9e et manifestement troubl\u00e9e quand, de nombreux mois plus tard, on lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne sur cette situation. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucun conflit ant\u00e9rieur avec M. Croteau et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t occup\u00e9e de prendre pour lui des mesures d\u2019accommodement apr\u00e8s une blessure subie dans un accident de taxi. La conversation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 br\u00e8ve, de quelques minutes. Sa porte \u00e9tait ouverte, de sorte que, s\u2019il y avait eu une telle altercation, d\u2019autres l\u2019auraient entendue.\n[83] KS est entr\u00e9e au service du CN en 1985. Elle occup\u00e9 divers postes sur le terrain, dont ceux de coordonnatrice de train, de chef de train et de conductrice de locomotive, avant de joindre les rangs de la direction. Elle a clairement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de gestionnaire d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et d\u2019AGR \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e pour ne pas s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir des probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux personnels d\u2019un employ\u00e9, qu\u2019il y avait un [Traduction] \u00ab mur de briques \u00bb entre Medisys\/SST et le [Traduction] \u00ab personnel sur le terrain \u00bb comme elle lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait question des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux personnels des employ\u00e9s. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait un [Traduction] \u00ab souvenir \u00bb de la r\u00e9union, quelque neuf ans plus tard : [Traduction] \u00ab Peut-\u00eatre cinq minutes dans mon bureau. Il est entr\u00e9 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019un formulaire pour une absence. Je devais confirmer si cette absence \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au travail ou non parce que le processus [et le formulaire] \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent. \u00bb S\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une absence li\u00e9e au travail, KS s\u2019en occupait; sinon (en cas de blessure\/maladie), l\u2019employ\u00e9 faisait affaire avec Debbie Robinson.\n[84] Dans la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019elle a faite au Service des ressources humaines du CN, lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne, elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nXI. Les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement\nA. L\u2019all\u00e9gation no 1 : la conversation du 19 novembre 2003 entre KS et le plaignant\n[Traduction] Je me souviens que Pierre est entr\u00e9 dans mon bureau au sujet d\u2019une situation personnelle. Je me souviens aussi de lui avoir demand\u00e9 si c\u2019\u00e9tait li\u00e9 au travail et il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que non; je l\u2019ai donc orient\u00e9 vers Debbie pour les renseignements concernant les nouveaux formulaires [\u2026] La seule conversation que j\u2019ai eue avec Pierre au sujet de sa situation c\u2019\u00e9tait si celle-ci \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au travail ou non. Le suivi que nous faisons est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent, selon que nous avons affaire \u00e0 une blessure ou \u00e0 un accident de travail.\n[\u2026]\nL\u2019une des premi\u00e8res choses que j\u2019ai apprises \u00e0 titre d\u2019AGR c\u2019est que, si un employ\u00e9 avait un probl\u00e8me personnel, je n\u2019avais pas le droit de savoir quoi que ce soit sur ce dernier. Jamais je ne lui aurais pos\u00e9 ces questions personnelles si je savais que je n\u2019avais pas d\u2019affaire \u00e0 le savoir [\u2026] Je crois que sa visite a dur\u00e9 moins d\u2019une minute.\n[85] KS a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [Traduction] \u00ab jamais \u00bb elle n\u2019aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 quelle \u00e9tait la nature de sa maladie : [Traduction] \u00ab Nous savions que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de nos affaires et nous n\u2019\u00e9tions pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 poser la question \u00bb. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e de 500 employ\u00e9s se trouvant dans une situation semblable, qui voulaient obtenir des formulaires, et qu\u2019elle leur demandait si le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait li\u00e9 au travail ou non : [Traduction] \u00ab Je n\u2019ai jamais franchi cette ligne, je n\u2019en aurais tir\u00e9 aucun avantage, il n\u2019y avait aucune raison de le demander \u00bb. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun des 500 employ\u00e9s en question n\u2019avait jamais all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pos\u00e9 de telles questions d\u00e9plac\u00e9es, \u00e0 part M. Croteau.\n[86] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la situation classique, qui repose enti\u00e8rement sur les dires de l\u2019un et ceux de l\u2019autre. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur ce fait. Cependant, l\u2019\u00e9pouse et la belle-s\u0153ur de M. Croteau ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu\u2019elles ont eues le 23 avril 2004 avec KS, et dans lesquelles cette derni\u00e8re demandait o\u00f9 M. Croteau se trouvait. Mme Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que KS avait non seulement \u00e9t\u00e9 impolie et agressive, mais qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux personnels et voulu savoir [Traduction] \u00ab ce qui cloch[ait] chez lui maintenant \u00bb. Je conclus que Mme Croteau et Mme Hames ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins dignes de foi. Il est possible que, le 19 novembre 2003, KS ait \u00e9t\u00e9 indiscr\u00e8te, curieuse de savoir quel \u00e9tait le motif m\u00e9dical personnel pour lequel on avait eu besoin d\u2019un formulaire, et qu\u2019elle ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau de le divulguer. Cependant, en me fondant sur mes doutes quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du plaignant, et apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage de KS, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 agressive, autoritaire, impatiente, voire impolie, au cours de la conversation qu\u2019elle a eue dans le bureau avec M. Croteau, y compris au moment de v\u00e9rifier si la maladie \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au travail ou non, mais qu\u2019elle ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel. Cela, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, n\u2019engage aucune responsabilit\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP. Je souhaite \u00e9galement ajouter que, pendant toutes les audiences, M. Croteau a fait des commentaires sur le comportement des gens : Untel [Traduction] \u00ab avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impoli \u00bb, etc. Pour M. Croteau, et cela se comprend, les bonnes mani\u00e8res et l\u2019\u00e9tiquette sont importantes, et cela a peut-\u00eatre eu un effet sur la perception qu\u2019il avait de cet incident.\n[87] Subsidiairement, m\u00eame si elle s\u2019\u00e9tait effectivement enquise de la nature de sa maladie (\u00e0 part le fait de savoir si elle \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au travail ou non), une telle question ne constituerait pas un geste de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, et ce, pour les raisons suivantes : une telle question, \u00e0 laquelle M. Croteau n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu, serait davantage une tentative d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. Cela ne serait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une [Traduction] \u00ab conduite malvenue \u00bb de nature importante ou singuli\u00e8re, ou de nature persistante et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e pour le motif illicite de la d\u00e9ficience, ou comme une conduite ayant cr\u00e9\u00e9 un milieu de travail malsain, selon la norme objective.\n[88] C\u2019est l\u00e0 une all\u00e9gation importante, car il s\u2019agit de la gen\u00e8se, selon le plaignant, de ce qui a suivi, tant pour ce qui est du harc\u00e8lement que pour le d\u00e9faut de r\u00e9pondre convenablement \u00e0 ses besoins du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019avocat du plaignant, Me Bolter : [Traduction] \u00ab il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du moment d\u00e9cisif dans sa relation avec [KS] \u00bb, et avec le CN aussi, si je puis me permettre. Bien que la divulgation ult\u00e9rieure de la surveillance vid\u00e9o ait exacerb\u00e9 la situation, c\u2019est cette r\u00e9union qui a d\u00e9clench\u00e9 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de sa vie professionnelle.\n[89] Me McFadden a qualifi\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant au sujet de l\u2019incident ayant eu lieu le 19 novembre 2003 de [Traduction] \u00ab si\u00e8ge de l\u2019irr\u00e9alisme. Il croit r\u00e9ellement que cela et tout ce qui lui est arriv\u00e9 apr\u00e8s novembre 2003 [\u2026] \u00e9tait d\u00fb au fait que [KS] \u00e9tait en col\u00e8re contre lui parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel lors de cette conversation de deux ou trois minutes qui a eu lieu vers le 19 novembre 2003. \u00bb L\u2019avocat a aussi ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab Cela a un effet d\u2019\u00e9cho : dans chaque cas, il revient \u00e0 cette conversation. Cela a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une animosit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une vengeance de la part de [KS] contre lui, qui infecte le reste du CN. Et cela se poursuit jusqu\u2019en 2007, ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 cela faisait longtemps qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait partie. \u00bb\n[90] Il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de M. Croteau que la gen\u00e8se de sa plainte est la conversation qu\u2019il a eue le 19 novembre 2003 dans le bureau de KS. En fait, il a soutenu que les faits ayant eu lieu par la suite, y compris avec d\u2019autres gestionnaires du CN, \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 KS ou avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9s par elle : une tentative ou une vengeance, assimilable \u00e0 un complot, pour le harceler et mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi au CN. \u00c0 un moment dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que quatre employ\u00e9s lui avaient dit que KS cherchait \u00e0 obtenir son cong\u00e9diement. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 de les nommer, il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne connaissait qu\u2019un seul des quatre. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas voulu le nommer de crainte que le CN exerce des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui. Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de justice naturelle, je n\u2019accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cette preuve.\n[91] Le coordonnateur de train Kevin Mau a tenu une r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003 \u00e0 propos du d\u00e9faut de M. Croteau de [Traduction] \u00ab prot\u00e9ger ses affectations \u00bb relativement \u00e0 deux appels manqu\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une violation de la politique relative aux terminaux du CN. C\u2019\u00e9tait presque un mois apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident ayant eu lieu le 19 novembre dans le bureau de KS. Un repr\u00e9sentant syndical avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie de la r\u00e9union. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que c\u2019est KS qui \u00e9tait responsable du fait que M. Mau l\u2019avait fait venir pour une enqu\u00eate. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 laquelle prenait part le plaignant. Il a reconnu l\u2019existence de la politique (il est interdit de manquer plus d\u2019un quart de travail sur 28) et de la pratique au CN. M. Croteau a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8re \u00bb \u00e0 propos de ces questions de pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, avec tous ses employ\u00e9s. Il n\u2019a aucune preuve que M. Mau \u00e9tait au courant de son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel ou de la conversation qu\u2019il y avait eu le 19 novembre dans le bureau de KS, ou m\u00eame que les deux en avaient parl\u00e9 ou avaient parl\u00e9 de M. Croteau. En particulier, ce dernier a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme du \u00ab harc\u00e8lement \u00bb le fait que M. Mau lui ait dit qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour manque d\u2019assiduit\u00e9.\n[92] \u00c0 part ce que M. Croteau croyait personnellement, aucune preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que cette r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la conversation qu\u2019il avait eue avec KS le 19 novembre 2003 qui, selon ce que j\u2019ai conclu, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas contraire \u00e0 la LCDP. L\u2019enqu\u00eate du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003 \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 une politique de pratique courante, non discriminatoire, du CN. Quant au commentaire de M. Mau selon lequel il pouvait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour manque d\u2019assiduit\u00e9, je conclus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait essentiellement dans le contexte de pratiques exemplaires qui exigent que les gestionnaires tiennent leurs employ\u00e9s au courant des cons\u00e9quences d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 une politique (non discriminatoire), une politique concernant, en l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019assiduit\u00e9. Il n\u2019y avait ici aucune animosit\u00e9 ou menace, expresse ou implicite. Je signale que M. Mau n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Au cours des audiences, j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 lors de la gestion de l\u2019instance qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que Me McFadden appelle M. Mau ou TC \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, mais qu\u2019il pouvait le faire s\u2019il le souhaitait. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas les appeler. Me Bolter aurait pu d\u00e9cider lui aussi de les appeler \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, mais il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[93] Le 8 janvier 2004, M. Croteau s\u2019est bless\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule en tirant sur un frein \u00e0 main. Il all\u00e8gue que KS a exig\u00e9 ind\u00fbment qu\u2019il participe \u00e0 une reconstitution imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019accident et qu\u2019elle l\u2019a [Traduction] \u00ab interrog\u00e9 \u00bb. Il a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que le CN avait pour politique de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une reconstitution le plus rapidement possible apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident, aussi minime que soit la blessure ou l\u2019accident. Cela faisait partie du principe de la \u00ab s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019abord \u00bb du CN.\n[94] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le processus de reconstitution a dur\u00e9 en tout au moins plusieurs heures. Il a quand m\u00eame reconnu que la reconstitution elle-m\u00eame n\u2019avait dur\u00e9 que cinq minutes environ. Ce qu\u2019il avait trouv\u00e9 de particulier, c\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la premi\u00e8re fois, \u00e0 sa connaissance, que KS prenait part au processus. M. Croteau a aussi reproch\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019on avait laiss\u00e9 son \u00e9pouse attendre dans l\u2019automobile. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que KS avait dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas tir\u00e9 comme il faut sur le frein et que M. Brownlee avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab N\u2019allez pas l\u00e0 [K] \u00bb. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 se sentir [Traduction] \u00ab cibl\u00e9 \u00bb par le CN \u00e0 ce stade et qu\u2019il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat.\n[95] Je ne vois l\u00e0 aucun harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP. KS suivait la politique de pratique courante du CN qui s\u2019appliquait lorsqu\u2019on d\u00e9clarait un accident. Sa pr\u00e9sence aux reconstitutions \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important de son travail d\u2019AGR. Cette pr\u00e9sence n\u2019avait aucun lien avec sa conversation du 19 novembre 2003 avec M. Croteau (qui, selon ce que j\u2019ai conclu, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de nature discriminatoire). La reconstitution a dur\u00e9 \u00e0 peine cinq minutes. Quant au d\u00e9lai d\u2019attente, M. Croteau \u00e9tait rentr\u00e9 chez lui et s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu compte qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas remis son rapport d\u2019accident et avait donc d\u00fb revenir au terminal. KS, Mme Paquet, M. Colasimone et Mme Fusco ont eux aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la politique et de la pratique du CN : ce dernier tient \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on fasse une reconstitution dans chaque cas si c\u2019est possible, et le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident. Aucun accident n\u2019est trop minime pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une reconstitution, et ce, \u00e0 bord du m\u00eame train et avec le m\u00eame \u00e9quipement si cela est possible. De plus, Paul Sutor, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas plaint de la reconstitution.\n[96] Au sujet du commentaire de M. Brownlee : [Traduction] N\u2019allez pas l\u00e0 [K] \u00bb, je ne puis dire, sans disposer de plus d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments, s\u2019il avait un ton n\u00e9gatif et discriminatoire. De plus, aucune mesure disciplinaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation que M. Croteau avait faite du frein \u00e0 main, et aucune enqu\u00eate du type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e. Si KS avait voulu prendre M. Croteau pour cible ou en d\u00e9faut, cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pour elle l\u2019occasion de le faire. Au lieu de cela, elle a juste fait son travail, soit d\u00e9couvrir pourquoi un accident avait eu lieu et tenter d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019il se reproduise.\n[97] M. Croteau s\u2019est bless\u00e9 au genou en descendant d\u2019un train le 10 mars 2004. Il convient de noter qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait-l\u00e0 de sa seconde blessure en deux mois. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que KS l\u2019avait interrog\u00e9 sur l\u2019incident et avait critiqu\u00e9 son dossier d\u2019accidents : il y en avait douze en dix ans. KS a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y en avait eu onze entre octobre 1993 et janvier 2004 : [Traduction] \u00ab un chiffre exceptionnellement \u00e9lev\u00e9. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle il \u00e9tait inscrit sur la liste pour avoir une conversation avec [TC] \u00bb. Il ressort de la preuve qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de sa r\u00e9union avec KS, cette derni\u00e8re a offert qu\u2019on le conduise \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, ce qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9, et elle lui rappel\u00e9 de ramener les formulaires m\u00e9dicaux que son m\u00e9decin remplirait. M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, comme KS l\u2019avait [Traduction] \u00ab angoiss\u00e9 \u00bb, il ne lui avait pas ramen\u00e9 directement les formulaires comme elle le lui avait dit, mais avait plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 au syndicat de le faire pour lui.\n[98] Je souligne qu\u2019aucune reconstitution n\u2019a eu lieu juste apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, car il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait mal et voulait se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Et il l\u2019a fait. Le m\u00e9decin lui a remis un billet prescrivant une p\u00e9riode de restriction de trois jours. Cependant, M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que KS avait fait preuve de harc\u00e8lement en le faisant rester sur place et en lui posant des questions sur un ton accusateur au sujet de son plus r\u00e9cent accident et qu\u2019elle lui avait dit que son dossier d\u2019accidents \u00e9tait mauvais. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi qu\u2019elle avait cri\u00e9 apr\u00e8s lui pendant qu\u2019il descendait rapidement les escaliers : [Traduction] \u00ab comme un hurlement, elle \u00e9tait hors de ses gonds \u00bb.\n[99] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant et de KS et apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue la preuve documentaire, je ne conclus pas que le CN et son employ\u00e9e, KS, l\u2019ont harcel\u00e9. Premi\u00e8rement, KS avait \u00e9mis des doutes au sujet de l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de sa blessure, en se fondant sur la mani\u00e8re dont il avait dit et \u00e9crit ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 : c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait tordu le genou pendant qu\u2019il descendait du train, par opposition \u00e0 apr\u00e8s \u00eatre descendu du train. Je ne sous\u2011entends pas que M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 moins qu\u2019honn\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet. Et cette question comporte un aspect s\u00e9mantique. Je conclus toutefois que KS n\u2019a pas agi d\u00e9raisonnablement en l\u2019interrogeant et m\u00eame en ayant des doutes sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, compte tenu des contradictions manifestes que comportaient ses versions. S\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait agi de son premier accident en dix ans, j\u2019aurais peut-\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la situation sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, mais il s\u2019agissait de son douzi\u00e8me accident en dix ans, et de son deuxi\u00e8me en deux mois. De plus, c\u2019\u00e9tait son travail, en tant qu\u2019AGR, de poser des questions sur ce genre de situation. J\u2019ai entendu lors de l\u2019audience un t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il n\u2019est pas rare que des employ\u00e9s tentent d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019\u00eatre responsables d\u2019un accident. Je ne sous-entends pas que M. Croteau l\u2019a fait, mais juste que, compte tenu des circonstances, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable que KS le questionne et il ne s\u2019agissait certes pas d\u2019un acte de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est la d\u00e9ficience sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP.\n[100] Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9, compte tenu de mes doutes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 du plaignant, et apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le t\u00e9moignage de KS, \u00e0 conclure que cette derni\u00e8re a [Traduction] \u00ab hurl\u00e9 \u00bb apr\u00e8s lui. Elle a peut-\u00eatre perdu patience, mais cela, en soi, ne constitue pas un geste de harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP.\n[101] Pour ce qui est des questions qu\u2019elle a pos\u00e9es sur son dossier d\u2019accidents, l\u00e0 encore je ne conclus pas qu\u2019il y a eu violation de la LCDP. La preuve documentaire pr\u00e9sente chacun des accidents que le plaignant a subis : douze en dix ans. Une bonne part du temps d\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la revue de chaque incident ou accident. Je conviens que quelques-uns de ces douze accidents peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s de mineurs et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas attribuables \u00e0 une n\u00e9gligence de sa part ou \u00e0 un d\u00e9faut de se conformer aux r\u00e8gles en vigueur, mais pas tous les douze, et sur une p\u00e9riode de dix ans.\n[102] Me Bolter me demande de tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable du fait que le CN a omis de produire les dossiers informatiques comparatifs illustrant les accidents subis par certains employ\u00e9s pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Divers t\u00e9moins du CN ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces renseignements \u00e9taient disponibles. Cependant, le CN n\u2019a pas dit pourquoi il ne les avait pas produits. Je trouve curieux que cela n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, mais je refuse d\u2019en tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable. (Je signale que Me Bolter aurait pu demander une ordonnance de production.) Plusieurs t\u00e9moins du CN m\u2019ont fait part de ce qu\u2019ils pensaient d\u2019un dossier de douze accidents en dix ans. M. Gallagher a d\u00e9crit la situation de mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement color\u00e9e, disant que c\u2019\u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e9pouvantable \u00bb. Il a affirm\u00e9 que [Traduction] \u00ab un accident par ann\u00e9e ou plus, c\u2019est un dossier tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s mauvais. Rares sont les employ\u00e9s qui ont un dossier comme celui-l\u00e0 \u00bb. La d\u00e9claration par ou\u00ef-dire de TC \u00e9tait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un accident au cours de ses trente ann\u00e9es de carri\u00e8re au CN. Mme Paquet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le dossier du plaignant \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e9lev\u00e9 et constant ; beaucoup d\u2019accidents et au moins tous les ans ou aux deux ans [\u2026] Il a un comportement tr\u00e8s peu s\u00e9curitaire \u00bb. Et ces commentaires-l\u00e0 viennent de gestionnaires chevronn\u00e9s du CN, dont la plupart ont acquis une vaste exp\u00e9rience en tant que \u00ab roulants \u00bb (personnel roulant), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en tant que chefs de train ou conducteurs de locomotive, lesquels doivent tous garder \u00e0 jour leur formation et leurs qualifications en tant que membres d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de train.\n[103] Parmi les t\u00e9moins du CN, c\u2019est M. Colasimone qui a le plus d\u2019exp\u00e9rience en tant que membre d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de train sur le plan des activit\u00e9s et de la gestion, et il occupe un poste de cadre sup\u00e9rieur au sein du secteur op\u00e9rationnel au CN. J\u2019accorde une grande importance \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. Lui aussi a exprim\u00e9 assez clairement son opinion sur un tel dossier d\u2019accidents. Quand on lu a demand\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Est-il fr\u00e9quent que des employ\u00e9s membres du personnel roulant ne subissent aucun accident ? \u00bb, il a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent, plus de la moiti\u00e9 \u00bb. Ensuite, [Traduction] \u00ab Si vous voyiez un employ\u00e9 avec un dossier comme celui-ci, 12 en 10 ? \u00bb, il a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Cela me pr\u00e9occuperait beaucoup. Cet employ\u00e9 deviendrait un \u201cemploy\u00e9 cibl\u00e9\u201d et il aurait une discussion avec lui et lui ferait le dessin du [Traduction] \u00ab bonhomme-allumettes \u00bb que l\u2019on utilise pour les accidents [12] . Cependant, cela n\u2019a pas eu lieu dans le cas de M. Croteau. \u00c0 part le fait que KS lui parle de son dossier avec lui le 10 mars 2004 et exige qu\u2019il s\u2019entretienne avec TC, ce qu\u2019il a fait, rien d\u2019autre n\u2019a eu lieu : on n\u2019a certainement pas fait de lui un \u00ab employ\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 \u00bb. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 comment M. Croteau avait [Traduction] \u00ab pu durer \u00bb avec un dossier comme celui-l\u00e0 pendant plus de dix ans, M. Colasimone a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab [d]es styles de gestion diff\u00e9rents. Il est manifestement pass\u00e9 \u00e0 travers les mailles du filet. Personnellement, je ne peux pas imaginer que cela se produise \u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement reconnu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un [Traduction] \u00ab dossier de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9pouvantable \u00bb et que, sous sa surveillance, le plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00ab employ\u00e9 cibl\u00e9 \u00bb. Je n\u2019en ai aucun doute. De plus, il ne semble pas qu\u2019il se trouvait [Traduction] \u00ab sur l\u2019\u00e9cran radar \u00bb \u2013 un sujet de discussion lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique nationale hebdomadaire sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 avec la direction, \u00e0 laquelle participait M. Creel, le haut dirigeant num\u00e9ro deux, juste en dessous du chef de la direction de l\u2019entreprise.\n[104] M\u00eame s\u2019il semble que le plaignant soit [Traduction] \u00ab pass\u00e9 au travers des mailles du filet \u00bb (si l\u2019on fait exception du fait que KS lui a demand\u00e9 de s\u2019entretenir avec TC au sujet de son dossier de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en 2004), je conclus que M. Croteau avait de r\u00e9els probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et un mauvais dossier de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en tant que chef de train au CN. Je suis conscient que cela contredit la perception qu\u2019a le plaignant de lui-m\u00eame : [Traduction] \u00ab l\u2019un des employ\u00e9s les plus s\u00fbrs \u00bb au CN.\n[105] Il s\u2019agit peut-\u00eatre l\u00e0 de l\u2019all\u00e9gation la plus importante pour ce qui est de l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle a eue sur M. Croteau et sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 mentale. S\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9prouvait pas de graves troubles li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 avant d\u2019entendre parler de la surveillance lors de la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate du type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb tenue avec M. Mau le 11 mai 2004, ces troubles ont tr\u00e8s certainement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, et ses sympt\u00f4mes ont empir\u00e9 au fil du temps.\n[106] Apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre bless\u00e9 au genou le 10 mars 2004, le plaignant a remis \u00e0 son syndicat un billet de m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9cisant initialement qu\u2019il pouvait revenir au travail pour ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches all\u00e9g\u00e9es; peu de temps apr\u00e8s, il a remis un autre billet contenant des restrictions m\u00e9dicales contradictoires, disant qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas retourner au travail du tout avant le 29 mars 2004. Ces billets n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remis directement au CN, mais plut\u00f4t au syndicat. Durant l\u2019absence de 20 jours, M. Croteau n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 directement avec la direction du CN, mais il a plut\u00f4t communiqu\u00e9 avec son syndicat. Il ressort de la preuve que KS a mis en doute la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 du cong\u00e9 de maladie de M. Croteau, et que le CN a retenu les services d\u2019une agence priv\u00e9e d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour soumettre l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 une surveillance vid\u00e9o durant son absence. Il y a eu deux p\u00e9riodes de surveillance, l\u2019une en mars 2004 et l\u2019autre un mois plus tard.\n[107] La surveillance a capt\u00e9, notamment, M. Croteau en train de jouer au soccer avec ses enfants dans un parc, M. Croteau en train de jouer au basketball avec quelques amis adultes, ainsi que des sc\u00e8nes de sa maison, prises de la rue, et diverses images de M. Croteau ou de son \u00e9pouse au volant de leurs automobiles. Toutes les images de surveillance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises de jour et dans des lieux publics.\n[108] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait que KS et M. Schenk avaient autoris\u00e9 la surveillance et que celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e parce qu\u2019on le soup\u00e7onnait d\u2019\u00eatre gai, \u00e0 cause de son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel et \u00e0 cause du fait, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement notoire \u00e0 Sarnia, que son fr\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9 par le sida. Il ressort de la preuve que, bien que KS ait recommand\u00e9 que l\u2019on exerce une surveillance, celle-ci a vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par Tony Marquis, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas pris part \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de surveiller M. Croteau, M. Colasimone, qui occupe actuellement le poste qu\u2019occupait M. Marquis en 2004, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait autoris\u00e9 la surveillance de certains employ\u00e9s dans le pass\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait pris part \u00e0 quelques douzaines d\u2019op\u00e9rations de ce genre. Souvent, cela se faisait si l\u2019entreprise avait des soup\u00e7ons au sujet des activit\u00e9s, des blessures ou des absences du travail d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Parfois, l\u2019obtention de plusieurs ordonnances aupr\u00e8s de m\u00e9decins diff\u00e9rents suscitait des soup\u00e7ons. M. Gallagher et Mme Fusco ont \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 des raisons ou des situations qui pouvaient amener le CN \u00e0 faire surveiller un employ\u00e9. Il est clairement ressorti de la preuve que le CN n\u2019ordonnait pas \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re la surveillance d\u2019un employ\u00e9, qui est un exercice co\u00fbteux. Mais, manifestement, la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ayant eu lieu en mars et en avril 2004 et mettant en cause M. Croteau, dont sa p\u00e9riode de 20 jours d\u2019absence sans permission, son bref retour suivi d\u2019un autre cong\u00e9, ainsi que les billets de m\u00e9decin contradictoires et l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de le joindre, a \u00e9veill\u00e9 cumulativement les soup\u00e7ons de KS et de la haute direction. En fin de compte, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019absence sans permission de 20 jours. J\u2019accepte le fait qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 au syndicat d\u2019informer le CN de la situation parce qu\u2019il ne voulait pas avoir directement affaire \u00e0 KS. Le syndicat agissait comme son mandataire ou repr\u00e9sentant, ou comme \u00ab interm\u00e9diaire \u00bb entre lui et KS.\n[109] M\u00eame si, en fin de compte, le CN ne s\u2019est pas servi des bandes de surveillance pour prendre des mesures disciplinaires contre M. Croteau, les sc\u00e8nes le montrant en train de jouer au soccer et au basketball auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 un motif raisonnable pour \u00e9veiller les soup\u00e7ons d\u2019un employeur et mettre en doute la validit\u00e9 des absences du travail d\u2019un employ\u00e9. Je prends connaissance d\u2019office que le soccer et le basketball sont des activit\u00e9s qui obligent \u00e0 pivoter et \u00e0 tourner sur soi-m\u00eame dans des directions diff\u00e9rentes, des gestes qui peuvent \u00eatre incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9tention d\u2019\u00eatre incapable de travailler en raison d\u2019une blessure au genou.\n[110] Je tiens aussi \u00e0 traiter du fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de joindre M. Croteau au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. KS a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir essay\u00e9 58 fois de joindre le plaignant par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Sa liste des dates et des heures des appels a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. M. Croteau dit qu\u2019elle ment; jamais elle n\u2019a fait ces appels. Il avait un num\u00e9ro \u00e0 domicile et deux num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire. Lorsqu\u2019elle avait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 ses deux num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones paraissaient \u00e9teints parce qu\u2019elle ne tombait que sur le message type disant que la personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible, mais sans possibilit\u00e9 de laisser un message dans une messagerie vocale. Il y a deux points que je trouve curieux. Premi\u00e8rement, que KS aurait eu le temps \u2013 car elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fort occup\u00e9e au cours de cette p\u00e9riode \u2013 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner 58 fois \u00e0 M. Croteau. Deuxi\u00e8mement, et ce, bien avant le 58e appel, qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas eu recours \u00e0 un autre moyen pour communiquer avec lui \u2013 p. ex., par courrier recommand\u00e9. Finalement, il est curieux que M. Croteau n\u2019ait pas de messagerie vocale associ\u00e9e \u00e0 son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone afin d\u2019\u00eatre s\u00fbr de pouvoir recevoir des messages importants de son employeur. Cela dit, malgr\u00e9 le z\u00e8le peut-\u00eatre excessif de KS, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 avec soin son t\u00e9moignage et pass\u00e9 en revue la pi\u00e8ce \u00e9num\u00e9rant les d\u00e9tails de ses appels, je conclus effectivement qu\u2019elle a fait ces 58 appels \u00e0 M. Croteau, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[111] Je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de violation de la LCDP dans le fait d\u2019ordonner la tenue de la surveillance, ni dans les m\u00e9thodes que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur priv\u00e9 a utilis\u00e9es. Manifestement, KS et ses sup\u00e9rieurs doutaient de l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 des absences et de la blessure de M. Croteau. Leurs soup\u00e7ons s\u2019appuyaient sur des motifs raisonnables, dont l\u2019encha\u00eenement des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, y compris la teneur diff\u00e9rente des billets de m\u00e9decin, la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 le joindre, etc. Nous n\u2019avons pas affaire ici \u00e0 un acte de harc\u00e8lement qui repose sur le motif illicite de distinction fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience. Manifestement, M. Croteau et sa famille ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9s. Son \u00e9pouse a elle aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Et je ne les mets pas en doute. Je puis comprendre qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre tr\u00e8s troublant d\u2019apprendre que l\u2019on a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi et film\u00e9 par un enqu\u00eateur priv\u00e9. Et je puis comprendre aussi que M. Croteau juge qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune raison objective et justifiable pour exercer une telle surveillance. Mais j\u2019arrive toutefois \u00e0 une conclusion contraire. Le fait qu\u2019un employeur, un assureur ou la CSPAAT ordonne la surveillance d\u2019une personne qui pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre bless\u00e9e ou handicap\u00e9e n\u2019est pas une violation de la LCDP, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il existe des motifs raisonnables pour le faire et o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une surveillance ne repose pas sur des facteurs discriminatoires.\n[112] Quant au rapport du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada (le CPVP) sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Croteau contre le CN \u00e0 cause de la surveillance, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que le CN avait ordonn\u00e9 la surveillance pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment, sans recourir d\u2019abord \u00e0 des m\u00e9thodes moins restrictives. Le CPVP n\u2019a pas conclu que le CN avait harcel\u00e9 M. Croteau ou n\u2019avait pas de fondement licite pour les surveiller, sa famille et lui. Et, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, la d\u00e9cision rendue par le CPVP au titre de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents \u00e9lectroniques, L.C. 2000, ch. 5, n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante quant \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction relative \u00e0 une violation de la LCDP.\n[113] M. Croteau s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre les m\u00e9thodes de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur priv\u00e9, y compris le fait de filmer son \u00e9pouse et ses enfants en son absence. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. J\u2019ignore pourquoi il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire cela, mais j\u2019ai regard\u00e9 les bandes de surveillance. Toutes les images ont \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9es dans des lieux publics. Je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019une surveillance indirecte a eu lieu pendant que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur v\u00e9rifiait si Mme Croteau allait rencontrer son \u00e9poux. Mais, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, c\u2019\u00e9tait M. Croteau qui faisait l\u2019objet de la surveillance, et l\u2019inclusion de la famille et d\u2019autres personnes \u00e9tait simplement un fait accessoire. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue les rapports \u00e9crits de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une agence priv\u00e9e d\u2019enqu\u00eate agr\u00e9\u00e9e \u2013 un tiers dont le CN avait retenu les services. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que le CN a dit \u00e0 cette agence de surveiller Mme Croteau ou ses enfants ou, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de quelle fa\u00e7on ex\u00e9cuter le travail de surveillance. L\u00e0 encore, je souligne que je suis conscient de l\u2019effet que cela a eu sur M. Croteau (et sur son \u00e9pouse) quand il a appris, le 11 mai 2004, qu\u2019il avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une surveillance. Les effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diats et palpables, et ont consist\u00e9, notamment, \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager l\u2019un de ses fils dans la chambre \u00e0 coucher de l\u2019autre. En outre, cela a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019image qu\u2019il avait de lui-m\u00eame, celle d\u2019un employ\u00e9 soucieux de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, travaillant et honn\u00eate, et cela a d\u00e9not\u00e9 que d\u2019autres personnes au CN avaient des soup\u00e7ons \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et avaient peut-\u00eatre une opinion contraire de lui.\n[114] Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019occasion \u00e0 laquelle M. Croteau a appris pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019on l\u2019avait surveill\u00e9. M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate du type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb, comme l\u2019exigeaient la politique du CN et la convention collective, au sujet des 20 jours de cong\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pris sans permission, du 10 au 30 mars 2004. M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que la tenue de cette r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait une forme de harc\u00e8lement. Il conteste \u00e9galement sa dur\u00e9e excessive. Il all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que M. Mau a fait remarquer qu\u2019il avait de [Traduction] \u00ab beaux enfants \u00bb et il a jug\u00e9 que ce commentaire \u00e9tait de nature mena\u00e7ante, [Traduction] \u00ab sinistre \u00bb, mais pas de nature sexuellement d\u00e9plac\u00e9e. En outre, il all\u00e8gue que KS l\u2019a [Traduction] \u00ab bouscul\u00e9 \u00bb dans le couloir, alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[115] Lors de la r\u00e9union, on a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau les images de la vid\u00e9o de surveillance. M. Mau l\u2019a confront\u00e9 au sujet du fait qu\u2019on le voyait jouer au soccer et au basketball pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d\u2019une blessure au genou. Le plaignant a reconnu que M. Mau avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab il n\u2019y avait rien dans les sc\u00e8nes film\u00e9es que le CN pouvait utiliser \u00bb.\n[116] M. Mau n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et pris en consid\u00e9ration le t\u00e9moignage de M. Croteau ainsi que la plainte interne \u00e9crite sur cette question, je suis d\u2019avis que la r\u00e9union, que la convention collective obligeait \u00e0 tenir avant la prise de n\u2019importe quelle mesure disciplinaire, avait pour objet de traiter des soup\u00e7ons raisonnables qu\u2019avait le CN \u00e0 propos des 20 jours de cong\u00e9 sans permission, y compris pourquoi il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de joindre M. Croteau durant cette p\u00e9riode, pourquoi il avait consult\u00e9 des m\u00e9decins diff\u00e9rents et ce qu\u2019il avait fait pendant son cong\u00e9. Je ne d\u00e9c\u00e8le aucun signe de harc\u00e8lement dans cette r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pris pour cible parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bless\u00e9, malade ou atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Je conviens avec Me McFadden que le message non harcelant que le CN lui transmettait (\u00e0 lui et \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel autre employ\u00e9) \u00e9tait le suivant : [Traduction] \u00ab si vous d\u00e9cidez de prendre un cong\u00e9 sans permission, s\u2019il est impossible de vous joindre et s\u2019il semble que vous \u00eates \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un m\u00e9decin complaisant, il est possible qu\u2019on vous mette sous surveillance \u00bb et que l\u2019on vous convoque \u00e0 une r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate du type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb.\n[117] Il est vrai que la r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9ment longue \u2013 pr\u00e8s de cinq heures, inclusion faite des trois pauses d\u2019une vingtaine de minutes \u2013 et qu\u2019on a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019espace pr\u00e9vu dans le formulaire pour un nombre maximal de 98 questions et d\u00fb remplir une seconde feuille, ce qui avait donn\u00e9 en tout 125 questions pos\u00e9es. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue la transcription de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et, m\u00eame si je m\u2019\u00e9tais attendu \u00e0 voir des questions sur la mani\u00e8re dont la blessure au genou proprement dite \u00e9tait survenue et plus qu\u2019une seule question sur les parties de soccer ou de basketball, il ressort clairement de ces questions que le CN avait des doutes sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ses 20 jours d\u2019absence du travail, ainsi que sur son manque de communication et sur l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de le joindre au cours de cette p\u00e9riode (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que KS avait tent\u00e9 de le joindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 58 reprises). Je signale qu\u2019en contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a tout d\u2019abord ni\u00e9 que M. Mau l\u2019avait questionn\u00e9 sur le fait d\u2019avoir jou\u00e9 dans le parc avec ses enfants. Cependant, quand on lui a montr\u00e9 le document, il s\u2019est r\u00e9tract\u00e9. Il est clair aussi que M. Mau voulait v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il n\u2019exploitait pas une entreprise (peut-\u00eatre comme pilote) pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 sans permission. Il ne fait aucun doute que le CN avait des soup\u00e7ons \u00e0 propos de l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 de sa blessure ou de ses absences. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019issue et de la conclusion, le CN avait des motifs raisonnables, non assimilables \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement, pour tenir cette r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate du type interrogatoire.\n[118] Certes, M. Gallagher a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, il \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9ellement stupide \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab absolument inutile \u00bb de montrer la bande de surveillance : [Traduction] \u00ab pourquoi montrer la bande si l\u2019on n\u2019obtient rien [\u2026] \u00bb. Cependant, si l\u2019on examine son t\u00e9moignage dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, certaines choses ressortent clairement. Premi\u00e8rement, M. Gallagher n\u2019avait vu que [Traduction] \u00ab 10 minutes environ \u00bb des bandes tourn\u00e9es sur les parties de soccer. C\u2019\u00e9tait sa premi\u00e8re semaine dans la r\u00e9gion et il ne connaissait pas les personnes concern\u00e9es. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Robert Bruder m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de les regarder et de dire ce que j\u2019en pensais, afin de justifier une enqu\u00eate pour fraude, pour d\u00e9claration frauduleuse au sujet de sa maladie \u00bb. Il a regard\u00e9 les bandes un vendredi et on lui a dit que M. Croteau revenait au travail le lundi suivant. Il est clair \u00e0 mes yeux qu\u2019il pensait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9ellement stupide \u00bb de lui montrer la surveillance quelques jours avant son retour au travail. Dans son nouvel interrogatoire, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab je n\u2019aurais pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cela comme stupide et inutile si M. Croteau revenait au travail un mois plus tard ou s\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune date [de retour] connue \u00bb. Il ne disait pas que le fait de mettre M. Croteau sous surveillance \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9ellement stupide \u00bb ou qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une mesure prise dans un but ill\u00e9gitime.\n[119] Au sujet de l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant les [Traduction] \u00ab beaux enfants \u00bb de M. Croteau, M. Mau n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Cependant, bien que je croie que, d\u2019un point de vue subjectif, M. Croteau ait pu se sentir menac\u00e9 par cette remarque [Traduction] \u00ab sinistre \u00bb, d\u2019un point de vue objectif ce commentaire me semble n\u2019\u00eatre rien de plus qu\u2019un compliment, une fa\u00e7on de rompre la glace dans le cadre d\u2019une r\u00e9union du type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb stressante. Je signale que M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais eu de conflits personnels avec M. Mau. Il n\u2019y avait l\u00e0 aucune animosit\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant le fait que KS l\u2019avait bouscul\u00e9 dans le couloir, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9 une conclusion sur cet incident dans la section de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ayant trait \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9.\n[120] M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que son superviseur avait approuv\u00e9 sa demande de remboursement de frais de scolarit\u00e9, avant que TC lui dise que le CN ne l\u2019approuverait pas. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un geste de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pris pour cible du fait de ses absences l\u00e9gitimes du travail.\n[121] Le 30 mars 2004, TC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au plaignant que le CN jugeait qu\u2019il avait pris un cong\u00e9 sans permission, que KS avait tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec lui et qu\u2019il ne communiquait pas avec l\u2019entreprise.\n[122] Le 2 juillet 2004, TC avait dit \u00e0 M. Croteau, au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone : [Traduction] \u00ab j\u2019en ai parl\u00e9 avec nos agents des RH et nous ne sommes pas r\u00e9ellement dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 offrir une aide pour suivre des cours \u00bb. Quand il lui avait demand\u00e9 pourquoi pas, il avait r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab [e]h bien, cela d\u00e9pend de la personne. Cela d\u00e9pend du fait de savoir si la personne peut \u00eatre promue. Cela d\u00e9pend des cours qu\u2019elle suit. Je leur ai fait r\u00e9viser la demande et ils l\u2019ont refus\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[123] Lors de la r\u00e9union du 5 juillet 2004 tenue dans le bureau de TC et enregistr\u00e9e en secret par M. Croteau, TC a dit au plaignant qu\u2019il devait [Traduction] \u00ab faire montre des techniques de gestion appropri\u00e9es, venir au travail, \u00eatre productif, ne pas se blesser, et tout cela fait partie du travail de gestionnaire \u00bb. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Absolument. Et, si vous parlez \u00e0 qui que ce soit autour d\u2019ici, je suis probablement l\u2019une des personnes les plus soucieuses de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui se trouve ici. J\u2019observe les r\u00e8gles. Je suis \u00e0 la lettre les instructions qu\u2019on me donne [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[124] Plus loin, TC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaillait au CN depuis 30 ans et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait jamais bless\u00e9. Il a ensuite fait remarquer que la CSPAAT de l\u2019Ontario \u00e9tait plus souple \u2013 [Traduction] \u00ab c\u2019est presque du communisme \u00bb \u2013 que les commissions d\u2019indemnisation des accidents du travail des provinces de l\u2019Ouest (le CN a sermonn\u00e9 TC pour avoir fait cette remarque). TC a ensuite fait remarquer : [Traduction] \u00ab je n\u2019ai m\u00eame pas vu les bandes, car j\u2019ai entendu dire que vous jouiez \u00e0 la balle ou au soccer avec vos enfants ou quelque chose du genre [\u2026] et vous \u00eates en cong\u00e9 avec des indemnit\u00e9s pour accident de travail [\u2026] ce n\u2019est qu\u2019un exemple mineur. On vous oriente au d\u00e9part vers des fonctions all\u00e9g\u00e9es et, tout \u00e0 coup, voil\u00e0 que \u00e7a change pour tout \u00e0 fait inapte au travail, et nous ne pouvons plus communiquer avec vous pendant un mois \u00bb.\n[125] On a pos\u00e9 une question \u00e0 M. Colasimone au sujet du programme d\u2019aide aux \u00e9tudes du CN et de sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019approuver, et ensuite de rejeter, le remboursement des frais de scolarit\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moin a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne comprenait pas pourquoi la demande n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e une fois que le formulaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 :\nB. L\u2019all\u00e9gation no 2 : la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate de M. Mau le 15 d\u00e9cembre 2003\nC.

L\u2019all\u00e9gation no 7 : Le refus de rembourser les frais de scolarit\u00e9\n[Traduction] Pas de commentaire, sans plus d\u2019informations. Il manque quelque chose. Nous nous targuons de faire ce que nous disons que nous allons faire. Il manque des d\u00e9tails dans cette histoire. Il faudrait que la demande atteigne au moins le niveau du surintendant adjoint et que l\u2019on discute avec le DG; c\u2019est beaucoup d\u2019argent \u2026 il faut r\u00e9pondre aux crit\u00e8res et il faut certainement que l\u2019entreprise en tire un avantage.\nJe signale qu\u2019il semble que la demande n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e au niveau du surintendant adjoint, juste par son superviseur, et pour un cours seulement.\n[126] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages de vive voix et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire et pris en consid\u00e9ration les arguments juridiques, je ne conclus pas que l\u2019all\u00e9gation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s ne constituent pas du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience. J\u2019accepte le fait qu\u2019\u00e0 cause des faits qui ont eu lieu, la direction du CN (au niveau du surintendant adjoint ou \u00e0 un \u00e9chelon sup\u00e9rieur) n\u2019a pas cru que M. Croteau faisait montre d\u2019un comportement [Traduction] \u00ab propice \u00e0 une promotion \u00bb ou avait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre gestionnaire, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Cela ne veut pas dire que le CN ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 plus tard \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente. Par exemple, si le fait de communiquer par l\u2019entremise du syndicat n\u2019est pas un geste irr\u00e9gulier, du point de vue du CN, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait probablement pas une \u00ab bonne pratique de gestion \u00bb. Autrement dit, l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui aspire \u00e0 devenir gestionnaire, mais qui craint de faire affaire directement avec la direction n\u2019est pas un [Traduction] \u00ab bon candidat \u00bb. Me Bolter soutient que TC a fait des [Traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9somptions erron\u00e9es \u00bb et que [Traduction] \u00ab l\u2019employeur est revenu sur l\u2019entente pour les mauvaises raisons \u00bb, ce qui constitue du harc\u00e8lement. Cela est peut-\u00eatre bien vrai pour ce qui est des deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son argument, mais non pour le troisi\u00e8me : qu\u2019il y a eu ici du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience. Cela peut \u00eatre, tout au plus, une rupture de contrat ou un d\u00e9lit, mais cela d\u00e9borde le cadre de mon mandat et je ne tire aucune conclusion de cette nature.\n[127] Je suis conscient que M. Croteau a pu \u00eatre troubl\u00e9 par le fait que le CN a approuv\u00e9 \u2013 et ensuite rejet\u00e9 \u2013 sa demande d\u2019aide aux \u00e9tudes. Il ne fait aucun doute que M. Croteau \u00e9tait ambitieux et avait de lui-m\u00eame une image tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9 que celle qu\u2019avait le CN. Par exemple, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 TC qu\u2019il \u00e9tait l\u2019un des employ\u00e9s du groupe qui \u00e9tait le plus soucieux de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a dit qu\u2019il aspirait \u00e0 atteindre un jour le sommet de la direction du CN \u2013 le poste de chef de la direction, comme son mod\u00e8le, le chef de la direction (et aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l\u2019entreprise rivale, le Canadien Pacifique) Hunter Harrison.\n[128] Cette all\u00e9gation est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que TC, en [Traduction] \u00ab revenant \u00bb sur l\u2019accord du superviseur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul Sutor, s\u2019\u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 tort sur du ou\u00ef-dire et des renseignements erron\u00e9s provenant des agents des Ressources humaines et des Relations de travail du CN.\n[129] Il est vrai que l\u2019on avait fait part \u00e0 TC de quelques d\u00e9clarations relat\u00e9es et renseignements inexacts. Par exemple, lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Croteau recevait des indemnit\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 on l\u2019avait vu jouer au soccer et au basketball, c\u2019\u00e9tait techniquement faux. Cependant, \u00e0 ce moment, le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations de la CSPAAT. Mais, au\u2011del\u00e0 de cela, il y a le fait qu\u2019un gestionnaire est en droit d\u2019obtenir des renseignements aupr\u00e8s du Service des ressources humaines ou du Service des relations de travail au sein d\u2019une organisation. Et, il est possible qu\u2019il re\u00e7oive quelques renseignements erron\u00e9s et qu\u2019il s\u2019en serve, mais, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une intention irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re ou d\u2019un effet d\u00e9favorable visant \u00e0 exercer de la discrimination ou \u00e0 harceler, la LCDP n\u2019est pas en cause. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve, hormis la conviction de M. Croteau, que le CN (par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de KS, de TC ou d\u2019autres) a refus\u00e9 cette aide relative aux frais d\u2019un seul cours parce qu\u2019on le punissait ou qu\u2019on le prenait pour cible du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience. Les motifs \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette conclusion sont expliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, qui porte sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 7.\n[130] En janvier 2006, le CN a impos\u00e9 une suspension diff\u00e9r\u00e9e de 14 jours (qui n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de son dossier) pour avoir omis de communiquer avec le CN au cours des 20 jours d\u2019absence sans permission en mars 2004. Kevin Mau l\u2019avait convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate de type \u00ab interrogatoire \u00bb le 11 mai 2004. M. Croteau all\u00e8gue que la mesure disciplinaire elle-m\u00eame et le moment o\u00f9 celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e constituent un geste de harc\u00e8lement.\n[131] Selon mon examen de la preuve, il n\u2019y a que la conviction personnelle de M. Croteau que la mesure disciplinaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e et diff\u00e9r\u00e9e en vue de le harceler, et cette mesure est li\u00e9e au conflit qu\u2019il a eu avec KS le 19 novembre 2003. KS avait quitt\u00e9 Sarnia parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 promue au terminal d\u2019Oakville en avril 2004.\n[132] Pour ce qui est de la sanction disciplinaire elle-m\u00eame, Me Bolter a convenu que, d\u2019un point de vue technique, son client avait \u00e9t\u00e9 absent sans permission au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de 20 jours. La sanction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9r\u00e9e, ce qui voulait dire qu\u2019elle serait appliqu\u00e9e en cas de r\u00e9cidive. Elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e, et elle a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9e de son dossier du personnel. M\u00eame si le CN a eu tort d\u2019imposer cette sanction diff\u00e9r\u00e9e, je ne vois ici aucune violation de la LCDP pour harc\u00e8lement, aucun lien p\u00e9joratif \u00e9tabli avec le motif illicite que constitue la d\u00e9ficience.\n[133] Quant au moment o\u00f9 la sanction a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e, en contre\u2011interrogatoire, M. Croteau a convenu avec r\u00e9ticence que le CN avait attendu parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail entre le 14 mai 2004 et le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2007, p\u00e9riode durant laquelle il avait re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019ICD et ensuite d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e (ILD). Et il a convenu que le syndicat avait peut-\u00eatre demand\u00e9 au CN d\u2019attendre. J\u2019ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019a subi aucun pr\u00e9judice du fait de ce d\u00e9lai dans la suspension diff\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[134] M. Croteau a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief aupr\u00e8s du BAMCFC. Un arbitre l\u2019a rejet\u00e9.\n[135] En conclusion, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve concernant les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement de mani\u00e8re individuelle et ensuite de mani\u00e8re globale, et apr\u00e8s avoir appliqu\u00e9 les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune violation des droits que l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP conf\u00e8re \u00e0 M. Croteau.\n[136] Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue la quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de preuve, je conclus que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable, contraire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP. Cela exige une explication et une justification de la part du CN. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a produit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ) au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la LCDP et, dans le cadre de cette d\u00e9fense, qu\u2019elle avait fourni des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables ou, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la loi \u2013 sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive \u2013 aux termes du paragraphe 15(2). De ce fait, l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 s\u2019articulait principalement autour de la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019avait le CN de montrer qu\u2019elle avait pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables en vue de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de M. Croteau.\n[137] Le diagnostic et les troubles m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant sont essentiels pour comprendre ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 durant de cette p\u00e9riode de dix ans entre le moment de la blessure\/maladie\/d\u00e9ficience et la fin des audiences. Ses troubles m\u00e9dicaux ont influenc\u00e9 ses r\u00e9actions par rapport aux employ\u00e9s et aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements au CN, ce qui a fait obstacle \u00e0 un retour au travail fructueux. Il est difficile de d\u00e9terminer la mesure dans laquelle les pens\u00e9es, les r\u00e9actions et la conduite de M. Croteau sont attribuables \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 mentale pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode, mais il est certain que ses troubles m\u00e9dicaux, les effets qui en ont d\u00e9coul\u00e9 et les cons\u00e9quences souvent destructrices sont r\u00e9els, et non imagin\u00e9s.\n[138] Qu\u2019a-t-on diagnostiqu\u00e9 chez M. Croteau, et ce diagnostic a-t-il chang\u00e9 pendant les dix ann\u00e9es \u00e9coul\u00e9es entre 2003 et 2013? Son \u00e9quipe de sp\u00e9cialistes de la sant\u00e9 comprenait son m\u00e9decin de famille, le Dr Gannon, et son psychologue, M. AB. En outre, le Dr Larry Chad, psychiatre et chef adjoint de la psychiatrie au Toronto East General Hospital, a effectu\u00e9 trois examens m\u00e9dicaux ind\u00e9pendants (EMI) et a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le de premier plan. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du CN, les autres personnes qui sont intervenues sur le plan m\u00e9dical ont \u00e9t\u00e9 le Dr L\u00e9ger, son m\u00e9decin chef, ainsi que des infirmi\u00e8res du Service de SST du CN (autrefois appel\u00e9 Medisys, une entreprise priv\u00e9e dont le CN retenait les services par contrat). Il y a eu d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s du CN qui s\u2019occupaient de questions de retour au travail, mais ils se trouvaient de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du \u00ab mur \u00bb de la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9 pour prot\u00e9ger les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux confidentiels des employ\u00e9s, comme l\u2019agent de gestion des risques, le gestionnaire des ressources humaines, le coordonnateur des retours au travail, ainsi que divers gestionnaires ou superviseurs op\u00e9rationnels.\n[139] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les documents m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Chad, du Dr Gannon et de M. AB, ainsi que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences qui y sont faites dans les documents du service de SST du CN, je qualifierai son diagnostic et son \u00e9tat de \u00ab troubles anxieux \u00bb. Ces derniers englobent les sympt\u00f4mes d\u00e9crits, comme les crises de panique, les palpitations cardiaques, les naus\u00e9es, les vomissements et les sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019un TSPT.\n[140] Les restrictions mises par le CN dans les PTT concernant le retour au travail de M. Croteau ont \u00e9galement une certaine importance. Les quatre restrictions en question \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux re\u00e7us du Dr Gannon, du Dr Chad et de M. AB. Elles n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin des audiences, comme l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 le plaignant par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son avocat. Ces quatre restrictions sont les suivantes :\nH. L\u2019all\u00e9gation no 8 : TC s\u2019est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 tort sur du ou\u00ef-dire et des renseignements erron\u00e9s\nI. L\u2019all\u00e9gation no 9 : La mesure disciplinaire prise \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Croteau en 2006 pour les absences en mars 2004\nXII. L\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant le manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement\nA. Le diagnostic \/ les troubles m\u00e9dicaux de M. Croteau et les restrictions\n(1) ne peut occuper un poste essentiel ou sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ni accomplir de telles fonctions;\n(2) ne peut faire fonctionner du mat\u00e9riel ferroviaire en mouvement;\n(3) ne peut assumer des responsabilit\u00e9s concernant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes;\n(4) ne peut travailler seul.\n[141] Bien qu\u2019il soit difficile de mettre le doigt sur le moment exact o\u00f9 ces probl\u00e8mes sont apparus, la gen\u00e8se du conflit de travail sous-jacent, pour ce qui est du moins des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, semble \u00eatre la courte r\u00e9union qui a eu lieu le 19 novembre 2003 dans le bureau de KS. Ce qui semble aussi admis, c\u2019est que les troubles anxieux ont nettement empir\u00e9 ou se sont amplifi\u00e9s quand on a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau l\u2019existence des bandes de surveillance lors de la r\u00e9union d\u2019enqu\u00eate tenue le 11 mai 2004. Je ne saurais trop insister sur l\u2019importance que ce fait eu par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat mental de M. Croteau. Sans ce fait, il est probable que l\u2019escalade des faits ayant eu lieu dans les ann\u00e9es suivantes n\u2019aurait pas eu lieu et que la vie de M. Croteau aurait connu une issue diff\u00e9rente et plus positive, tant au travail qu\u2019\u00e0 la maison. Je souscris au t\u00e9moignage de M. AB, \u00e0 savoir que la m\u00e9fiance de M. Croteau \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du CN a atteint le stade o\u00f9 ses troubles anxieux sont devenus chroniques et se sont [Traduction] \u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s \u00bb au-del\u00e0 des [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb si souvent cit\u00e9s dans les rapports et les documents du Dr Chad, du Dr Gannon et de M. AB.\n[142] Dans le cas des troubles anxieux, comme dans celui d\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019affections, les m\u00e9decins et d\u2019autres fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 se fient \u00e0 ce que le patient leur dit et \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont il [Traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9sente \u00bb son \u00e9tat. Et, bien s\u00fbr, dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 mentale, il existe des tests qu\u2019il est possible de faire passer. En gardant cela \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, il vaut la peine d\u2019examiner si le Dr Chad, le Dr Gannon et M. AB seraient arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente au sujet du diagnostic, du pronostic et du traitement de M. Croteau en vue d\u2019un retour au travail au CN, ce qui inclut la question de savoir s\u2019il aurait un jour pu retourner au travail avec succ\u00e8s au CN, si ceux-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de certains faits cruciaux.\n[143] En ce qui concerne les renseignements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, M. Croteau a fait savoir qu\u2019il \u00e9prouvait un sentiment constant de peur ou de parano\u00efa face \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que KS puisse kidnapper ses deux fils, et il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de lui accorder des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux afin qu\u2019il puisse vendre sa maison et d\u00e9m\u00e9nager car, notamment, il craint de laisser le CN savoir o\u00f9 il vit. Il a clairement exprim\u00e9 qu\u2019il craignait [Traduction] \u00ab que le CN et KS sachent o\u00f9 [il vivait] \u00bb. Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il souhaitait d\u00e9m\u00e9nager parce que la maison \u00e9tait associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode n\u00e9gative dans sa vie ou parce que le CN lui ferait du mal, il a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab les deux \u00bb. M. AB a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de cela, et que de telles peurs n\u2019avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9es lors des 150 s\u00e9ances qu\u2019ils avaient eues ensemble. Il n\u2019y a eu aucune mention de cela dans les trois EMI du Dr Chad.\n[144] Je soup\u00e7onne aussi que, si le Dr Chad \u2013 le seul psychiatre \u00e0 avoir vu le plaignant \u2013 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au fait de ces questions, celles-ci auraient occup\u00e9 une place importante dans ses EMI, et que son diagnostic ou ses recommandations auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents quant aux perspectives de retour au travail de M. Croteau en tant que chef de train au CN.\n[145] Je signale que le CN \u00e9tait en droit de se fier aux avis m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Chad et du Dr Gannon, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019opinion psychologique de M. AB. Il est possible d\u2019inf\u00e9rer, \u00e0 partir de la LCDP, que l\u2019employeur a le devoir de chercher \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements pertinents sur l\u2019employ\u00e9 et ses besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement, et que l\u2019employ\u00e9 a le devoir correspondant de faciliter la collecte de ces renseignements complets et exacts.\n[146] Par ailleurs, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, comme M. Croteau est toujours un employ\u00e9 du CN pendant qu\u2019il est en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9 et que le CN est encore tenu de r\u00e9pondre aux \u00ab besoins \u00bb qu\u2019entra\u00eene sa d\u00e9ficience, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont pertinents pour ce qui est de savoir s\u2019il serait possible de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces \u00ab besoins \u00bb sans s\u2019imposer de contrainte excessive, l\u2019objectif \u00e9tant qu\u2019il soit capable d\u2019accomplir les fonctions essentielles du travail pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, soit celui de chef de train.\n[147] Je tiens aussi \u00e0 signaler que, ni dans les documents m\u00e9dicaux, ni dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. AB, ni dans les observations de l\u2019avocat du plaignant, on a laiss\u00e9 entendre que M. Croteau n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de comprendre ce qu\u2019il disait ou faisait, y compris au cours des audiences. L\u2019avocat du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait que son client \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retenir ses services et \u00e0 lui donner des directives pendant tout le processus. M\u00eame si M. Croteau a subi de nombreuses crises de panique au cours des audiences, des crises pour lesquelles nous avons souvent fait des pauses, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de participer du d\u00e9but jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin, et cela inclut son propre t\u00e9moignage durant plusieurs jours. Cela ne vise pas \u00e0 minimiser les r\u00e9els sympt\u00f4mes dont il subissait les effets durant ses crises de panique.\n[148] Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour le plaignant, m\u00eame si ce dernier all\u00e8gue que l\u2019on a omis de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et continue de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin des audiences, il reconna\u00eet que le CN y a tout de m\u00eame r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 certains moments entre les ann\u00e9es 2007 et 2013. Cependant, son avocat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer ces mesures d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9cises.\n[149] Le 8 janvier 2004, M. Croteau s\u2019est bless\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule en se servant d\u2019un frein \u00e0 main. Deux mois plus tard, le 10 mars 2004, il s\u2019est bless\u00e9 de nouveau, cette fois-ci au genou, en descendant d\u2019un train. Il s\u2019est rendu \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et le premier m\u00e9decin qui l\u2019a vu lui a remis un billet pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il devait prendre cong\u00e9 pour quatre jours, et qu\u2019il pouvait retourner au travail avec les all\u00e8gements n\u00e9cessaires. Je signale que KS tentait de le joindre parce qu\u2019elle lui avait trouv\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es. Essentiellement, le CN \u00e9tait, \u00e0 ce stade, pr\u00eat \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses \u00ab besoins \u00bb. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Croteau a pris un cong\u00e9 de 20 jours, du 10 au 31 mars. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son syndicat de communiquer avec le CN au sujet de son absence et de fournir les documents requis. Il y a eu un probl\u00e8me de communication, c\u2019est le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire, parce que KS a tent\u00e9 de le joindre (elle a fait 58 appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques). Le CN a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait absent\u00e9 sans permission. Il est retourn\u00e9 au travail du 1er au 18 avril 2004 et, ensuite, a pris de nouveau cong\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d\u2019un probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel (non li\u00e9 \u00e0 la blessure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule ou au genou) le 19 avril. Il est revenu le 21 avril, pour repartir le 14 mai 2004.\n[150] Le 23 avril 2004, KS a eu une conversation [Traduction] \u00ab discourtoise \u00bb avec l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant (qui a qualifi\u00e9e KS de \u00ab salope \u00bb) et une autre avec la belle-s\u0153ur du plaignant. Dans les deux cas, KS voulait savoir o\u00f9 se trouvait M. Croteau. \u00c0 ce stade, sur sa recommandation et avec l\u2019accord de la haute direction, on a ordonn\u00e9 de surveiller M. Croteau \u00e0 deux reprises \u2013 la premi\u00e8re fois en mars et la seconde en avril, \u00e0 son insu, jusqu\u2019au 11 mai 2004. \u00c0 ce stade, le CN avait des doutes au sujet des blessures de M. Croteau ainsi que de ses absences du travail.\n[151] Entre le 14 mai 2004 et le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2007, le plaignant n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 au CN. Il a par la suite \u00e9puis\u00e9 ses prestations d\u2019ICD et ensuite d\u2019ILD. Il \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tout \u00e0 fait inapte au travail. Il a aussi re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Entre 2004 et 2007, il y a eu une p\u00e9riode de trois semaines pendant laquelle M. Croteau n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins. \u00c0 part cette br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode, le CN n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement tenu, sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de trois ans. Durant ce temps, le CN, qui avait re\u00e7u le premier EMI du Dr Chad, dans lequel figurait le diagnostic et l\u2019avis d\u2019expert selon lequel le probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab li\u00e9 au travail [\u2026] sans aucune restriction due \u00e0 des facteurs psychiatriques \u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ferait dispara\u00eetre les [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb \u2013 KS et TC \u2013 de l\u2019\u00e9quation en termes d\u2019\u00e9ventuels rapports avec le plaignant.\nB. Les mesures d\u2019accommodement : historique et conclusions\nLe Dr Chad et le premier compte rendu d\u2019EMI dat\u00e9 du 10 juin 2004\n[152] Le Dr Chad a \u00e9crit que [Traduction] \u00ab M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avant le mois d\u2019avril ou, mai de 2003, il se sentait bien, tant sur le plan physique qu\u2019affectif \u00bb. Il n\u2019avait eu [Traduction] \u00ab auparavant pas de d\u00e9pression s\u00e9rieuse, de changements d\u2019humeur ou de crises d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, pas de contacts psychiatriques, n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 suicidaire et n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9 sur le plan psychiatrique \u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son patron [KS] ne s\u2019est pas occup\u00e9 de son cas avant novembre 2003 \u00bb.\n[153] Selon le Dr Chad, M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait deux crises d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 par jour et qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait pas \u00e0 se concentrer : [Traduction] \u00ab Je ne peux m\u00eame pas vider le lave-vaisselle sans le faire de travers. \u00bb Cela posait un probl\u00e8me, \u00e0 cause du travail dangereux que font les chefs de train. Il a ensuite \u00e9crit : [Traduction] \u00ab M. Croteau consid\u00e8re que son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9coule essentiellement du stress li\u00e9 au travail et de sa peur d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00bb. \u00c0 la page 7, le m\u00e9decin a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] \u00ab On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau s\u2019il pensait \u00eatre capable de travailler pour un autre patron \u00e0 ce stade-ci, et il a r\u00e9pondu \u201cabsolument\u201d. Il a dit qu\u2019il pense pouvoir travailler si ses probl\u00e8mes de travail sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9s \u00bb. La notion du [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e8glement des probl\u00e8mes de travail \u00bb deviendra un \u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 du diagnostic et des tentatives de retour au travail. Le Dr Chad a signal\u00e9 que le plaignant avait fait remarquer que, depuis d\u00e9cembre 2003, [Traduction] \u00ab son patron [KS] a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019en prendre \u00e0 lui \u00e0 cause de ses probl\u00e8mes d\u2019assiduit\u00e9 et de ses accidents \u00bb. Le Dr Chad a aussi \u00e9crit que M. Croteau avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un [Traduction] \u00ab avocat s\u2019occupait de sa poursuite pour harc\u00e8lement et de sa poursuite pour intimidation aupr\u00e8s des Droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[154] Le Dr Chad a mentionn\u00e9 que le plaignant donnait l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre [Traduction] \u00ab raisonnablement clair \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab coh\u00e9rent \u00bb. [Traduction] \u00ab Dans l\u2019ensemble, il ne para\u00eet pas tr\u00e8s d\u00e9prim\u00e9 ou anxieux [\u2026] Il n\u2019y avait aucun signe de r\u00e9flexion psychotique \u00bb. Du point de vue diagnostique, selon le DSM\u2011IV, le Dr Chad a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019axe I ([Traduction] \u00ab Trouble de l\u2019adaptation avec anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mixte et \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif et probl\u00e8me professionnel \u00bb) s\u2019applique. Il a \u00e9crit ce qui suit, aux pages 13 et 14 :\n[Traduction] L\u2019historique d\u00e9note que M. Croteau a acquis un trouble de l\u2019adaptation avec anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mixte et \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif par rapport \u00e0 son stress g\u00e9n\u00e9ral li\u00e9 au travail, aux probl\u00e8mes avec son patron, et \u00e0 la douleur associ\u00e9e \u00e0 [son probl\u00e8me m\u00e9dical personnel]. Il ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci aux crit\u00e8res diagnostiques qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un \u00e9pisode d\u00e9pressif majeur. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, il ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 ce stade-ci aux crit\u00e8res diagnostiques d\u2019un trouble de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail sont pour lui d\u2019importants facteurs pr\u00e9cipitants qui l\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 se sentir d\u00e9prim\u00e9, anxieux, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 arr\u00eater de travailler et \u00e0 continuer de s\u2019absenter du travail. Il a aussi un probl\u00e8me professionnel.\n[\u2026]\nIl est possible que M. Croteau continue d\u2019\u00e9prouver quelques sympt\u00f4mes mixtes, l\u00e9gers et intermittents, d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression, mais ces derniers ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas d\u2019une nature ou d\u2019une gravit\u00e9 qui l\u2019am\u00e8neraient \u00e0 l\u2019emp\u00eacher totalement de travailler \u00e0 ce stade-ci, si l\u2019on r\u00e9glait les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail.\n[155] L\u00e0 encore, \u00e0 la page 14, le Dr Chad a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Les sympt\u00f4mes psychiatriques actuels de M. Croteau ne sont pas assez graves pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher de retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein, d\u00e8s que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. Sans cela, il serait probablement trop anxieux pour travailler de mani\u00e8re s\u00e9curitaire et efficace, du fait de son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de ses probl\u00e8mes de concentration.\n[156] Enfin, il a conclu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] Si l\u2019on r\u00e9glait les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail, M. Croteau devrait \u00eatre capable de travailler de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 ce stade-ci sans aucune restriction due \u00e0 des facteurs psychiatriques. Il souscrit \u00e0 cela. [\u2026] Le pronostic d\u2019une am\u00e9lioration constante est bon, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019on r\u00e8gle ses probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[157] Il est important de signaler qu\u2019en date du 10 juin 2004, le Dr Chad, psychiatre, dit au CN que M. Croteau pourrait retourner travailler \u00e0 temps plein en tant que chef de train [traduction] \u00ab sans aucune restriction due \u00e0 des facteurs psychiatriques \u00bb dans la mesure o\u00f9 [Traduction] \u00ab on r\u00e8gle les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb. \u00c0 ce stade, les [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb sont le conflit entre le plaignant, KS et TC.\n[158] Le 25 ao\u00fbt 2004, M. Croteau a eu sa premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance avec M. AB. Le 5 novembre 2004, ce dernier a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] \u00ab il semble que le retour au travail de M. Croteau soit en suspens, \u00e0 cause de probl\u00e8mes de nature plus juridique, et pas tant de nature psychologique \u00bb.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me compte rendu d\u2019EMI dat\u00e9 du 4 janvier 2005\n[159] Sept mois plus tard, le Dr Chad a vu de nouveau le plaignant pour un deuxi\u00e8me EMI. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, M. Croteau \u00e9tait encore en cong\u00e9 et recevait des prestations. Il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne et avait port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s du CPVP au sujet du probl\u00e8me de la surveillance. Le Dr Chad a signal\u00e9 que le plaignant avait dit qu\u2019il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir la nuit et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait aux prises avec des crises de panique et des probl\u00e8mes de concentration.\n[160] Aux pages 8 et 9, le Dr Chad a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau pourquoi il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore retourn\u00e9 au travail, et il a r\u00e9pondu que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce que les probl\u00e8mes de travail n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. Il a dit que, si le CN l\u2019autorisait maintenant \u00e0 revenir, il ne voudrait pas le faire avant que les probl\u00e8mes de travail soient r\u00e9gl\u00e9s. Si les deux patrons [KS et TC] dont il se plaignait n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0, il retournerait maintenant. [\u2026] \u201cJe n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention de me soumettre \u00e0 une vengeance\u201d. \u00bb\n[161] Le Dr Chad a pos\u00e9 le diagnostic suivant aux pages 13 et 14 :\n[Traduction] Il semble \u00eatre victime de stress et avoir acquis un trouble de l\u2019adaptation avec anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mixte et \u00e9tat d\u00e9pressif. [\u2026] Il ne r\u00e9pond pas \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res diagnostiques qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un trouble de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne r\u00e9pond pas aux crit\u00e8res diagnostiques qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 un trouble de stress post\u2011traumatique. [\u2026] Si l\u2019on tient compte du fait que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail sont les principaux facteurs pr\u00e9cipitants et perp\u00e9tuants de son stress, de son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et du fait qu\u2019il ne continue pas de travailler, il a aussi un probl\u00e8me professionnel.\n[\u2026]\nM. Croteau continue peut-\u00eatre de souffrir de quelques sympt\u00f4mes mixtes, l\u00e9gers et intermittents d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression, mais ces derniers ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas d\u2019une nature ou d\u2019une gravit\u00e9 qui l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de travailler \u00e0 ce stade-ci. [\u2026] Il devrait pouvoir rencontrer son employeur \u00e0 ce stade-ci et s\u2019occuper des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail.\n[\u2026]\nSi M. Croteau retournait au travail \u00e0 ce stade-ci, sans que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9s, il pourrait avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir ses t\u00e2ches ordinaires \u00e0 cause de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de quelques probl\u00e8mes de concentration et de quelques difficult\u00e9s de dur\u00e9e d\u2019attention. Le fait de ne pas r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail ne fera que perp\u00e9tuer ses sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 mixte et de d\u00e9pression et prolonger son absence du travail [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nSi l\u2019on r\u00e8gle les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail, il ne sera pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019imposer de restrictions pr\u00e9cises au sujet du retour au travail de M. Croteau, sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et \u00e0 plein temps. [\u2026] M. Croteau n\u2019a pas besoin de m\u00e9dicaments psychotropes \u00e0 ce stade-ci. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019orienter vers un psychiatre pour le moment. [\u2026] La principale intervention n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce stade-ci consiste \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ses probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail. Il semble s\u2019agir davantage d\u2019un probl\u00e8me li\u00e9 au travail que d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de d\u00e9ficience psychiatrique. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[162] En janvier 2005, le CN ayant re\u00e7u la deuxi\u00e8me EMI du Dr Chad, l\u2019AGR Bob Leonard a \u00e9crit au plaignant pour dire qu\u2019il aimerait le rencontrer en vue de parler de son retour de travail. Ce geste s\u2019est heurt\u00e9 \u00e0 une vive opposition de la part du plaignant et du syndicat, qui le repr\u00e9sentait. Ils ne voulaient m\u00eame pas parler du retour au travail. M. Croteau a dit qu\u2019il pensait que le CN essayait de l\u2019obliger \u00e0 revenir trop t\u00f4t pour travailler comme chef de train. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cela. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que l\u2019on proposait simplement de tenir une r\u00e9union pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 un retour au travail. Je suis d\u2019accord avec Me McFadden, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela constituait un refus injustifiable de participer au [Traduction] \u00ab dialogue d\u2019accommodement \u00bb et que cela aurait pu se solder par de graves cons\u00e9quences pour M. Croteau, lesquelles auraient pu aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement.\n[163] Le 1er mars 2005, une r\u00e9union importante a eu lieu en vue de discuter de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne du plaignant contre KS et TC. Selon la note au dossier, le syndicat voulait discuter d\u2019un retour au travail, mais M. Gallagher a r\u00e9pondu que la r\u00e9union avait pour but de traiter de la plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne de M. Croteau. Il est \u00e0 noter qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e9galement au courant de la surveillance que le CN avait exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019entremise d\u2019une agence priv\u00e9e d\u2019enqu\u00eate et qu\u2019il manifestait clairement des signes de troubles anxieux. La r\u00e9union a eu lieu avec M. Gallagher, le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse, ainsi que trois membres sup\u00e9rieurs du syndicat. Lors de cette r\u00e9union, M. Croteau a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa [Traduction] \u00ab liste de souhaits \u00bb en vue de r\u00e9gler la plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne. [Traduction] \u00ab Je me fiais \u00e0 ce que voulait le syndicat \u00bb a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Croteau \u00e0 la barre. Me McFadden a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il essayait de [Traduction] \u00ab se cacher derri\u00e8re le syndicat \u00bb et d\u2019en rejeter le bl\u00e2me sur lui. Le plaignant a dit que non. M. Gallagher a d\u2019embl\u00e9e dit qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une liste [Traduction] \u00ab souple \u00bb et il les a incit\u00e9s \u00e0 faire un peu de [Traduction] \u00ab marchandage, de n\u00e9gocier \u00bb. Apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue les t\u00e9moignages du plaignant et de M. Gallagher, de m\u00eame que la liste figurant dans la note au dossier d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en tant que preuve, je conclus que M. Croteau voulait, notamment :\n(1) que KS et TC soient sanctionn\u00e9s et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame cong\u00e9di\u00e9s;\n(2) des excuses du CN ainsi que de KS et de TC, envers lui et sa famille;\n(3) un d\u00e9dommagement pour perte de revenus et de prestations.\n[164] Dans la note au dossier, M. Gallagher a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 des \u00e9claircissements au sujet de la r\u00e9paration que M. Croteau souhaitait obtenir. Apr\u00e8s une d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration assez longue, M. Croteau a donn\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse suivante : \u201c\u00c0 titre de r\u00e9paration, une mesure dissuasive d\u2019un dollar serait peut-\u00eatre trop et un million de dollars ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas assez, nous ne saurons pas tant que le processus n\u2019est pas termin\u00e9\u201d. \u00bb Le plaignant a parl\u00e9 du sens de ce passage : [Traduction] \u00ab Si M. Gallagher faisait une enqu\u00eate appropri\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, en fin de compte, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019argent. C\u2019est le syndicat qui me l\u2019a dit. \u00bb Me McFadden a r\u00e9pondu en demandant au plaignant comment il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que le CN r\u00e9agisse \u00e0 une telle proposition. Sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suivante : [Traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est une bonne question. Mon intention \u00e9tait de secouer un peu le service des RH. \u00bb L\u2019avocat du CN a pos\u00e9 la question suivante : [Traduction] \u00ab Votre intention \u00e9tait de concevoir un r\u00e8glement qui \u00e9tait en quelque sorte ridicule de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on ne vous parle plus? \u00bb Le plaignant a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord. Quand je suis intervenu et ai laiss\u00e9 entendre que cela pouvait ressembler \u00e0 un obstacle pour le CN, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu [Traduction] \u00ab Vous avez peut-\u00eatre raison. Le syndicat m\u2019a laiss\u00e9 tomber peu de temps apr\u00e8s [\u2026] Je puis comprendre que le CN consid\u00e9rerait peut-\u00eatre cela comme un signe que ce type ne veut pas r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me, retourner au travail. \u00bb Moi aussi je puis comprendre comment M. Gallagher et le CN sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 cette conclusion \u2013 que, pour gu\u00e9rir et retourner au travail, il fallait que le CN souscrive \u00e0 la [Traduction] \u00ab liste de souhaits \u00bb qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de.\n[165] Ce qu\u2019il y a de remarquable au sujet des renseignements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, c\u2019est que, tout juste quelques semaines plus t\u00f4t, M. Croteau et le syndicat refusaient ne serait-ce que de tenir une r\u00e9union pour discuter d\u2019un retour au travail. Pourtant, M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 1er mars 2005 que, si le CN souscrivait \u00e0 la [Traduction] \u00ab liste de souhaits \u00bb, il retournerait travailler comme chef de train imm\u00e9diatement et sans restrictions. Me McFadden l\u2019a contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 sur ce point et a pos\u00e9 la question suivante : [Traduction] \u00ab La note pr\u00e9cise que, si les conditions sont remplies, vous seriez de retour au travail en mars 2005 et que vous exerceriez vos t\u00e2ches compl\u00e8tes, sans restriction, \u00e0 titre de chef de train; pourtant, vous avez dit aujourd\u2019hui que vous ne le pouviez pas, vous \u00e9tiez en mauvais \u00e9tat \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0? \u00bb M. Croteau a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Je vois ce que vous voulez dire. \u00bb Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 douter de sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et de sa bonne foi quant \u00e0 un retour au travail au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Cela ajoute \u00e9galement foi \u00e0 l\u2019argument du CN selon lequel M. Croteau avait toujours un [Traduction] \u00ab plan de rechange \u00bb \u2013 poursuivre sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement interne, [Traduction] \u00ab attendre le rapport du CPVP \u00bb, [Traduction] \u00ab s\u2019adresser au BAMCFC [grief] \u00bb, et attendre que ses prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9puisent \u2013, mais pas retourner au travail. Je signale aussi qu\u2019\u00e0 la page 2 de son \u00e9ventuel \u00ab contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00bb du refus de la demande d\u2019arbitrage aupr\u00e8s du BAMCFC (envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au Conseil canadien de la magistrature, au CPVP, etc., mais jamais d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en tant que demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire), M. Croteau a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab Depuis les trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, je collabore avec mon syndicat quant aux d\u00e9cisions prises au sujet de son plan d\u2019action, qui est de faire en sorte que je demeure relev\u00e9 de mes fonctions \u00e0 cause de ma maladie pendant que je re\u00e7oit des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e et que j\u2019attends l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Commissariat \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[166] Le plaignant a contest\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate pour harc\u00e8lement de M. Gallagher, tant en ce qui concerne la conclusion que le processus suivi. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen que j\u2019ai fait de la preuve, je conclus que l\u2019enqu\u00eate de M. Gallagher (et celle de Mme Fusco, qui y a travaill\u00e9 avant de partir en cong\u00e9) \u00e9tait \u00e9quitable et raisonnable, tant pour ce qui est de son d\u00e9roulement que de sa conclusion. Les \u00e9tapes du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les suivantes : le Service des ressources humaines du CN a re\u00e7u la plainte \u00e9crite, plus longue et plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e que la plupart des autres, et l\u2019a examin\u00e9e; il a communiqu\u00e9 avec les auteurs pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s pour obtenir leur r\u00e9ponse \u00e9crite; Mme Fusco a \u00e9tabli un tableau comparant qui avait dit quoi sur des sujets diff\u00e9rents; une r\u00e9union a eu lieu le 1er mars 2005, en compagnie de son \u00e9pouse et de repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat; M. Gallagher a clairement dit qu\u2019il accepterait \u00e0 la suite de la r\u00e9union d\u2019autres observations du syndicat, qui n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es; M. Gallagher a \u00e9galement invit\u00e9 le syndicat \u00e0 communiquer d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, s\u2019il y en avait, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la plainte, ce qu\u2019il a fait (bandes de conversations enregistr\u00e9es entre M. Croteau et TC); M. Gallagher a invit\u00e9 un coll\u00e8gue d\u2019un rang sup\u00e9rieur, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de la plainte, \u00e0 \u00e9couter les bandes et \u00e0 faire part de son opinion.\n[167] M. Croteau a eu une possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de pr\u00e9senter son dossier de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 M. Gallagher. Ce dernier est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle de M. Croteau. M. Gallagher a conclu que les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement port\u00e9es contre KS et TC n\u2019avaient aucun fondement. Dans le pire des cas, KS avait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab autoritaire \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab agressive \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Croteau, mais cela ne constituait pas un geste de harc\u00e8lement. Je suis conscient que M. Croteau n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion de M. Gallagher, mais, \u00e0 un certain point, il faut que le processus prenne fin.\n[168] Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9, M. Croteau \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 et recevait des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas capable de travailler. Cependant, le CN a bel et bien pris certaines mesures pour favoriser son \u00e9ventuel retour au travail au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Premi\u00e8rement, le CN s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9 des [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb que le Dr Chad avait relev\u00e9s; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, KS et TC. KS avait \u00e9t\u00e9 promue \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 Oakville \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2004, et M. Mau prendrait la place de TC si jamais il devait y avoir une interaction quelconque entre le plaignant et ce dernier. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le CN s\u2019effor\u00e7ait de trouver du travail au plaignant. Le CN a propos\u00e9 un poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins, celui de surveillant Incendie\/S\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 Sarnia, le 15 mars 2005. M. Croteau a voulu montrer cette offre au Dr Gannon pour voir si elle correspondait \u00e0 ses restrictions. Deux semaines plus tard, le 28 mars 2005, la Great-West, compagnie d\u2019assurance-vie, a accept\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019ILD. M. Croteau a pris neuf mois avant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce projet de PTT. En d\u00e9cembre 2005, le CN a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le poste lui-m\u00eame n\u2019existait plus.\n[169] Le 30 novembre 2005, M. AB a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019accord pour dire que [Traduction] \u00ab un retour graduel au travail, au sein d\u2019un poste non sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tout en v\u00e9rifiant sa symptomatologie, est justifi\u00e9 [\u2026] \u00bb. Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2005, signalant la [Traduction] \u00ab grave crise de panique \u00bb que M. Croteau avait r\u00e9cemment subie en tentant de retourner au travail, il a recommand\u00e9 que son client reste en arr\u00eat de travail pendant quelques mois.\n[170] Pendant pr\u00e8s de trois ans (2004-2007), M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 et a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union importante tenue apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9puisement de ses prestations a eu lieu le 4 avril 2007, \u00e0 la gare de triage Mac, \u00e0 Concord, au nord de Toronto. \u00c9taient pr\u00e9sents M. Croteau, M. King, le repr\u00e9sentant du syndicat, M. Gallagher, ainsi que les infirmi\u00e8res de la SST Jackie Andersen et Marge McCauley (par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone). M. Croteau, comme il l\u2019avait souvent fait, a enregistr\u00e9 en secret la r\u00e9union. La bande a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cout\u00e9e lors des audiences. La r\u00e9union avait pour but de discuter du retour au travail du plaignant. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9vident que M. Croteau voulait ressasser ses all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement ant\u00e9rieures, que M. Gallagher avait rejet\u00e9es au moment o\u00f9 son enqu\u00eate avait pris fin, en avril 2005. En avril 2007, la premi\u00e8re de ces all\u00e9gations (la conversation tenue le 19 novembre 2003 dans le bureau de KS) datait de trois ans et demi. \u00c0 la d\u00e9charge de M. King, celui-ci a dit au plaignant de \u2013 au propre (et au figur\u00e9) \u2013 [Traduction] \u00ab fermer ses dossiers [de plainte] \u00bb sur cette question et de se concentrer sur le retour au travail. M. Croteau a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Je veux juste que l\u2019on traite de cette s\u00e9rie-l\u00e0 de mensonges. \u00bb \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, M. Croteau \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 depuis trois ans, et recevait une fraction du revenu qu\u2019il recevait avant ses prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. On peut comprendre son obsession, sa persistance, son ent\u00eatement \u2013 quel que soit le mot que l\u2019on utilise pour d\u00e9crire cet \u00e9tat \u2013 \u00e0 ne pas laisser tomber cette question. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. AB a dit de M. Croteau qu\u2019il \u00e9tait une personne qui [Traduction] \u00ab ne va pas renoncer, pas dans un sens n\u00e9gatif [\u2026] Il est comme un chien \u00e0 qui l\u2019on donne un os, il ne le l\u00e2chera pas [\u2026] Il a des principes extr\u00eamement bien arr\u00eat\u00e9s. Quand il a une id\u00e9e en t\u00eate, il ne la l\u00e2che pas \u00bb \u00c0 ce stade, le CN avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re raisonnable le premier et le deuxi\u00e8me EMI du Dr Chad, \u00e0 savoir que les [Traduction] \u00ab facteurs psychiatriques \u00bb en cause \u00e9taient les [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb que repr\u00e9sentaient KS et TC. Cependant, en r\u00e9trospective et avec le recul n\u00e9cessaire, il est \u00e9vident que les [Traduction] \u00ab questions li\u00e9es au travail \u00bb d\u00e9passaient le cadre de la pr\u00e9vention de tout rapport de KS et de TC avec M. Croteau et englobaient la surveillance, de m\u00eame que le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour harc\u00e8lement et son issue et ses conclusions.\n[171] \u00c0 la r\u00e9union du 4 avril 2007, les participants ont discut\u00e9 de plusieurs sujets :\nC. La p\u00e9riode d\u2019accommodement d\u2019avril 2007 \u00e0 mai 2008\n(1) M. Gallagher a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau que la sanction disciplinaire diff\u00e9r\u00e9e de 2006 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9e de son dossier, et il a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 cet effet aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union. M. Croteau a reconnu que [Traduction] \u00ab c\u2019\u00e9tait un bon d\u00e9part \u00bb;\n(2) M. Croteau voulait qu\u2019on lui paie le [Traduction] \u00ab tarif relatif \u00e0 la loco\u2011commande \u00bb applicable \u00e0 une journ\u00e9e de travail compl\u00e8te \u00e0 son retour au travail, m\u00eame s\u2019il effectuait moins que le quart normal de huit heures. M. Gallagher a dit qu\u2019il examinerait cela. Il l\u2019a fait et a transmis un courriel \u00e0 Denis Fournier, au Service de la paye du CN. M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui avait \u00ab promis \u00bb qu\u2019il serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ce tarif. L\u2019examen que j\u2019ai fait de la preuve d\u00e9note le contraire. Sur la bande, on peut entendre M. King dire qu\u2019ils aimeraient que le CN examine cette possibilit\u00e9 et M. Gallagher a accept\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tudier;\n(3) les participants ont discut\u00e9 de la question du retour au travail et de l\u2019emplacement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la bande, M. Croteau a dit : [Traduction] \u00ab Je retournerai au travail \u00e0 Sarnia \u00bb. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 la bande et examin\u00e9 les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (de vive voix et documentaire), je conclus que le CN pensait raisonnablement que M. Croteau n\u2019\u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 un retour au travail au terminal de Sarnia, et \u00e0 nulle part d\u2019autre.\n[172] Il ne fait aucun doute qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une r\u00e9union \u00e9motive. M. Croteau pleurait et \u00e9tait secou\u00e9 de sanglots. Selon le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant, peu apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9union, le syndicat (qui, selon ce qu\u2019il a dit, pensait que le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de M. Gallagher \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab exact \u00bb) l\u2019a [Traduction] \u00ab laiss\u00e9 tomber \u00bb et la relation entre le syndicat et M. Croteau est devenue n\u00e9gative et antagoniste, ce qui a amen\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte relative au devoir de juste repr\u00e9sentation pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019article 37 du Code canadien du travail aupr\u00e8s du Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le CCRI).\n[173] Le plan du CN, en collaboration avec le plaignant et le syndicat, \u00e9tait de faciliter le retour au travail du plaignant, l\u2019objectif \u00e9ventuel \u00e9tant de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans le poste de chef de train qu\u2019il occupait avant son accident\/sa d\u00e9ficience. Cette mesure \u00e9tait conforme au diagnostic et aux restrictions que le Dr Chad et le Dr Gannon avaient \u00e9tablis. Aucun d\u00e9lai n\u2019\u00e9tait grav\u00e9 dans la pierre, mais, de toute \u00e9vidence, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de faire des progr\u00e8s si l\u2019on voulait atteindre cet objectif \u00e9ventuel.\n[174] Le CN a convenu de payer le plaignant pour qu\u2019il consulte M. AB dans le cadre d\u2019un programme de [Traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9sensibilisation \u00bb. Au d\u00e9but, M. Croteau a eu de la difficult\u00e9 ne serait-ce que pour entrer dans le terminal du CN \u00e0 Sarnia. Le CN a fini par payer les s\u00e9ances de counseling de M. AB pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019environ un an, ce qui \u00e9tait un d\u00e9lai plus long que celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 anticip\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 au d\u00e9part. Dans le cadre de ce programme, M. Croteau devait tout d\u2019abord travailler avec M. AB sur des aspects de base : se rendre [Traduction] \u00ab sur les lieux \u00bb et subir ensuite un [Traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9breffage \u00bb. M. AB serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 pour se rendre sur place avec le plaignant. L\u2019espoir \u00e9tait que le plaignant s\u2019am\u00e9liorerait au point d\u2019\u00eatre capable d\u2019entreprendre un PTT. \u00c0 mesure que M. Croteau pourrait en faire davantage, on lui assignerait des t\u00e2ches additionnelles. L\u2019\u00e9valuation serait continue, et le [Traduction] \u00ab mur \u00bb de confidentialit\u00e9 demeurerait \u00e9rig\u00e9 entre le service de SST, le service de retour au travail et le secteur op\u00e9rationnel.\n[175] En ao\u00fbt 2007, le CN a propos\u00e9 que le plaignant soit jumel\u00e9 au surveillant Joe Russell lors du quart de nuit. Un PTT, contenant les quatre conditions\/restrictions ant\u00e9rieurement mentionn\u00e9es, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9. Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2007, il y a eu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique entre Mme Paquet, le plaignant et M. AB en vue de discuter du PTT.\n[176] Le poste de surveillant est un poste sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et il \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 par les restrictions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Croteau. Cependant, ce dernier ne ferait qu\u2019\u00ab observer \u00bb le surveillant. Ce plan de retour au travail assorti d\u2019accommodements n\u2019a dur\u00e9 qu\u2019un seul quart de travail. Le m\u00e9decin en chef du CN, le Dr L\u00e9ger, qui, selon la loi et le Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer (Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical), a le dernier mot au sujet des PTT, a essentiellement oppos\u00e9 son veto. Il estimait qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00ab observation \u00bb suppose que l\u2019employ\u00e9 est capable d\u2019exercer les fonctions du poste, il avait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sensibles sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi par rapport \u00e0 M. Croteau.\n[177] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2007, Mme Paquet a eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec M. AB, qui a accept\u00e9 que l\u2019on affecte le plaignant \u00e0 un poste administratif et qui a dit \u00e0 Mme Paquet qu\u2019il [Traduction] \u00ab s\u2019attend[ait] \u00e0 ce que l\u2019employ\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e8gre son emploi de chef de train \u00bb. Le 17 septembre 2007, le service de la SST a re\u00e7u une mise \u00e0 jour m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9cisant que des t\u00e2ches administratives conviendraient davantage au plaignant, compte tenu de son \u00e9tat et de ses restrictions. Une r\u00e9union a eu lieu entre M. Gallagher, Mme Paquet, Will Nolan et le plaignant. Un PTT de huit semaines a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au point; ce dernier consisterait \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter des t\u00e2ches administratives sous la surveillance du superviseur Brian Tino et, plus tard, de Debbie Robinson, qui ont [Traduction] \u00ab copi\u00e9-coll\u00e9 \u00bb et [Traduction] \u00ab mis en place \u00bb des t\u00e2ches que M. Croteau ex\u00e9cuterait. Il s\u2019agissait manifestement d\u2019un projet artificiel. (Je signale qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus de tels postes \u00e0 Sarnia.) Cependant, comme Mme Paquet l\u2019a fait logiquement remarquer dans son t\u00e9moignage, il y a encore, pour le CN, une certaine [Traduction] \u00ab valeur \u00bb \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 faisant l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019accommodement retourne sur les lieux, qu\u2019il y avait un aspect th\u00e9rapeutique au fait que l\u2019employ\u00e9 revienne au lieu de travail. Ce travail adapt\u00e9 a dur\u00e9 environ un mois.\n[178] Conform\u00e9ment aux rapports m\u00e9dicaux et aux mises \u00e0 jour, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait utile d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objet \u00e9ventuel et ultime d\u2019un retour au travail \u00e0 titre de chef de train, de faire en sorte que le plaignant soit [Traduction] \u00ab sur le terrain \u00bb plut\u00f4t que dans un bureau \u00e0 effectuer des [Traduction] \u00ab t\u00e2ches administratives \u00bb artificielles. Un PTT a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9, qui permettrait \u00e0 M. Croteau d\u2019observer la surveillante LG le matin et le jour; cette derni\u00e8re occupait elle-m\u00eame ce poste \u00e0 titre de mesure d\u2019accommodement. L\u00e0 encore, l\u2019objectif \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00ab observer \u00bb d\u2019abord, et ensuite d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter soi-m\u00eame les t\u00e2ches de surveillant et, en fin de compte, de retourner au travail \u00e0 titre de chef de train.\n[179] M. Croteau a entrepris ce travail d\u2019observation le 17 octobre 2007. Il a dur\u00e9 moins de deux mois \u00e0 cause d\u2019un s\u00e9rieux [Traduction] \u00ab conflit de personnalit\u00e9s \u00bb entre le plaignant et LG. Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que LG l\u2019avait qualifi\u00e9 de [Traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9rang\u00e9 mentalement \u00bb et l\u2019avait accus\u00e9 de faire des courses personnelles durant les heures de travail. LG l\u2019avait accus\u00e9 de toujours [Traduction] \u00ab dire du mal \u00bb de l\u2019entreprise et d\u2019autre chose. Il \u00e9tait clair que cela ne fonctionnait pas et qu\u2019il fallait les s\u00e9parer.\n[180] Le 1er novembre 2007, le service de la SST a re\u00e7u une mise \u00e0 jour m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9cisant que le plaignant devait r\u00e9duire ses heures de travail \u00e0 six heures par jour pendant une p\u00e9riode de trois \u00e0 quatre semaines. Comme dans le cas des autres recommandations de nature m\u00e9dicale, le CN a obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[181] Le PTT suivant a \u00e9t\u00e9 le poste de commis au stock de radios, lequel consistait \u00e0 regrouper et \u00e0 renum\u00e9roter les radios dans le sous-sol. Cela a eu lieu du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 au 12 avril 2008 \u2013 soit quatre mois. Il ressort clairement du t\u00e9moignage de M. Croteau et de la preuve documentaire que ce dernier trouvait ce travail ennuyeux et qu\u2019il voulait assumer plus de responsabilit\u00e9s. De plus, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui arrivait parfois de ne pas avoir plus d\u2019une demi\u2011heure \u00e0 une heure de travail productif par jour. Il a ajout\u00e9 que, souvent, il lisait des revues techniques. Il s\u2019agissait manifestement d\u2019un projet artificiel, de peu de valeur pour le CN, sinon pour \u2013 comme Mme Paquet l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t \u2013 le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans le cycle du travail sur les lieux et avec d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s du CN. Comme elle l\u2019a fait remarquer avec raison, souvent le simple fait de ramener physiquement l\u2019employ\u00e9 sur les lieux m\u00eames du travail constitue un obstacle. D\u2019autres employeurs n\u2019auraient peut-\u00eatre pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cela comme un exercice utile. \u00c0 la d\u00e9charge du CN, ce l\u2019\u00e9tait.\n[182] En d\u00e9cembre 2007, le CN \u00e9tait en train de se dire que les progr\u00e8s de M. Croteau avaient atteint un plateau et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus pr\u00e8s du stade o\u00f9 il reviendrait travailler comme chef de train qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9tait en avril 2007. Brian Tino, qui \u00e9tait en [Traduction] \u00ab bons termes \u00bb avec M. Croteau et qui l\u2019avait supervis\u00e9 durant ses PTT ax\u00e9s sur des t\u00e2ches administratives et le stock de radios, a envoy\u00e9 le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2007 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Andersen, au service de la SST, avec copie \u00e0 plusieurs personnes du CN qui s\u2019occupaient du programme de retour au travail de M. Croteau. Il demandait \u00e0 Mme Anderson de faire en sorte que l\u2019on [Traduction] \u00ab examine tous les rapports m\u00e9dicaux concernant M. Croteau afin de d\u00e9terminer son statut \u00e0 venir \u00bb. Il s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait du manque apparent de progr\u00e8s et du [Traduction] \u00ab peu d\u2019am\u00e9lioration \u00bb : [Traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] [N]ous avons progress\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 six heures et nous semblons \u00eatre bloqu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce niveau \u00bb. Il disait qu\u2019il fallait que la situation soit \u00e9valu\u00e9e afin de voir s\u2019il [Traduction] \u00ab atteindra jamais \u00bb le stade des fonctions qu\u2019il exer\u00e7ait \u00e0 titre de chef de train [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 Sarnia \u00bb avant son accident\/sa d\u00e9ficience. Il s\u2019agissait clairement l\u00e0 d\u2019un sentiment de frustration compr\u00e9hensible quant au manque de progr\u00e8s et \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9cision quant aux prochaines mesures \u00e0 prendre. Toutefois, il suivait la bonne voie : r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le statut de M. Croteau, en tenant compte des troubles m\u00e9dicaux et des restrictions. Le CN a ensuite d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le troisi\u00e8me EMI. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Mme Smolynec, il n\u2019est pas fr\u00e9quent au CN que l\u2019on commande des EMI co\u00fbteuses pour des dossiers de retour au travail; en faire trois, c\u2019est tr\u00e8s inusit\u00e9. Mais, \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge du CN, le projet est all\u00e9 de l\u2019avant et le Dr Chad a effectu\u00e9 son troisi\u00e8me EMI. Je signale que le plaignant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce troisi\u00e8me EMI, insistant pour dire qu\u2019il [Traduction] \u00ab s\u2019am\u00e9liorait tout le temps \u00bb.\n[183] Le CN a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u un formulaire du CN d\u00fbment rempli \u2013 le Rapport m\u00e9dical sur la sant\u00e9 mentale \u2013 du Dr Gannon, dat\u00e9 du 17 janvier 2008. Fait surprenant, ce dernier a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9tat du patient s\u2019am\u00e9liore \u2013 le pronostic est bon \u00bb.\n[184] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e par erreur du 29 novembre 2008, mais qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s M. AB, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par lui apr\u00e8s le 29 novembre 2007 (et non 2008), mais avant le 20 avril 2008, ce dernier a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nD. Les cinq tentatives de retour au travail\ni. La tentative no 1 : l\u2019observation du surveillant Joe Russell\nii. La tentative no 2 : le travail administratif\/de bureau avec M.

Croteau continue d\u2019avoir des crises de panique au travail.\n[\u2026]\nLorsque j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 de ces crises avec M. Croteau, nous avons d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentaient certaines caract\u00e9ristiques communes, qu\u2019elles semblent \u00eatre provoqu\u00e9es par certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements ou certaines activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 des \u00ab opinions politiques exprim\u00e9es au travail \u00bb, comme entendre d\u2019autres travailleurs se plaindre des conditions de travail, avoir affaire aux superviseurs, lire des avis perturbants au tableau d\u2019affichage, etc.\nM. AB a recommand\u00e9 que M. Croteau soit plac\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un [Traduction] \u00ab environnement de bureau \u00bb et dans la gare, avec les trains, car cela [Traduction] \u00ab pourrait \u00eatre b\u00e9n\u00e9fique, en ce sens qu\u2019en le faisant travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur on l\u2019\u00e9loignerait des choses qui d\u00e9clenchent ses crises de panique \u00bb.\nLe troisi\u00e8me rapport d\u2019EMI dat\u00e9 du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2008\n[185] En janvier 2008, apr\u00e8s cinq mois de tentatives de retour au travail, le CN ne voyait aucune v\u00e9ritable am\u00e9lioration quant aux progr\u00e8s que r\u00e9alisait M. Croteau par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019objectif ultime de le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans l\u2019emploi de chef de train qu\u2019il occupait avant de commencer \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. On avait l\u2019impression que M. Croteau avait atteint un plateau sur le plan de son am\u00e9lioration; d\u2019o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019obtenir un troisi\u00e8me EMI.\n[186] \u00c0 la page 5, le Dr Chad a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son objectif \u00e9tait de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son emploi de chef de train [\u2026] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019essentiellement, s\u2019il obtenait des excuses et une indemnisation quelconque pour l\u2019argent qu\u2019il avait perdu, il se sentirait mieux [\u2026] il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne d\u00e9missionnerait pas, parce qu\u2019il \u00ab [n\u2019avait] rien fait de mal \u00bb. [\u2026] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tous ses patrons avaient chang\u00e9 [\u2026] il a toutefois expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait davantage de responsabilit\u00e9s [13] .\n[187] \u00c0 la page 7, le Dr Chad a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions de chef de train. \u00ab \u00catre en fait le pr\u00e9sident et chef de la direction \u00bb. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il aimerait gravir les \u00e9chelons au CN [\u2026] M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il continue d\u2019avoir six crises de panique par jour quand il travaille \u00bb.\n[188] Le Dr Chad a fait un changement de diagnostic dans son troisi\u00e8me EMI. Il a jug\u00e9 que, selon le DSM\u2011IV, M. Croteau correspondait surtout \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie du trouble de l\u2019adaptation avec anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et diagnostic diff\u00e9rentiel de trouble panique et de probl\u00e8me professionnel. Dans l\u2019axe IV, M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9sentant [Traduction] \u00ab des facteurs de stress r\u00e9cents [\u2026] qui comprennent ses probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail ainsi que quelques contraintes d\u2019ordre p\u00e9cuniaire \u00bb.\n[189] \u00c0 la page 12, le Dr Chad a ajout\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] L\u2019historique d\u00e9note que M. Croteau est devenu de plus en plus anxieux en 2003\u20112004 par rapport au harc\u00e8lement qu\u2019il percevait au travail [\u2026] Comme il continue de ressentir des crises de panique, le diagnostic diff\u00e9rentiel inclurait un trouble panique. Il semble toutefois y avoir une am\u00e9lioration notable dans le cas de ses crises de panique depuis qu\u2019il est retourn\u00e9 au travail en septembre 2007 [\u2026] J\u2019ai le sentiment que, si on lui confiait graduellement plus de responsabilit\u00e9s, cela r\u00e9duirait son degr\u00e9 d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et activerait son d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9tablissement par rapport \u00e0 ses crises de panique [\u2026] son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 semble principalement rattach\u00e9e aux probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail, et il sera n\u00e9cessaire de les r\u00e9gler dans le contexte du travail. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[190] \u00c0 la page 13, le Dr Chad a conclu ce qui suit :\n[Traduction] J\u2019ai l\u2019impression que M. Croteau devrait \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019augmenter graduellement son niveau de responsabilit\u00e9 au travail. Il devrait \u00eatre apte \u00e0 occuper un poste sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, assorti de responsabilit\u00e9s croissantes. Il serait peut-\u00eatre utile pour lui, au d\u00e9but du moins, d\u2019occuper un tel poste dans un r\u00f4le d\u2019observation et ensuite, au d\u00e9part du moins, d\u2019\u00eatre supervis\u00e9 de plus pr\u00e8s [\u2026] J\u2019ai l\u2019impression que le fait d\u2019avoir restreint ses responsabilit\u00e9s a contribu\u00e9 involontairement \u00e0 son niveau d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 au travail ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 ses crises de panique. J\u2019ai l\u2019impression qu\u2019un rel\u00e8vement graduel de ses responsabilit\u00e9s s\u2019accompagnerait d\u2019une diminution de son niveau d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[191] Je d\u00e9duis des trois EMI que M. Croteau, selon le Dr Chad, a souffert d\u2019un trouble de l\u2019adaptation avec anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et probl\u00e8me professionnel qui, au moment o\u00f9 le troisi\u00e8me EMI a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9, incluait le diagnostic diff\u00e9rentiel d\u2019un trouble panique. Ce qui est aussi tr\u00e8s notable est l\u2019emploi fr\u00e9quent de l\u2019expression \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb dans les trois EMI. En premier lieu, cette expression semblait vouloir dire, aux yeux du Dr Chad, qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait seulement des rapports avec KS et TC, en se basant sur ce que M. Croteau lui avait dit. Cependant, une fois que ces deux gestionnaires n\u2019ont plus \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9cor, les \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb se sont poursuivis et se sont m\u00eame aggrav\u00e9s au moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que M. Croteau avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une surveillance et o\u00f9 a pris fin l\u2019enqu\u00eate de M. Gallagher, dont le plaignant n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat. Je reviendrai plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs sur cette question cl\u00e9 que sont les \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb.\n[192] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le Dr Chad, dans son troisi\u00e8me EMI dat\u00e9 du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2008, a recommand\u00e9 notamment que l\u2019on confie davantage de responsabilit\u00e9s au plaignant comme moyen d\u2019am\u00e9liorer son \u00e9volution vers l\u2019objectif \u00e9ventuel d\u2019un retour au travail \u00e0 titre de chef de train. Il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019affectation soit \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du bureau, \u00e0 un poste non administratif, \u00e0 des fonctions d\u2019observation\/jumelage, sous r\u00e9serve bien s\u00fbr de l\u2019examen et de l\u2019accord du m\u00e9decin chef du CN. Le Dr Chad a maintenu les quatre restrictions. Cela \u00e9tait \u00e9galement conforme \u00e0 la lettre que M. AB avait \u00e9crite apr\u00e8s le 29 novembre 2007. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 son EMI, comme il l\u2019avait fait dans le pass\u00e9, le CN a suivi la recommandation et a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un PTT qui consisterait \u00e0 suivre et \u00e0 observer le surveillant de nuit. Il faut se souvenir que le Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical exige que les employ\u00e9s occupant un poste sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (comme les chefs de train) soient [Traduction] \u00ab exempts de sympt\u00f4mes \u00bb pendant six mois avant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer leurs fonctions.\n[193] Le Dr L\u00e9ger a approuv\u00e9 le poste d\u2019observation du surveillant. Selon le plan \u00e9tabli, le surveillant de nuit Charlie Knight formerait M. Croteau pendant que ce dernier le suivait et l\u2019observait dans ses fonctions. Lorsque M. Croteau serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 exercer les fonctions de surveillant, M. Knight passerait au quart de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, car Joe Russell, qui s\u2019occupait de ce quart, devait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son poste ordinaire. M. Croteau a clairement mentionn\u00e9 dans sa plainte aupr\u00e8s du CPVP, ainsi que dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu\u2019il pensait que le CN l\u2019affectait au quart de nuit \u00e0 cause de son arbitrage imminent devant le BAMCFC, vraisemblablement pour qu\u2019il ne puisse pas s\u2019y pr\u00e9parer. Comme l\u2019a fait valoir Me McFadden, M. Croteau disait au Dr Chad, dans le troisi\u00e8me EMI, qu\u2019il voulait plus de responsabilit\u00e9s et qu\u2019il voulait en fin de compte revenir au travail en tant que chef de train. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9, pour la forme : [Traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019est-ce que cela voulait dire? S\u2019occuper davantage du stock de radios? \u00bb Ici, le CN acc\u00e9dait \u00e0 ses souhaits et suivait la recommandation du Dr Chad.\n[194] Le 7 avril 2008, Mme Paquet a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau une lettre concernant le travail d\u2019observation du surveillant de minuit. Elle lui disait que, s\u2019il avait [Traduction] \u00ab des questions ou des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 soumettre \u00bb, il pouvait communique avec elle. Il lui a fait part le 8 avril de ses pr\u00e9occupations : 1) il ne voulait pas suivre et observer une personne diff\u00e9rente chaque nuit, et 2) ces personnes seraient au courant de ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux confidentiels. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019occuper un poste de nuit dans un d\u00e9lai aussi bref, de sorte que la date du d\u00e9but de son travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9e. Mme Paquet, le 25 avril 2008, a r\u00e9\u00e9crit pour lui dire qu\u2019il ne travaillerait pas avec une personne diff\u00e9rente chaque nuit, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait en fait d\u2019une seule et m\u00eame personne, que M. Tino serait toujours sa personne ressource, et que seules ses restrictions seraient communiqu\u00e9es et uniquement s\u2019il le fallait. Elle a \u00e9galement trait\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait comme une [Traduction] \u00ab menace \u00bb dans sa lettre. De plus, elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que son arbitrage devant le BAMCFC ne devrait avoir aucune incidence sur son programme de retour au travail.\n[195] \u00c0 l\u2019insu de Mme Paquet, le 16 avril 2008, M. Croteau avait produit une lettre dans laquelle le Dr Gannon disait d\u2019\u00e9viter de l\u2019affecter au quart de nuit. Cette lettre a naturellement \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise au service de la SST. Ce dernier a ensuite inform\u00e9 Mme Paquet de cette nouvelle restriction (qui n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e auparavant dans l\u2019EMI du Dr Chad, ni par le Dr Gannon ou M. AB). Il est \u00e0 noter qu\u2019au cours du contre\u2011interrogatoire de M. AB, celui-ci a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon son interpr\u00e9tation de la lettre du Dr Gannon, ce dernier ne disait pas seulement [Traduction] \u00ab pas de quart de nuit \u00bb, mais il voulait dire aussi affecter M. Croteau au quart du matin\/de jour. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont M. AB interpr\u00e8te la lettre du Dr Gannon.\n[196] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas effectuer le quart de nuit parce que, dans les postes adapt\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait occup\u00e9s auparavant, il s\u2019\u00e9tait habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 des quarts moins tardifs, il souffrait d\u2019une profonde insomnie et il ne pouvait pas s\u2019entretenir avec son \u00e9pouse lors du quart de nuit (de 22 heures \u00e0 6 heures). Le CN soutient qu\u2019il a subitement soulev\u00e9 cette objection et s\u2019est organis\u00e9 pour que le Dr Gannon signe une lettre \u00e0 cet effet parce qu\u2019il voulait compter sur le temps disponible durant la journ\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9parer son audience prochaine devant le BAMCFC. M. Croteau a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 de la paperasse et des pr\u00e9paratifs. Son \u00e9pouse a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient fort occup\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode \u2013 [Traduction] \u00ab Bien des choses se passaient \u00bb. J\u2019ai quelque compassion pour la position de M. Croteau au sujet de ses raisons pour s\u2019opposer au quart de nuit. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, comme dans le pass\u00e9, aussi \u00ab fortuite \u00bb ou \u00ab suspecte \u00bb qu\u2019ait pu sembler cette restriction soudaine au sujet du quart de travail, le CN a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des motifs d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical. M. Croteau n\u2019a finalement effectu\u00e9 le quart de nuit que pendant une semaine.\n[197] Le CN a ensuite pris des dispositions avec le surveillant M. Knight pour que M. Croteau l\u2019accompagne lors du quart de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi et, quand M. Croteau serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 occuper le poste de surveillant, M. Knight reviendrait alors au quart de nuit afin que M. Croteau puisse avoir le quart de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi (14 heures \u00e0 22 heures). Une offre d\u2019emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 M. Croteau au sujet du quart de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Le 30 avril 2008, le service de la SST a re\u00e7u une autre mise \u00e0 jour m\u00e9dicale \u2013 cette fois-ci de M. AB \u2013 pr\u00e9cisant que le plaignant ne pouvait pas travailler l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi et sugg\u00e9rant plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il travaille avec un chef de triage (un poste essentiel sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dont le titulaire peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer n\u2019importe quel quart de travail). Habituellement, le CN se fiait aux notes des m\u00e9decins. Il s\u2019agissait de la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il se fiait uniquement \u00e0 la seule recommandation du psychologue M. AB pour ce qui \u00e9tait de l\u2019imposition de restrictions de travail ou d\u2019un changement \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le CN a accept\u00e9 et, \u00e0 ce stade, M. Croteau n\u2019avait effectu\u00e9 que deux quarts d\u2019observations de surveillant dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi.\n[198] Il \u00e9tait clair aux yeux du CN, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, que la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de M. Croteau et la seule autorisation m\u00e9dicale \u00e9taient le poste d\u2019observation d\u2019un surveillant le matin ou l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que le CN n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter cette option, car LG \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e au poste de surveillant \u00e0 titre de mesure d\u2019accommodement. En raison du conflit personnel qu\u2019il y avait eu plus t\u00f4t entre les deux, les remettre ensemble n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une solution viable. Je suis d\u2019accord. De plus, le CN ne pouvait pas remplacer un employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de mesures d\u2019accommodement par un autre. Cela dit, Mme Paquet a laiss\u00e9 entendre que Mme Reaume, la repr\u00e9sentante du syndicat, pourrait peut-\u00eatre parler avec LG pour voir si celle-ci accepterait d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre quart. Le syndicat n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Paquet.\n[199] \u00c0 ce stade, le CN commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e0 court de solutions pour M. Croteau. M. Gallagher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 30 avril 2008 qu\u2019il voulait tenir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le plus t\u00f4t possible en vue de discuter des prochaines \u00e9tapes. Cela n\u2019a jamais eu lieu. Le CN n\u2019a fourni aucune explication. Au lieu de cela, le 6 mai 2008, Mme Paquet a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 M. Croteau et lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9, l\u2019informant qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de travail productif disponible pour lui qui respectait les quatre restrictions, il \u00e9tait \u00ab relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions \u00bb ou en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9. Le CN continuerait de lui chercher un travail qui correspondrait \u00e0 ses restrictions. Pour M. Croteau, cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 un moment d\u00e9vastateur, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9; une situation charg\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9motions, c\u2019est certain. Mme Paquet a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans l\u2019appel, mais non dans la lettre, elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Croteau s\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter Sarnia, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu. Elle avait aussi sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019entretienne avec Mme Reaume, sa repr\u00e9sentante syndicale, afin de voir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de prendre des dispositions avec LG pour la d\u00e9placer du quart de travail du matin\/de jour.\n[200] M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur la question de savoir s\u2019il avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question de Mme Paquet quant au fait de quitter Sarnia :\nv. La tentative no 5 : le poste d\u2019observation du surveillant\nE. Le 6 mai 2008 : M. Croteau est \u00ab relev\u00e9 de ses fonctions \u00bb \u2013 cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9\n[Traduction]\nR. Cela me dit quelque chose.\nQ. Elle d\u00e9clarera que vous n\u2019avez pas r\u00e9pondu avant l\u2019audience de janvier.\nR. J\u2019ai dit \u00ab ce serait sans probl\u00e8me \u00bb j\u2019en suis s\u00fbr. J\u2019aurais dit : \u00ab faites quelque chose \u00bb.\nQ. Elle d\u00e9clarera que vous n\u2019avez rien dit.\nR. Pourquoi est-ce que je n\u2019aurais pas r\u00e9pondu?\nQ. \u00c0 l\u2019audience de janvier, le membre instructeur Garfield a demand\u00e9 si vous n\u2019aviez jamais dit au CN que, vous avez dit \u00ab je ne crois pas leur avoir dit, mais jamais je n\u2019aurais dit \u201cnon\u201d \u00bb. Maintenant vous dites que vous l\u2019avez fait?\nR. [\u2026] \u00c7a me dit quelque chose, ce n\u2019est pas grav\u00e9 dans la pierre.\nCes r\u00e9ponses de M. Croteau sont alambiqu\u00e9es, vagues et contradictoires. Je puis comprendre que cet appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique l\u2019a beaucoup troubl\u00e9. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Paquet sur ce point. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, je conclus que M. Croteau n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question lors de l\u2019appel, ni par la suite, avant l\u2019audience tenue en 2012.\nF. Les faits ayant eu lieu apr\u00e8s le 6 mai 2008\n[201] Le 14 juillet 2008, l\u2019arbitre Picher a rejet\u00e9 le grief pour harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant le BAMCFC pour cause de d\u00e9lai (r\u00e8gle du manque de diligence). Soit dit en passant, c\u2019est au cours de cette audience d\u2019arbitrage que M. Croteau a vu KS pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis 2004.\n[202] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2008, Mme Reaume a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Paquet un nouveau PTT, pr\u00e9cisant que toutes les restrictions relatives au quart de travail \u00e9taient maintenant lev\u00e9es. Le CN a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il aurait besoin que le m\u00e9decin de M. Croteau fournisse des restrictions m\u00e9dicales mises \u00e0 jour, ce que le Dr Gannon a fait deux semaines plus tard : pas de restrictions quant aux quarts de travail, mais tout de m\u00eame une restriction relative au travail critique sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. (Je signale qu\u2019en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019il tentait d\u2019obtenir un travail adapt\u00e9, M. Croteau tentait aussi d\u2019obtenir des prestations d\u2019ILD, ce qui voulait dire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiellement incapable de travailler. Je signale \u00e9galement qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, sa famille et lui avaient de graves ennuis financiers.)\n[203] M. AB a \u00e9crit une lettre ult\u00e9rieure au CN, dat\u00e9e du 27 ao\u00fbt 2008, pour dire que [Traduction] \u00ab les difficult\u00e9s psychologiques de M. Croteau l\u2019emp\u00eachent de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son emploi ant\u00e9rieur, soit chef de train, au CN, mais il est maintenant capable de retourner au travail dans le cadre de fonctions modifi\u00e9es \u00bb. Dans sa derni\u00e8re lettre, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve, dat\u00e9e du 20 avril 2009, M. AB a \u00e9crit au CN [Traduction] \u00ab pour clarifier [sa] position au sujet de ses capacit\u00e9s de travail \u00bb. Il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que [Traduction] \u00ab la seule restriction quant au lieu de travail [du plaignant] est de ne pas travailler dans le cadre d\u2019un poste sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb. Sans toutefois qualifier cela de [Traduction] \u00ab restriction en soi \u00bb, il a recommand\u00e9 d\u2019affecter M. Croteau \u00e0 un quart de travail de jour.\n[204] Le 22 septembre 2008, M. Croteau a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte au titre de l\u2019article 37 du Code canadien du travail \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son syndicat pour manquement au devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait le sentiment que son syndicat complotait et \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab de m\u00e8che \u00bb avec le CN contre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le CCRI a rejet\u00e9 sa demande le 12 mai 2009. Fait int\u00e9ressant, \u00e0 la page 5, le CCRI a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab le Conseil n\u2019est pas un arbitre de griefs et ne d\u00e9cide pas si le CN s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Mais le Conseil signale toutefois, et M. Croteau ne l\u2019a pas contest\u00e9, qu\u2019il y a eu un nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 de tentatives pour lui trouver un travail qui correspondrait \u00e0 ses limites en constant changement \u00bb. Je souscris \u00e0 ces observations.\nLa r\u00e9union avec le plaignant, Mme Fusco et d\u2019autres le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008\n[205] Le 14 octobre 2008, M. Croteau a formul\u00e9 d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement au CN apr\u00e8s le 14 juillet 2008. Mme Fusco a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui et lui a envoy\u00e9 l\u2019ordre du jour d\u2019une r\u00e9union fix\u00e9e au 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008, \u00e0 la gare de triage Mac, \u00e0 Concord, en vue de discuter de ces nouvelles all\u00e9gations.\n[206] La r\u00e9union a dur\u00e9 environ 18 minutes. Y ont pris part Mme Fusco, M. Schenk, M. Croteau et M. AB (qui, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme un \u00ab ami \u00bb et non en fonction de son r\u00f4le professionnel). M. Croteau a clairement dit d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part qu\u2019il voulait ressasser les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement qui remontaient \u00e0 2003. Mme Fusco a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Gallagher les avait examin\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail et que le dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 clos en avril 2005 \u2013 plus de trois ans et demi plus t\u00f4t. M. Croteau a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab si [le CN] ne peut pas admettre qu\u2019il y a eu des gestes de harc\u00e8lement avant juillet 2008, dans ce cas nous n\u2019avons plus de sujet de discussion \u00bb. Il \u00e9tait visiblement contrari\u00e9 et a qualifi\u00e9 le CN de [Traduction] \u00ab menteur \u00bb. Cependant, M. AB et lui ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement. Mme Fusco a ensuite [Traduction] \u00ab chang\u00e9 le ton de la r\u00e9union et confirm\u00e9 avec Pierre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait actuellement en cong\u00e9 de maladie et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 des restrictions \u00bb. La r\u00e9union a pris fin peu de temps apr\u00e8s.\n[207] Le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2008, Mme Fusco lui a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de suivi concernant la r\u00e9union du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008 o\u00f9 elle a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :[ Traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] dans laquelle vous avez demand\u00e9 que j\u2019examine vos restrictions afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y aurait ou non pour vous un travail convenable \u00e0 Sarnia \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] Il a r\u00e9pondu par lettre, avec quelques pr\u00e9occupations et \u00e9claircissements, le 5 janvier 2009. Comme nous le verrons plus loin, pendant que le CN poursuivait ses efforts en vue de trouver pour M. Croteau un travail disponible et convenable, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019autres communications de la part du CN sur le sujet avant les audiences du tribunal en 2012. Aucune mise \u00e0 jour de la part du CN, rien.\n[208] Depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9 en mai 2008, M. Croteau travaille \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 Sarnia, dans un commerce appel\u00e9 Princess Auto. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une crise de panique importante quand l\u2019un des directeurs avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. \u00c0 sa d\u00e9charge, en 2009, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e9tudier au Coll\u00e8ge Lambton. Il avait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour divers emplois, y compris au sein de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne. Je conclus qu\u2019il a fait des efforts louables et raisonnables pour att\u00e9nuer sa perte de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[209] Comme Me McFadden l\u2019a reconnu avec raison, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Croteau demeure au service du CN, ce dernier est encore tenu de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019imposer une contrainte excessive ou, en d\u2019autres termes, prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnables.\n[210] Comme nous le verrons plus loin, le CN est d\u2019avis qu\u2019avant que M. Croteau t\u00e9moigne en janvier 2012, il ignorait, ou on ne pouvait pas raisonnablement consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il savait \u2013 que M. Croteau \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter Sarnia. Je suis d\u2019accord. Il ressort clairement de la r\u00e9union du 4 avril 2007 (et, d\u2019ailleurs, aussi de celle du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008) qu\u2019il ne voulait rester qu\u2019\u00e0 Sarnia. Au vu de la preuve dont je suis saisi, je conclus que Mme Fusco a confirm\u00e9 ses restrictions \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008 et qu\u2019elle s\u2019entretiendrait avec Mme Paquet pour [Traduction] \u00ab voir s\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas pour lui, \u00e0 Sarnia, des postes non essentiels \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui seraient disponibles \u00bb. \u00c0 aucun moment il ne l\u2019a corrig\u00e9e et il lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que le CN cherche ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 Sarnia. Elle lui a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de confirmation et une lettre de [Traduction] \u00ab suivi \u00bb, toutes deux dat\u00e9es du 16 d\u00e9cembre 2008 : [Traduction] \u00ab nous allons continuer d\u2019examiner les postes disponibles \u00e0 Sarnia par rapport aux nouveaux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui nous sont fournis \u00bb. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse du 5 janvier 2009, il l\u2019a corrig\u00e9e sur quelques points, mais non sur la question importante selon laquelle le rayon de recherche d\u2019un emploi se limitait \u00e0 Sarnia.\n[211] Dans le courriel que Mme Reaume a transmis au CN en date du 13 ao\u00fbt 2008, pour analyser un \u00e9ventuel retour au travail de M. Croteau, elle aussi s\u2019est concentr\u00e9e sur les postes disponibles \u00e0 Sarnia. Il est \u00e9vident dans la preuve que le syndicat \u00e9tait lui aussi d\u2019avis que tout ce qui int\u00e9ressait M. Croteau \u00e9tait un travail adapt\u00e9, \u00e0 Sarnia.\n[212] Quand est-il devenu \u00e9vident que M. Croteau \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 Sarnia? La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est : \u00e0 l\u2019audience tenue en janvier 2012. Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Sarnia et qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait que le CN aurait d\u00fb s\u2019en rendre compte. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019il l\u2019avait dit au CN. Il s\u2019est ensuite r\u00e9tract\u00e9 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN aurait d\u00fb d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter Sarnia \u00e0 partir de ses lettres, comme le commentaire fait dans l\u2019une d\u2019elles selon lequel il voulait revenir au CN.\n[213] J\u2019ai pris note de ce changement \u00e0 l\u2019audience et j\u2019ai prescrit que M. Croteau fasse part au CN des param\u00e8tres de recherche appropri\u00e9s. C\u2019est ainsi que Mme Cialone a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Croteau une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 22 mai 2012, disant qu\u2019elle croyait comprendre que M. Croteau \u00e9tait maintenant int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste adapt\u00e9, situ\u00e9 m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Sarnia. Elle a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019un [Traduction] \u00ab centre de grande taille situ\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, comme Toronto [la gare de triage Mac est le plus gros terminal du CN], \u00e9tait celui qui offrirait les meilleures possibilit\u00e9s [\u2026] s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun poste de ce genre disponible, le CN pourrait \u00e9tendre sa recherche \u00e0 d\u2019autres r\u00e9gions. Veuillez pr\u00e9ciser si vous \u00eates dispos\u00e9 ou non \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans la r\u00e9gion de Toronto [\u2026] \u00bb. M. Croteau a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019entremise de son avocat, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 5 juin 2012. Me Bolter a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son client \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que jamais il n\u2019avait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e de prendre en consid\u00e9ration un travail \u00e0 un autre endroit. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019endroit que M. Croteau pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait \u00e9tait Sarnia [Traduction] \u00ab ou le plus pr\u00e8s possible de Sarnia \u00bb, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Toronto pour un poste [Traduction] \u00ab raisonnablement stable \u00bb. Au paragraphe suivant, il a ensuite mentionn\u00e9 un poste [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 Toronto ou ailleurs \u00bb. \u00c0 ce stade, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que M. Croteau \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans la r\u00e9gion de Toronto. Jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 ce \u00ab ou ailleurs \u00bb s\u2019\u00e9tendait dans son esprit, je n\u2019en ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 certain avant le dernier jour du volet \u00ab t\u00e9moignages \u00bb des audiences \u2013 le 12 juin 2013. Dans son t\u00e9moignage en r\u00e9plique, M. Croteau s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re claire et non ambigu\u00eb, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, sur la question : il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager n\u2019importe o\u00f9, [Traduction] \u00ab d\u2019un oc\u00e9an \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00bb au Canada.\n[214] Ce qu\u2019il y a d\u2019int\u00e9ressant c\u2019est que, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 concernant l\u2019extension du rayon de recherche au-del\u00e0 de Sarnia et des probl\u00e8mes de communication entre le plaignant et le CN sur ce point, ce dernier \u00e9tait en fait \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un travail disponible et convenable pour M. Croteau ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 Sarnia, pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9.\n[215] Laura Waller, coordonnatrice de retour au travail au CN, qui avait pris en charge depuis peu les dossiers de sa coll\u00e8gue Tania Cialone (partie en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9), a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits en preuve des courriels de Mme Waller et de Mme Cialone sur les efforts de retour au travail qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pendant que M. Croteau se trouvait en cong\u00e9 non pay\u00e9. Mme Waller a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques nationales mensuelles que faisait le CN au sujet des [Traduction] \u00ab cas complexes \u00bb et visant \u00e0 trouver des postes adapt\u00e9s pour des employ\u00e9s accident\u00e9s ou atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de ces appels le Service de SST, le Service des ressources humaines, le Service des relations de travail ainsi que le groupe de retour au travail de Mme Waller. Ces personnes passent en revue les dossiers des employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s afin de tenter de leur trouver un emploi adapt\u00e9 disponible. Le service de SST ne communique pas aux autres participants le diagnostic ou d\u2019autres renseignements m\u00e9dicaux confidentiels. Mme Waller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s en question demeurent habituellement inscrits sur la liste pendant quelques ann\u00e9es, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que le groupe apprenne \u00e0 bien conna\u00eetre leur situation et leurs restrictions. Aucun proc\u00e8s\u2011verbal de r\u00e9union, aucune feuille de calcul ou aucune confirmation \u00e9crite de la teneur de ces conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve. L\u2019avocat du CN a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire contenaient des renseignements privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s, car ce service avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fusionn\u00e9 aux services juridiques du CN. Me Bolter n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 que ces conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques mensuelles avaient lieu; il a plut\u00f4t soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019on ignore si le nom de M. Croteau a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 lors de chaque conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et que les r\u00e9unions n\u2019ont pas [Traduction] \u00ab port\u00e9 sur ses besoins et ses probl\u00e8mes uniques \u00bb. Bien que je trouve curieux qu\u2019aucun renseignement \u00e9crit sur ces [Traduction] \u00ab conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques complexes \u00bb n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite aux audiences, je souscris au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Waller. Cette derni\u00e8re est digne de foi.\n[216] Mme Waller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi de bureau pour un employ\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 des restrictions semblables \u00e0 celles de M. Croteau, mais sans succ\u00e8s, depuis 2008, dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Certaines de ces recherches, concernant des t\u00e2ches de bureau ou s\u00e9dentaires, ont \u00e9galement eu lieu en 2009 et en 2010. Elle a fait remarquer ce qui suit :\nG. Les efforts d\u2019accommodement faits entre mai 2008 et juin 2013, y compris le rayon de la recherche d\u2019emploi\n[Traduction] [\u00c0 la gare de triage, pour ce qui est d\u2019un travail adapt\u00e9] c\u2019est tr\u00e8s difficile maintenant, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas beaucoup de postes ouverts qui ne sont pas sensibles ou critiques sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [\u2026] il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019autres emplois annonc\u00e9s, de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y a malheureusement pas beaucoup de mouvement dans la liste des mesures d\u2019accommodement [\u2026] cela fait plus d\u2019un an ou davantage [depuis le dernier emploi de bureau adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 la gare de triage Mac] [\u2026] Le seul bulletin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 est celui des TCA [Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses canadien(ne)s de l\u2019automobile] [pour les postes de r\u00e9partiteur d\u2019\u00e9quipe].\n[217] Me McFadden lui a demand\u00e9 combien il y avait eu de postes de bureau (non critiques ou essentiels sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9) disponibles depuis le 6 mai 2008. Elle a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 Sarnia, aucun. \u00c0 la gare de triage Mac, il y a eu des emplois de bureau dans le secteur de la r\u00e9partition d\u2019\u00e9quipe [emplois non sensibles ou critiques sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9] qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s par les TCA [membres]. Aucun n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9 par une personne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 la gare de triage Mac; en Ontario, pas un seul \u00bb. Elle a dit qu\u2019au CN, il n\u2019y a pas de placements entre unit\u00e9s de n\u00e9gociation dans le cas des emplois de bureau. Et, il y a fort peu d\u2019emplois de bureau pour commencer. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, compte tenu des restrictions de M. Croteau (p. ex., pas de fonctions critiques ou sensibles sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9), [Traduction] \u00ab cela exclut un nombre assez \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019emplois, comme le secteur du transport, le secteur technique et certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du secteur m\u00e9canique. Il ne reste donc que les emplois de type bureau \u00bb.\n[218] Mme Waller a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail au sujet des efforts qu\u2019elle avait faits pour M. Croteau ainsi que des postes adapt\u00e9s disponibles qui correspondaient peut-\u00eatre aux quatre restrictions, et pourquoi ces postes ne faisaient pas l\u2019affaire :\n1) syst\u00e8me d\u2019inspection des voies : le poste comprenait des t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ordinateur, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un emploi physique, c\u2019\u00e9tait plus un travail de bureau, il y avait un peu de d\u00e9placements; mais le CN n\u2019avait besoin de personne; le poste n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 dot\u00e9. Elle a pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question de financement;\n2) travail de concierge : pas disponible parce que le CN confie ce genre de travail \u00e0 forfait dans l\u2019Est du Canada. \u00c0 la d\u00e9charge du CN, la gestionnaire a communiqu\u00e9 avec le vice-pr\u00e9sident, Est du Canada, pour voir si l\u2019on pouvait faire quelque chose. La r\u00e9ponse re\u00e7ue \u00e9tait que le CN ne s\u2019occupe pas de services de conciergerie dans cette r\u00e9gion. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait au courant d\u2019aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi en dehors de l\u2019Est du Canada;\n3) poste de surveillant \u00e0 Sarnia : pas de poste disponible dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi entre 2009 et 2011, et pas de poste de surveillant disponible pour le moment pour le quart du soir (nuit);\n4) postes vacants \u00e0 Sarnia entre janvier 2008 et novembre 2010: elle n\u2019\u00e9tait au courant d\u2019aucuns. Cette liste provenait de Mme Cialone et pr\u00e9cisait que ces postes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas applicables parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient de nature cruciale ou sensible sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou alors exigeaient une attestation de m\u00e9tier de journalier d\u00e9sign\u00e9 Sceau rouge;\n5) Emplois de r\u00e9partiteur d\u2019\u00e9quipe : les TCA avaient le droit de pr\u00e9senter leur candidature en premier; si le poste n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dot\u00e9, le CN pouvait chercher dans une autre unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation. Tous les emplois \u00e9taient combl\u00e9s par les TCA [M Croteau n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre de ce syndicat];\n6) surveillant Incendie\/S\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 Windsor : elle voulait cet emploi pour un autre travailleur pour lequel il fallait prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, et cet emploi ne convenait pas \u00e0 M. Croteau \u00e0 cause des restrictions auxquelles il \u00e9tait soumis. L\u2019emploi n\u2019existait qu\u2019\u00e0 Windsor. Si M. Croteau l\u2019avait pris, Mme Cialone aurait d\u00fb en trouver un autre pour l\u2019employ\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer avec raison Me McFadden, la LCDP n\u2019exige pas que les mesures d\u2019accommodement que l\u2019on prend pour un employ\u00e9 atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience consistent \u00e0 en d\u00e9placer un autre de l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il occupe.\nMme Waller a fait remarquer qu\u2019il est toujours [Traduction] \u00ab plus difficile \u00bb de trouver du travail adapt\u00e9 dans les terminaux de petite taille : moins d\u2019emplois de bureau, moins d\u2019emplois en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 ces endroits.\n[219] Mme Waller a reconnu que les documents figurant dans le dossier de Mme Cialone commencent en 2011 et vont jusqu\u2019\u00e0 novembre 2012 ; il n\u2019y a rien dans le dossier qui date d\u2019avant 2011, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de 2008 \u00e0 2011. (Mais, je signale qu\u2019un courriel de Mme Cialone, dat\u00e9 du 24 novembre 2008, au sujet du dossier de M. Croteau, a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit en preuve.) Quand on lui a demand\u00e9 si elle trouvait cela surprenant, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab pas n\u00e9cessairement [\u2026] il n\u2019y avait peut-\u00eatre aucune mesure requise ; rien ne s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Je suppose que nous pourrions am\u00e9liorer le processus pour pr\u00e9ciser \u201cpas de mesure prise \u00e0 cause de restrictions externes\u201d \u00bb. Elle a manifestement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle Mme Cialone \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab passive \u00bb ou ne faisait pas preuve de [Traduction] \u00ab cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 \u00bb dans les efforts qu\u2019elle avait faits pour le compte de M. Croteau : [Traduction] \u00ab Non, Tania faisait des recherches assez actives [\u2026] Nous agissons bel et bien de mani\u00e8re active \u00bb. Elle a \u00e9galement signal\u00e9 que les quatre restrictions de M. Croteau n\u2019avaient pas chang\u00e9 et que le Service de SST avait jug\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient permanentes. Cela est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la lettre dat\u00e9e du 22 mai 2012 que Mme Cialone a envoy\u00e9e au plaignant. Le t\u00e9moin a reconnu qu\u2019elle ignorait ce que le CN avait fait pour lui entre mai 2008 et 2011, car cela ne figurait pas dans le dossier.\n[220] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question sur le rayon de recherche d\u2019un emploi, selon la lettre du 5 juin 2012 de Me Bolter, Mme Waller a dit qu\u2019il semblait que M. Croteau pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait encore Sarnia, mais qu\u2019il envisagerait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Toronto :\n[Traduction] Ce n\u2019est pas clair s\u2019il veut dire \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Ontario \u00bb. Je voudrais probablement \u00e9claircir ce point [\u2026] J\u2019ai \u00e9tendu la recherche \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019Ontario, mais pas au-del\u00e0. Je ne suis pas vraiment s\u00fbre qu\u2019il veuille sortir de la province. Ce n\u2019est pas clair [le 12 juin 2013, M. Croteau a finalement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 : \u00ab d\u2019un oc\u00e9an \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00bb] [\u2026] Je n\u2019ai pas regard\u00e9 dans l\u2019Ouest pour lui.\n[221] Me McFadden lui a ensuite fait confirmer que la connaissance qu\u2019elle avait des efforts faits par Mme Cialone en vue de trouver un travail productif et convenable pour M. Croteau reposait sur les documents soumis au Tribunal, mais que, en 2011, elle avait tent\u00e9 de faire retourner au travail d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s, ce qui fait qu\u2019elle savait bien quels \u00e9taient les postes disponibles \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Mme Waller a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative et a affirm\u00e9 aussi qu\u2019elle savait ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 disponible entre le mois de mai 2008 et l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2011. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que les seuls postes appropri\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient disponibles au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 2008 \u00e0 2011 \u00e9taient les postes de r\u00e9partiteur d\u2019\u00e9quipe et qu\u2019ils avaient tous \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s par les TCA. Je signale que Mme Cialone a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 des gestionnaires du CN dans tout l\u2019Ontario le 13 mai 2011 pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir des emplois de bureau disponibles pour M. Croteau : [Traduction] \u00ab le CN recherche tr\u00e8s activement un travail adapt\u00e9 pour un employ\u00e9 qui est en cong\u00e9 depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[222] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Waller et la preuve documentaire que le CN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au sujet des efforts qu\u2019il a faits pour trouver du travail convenable et disponible dans les limites des restrictions de M. Croteau entre le mois de mai 2008 et la fin des audiences, en juin 2013. M. Croteau n\u2019a pas dit clairement avant les audiences qu\u2019il envisagerait de travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Sarnia. De plus, lors des audiences, la clart\u00e9 de son intention a \u00e9volu\u00e9, depuis son t\u00e9moignage fait en janvier 2012 jusqu\u2019au t\u00e9moignage en r\u00e9plique du plaignant ([Traduction] \u00ab d\u2019un oc\u00e9an \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00bb) le 12 juin 2013, en passant par la lettre de son avocat dat\u00e9e du 5 juin 2012. Ind\u00e9pendamment de cette \u00e9volution graduelle, le CN se trouvait loin devant M. Croteau pour ce qui \u00e9tait de son propre rayon de recherche d\u2019un emploi adapt\u00e9. Le CN s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 ici de son obligation d\u2019accommodement pr\u00e9vue par la loi.\n[223] Je n\u2019admets pas que M. Croteau a dit au CN (avant les audiences tenues en 2012) qu\u2019il d\u00e9m\u00e9nagerait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Sarnia ou qu\u2019il faudrait consid\u00e9rer que le CN le savait. Il \u00e9tait clair d\u2019apr\u00e8s les gestes et les paroles de M. Croteau entre 2007 et 2012 qu\u2019il voulait retourner au travail \u00e0 Sarnia, et \u00e0 Sarnia seulement. De plus, je signale que M. Croteau a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de longs documents \u00e9crits au CN ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 divers tribunaux administratifs et organismes sous la forme de lettres, sa plainte interne de harc\u00e8lement, son grief d\u2019arbitrage aupr\u00e8s du BAMCFC, sa plainte au titre de l\u2019article 37 contre le syndicat, etc. Et ces documents \u00e9crits allaient du plus grand au plus minutieux. Il n\u2019a aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer par \u00e9crit. S\u2019il avait voulu travailler \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de Sarnia, pour cette question de grande importance pour lui, M. Croteau l\u2019aurait dit. Il suffisait d\u2019une phrase, exprim\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re non \u00e9quivoque, au CN. Mais, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, bien que ce soit pertinent en tant que question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, pour ce qui est de l\u2019issue, cela n\u2019aurait fait aucune diff\u00e9rence. Pourquoi? Parce que le CN, de sa propre initiative, avait fait des recherches au-del\u00e0 de Sarnia et que rien de convenable n\u2019\u00e9tait disponible.\n[224] Quant aux efforts d\u2019accommodement faits par le CN entre 2007 et le 6 mai 2008, je conclus \u00e9galement qu\u2019il a \u00e9tabli sa d\u00e9fense l\u00e9gale d\u2019une EPJ assortie de mesures d\u2019accommodement sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la contrainte excessive. Les efforts de retour au travail ont compris cinq tentatives d\u2019accommodement, sans compter la tentative infructueuse de surveillant Incendie\/S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de mars 2005. Le CN a agi de bonne foi. Il voulait que M. Croteau r\u00e9int\u00e8gre l\u2019emploi pour lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 et form\u00e9, et qu\u2019il avait en fait exerc\u00e9 durant des ann\u00e9es, celui de chef de train. Le CN a toujours suivi les recommandations m\u00e9dicales et a tent\u00e9 de travailler de mani\u00e8re constructive avec le plaignant et ses repr\u00e9sentants syndicaux.\n[225] La premi\u00e8re de ces questions n\u2019est pas simple. Nous avons affaire \u00e0 un \u00eatre humain, pas \u00e0 une machine. Il souffrait (et souffre) manifestement de graves troubles li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. De cela, je n\u2019en ai aucun doute. Mais je crois que les efforts de retour au travail ont \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueux pour les raisons suivantes :\nH. Pourquoi les tentatives de retour au travail de M. Croteau ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuses? Pourquoi la d\u00e9fense d\u2019\u00ab EPJ\/Mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00bb du CN a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue?\n1) M. Croteau n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 pleinement au processus d\u2019accommodement :\n[226] M. Croteau n\u2019a pas pleinement collabor\u00e9 au processus en tout temps et ne s\u2019est parfois pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation l\u00e9gale de prendre part au dialogue ayant trait aux mesures d\u2019accommodement. Par exemple, aux audiences il a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 des emplois dans lesquels, \u00e0 son avis, le CN aurait d\u00fb songer \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grer. Mais ces emplois d\u00e9bordaient le cadre de ses qualifications ou de ses restrictions, comme un poste d\u2019\u00e9lectricien qui requiert une attestation Sceau rouge apr\u00e8s plusieurs ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes et d\u2019apprentissage. Il voulait observer le travail du chef de triage. Mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019un emploi essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Pourquoi le CN lui ferait-il observer un poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour lequel il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9? En janvier 2005, M. Croteau (et le syndicat) ne voulaient m\u00eame pas tenir une r\u00e9union pour discuter de son retour au travail. Le 1er mars 2005, il a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union avec le syndicat et M. Gallagher, o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab un dollar est peut-\u00eatre trop et un million de dollars n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas assez \u00bb et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une liste d\u2019exigences qui, avec raison, a donn\u00e9 au CN l\u2019impression qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un employ\u00e9 qui voulait vraiment retourner au travail, \u00e0 moins que cela se fasse \u00e0 ses conditions seulement. Si le CN acceptait ses conditions, il serait apparemment retourn\u00e9 au travail ce m\u00eame mois.\n[227] En outre, il a modifi\u00e9 un document du CN et a fait en sorte que son superviseur le signe. M. Gallagher a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela aurait pu avoir pour r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019on lui attribue la moiti\u00e9 des points d\u2019inaptitude qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour donner lieu \u00e0 un cong\u00e9diement. Me McFadden a fait valoir que cela aurait pu mener \u00e0 une sanction disciplinaire s\u00e9rieuse, dont son cong\u00e9diement du CN. Je conviens avec Me McFadden que, si le CN avait vraiment voulu [Traduction] \u00ab se d\u00e9barrasser \u00bb de M. Croteau comme ce dernier le craignait, celui-ci avait fourni \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise plein de munitions et d\u2019occasions. De plus, M. Croteau n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 honn\u00eate lors de la r\u00e9union du 30 avril 2008 avec M. AB, et en lui faisant \u00e9crire au CN pour inclure une restriction relative au quart de travail dans le cadre du retour au travail \u00e0 un poste d\u2019observation du surveillant, en se fondant sur des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 deux points que le plaignant savait, tout juste cinq jours plus t\u00f4t, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la lettre de Mme Paquet, \u00eatre faux.\n[228] Il est vrai qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas refus\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches adapt\u00e9es, mais lorsqu\u2019il les a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, c\u2019\u00e9tait comme s\u2019il n\u2019ex\u00e9cutait que les mouvements uniquement. Cela peut \u00eatre d\u00fb en partie \u00e0 la nature artificielle de certains des emplois offerts pour un retour au travail. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une des conclusions que je tire de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours de ces 36 jours d\u2019audiences.\n2) Sa crainte\/parano\u00efa\/m\u00e9fiance \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e au d\u00e9part sur KS, mais s\u2019est \u00e9tendue ensuite au CN :\n[229] J\u2019emploie ces termes non pas dans leur sens clinique ou m\u00e9dical (p. ex., parano\u00efa), mais dans leur sens ordinaire, de tous les jours, celui que donnent les dictionnaires. Durant toutes les audiences, il m\u2019a paru clair que M. Croteau avait (et a toujours) profond\u00e9ment peur de KS. La crainte de l\u2019enl\u00e8vement en \u00e9tait un exemple \u00e9vident. Je ne dis pas cela pour rabaisser ou d\u00e9nigrer M. Croteau. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il invente cela. Le probl\u00e8me est que, m\u00eame si KS et TC ont quitt\u00e9 la sc\u00e8ne tr\u00e8s rapidement \u00e0 l\u2019insistance du CN et n\u2019ont plus eu de rapports avec M. Croteau, leur incidence (celle de KS surtout) subsiste : en fait, son image le hante encore. Cette peur\/parano\u00efa au sujet de KS s\u2019est finalement mu\u00e9e en une profonde m\u00e9fiance envers tout ce qui concerne le \u00ab CN \u00bb. Les \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb, souvent r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s dans les EMI du Dr Chad ainsi que dans les rapports et les lettres du Dr Gannon et de M. AB, s\u2019\u00e9tendaient au-del\u00e0 de KS et de TC. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u00e9vidence quand le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait une indemnisation pour couvrir ses frais de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement parce qu\u2019il ne voulait pas que le CN sache o\u00f9 il vivait. La m\u00e9fiance s\u2019\u00e9tendait au syndicat lui aussi et \u00e0 sa conviction que ce dernier complotait avec le CN contre ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Lors des audiences, il n\u2019a pas voulu accepter d\u2019explications et de motifs b\u00e9nins pour les gestes du CN; c\u2019est le cas, par exemple, du fait que le CN a pay\u00e9 les s\u00e9ances que M. AB a pass\u00e9es avec lui et bien au-del\u00e0 du temps initial (et du co\u00fbt) qu\u2019il avait allou\u00e9.\n3) M. Croteau voulait une entente, ou les \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb ne seraient pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9s\n[230] Il y avait ici un raisonnement circulaire en jeu : comme un man\u00e8ge, ou comme dans le film Le jour de la marmotte. Je crois M. Croteau, quand il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et \u00e9crit qu\u2019il devait se remettre sur pied pour pouvoir retourner au travail. Mais la question est la suivante : de quoi avait-il besoin pour pouvoir se remettre sur pied et retourner au travail? Je n\u2019accepte pas qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 simplement question d\u2019un meilleur processus : p. ex., plus de r\u00e9unions avec Mme Paquet, une meilleure enqu\u00eate pour harc\u00e8lement de la part de M. Gallagher (et pas n\u00e9cessairement une conclusion ou des constatations diff\u00e9rentes). Non, ce qu\u2019il souhaitait obtenir en plus de ces choses, c\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019on CONVIENNE \u2013 que KS et TC \u00e9taient \u00ab coupables \u00bb de l\u2019avoir harcel\u00e9, que le CN \u00e9tait \u00ab coupable \u00bb de l\u2019avoir mis (lui et, accessoirement, sa famille) sous surveillance, qu\u2019il re\u00e7oive des excuses et une indemnit\u00e9, que l\u2019on prenne des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de KS et de TC, etc. La liste des exigences pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 1er mars 2005, je crois, \u00e9tait des conditions qui, dans l\u2019esprit de M. Croteau, \u00e9taient sinc\u00e8rement n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019il se r\u00e9tablisse et retourne travailler au CN. Rien de moins ne ferait l\u2019affaire.\n[231] Il y a eu un \u00e9change int\u00e9ressant en contre\u2011interrogatoire entre Me McFadden et M. AB. L\u2019avocat a dit au t\u00e9moin qu\u2019il ressortait clairement de la preuve que M. Croteau voulait des excuses, et que le fait que le CN \u00e9carte KS et TC, pour qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient plus de rapports avec le plaignant, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant. Mais, a demand\u00e9 Me McFadden, s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient rien fait de r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible? Comment, dans ce cas, le CN r\u00e8glerait-il les \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail \u00bb de M. Croteau? M. AB a r\u00e9pondu : [Traduction] \u00ab Je suis aussi th\u00e9rapeute conjugal. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une communication franche, le fait d\u2019essayer l\u00e9gitimement de se comprendre l\u2019un l\u2019autre, parfois cela fonctionne. Des excuses sont-elles n\u00e9cessaires? Peut-\u00eatre que s\u2019ils s\u2019asseyaient tous dans une pi\u00e8ce [\u2026] \u00bb. Sans vouloir manquer de respect \u00e0 M. AB et \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9tences en tant que psychologue et th\u00e9rapeute conjugal, bien qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019agir l\u00e0 d\u2019une ordonnance th\u00e9rapeutique qui fonctionne parfois, cela n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9ussi dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. Plus de conversations, les PTT, les lettres, les rencontre formelles ou la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate pour harc\u00e8lement n\u2019auraient pas fait de diff\u00e9rence, sauf si le CN CONVENAIT en fin de compte avec M. Croteau des torts per\u00e7us dont il avait cens\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de la part de KS, de TC, du CN, du syndicat, etc. Sans cela, il n\u2019y aurait pas de gu\u00e9rison, et sans la gu\u00e9rison dont M. Croteau avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, il n\u2019y aurait aucun retour au travail fructueux.\n[232] Les progr\u00e8s de M. Croteau sur le plan de son retour au travail avaient atteint un plateau. Bien entendu, la situation \u00e9tait meilleure qu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2004, o\u00f9 il ne pouvait m\u00eame pas se rendre sur place sans subir une grave crise de panique. Mais, pour ce qui \u00e9tait de faire de r\u00e9els progr\u00e8s, au point d\u2019\u00eatre raisonnablement capable de retourner au travail en tant que chef de train, son r\u00e9tablissement \u00e9tait loin de cet objectif, malgr\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve m\u00e9dicale contraires. Je dis cela parce que le Dr Chad, le Dr Gannon et M. AB n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement inform\u00e9s par M. Croteau de ses v\u00e9ritables sentiments et craintes au sujet de KS et du CN en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. M. AB n\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas au courant, par exemple, de la crainte qu\u2019avait M. Croteau que KS enl\u00e8ve ses enfants.\n4) Il n\u2019y avait aucun travail convenable et disponible pour M. Croteau\n[233] Finalement, il n\u2019y avait aucun travail convenable et disponible qui correspondait aux quatre restrictions de M. Croteau, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 sa restriction g\u00e9ographique. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le CN avait m\u00eame devanc\u00e9 les besoins de M. Croteau, en ce sens qu\u2019il avait \u00e9tendu le rayon de recherche d\u2019un emploi au-del\u00e0 de Sarnia. Comme l\u2019ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Waller (et, dans une moindre mesure, celui de M. Colasimone) et la preuve documentaire, au CN il n\u2019y avait (au dernier jour des audiences) rien de disponible en ce qui concerne un emploi de bureau.\n[234] Au vu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le CN a \u00e9tabli une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une EPJ o\u00f9 des mesures d\u2019accommodement au sens du paragraphe 15(1)a) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[235] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, dans la d\u00e9cision Cruden, le juge Zinn a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019obligation proc\u00e9durale distincte dans le processus d\u2019accommodement qui peut \u00eatre viol\u00e9e et qui donnerait lieu \u00e0 des mesures de r\u00e9paration, malgr\u00e9 une conclusion de fond selon laquelle il existe une contrainte excessive. Les mesures d\u2019accommodement doivent \u00eatre raisonnables (sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la contrainte excessive); il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019elles soient parfaites : Renaud.\n[236] \u00c0 la suite de cette longue instruction, bien que j\u2019aie conclu que le CN a \u00e9tabli une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur une EPJ et des mesures d\u2019accommodement, il y a certains aspects du processus qu\u2019il a suivi qui, m\u00eame s\u2019ils n\u2019engagent pas une responsabilit\u00e9 au titre de la LCDP (car ils ne correspondent certes pas \u00e0 l\u2019exception que le juge Zinn a formul\u00e9e au paragraphe 79 de la d\u00e9cision Cruden), sont n\u00e9anmoins loin de correspondre \u00e0 des \u00ab pratiques exemplaires \u00bb et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels je souhaite faire quelques commentaires.\nI. Les questions proc\u00e9durales concernant les mesures d\u2019accommodement et les pratiques exemplaires\n1) De meilleures communications avec les employ\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de mesures d\u2019accommodement\/des changements au PTT\n[237] J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Croteau selon lequel le CN a apport\u00e9 des changements au PTT le concernant \u00e0 court pr\u00e9avis et sans tenir compte de son point de vue. Je me contenterai de dire qu\u2019il faudrait tout mettre en \u0153uvre pour \u00e9liminer de telles situations en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment relativement aux employ\u00e9s qui, comme M. Croteau, ont un diagnostic de troubles li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. J\u2019inclus \u00e9galement dans cette cat\u00e9gorie le temps qu\u2019il a fallu pour faire savoir \u00e0 M. Croteau, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 4 avril 2007, s\u2019il toucherait le [Traduction] \u00ab tarif relatif \u00e0 la loco\u2011commande \u00bb. Ce fait a occasionn\u00e9 un stress excessif \u00e0 propos d\u2019un aspect fondamental de la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 \u2013 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u2013 et ce, \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 ayant de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. Les exemples qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause des tentatives infructueuses de retour au travail.\n2) Les communications avec les employ\u00e9s accident\u00e9s ou atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et \u00ab relev\u00e9s de leurs fonctions \u00bb\n[238] Selon la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il n\u2019y a pas eu de communication directe entre le CN et M. Croteau au sujet des efforts faits pour lui trouver un travail adapt\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2008 avec Mme Fusco et M. Schenk ainsi que la lettre de suivi. Fait surprenant, il n\u2019y a m\u00eame pas eu de mise \u00e0 jour officielle entre le 5 juin 2012 (date \u00e0 laquelle Me Bolter a \u00e9crit sa lettre de r\u00e9ponse au CN au sujet de la disposition de son client \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans la r\u00e9gion de Toronto [Traduction] \u00ab ou ailleurs \u00bb) et la fin des audiences en juin 2013, \u00e0 part le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Waller. Je conviens avec Me Bolter que cela am\u00e8ne un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 penser que rien n\u2019est fait. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite au sujet de la politique et des pratiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du CN sur le plan des communications avec les employ\u00e9s \u00ab relev\u00e9s de leurs fonctions \u00bb.\n3) Des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux r\u00e9cents ou mis \u00e0 jour\n[239] Les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux les plus r\u00e9cents que l\u2019on trouve dans le dossier de M. Croteau et qui proviennent d\u2019un m\u00e9decin sont ceux du Dr Gannon. Ce dernier a \u00e9crit une lettre et une ordonnance toutes deux dat\u00e9es du 28 ao\u00fbt 2008. On peut lire sur l\u2019ordonnance : [Traduction] \u00ab son patient peut retourner au travail sans restrictions quant aux heures de quart \u00bb. Il a \u00e9galement rempli le formulaire du CN [Traduction] \u00ab Rapport m\u00e9dical sur la sant\u00e9 mentale (poste essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9) \u00bb pour M. Croteau, en date du 2 octobre 2008. Le dernier compte rendu d\u2019EMI du Dr Chad porte la date du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2008. La derni\u00e8re lettre de M. AB au CN est dat\u00e9e du 20 avril 2009. M. AB a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 l\u2019aptitude de M. Croteau \u00e0 un retour au travail depuis un certain temps. Il d\u00e9clare que ce dernier [Traduction] \u00ab souffre de troubles anxieux s\u00e9v\u00e8res et chroniques \u00bb. Son \u00e9tat a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au stade chronique.\n[240] Au cours des audiences, Me McFadden a dit au d\u00e9part que son client subirait peut-\u00eatre un autre EMI (le quatri\u00e8me). Plus tard, aux audiences du 16 avril et du 13 juin 2013, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CN ne le ferait probablement pas, mais consulterait plut\u00f4t le m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant au sujet des restrictions relatives au retour au travail de M. Croteau, etc. Je signale que le CN, au dernier jour des audiences, n\u2019avait rien fait de cela. J\u2019ignore s\u2019il l\u2019a fait depuis ce temps.\n[241] Je suis conscient que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la lettre du 5 juin 2012 de Me Bolter et de l\u2019argument qu\u2019il a invoqu\u00e9 pour le compte de son client au cours des audiences, \u00e0 savoir que les quatre restrictions sont maintenues, le CN ne pense peut-\u00eatre pas qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de tenter d\u2019obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 surtout qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun travail disponible qui corresponde \u00e0 ces restrictions. De plus, Mme Waller a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le service de SST a fait savoir que les quatre restrictions de M. Croteau \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme permanentes, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la lettre de Mme Cialone, dat\u00e9e du 22 mai 2012, \u00e0 M. Croteau. J\u2019accepte \u00e9galement que, se fondant sur les nombreuses crises de panique que M. Croteau a eues au cours des audiences, le CN est d\u2019avis que ce dernier n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt de sympt\u00f4mes pendant une p\u00e9riode de six mois en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019un travail crucial sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ainsi que l\u2019exige le Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer, et que les conditions sous-jacentes qui ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 imposer la restriction concernant les t\u00e2ches essentielles ou sensibles sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, par exemple, n\u2019ont pas beaucoup chang\u00e9, sinon pas du tout.\n[242] Pour ce qui est du paragraphe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les \u00ab pratiques exemplaires \u00bb voudraient dire le fait d\u2019obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour en vue de confirmer les restrictions de travail. Ces renseignements sont tir\u00e9s des donn\u00e9es que fournissent les m\u00e9decins au d\u00e9part. Cependant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si le CN avait pris la mesure d\u2019accommodement proc\u00e9durale d\u2019obtenir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 jour aupr\u00e8s du m\u00e9decin de M. Croteau \u00e0 partir de 2009, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que, au fond, cela n\u2019aurait fait aucune diff\u00e9rence du point de vue de l\u2019issue au regard de l\u2019objectif ultime : le retour au travail de M. Croteau au CN. Je dis cela pour les motifs expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente : \u00ab Pourquoi les tentatives de retour au travail de M. Croteau ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuses? Pourquoi la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur d\u2019\u201cEPJ\/Mesures d\u2019accommodement\u201d du CN a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue? \u00bb\n[243] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e et elle est donc rejet\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 longue \u00e0 instruire et a comport\u00e9 de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, s\u2019\u00e9tendant sur une d\u00e9cennie de faits. Je sais que M. Croteau sera d\u00e9\u00e7u. J\u2019ai pr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u2019oreille avec beaucoup d\u2019attention aux arguments que ce dernier a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (ainsi que le CN). Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Croteau a dit : [Traduction] \u00ab J\u2019esp\u00e8re que le Tribunal me permettra de trouver la paix \u00bb. Ceci \u00e9tant dit avec beaucoup de compassion et d\u2019empathie, j\u2019esp\u00e8re que M. Croteau saura trouver la paix et se r\u00e9tablir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019amour et au soutien de sa famille, \u00e0 sa force et \u00e0 sa d\u00e9termination interne, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019aide de M. AB. Il est un homme s\u00e9rieux et intelligent, qui a encore de nombreuses ann\u00e9es devant lui.\nXIII. La conclusion\nSign\u00e9e par\nMatthew D.

La premi\u00e8re plainte, contre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (Postes Canada) (20130538), \u00e9tait une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). La seconde plainte, contre l\u2019Association des officiers des postes du Canada (l\u2019Association) (20130539), \u00e9tait une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre des articles 9 et 10 de la Loi. La Commission a demand\u00e9 que les deux plaintes fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019une seule instruction.\nII. Les positions des parties [2] Le 24 avril 2014, le Tribunal a propos\u00e9 aux parties de participer \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation en vue de r\u00e9gler les diff\u00e9rends avant que les plaintes ne soient entendues devant le Tribunal.\n[3] Le 14 mai 2014, on a re\u00e7u la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse des parties, laquelle a confirm\u00e9 que toutes les parties avaient accept\u00e9 de prendre part au processus de m\u00e9diation.\n[4] Le m\u00eame jour, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli que les parties avaient jusqu\u2019au 11 juin 2014, au plus tard, pour d\u00e9poser leur m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation.\n[5] Le 22 mai 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Association, a \u00e9crit une lettre au Tribunal pour lui demander d\u2019autoriser les parties \u00e0 terminer les n\u00e9gociations, qui devaient reprendre la semaine du 9 juin 2014, avant de d\u00e9poser leur m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation et de participer au processus de m\u00e9diation. L\u2019Association souligne que les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi font l\u2019objet de discussions dans le contexte des n\u00e9gociations collectives.\n[6] Le 23 mai 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Postes Canada, a demand\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation soit prorog\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au vendredi 11 juillet 2014, en raison des dates des vacances et des conflits horaires dans le calendrier des litiges entre leurs clients donneurs d\u2019instructions et leurs avocats. Le m\u00eame jour, l\u2019Association a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne demandait pas que le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 au 11 juin 2014 soit prorog\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une date particuli\u00e8re; elle demandait plut\u00f4t que le Tribunal laisse le pr\u00e9sent dossier en suspens en attendant que les n\u00e9gociations collectives prennent fin. L\u2019Association a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que les parties reprennent les n\u00e9gociations en juin 2014. Toutefois, l\u2019Association affirme qu\u2019il est peu probable qu\u2019on parvienne au renouvellement de la convention avant l\u2019automne.\n[7] Le 27 mai 2014, Postes Canada a souscrit \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019Association. Le m\u00eame jour, la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle s\u2019opposait \u00e0 la demande de mise en suspens du dossier de l\u2019Association. La plaignante soutient que sa plainte est fond\u00e9e sur la formulation de la convention collective qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e en septembre 2009 et qui a pris fin le 31 mars 2014. Elle ajoute que, quelle que soit l\u2019issue des n\u00e9gociations actuellement en cours, cela n\u2019aura aucune pertinence ou incidence en ce qui concerne sa situation, vu que la nouvelle convention couvrira la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 1er avril 2014. La plaignante affirme que la convention collective ne peut pas avoir d\u2019effets r\u00e9troactifs et redresser des situations pass\u00e9es. En outre, la plaignante partira \u00e0 la retraite le 12 septembre 2014. Pour finir, la plaignante n\u2019a aucune objection en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 11 juin 2014, et elle appuie la demande de Postes Canada en vue d\u2019obtenir la prorogation du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour d\u00e9poser son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation.\n[8] Le 2 juin 2014, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 23 mai 2014 et \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 27 mai 2014, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne consentait pas \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019Association. La Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il convient de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation comme pr\u00e9vu, en tenant pour acquis que toutes les parties y consentent encore.\n[9] Dans la r\u00e9ponse du 2 juin 2014, l\u2019Association fait valoir que, du point de vue de la politique publique, il en va de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties concern\u00e9es (Postes Canada et l\u2019Association) qu\u2019on parvienne \u00e0 un accord \u00e0 l\u2019amiable au moyen des n\u00e9gociations collectives. Nonobstant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la plaignante et la Commission peuvent potentiellement faire de la convention collective, et plus particuli\u00e8rement de la clause en cause, l\u2019Association affirme que les parties aux n\u00e9gociations collectives doivent avoir priorit\u00e9 pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 toute all\u00e9gation de discrimination.\n[10] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019Association exprime respectueusement son d\u00e9saccord \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la plaignante selon laquelle tout r\u00e8glement auquel on parviendrait \u00e0 la table des n\u00e9gociations n\u2019aurait aucune incidence sur elle. L\u2019Association soutient que les parties pourraient parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement qui aura une incidence sur la plaignante et pourrait avoir un effet r\u00e9troactif.\n[11] Pour finir, l\u2019Association soutient qu\u2019aucune partie ne subira de pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant du retard propos\u00e9, et que, dans les circonstances, le fait de mettre le dossier en suspens est un moyen raisonnable et sens\u00e9 de traiter de la question en litige.\nIII. Analyse [12] Premi\u00e8rement, il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et que le fait de se prononcer sur l\u2019ajournement d\u2019une affaire rel\u00e8ve bel et bien de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Je conclus que les principes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finis dans la d\u00e9cision Baltruweit c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9), 2004 TCDP 14 (CanLII), s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d\u2019importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d\u2019ajournement. Ce principe est analys\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad c. Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration, [1989] 1. R.C.S. 560. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de son enqu\u00eate d\u2019immigration en attendant que le Ministre rende sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa demande visant \u00e0 lui permettre de demeurer au Canada. L\u2019arbitre a rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019ajournement.\n[16] Dans son jugement, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que les tribunaux administratifs, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, sont ma\u00eetres chez eux et fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, ces tribunaux sont tenus de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. [Voir aussi Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers\u2019 International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (C.A. Ont.), Pierre c. Ministre de la Main-d\u2019\u0153uvre et de l\u2019Immigration, [1978] 2 C.F. 849, 851 (C.F. 1re inst.)].\n[13] Cela \u00e9tant dit, lorsqu\u2019il examine une demande d\u2019ajournement, le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement tenir compte du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. \u00bb L\u2019exercice par le Tribunal de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est assujetti aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle, de m\u00eame qu\u2019au r\u00e9gime de la Loi. Cette derni\u00e8re exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il instruise la plainte quand la Commission lui en fait la demande et, aussi, qu\u2019il accorde aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments et leurs observations. L\u2019article 2 de la Loi fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9limination des pratiques discriminatoires. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet article, les all\u00e9gations de discrimination doivent \u00eatre instruites de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et en temps opportun. Voir la d\u00e9cision Blain c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2012 TCDP 13, aux paragraphes 12 et 14.\n[14] En outre, j\u2019adopte \u00e9galement les motifs que le Tribunal a prononc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Marshall c. Cerescorp Co, aux paragraphes 11 et 12 :\nConform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal doit se faire sans formalisme et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Cependant, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de ses propres proc\u00e9dures, il peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il juge appropri\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir L\u00e9ger c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada [1999] D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en respectant les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, au paragraphe 17). Le Tribunal peut devoir tenir compte de questions de justice naturelle telles que la non-accessibilit\u00e9 de la preuve, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner pour trouver un avocat ou la communication tardive de la partie adverse.\n[\u2026] Pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 obtienne un ajournement, il doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il subirait un d\u00e9ni de justice naturelle si l\u2019instruction devant le Tribunal poursuivait son cours normal. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne m\u2019a pas convaincu qu\u2019il subirait n\u00e9cessairement un tel pr\u00e9judice si je n\u2019accordais pas l\u2019ajournement.\n[15] Pour finir, quand il est question d\u2019un ajournement de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal, compte tenu de la nature quasi-constitutionnelle de la Loi et de son objet, ainsi que de l\u2019importance que l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice et les droits de la personne ont dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les ajournements ne devraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s que dans des cas exceptionnels, et conform\u00e9ment aux principes dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question ci\u2011dessus.\nIV. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [16] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et apr\u00e8s r\u00e9flexion, l\u2019Association, qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la demande d\u2019ajournement, n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019instruction ne serait pas ajourn\u00e9e comme elle l\u2019a demand\u00e9, elle subirait un d\u00e9ni d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale ou de justice naturelle ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments et ses observations. Je ne dispose pas de tous les renseignements, et il est possible que certaines questions en litige puissent se voir circonscrites ou examin\u00e9es dans le contexte des n\u00e9gociations collectives, ce qui traiterait les plaintes ou une partie des plaintes. Toutefois, il est \u00e9galement vraisemblable que la convention collective ne traite pas de toutes les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi, et, plus important encore, il n\u2019existe aucune garantie que les parties parviendront \u00e0 une entente du simple fait que les n\u00e9gociations prendront fin. Le fait de mettre le dossier en suspens g\u00e9n\u00e9rera des retards inutiles dans le traitement du dossier.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019Association est rejet\u00e9e.\n[18] Les parties recevront bient\u00f4t une lettre dans laquelle on les informera des dates \u00e9tablies pour la communication de la preuve et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 18 juin 2014",

Contexte [1] La plaignante, Madame Leslie Palm, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes de discrimination contre les intim\u00e9s International Longshore and Warehouse Union, local 500 (ci-apr\u00e8s I.L.W.U.)

Dans le cas d\u2019une loi relative aux droits de la personne, il faut se rappeler qu\u2019elle exprime des valeurs essentielles et vise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019objectifs fondamentaux.

(Nous soulignons)\n[\u2026]\n[62] Certes, la LCDP demeure consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une loi quasi constitutionnelle qui appelle une interpr\u00e9tation large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique en rapport avec cette nature particuli\u00e8re. Toutefois, on ne saurait substituer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse textuelle et contextuelle une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique dans le seul but de donner effet \u00e0 une autre d\u00e9cision de principe que celle prise par le l\u00e9gislateur (Bell Canada c.

Contexte\nA. Position du Plaignant\n[1] Le plaignant, Chris Hughes, soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9, Transports Canada, l\u2019a discrimin\u00e9 contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, sur la base de certaines d\u00e9ficiences qu\u2019aurait v\u00e9cues le plaignant et cela, dans le cadre de quatre (4) comp\u00e9titions que le plaignant avait postul\u00e9es afin d\u2019obtenir un emploi aupr\u00e8s de Transports Canada.\n[2] De plus, le plaignant maintient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait fait preuve de repr\u00e9sailles en son endroit contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne tenant compte qu\u2019il aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00ab Agence du revenu du Canada \u00bb (ARC) et l\u2019agence de douanes \u00ab Agence des services frontaliers du Canada \u00bb (ASFC).\n[3] Dans le cadre d\u2019une premi\u00e8re candidature pour un poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04) portant le num\u00e9ro 05MOT-OC-VAN-005187, il soutient qu\u2019il aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 au comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait de fa\u00e7on claire et positive une \u00e9valuation de ses performances ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 pour le service f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour lequel il a travaill\u00e9 (service public f\u00e9d\u00e9ral).\n[4] Dans son application pour le poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04), le plaignant indique qu\u2019il aurait fait part au comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection en place qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sujet d\u2019un traitement discriminatoire et de repr\u00e9sailles dans les endroits o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, soit l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC.\n[5] De fait, il a port\u00e9 plainte contre l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC pour lesdites pratiques discriminatoires dont il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. \u00c0 la suite des mauvais traitements qu\u2019il aurait subis chez ses derniers employeurs, il aurait souffert de stress et de d\u00e9pression. Le plaignant indique que pour son application au poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04), sa candidature aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e m\u00eame s\u2019il avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait les qualifications essentielles afin d\u2019obtenir le poste convoit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04).\n[6] \u00c9galement, le plaignant indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait rejet\u00e9 sa candidature pour trois (3) autres emplois qu\u2019il aurait appliqu\u00e9s, soit : \u00ab inspecteur r\u00e9gional de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des pr\u00e9paratifs d\u2019urgence \u00bb (concours TI-06 \u2013 processus de s\u00e9lection no 05-MOT-OC-VAN-005467; \u00ab inspecteur r\u00e9gional de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des transports et des pr\u00e9paratifs d\u2019urgence \u00bb (concours TI\u201106 \u2013 processus de s\u00e9lection no 06-MOT-OC-VAN-008455) et finalement, une troisi\u00e8me application connue comme \u00e9tant \u00ab inspecteur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des transports \u00bb (concours TI-06 \u2013 processus de s\u00e9lection no 07-MOT-EA-VAN-60712.\n[7] C\u2019est dans ce contexte de ces quatre (4) applications que le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 discrimin\u00e9 et cela, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et \u00e9galement, qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sujet \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles et cela, contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne tenant compte de plaintes ant\u00e9rieures qu\u2019il aurait formul\u00e9es contre les agences mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus.\n[8] Pour une meilleure compr\u00e9hension des dispositions l\u00e9gales applicables, le Tribunal fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne lequel se lit comme suit :\nArticle 7 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu ;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nArticle 14.1 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n1998, ch. 9, art. 14.\nB. Position de l\u2019Intim\u00e9\n[9] Dans son argumentation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique au Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de discrimination pour aucune des applications pour lesquelles le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature.\n[10] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat qu\u2019\u00e0 chacune des applications pour lesquelles le plaignant a postul\u00e9, elles requ\u00e9raient des exigences sp\u00e9cifiques et d\u00e9pendant des particularit\u00e9s de chacune des applications, des connaissances ainsi que de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du plaignant, la candidature du plaignant fut rejet\u00e9e. Si la candidature du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que cela est d\u00fb essentiellement au fait que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019indiquer qu\u2019il avait l\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise pour les applications en cause.\n[11] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique qu\u2019il revenait au plaignant d\u2019indiquer ou de prouver qu\u2019il avait les comp\u00e9tences requises afin de pouvoir obtenir l\u2019un des emplois o\u00f9 il a postul\u00e9.\n[12] Cette preuve devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e au moyen de tests \u00e9crits, d\u2019entrevues ainsi que de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences requises \u00e9galement dans le cadre de ces emplois.\n[13] Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que pour chacune des applications pour lesquelles le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature, il n\u2019avait pas les qualifications requises pour chacune de ces applications.\nC. Position de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\n[14] Au tout d\u00e9but de sa pr\u00e9sentation, la repr\u00e9sentante de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) indique que leur participation est directement reli\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019aspect des repr\u00e9sailles et de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dans le contexte de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[15] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la Commission soutient qu\u2019il serait utile de savoir si les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi prot\u00e8ge des individus qui ont port\u00e9 des plaintes de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une agence de la Couronne et qu\u2019elle prot\u00e8gerait ces individus de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de d\u2019autres agences de la Couronne. En d\u2019autres termes, la Commission s\u2019interroge \u00e0 savoir si les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi doivent \u00eatre lues comme couvrant des repr\u00e9sailles de la part de d\u2019autres agences de la Couronne lesquelles ne sont pas parties \u00e0 la plainte actuellement sous \u00e9tude.\n[16] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, si la r\u00e9ponse est affirmative \u00e0 la question ci-dessus, est-ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ni\u00e9 au plaignant une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 cause de plaintes qu\u2019il aurait port\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ASFC ou d\u2019ARC ? Telle est la question subsidiaire que pose la Commission au tribunal.\n[17] Finalement, la Commission soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019arguments au regard de la premi\u00e8re question mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus et en cons\u00e9quence, elle demande au Tribunal d\u2019adopter sa position pour les faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[18] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas de preuve qui pourrait soutenir une conclusion de repr\u00e9sailles tant de la part d\u2019autres agences gouvernementales que par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du plaignant.\nII. Les faits\nA. Preuve du Plaignant\n[19] \u00c0 fin d\u2019\u00e9tablir sa preuve, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a fait entendre ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019audience et a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 un sommaire de plainte dat\u00e9 du 27 janvier 2008 (C3-128) en premier lieu et le plaignant a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re application pour le poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04), application qui fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2005.\n[20] Dans le cadre de cette application, le plaignant a eu une entrevue aupr\u00e8s du Comit\u00e9 alors en charge des candidatures, lequel Comit\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par monsieur John Lavers, ce dernier \u00e9tait \u00e9galement accompagn\u00e9 de deux (2) autres membres, soit madame Sonya Wood ainsi que de monsieur Ron Perkio.\n[21] Le Plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a alors compl\u00e9t\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s la phase d\u2019entrevue pour l\u2019application qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et que subs\u00e9quemment, son application fut rendue \u00e0 la phase de v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournies par ledit comit\u00e9.\n[22] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal, en r\u00e9visant son curriculum vitae, qu\u2019il avait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab agent des contacts pour les recouvrements\/agent de conformit\u00e9 \u2013PM-01 \u00bb, \u00e0 compter du 1er f\u00e9vrier 1995 jusqu\u2019au 4 d\u00e9cembre 1999, puis du 1er mai 2000 jusqu\u2019au 14 septembre 2001.\n[23] Par la suite, il a occup\u00e9 le poste d\u2019\u00ab inspecteur des douanes \u2013 PM-02 \u00bb du 6 mai 2002 au 14 octobre 2002 ainsi que du 28 avril 2003 au 26 septembre 2003.\n[24] Finalement, il a occup\u00e9 la fonction d\u2019\u00ab agent de guichet d\u2019affaires \u2013 PM-01 \u00bb pour les p\u00e9riodes de temps suivantes : soit du 5 d\u00e9cembre 1999 au 30 avril 2000, du 28 novembre 2001 au 5 mai 2002, puis du 15 octobre 2002 au 25 avril 2003 et finalement, du 19 septembre 2003 jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 son curriculum vitae fourni \u00e0 l\u2019audience (C4 Tab1).\n[25] Par la suite, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 dans diff\u00e9rentes positions pour de courtes p\u00e9riodes de temps inspecteur soit dans le secteur priv\u00e9 ainsi que dans le secteur public. En juillet 2011, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par Election British Columbia afin d\u2019assister le directeur des \u00e9lections, pour une courte p\u00e9riode de temps de cinq (5) ou six (6) semaines. Il \u00e9tait sans emploi depuis septembre 2011.\n[26] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, pour les besoins de cette application faite par le plaignant aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9, un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9 trois (3) membres \u00e0 savoir monsieur John Lavers, madame Sonya Wood ainsi que de monsieur Ron Perkio afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination des candidats admissibles \u00e0 cet emploi.\n[27] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ussi l\u2019examen \u00e9crit dans un premier temps et par la suite, il fut invit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer \u00e0 une entrevue avec les membres du comit\u00e9.\n[28] Ainsi, le plaignant a indiqu\u00e9 que son entrevue orale s\u2019est \u00e9galement d\u00e9roul\u00e9e avec succ\u00e8s et en cons\u00e9quence, la troisi\u00e8me phase de son application devait donc se poursuivre avec l\u2019examen des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 son endroit.\n[29] Le plaignant indique dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fourni imm\u00e9diatement de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection tenant compte qu\u2019il savait que des questions relativement \u00e0 ses plaintes ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019ARC et de ASFC se poseraient et\/ou auraient pu influencer le pointage \u00e0 ce qui attrait \u00e0 son entrevue pour le poste de PM-04. Cons\u00e9quemment, il a donc attendu d\u2019\u00eatre recontact\u00e9 afin de fournir ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[30] Il indique au Tribunal qu\u2019en 2001, il a v\u00e9cu une situation de \u00ab cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 au stress \u00bb suite \u00e0 un incident survenu dans le cadre de son travail lequel lui aurait caus\u00e9 cette r\u00e9action de stress importante.\n[31] De m\u00eame, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait souffert de d\u00e9pression en 2005, cette d\u00e9pression originant encore une fois \u00e0 une circonstance survenue dans le cadre de son travail ant\u00e9rieur.\n[32] En effet, le plaignant indique au Tribunal qu\u2019il aurait arr\u00eat\u00e9 un acte ill\u00e9gal qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par l\u2019ARC en l\u2019an 2000 et que par la suite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles et plusieurs promotions lui furent refus\u00e9es par l\u2019ARC.\n[33] \u00c9galement, il confirme que cette situation de stress lui aurait caus\u00e9 une d\u00e9pression durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2005 et que par la suite, il fut incapable de travailler durant certaines p\u00e9riodes de temps en 2004. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que cela \u00e9tait pour du stress (cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 au stress).\n[34] Ainsi, le plaignant indique dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il fut contact\u00e9 au d\u00e9but du mois de f\u00e9vrier 2006 par le pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9, soit monsieur John Lavers, afin d\u2019obtenir trois (3) r\u00e9f\u00e9rences afin d\u2019appuyer sa candidature.\n[35] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant a donc re\u00e7u un appel de monsieur Lavers en date du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2006.\n[36] Apr\u00e8s cet appel, le plaignant a alors fourni \u00e0 monsieur Lavers certaines r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, lesquelles apparaissent dans un courriel adress\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur John Lavers en date du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2006 (voir C1 onglet 26).\n[37] Consid\u00e9rant que le plaignant \u00e9tait alors appel\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au soutien de son application, le plaignant a alors contact\u00e9 certains de ses employeurs ant\u00e9rieurs afin de l\u2019aider \u00e0 fournir les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au soutien de son dossier.\n[38] Le plaignant a alors indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir de telles r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et alors, il en a inform\u00e9 monsieur John Lavers, le tout tel qu\u2019il appert aux diff\u00e9rents \u00e9changes de courriels apparaissant au dossier (voir C1 onglet 28 plus particuli\u00e8rement).\n[39] Dans un des courriels adress\u00e9 par le plaignant \u00e0 monsieur John Lavers, plus particuli\u00e8rement celui du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006, le plaignant avait inform\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, de certaines difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences n\u00e9cessaires. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le plaignant informe alors monsieur Lavers que certaines r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9vasives ou ne pas vouloir lui fournir de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[40] De m\u00eame, il informe monsieur Lavers que le refus d\u2019obtenir de telles r\u00e9f\u00e9rences n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec les performances ou sa fiabilit\u00e9 au travail ou sa personnalit\u00e9. Il informe alors monsieur Lavers qu\u2019il y aurait eu un r\u00e8glement de cour avec ASFC et ARC, r\u00e8glement survenu le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Il mentionne dans le m\u00eame courriel que ces deux (2) agences soit l\u2019\u00ab Agence du revenu du Canada \u00bb (ARC) et l\u2019agence de douanes \u00ab Agence des services frontaliers du Canada \u00bb (ASFC) faisaient originalement parties du m\u00eame organisme connu comme \u00e9tant l\u2019ADRC.\n[41] Dans le m\u00eame courriel, le plaignant indique \u00e0 monsieur Lavers qu\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 pour l\u2019Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) laquelle firme l\u2019a engag\u00e9 sans h\u00e9sitation et que si tel \u00e9tait le d\u00e9sir de monsieur Lavers, ICBC pouvait alors fournir une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence le concernant.\n[42] Dans sa preuve, le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un courriel adress\u00e9 par monsieur John Lavers aux deux (2) autres membres du Comit\u00e9, soit madame Sonya Wood et monsieur Ron Perkio, lequel courriel est dat\u00e9 du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 dans lequel monsieur Lavers fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu\u2019il y aurait des [traduction] \u00ab questions en suspens \u00bb relativement \u00e0 ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. Monsieur Lavers demande alors \u00e0 monsieur Perkio s\u2019il avait des commentaires \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, (voir C1 onglet 28 page 137).\n[43] Le lendemain, soit le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, madame Sonya Wood adresse un courriel \u00e0 monsieur John Lavers et monsieur Ron Perkio lequel se lit comme suit :\n[traduction]\nBonjour John, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une situation inhabituelle.

Il s\u2019agissait en fait d\u2019une candidature pour un poste tel que d\u00e9crit ci-dessus mais pour une qualification TI-06.\n[59] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que pour sa candidature pour le poste de PM-04, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il devait effectuer un test \u00e9crit afin de se qualifier. Or, comme la note de passage \u00e9tait de 70% pour cet examen \u00e9crit, les r\u00e9sultats du plaignant en ce qui a trait \u00e0 cet examen \u00e9crit furent de 60%. Cons\u00e9quemment, sa candidature f\u00fbt donc rejet\u00e9e pour cette raison.\n[60] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant fait part de son d\u00e9sappointement \u00e0 l\u2019effet que normalement dans les applications d\u2019emploi au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, il devrait y avoir l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un test standardis\u00e9. Or, il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019un test diff\u00e9rent, l\u2019examen WCT345, fut administr\u00e9 pour les besoins de cet emploi.\n[61] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une lettre de Madame Sonya Wood dat\u00e9e du 26 juin 2006 relativement au poste de TI-06 auquel il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ci\u2011dessus. (C-2, onglet 74) Madame Wood lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019effectivement il avait obtenu un r\u00e9sultat de 60% \u00e0 l\u2019examen de communication \u00e9crite 345 alors que la note de passage \u00e9tait de 70 % pour ce test.\n[62] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il aurait fait part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 Transports Canada relativement \u00e0 cette question. .\n[63] De m\u00eame, il aurait \u00e9galement discut\u00e9 avec Madame Sonya Wood ou Madame Debbie Guinn, ou les deux, et il aurait fait part \u00e0 ces personnes qu\u2019il aurait eu une crampe \u00e0 la main au moment o\u00f9 il a effectu\u00e9 ce test. Le plaignant indique qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de commentaires particuliers de la part de Madame Wood ou Madame Guinn relativement au fait qu\u2019il aurait d\u00e9plor\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait souffert d\u2019une crampe \u00e0 la main au moment o\u00f9 il a effectu\u00e9 son test \u00e9crit.\n[64] Le plaignant consid\u00e8re que cette crampe \u00e0 la main a certainement affect\u00e9 son score final pour cet examen.\n[65] Par la suite, le plaignant indique qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un deuxi\u00e8me poste \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab inspecteur r\u00e9gional de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des pr\u00e9paratifs d\u2019urgence \u00bb au niveau TI-06 \u00e9galement.\n[66] La date de cl\u00f4ture en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la candidature \u00e9tait le 3 ao\u00fbt 2006.\n[67] Selon le plaignant, cette deuxi\u00e8me candidature pour un poste de TI-06 repr\u00e9sentait une position \u00e9quivalente avec une classification \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 celui du premier TI-06.\n[68] Encore une fois, apr\u00e8s avoir appris que sa candidature avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue, elle f\u00fbt subs\u00e9quemment rejet\u00e9e consid\u00e9rant que, selon Transports Canada, le plaignant n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00ab suffisamment \u00bb d\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00ab dans la conduite d\u2019enqu\u00eates \u00bb.\n[69] Cette information a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e au plaignant dans un courriel apparaissant dans les pi\u00e8ces, soit C2 Onglet 96, et dat\u00e9e du 12 octobre 2006.\n[70] Pourtant, le plaignant insiste dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les deux emplois \u00e9taient exactement les m\u00eames selon lui.\n[71] Au regard de cette deuxi\u00e8me application pour un poste de TI-06, le plaignant indique que dans son application, il avait clairement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience dans la conduite d\u2019enqu\u00eates (\u00ab in conducting investigations \u00bb).\n[72] Tenant compte de son d\u00e9saccord face \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision pour le deuxi\u00e8me poste de TI-06, le plaignant a alors \u00e9crit \u00e0 Transports Canada afin de faire part de son d\u00e9saccord et \u00e9galement, il a requis que sa candidature soit retenue de nouveau.\n[73] Toutefois, il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune r\u00e9ponse ne lui f\u00fbt envoy\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 sa demande et cons\u00e9quemment, il a inscrit une plainte formelle aupr\u00e8s de la Commission de la fonction publique (Voir C2 Onglet 100).\n[74] Finalement, dans son t\u00e9moignage le plaignant indique qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une troisi\u00e8me application, encore une fois pour un poste de niveau TI-06, soit un poste d\u2019\u00ab inspecteur de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des transports \u00bb, avec une date de cl\u00f4ture au 2 avril 2007.\n[75] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au niveau d\u2019exp\u00e9rience requis pour ce type d\u2019emploi, soit \u00ab l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la conduite d\u2019enqu\u00eates pouss\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[76] Relativement \u00e0 cette troisi\u00e8me candidature \u00e0 un poste TI-06, le plaignant a alors modifi\u00e9 son curriculum vitae afin d\u2019y joindre de fa\u00e7on plus sp\u00e9cifique son exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure au niveau de ses diff\u00e9rents emplois, mais \u00e9galement il a fait mention de son exp\u00e9rience personnelle au niveau de ce qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] \u00ab enqu\u00eate exhaustive relativement \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9, mis sur une liste noire et ai fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles de la part d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (ADRC) et de l\u2019ARC ainsi que de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) \u00bb.

Il confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il f\u00fbt grandement d\u00e9prim\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du fait qu\u2019on lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9ussi les diff\u00e9rents tests requis pour les applications auxquelles il avait particip\u00e9es, plus particuli\u00e8rement, par le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas obtenu des r\u00e9ponses ad\u00e9quates.\n[87] Il indique finalement au Tribunal que les six derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui un cauchemar.\n[88] Dans son contre-interrogatoire du plaignant, la repr\u00e9sentante de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle se penchera plus particuli\u00e8rement sur l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[89] Dans un premier temps, elle attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur diff\u00e9rentes annotations apparaissant dans les \u00e9valuations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par le comit\u00e9 en charge des candidatures en ce qui a trait au poste d\u2019\u00ab analyse de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04) (Voir onglets 40, 41 et 39).\n[90] Ainsi, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019onglet C-1 Onglet 40, et dat\u00e9 du 2 mars 2006 sign\u00e9 par Monsieur John Lavers, elle attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal \u00e0 la page 231, question 14, relativement au crit\u00e8re d\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[91] Dans une question adress\u00e9e au plaignant, elle demande \u00e0 ce dernier quelle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la note envisageable de ce que l\u2019on voit \u00e0 l\u2019annotation \u00e0 la page 231 qui indique [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s bon exemple \u00bb.\n[92] Le plaignant indique au Tribunal que cette annotation lui aurait s\u00fbrement valu une note entre 18 et 16 sur la grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation apparaissant \u00e0 la page 236 du m\u00eame onglet.\n[93] Toutefois, le plaignant mentionne au Tribunal que la note 12 lui f\u00fbt attribu\u00e9e avec la mention [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9chec \u00bb.\n[94] Subs\u00e9quemment, elle attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 41 de la pi\u00e8ce C1, plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la page 247, o\u00f9 l\u2019on retrouve l\u2019annotation [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s bon sur sa question d\u2019entrevue \u00bb. Le plaignant indique au Tribunal que la m\u00eame note 18 \u00e0 16 aurait d\u00fb lui \u00eatre octroy\u00e9e et non une note de 12 tel qu\u2019il appert \u00e0 la page 238.\n[95] Finalement, l\u2019avocate attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 39, page 215, o\u00f9 l\u2019on retrouve une annotation [traduction] \u00ab bien r\u00e9pondu \u2013 r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te \u00bb. Le plaignant indique au Tribunal qu\u2019encore une fois, il aurait d\u00fb avoir une annotation de 18 \u00e0 16 au lieu de la note de 12 tel qu\u2019elle lui f\u00fbt attribu\u00e9e au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019onglet \u00e0 la page 206.\n[96] Le plaignant indique au Tribunal qu\u2019en ce qui a trait au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb, il aurait ad\u00e9quatement satisfait ce crit\u00e8re.\n[97] Dans le contre-interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant est revenu sur les probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, et pour lesquels il a agi \u00e0 titre de \u00ab d\u00e9nonciateur \u00bb.\n[98] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il indique que cette action de sa part afin de d\u00e9noncer une activit\u00e9 ill\u00e9gale lui aurait attir\u00e9 de l\u2019animosit\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la part de d\u2019autres personnes de la m\u00eame agence o\u00f9 il travaillait.\n[99] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il a fait \u00e9tat au fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019obtenir les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour les emplois d\u2019officier aux douanes et d\u2019\u00ab agent des recouvrements et de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00bb pour des emplois qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9s aux alentours de la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2000. Il a alors constat\u00e9 le langage tr\u00e8s dur et les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs apparaissant dans ces rapports.\n[100] Le plaignant indique que suite \u00e0 ces r\u00e9f\u00e9rences n\u00e9gatives, il est entr\u00e9 dans une p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 pour cause de stress en 2001 laquelle s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e en un \u00e9tat d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 puis finalement en 2005, cette situation m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9volu\u00e9 vers un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9pression.\n[101] Relativement aux difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait rencontr\u00e9es aux alentours des ann\u00e9es 2000, et tel que mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le plaignant a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait cherch\u00e9, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019une m\u00e9diation, \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ses dossiers et de se trouver un emploi. Toutefois, il indique que suite \u00e0 certaines mauvaises informations ainsi que de menaces qui lui furent faites, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner. Cons\u00e9quemment, il a obtenu un d\u00e9dommagement de cinquante-cinq mille dollars (51 000,00 $) en date du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2005, mais fut incapable de trouver un emploi \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du ARC. \u00c9galement dans son interrogatoire, il mentionne que l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus dans le r\u00e8glement qu\u2019il avait obtenu, et cela, aux m\u00eames conditions.\n[102] Additionnellement, il indique au Tribunal que dans le cadre du r\u00e8glement qu\u2019il avait obtenu, les parties avaient convenues que monsieur Brian Currie devait agir \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence afin de permettre au plaignant de se trouver un nouvel emploi.\n[103] Un peu plus loin dans le contre-interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 une question de ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019effet de savoir de la part du plaignant si effectivement monsieur Lavers aurait agit en faisant des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 son endroit, le plaignant a alors indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nQ - \u00cates-vous d\u2019avis que M. Lavers exer\u00e7ait des repr\u00e9sailles contre vous?\nR - Oui, parce que je lui ai expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi aucun nom n\u2019apparaissait dans mes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et je lui ai dit que j\u2019avais d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dans le pass\u00e9, et je lui ai fourni des \u00e9valuations du rendement \u00e9tablies par ces m\u00eames personnes qui refusaient de me servir de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, lesquelles \u00e9valuations montraient que j\u2019\u00e9tais un bon employ\u00e9. Donc il \u2013 oui, il faisait partie de ceux qui ont exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1, en me faisant \u00e9chouer sous couvert de pr\u00e9textes, oui.\nQ - Qui d\u2019autre en faisait partie?\nR - Eh bien, selon moi, l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC auraient d\u00fb me donner des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\nQ - Mais elles ne sont pas parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, n\u2019est-ce pas?\nR - Effectivement, elles ne le sont pas.\n(Voir extrait de t\u00e9moignage du 20 mars 2013, page 14, lignes 7 \u00e0 22).\n[104] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes annotations apparaissant dans la pi\u00e8ce C-1 onglet 30 et confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il aurait rempli ad\u00e9quatement les conditions apparaissant dans les crit\u00e8res de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[105] Dans son contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a \u00e9galement r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles sa candidature n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour les trois postes TI-06.\n[106] Ainsi, en ce qui attrait \u00e0 premi\u00e8re sa candidature concernant l\u2019emploi TI-06, il confirme qu\u2019il aurait eu une crampe \u00e0 la main laquelle ne lui a pas permis de remplir ad\u00e9quatement le test d\u2019\u00e9criture requis. En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019avocat souligne qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune mention de probl\u00e8me de crampe \u00e0 la main dans sa plainte qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au soutien du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[107] En ce qui attrait \u00e0 sa deuxi\u00e8me candidature pour un poste de TI-06, le plaignant a maintenu qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait les aptitudes requises et n\u00e9cessaires au niveau de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de conduite des enqu\u00eates et que finalement en ce qui attrait \u00e0 sa candidature pour un troisi\u00e8me poste en TI-06, en ce qui attrait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019avoir conduit des enqu\u00eate de fa\u00e7on \u00ab pouss\u00e9e \u00bb, ou plus complexe, il indique au Tribunal que m\u00eame si les annotations qu\u2019il a fait dans sa fiche de candidat n\u2019ont pas directement rapport \u00e0 un emploi, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle qu\u2019on y retrouve indique qu\u2019il aurait fait une enqu\u00eate de fa\u00e7on \u00ab pouss\u00e9e \u00bb et cons\u00e9quemment, il se serait qualifi\u00e9 \u00e9galement pour ce troisi\u00e8me poste de TI-06.\n[108] \u00c9galement, il indique qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019urgence de la situation afin de recruter du personnel pour les postes de TI-06, tenant compte de ses capacit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9es, il indique qu\u2019il y aurait eu pr\u00e9sence de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit puisque sa candidature n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9admise alors que d\u2019autres candidats l\u2019auraient \u00e9t\u00e9.\n[109] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant a fait \u00e9galement mention que puisqu\u2019il avait communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Lavers ses probl\u00e8mes de nature psychologique qu\u2019il avait v\u00e9cus ant\u00e9rieurement, il croit que durant les comp\u00e9titions de TI-06, lesquelles auraient eu lieux simultan\u00e9ment avec sa candidature pour le poste de PM-04, que monsieur Lavers aurait eu des discussions personnelles avec les ressources humaines concernant les appr\u00e9hensions du plaignant et certainement, qu\u2019il avait communiqu\u00e9 son histoire concernant ce qu\u2019il aurait v\u00e9cu avec l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC.

Il y aurait eu un manque de validation \u00e0 cet effet par le plaignant.\n[131] Il indique au Tribunal qu\u2019\u00e0 travers ses fonctions dans d\u2019autres agences, tel que l\u2019ASFC et Transports Canada, il aurait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents comit\u00e9s de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 raison d\u2019une quarantaine de fois.\n[132] Comme troisi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait entendre monsieur Micheal Fu, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 plus particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui attrait au troisi\u00e8me poste de TI-06.\n[133] En fait, monsieur Fu \u00e9tait l\u2019un des trois membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection qui devait s\u00e9lectionner les candidats pour ce poste.\n[134] Au d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Fu a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res apparaissant pour ce poste (Voir C-3 onglet 103), lequel requ\u00e9rait trois types d\u2019exp\u00e9riences dont celle de d\u2019\u00ab exp\u00e9rience dans la conduite d\u2019enqu\u00eates pouss\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[135] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Fu a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 l\u2019application qu\u2019avait faite le plaignant au regard de ce troisi\u00e8me poste de TI-06 et il a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il voyait un candidat faire \u00e9tat de son exp\u00e9rience personnelle \u00e0 titre d\u2019exp\u00e9rience requise pour un tel poste (TI-06).\n[136] Il a notamment fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 par le plaignant en ce qui attrait \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate pour conducteur avec facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tait insuffisante. \u00c9galement, tenant compte de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience relat\u00e9e par le plaignant dans son application en ce qui attrait \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes avec \u00ab l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada \u00bb (ADRC), il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab limit\u00e9e, non li\u00e9e au travail et relative \u00e0 des questions personnelles \u00bb.\n[137] Il confirme encore une fois au Tribunal qu\u2019une simple investigation pour un conducteur ayant conduit avec des facult\u00e9s affaiblies n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante relativement aux crit\u00e8res recherch\u00e9es dans le troisi\u00e8me poste TI-06.\n[138] Il confirme \u00e9galement au Tribunal que tenant compte de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience inad\u00e9quate telle que formul\u00e9e dans la fiche de candidat du plaignant, la candidature du plaignant ne pouvait donc pas \u00eatre retenue il a donc \u00e9crit la mention [traduction] \u00ab NON \u00bb (voir partie sup\u00e9rieure droite page 194 C3 onglet 105).\n[139] En contre interrogatoire par le procureur du plaignant, \u00e0 une question relative au fait s\u2019il avait eu connaissance des plaintes de monsieur Hughes relativement aux autres d\u00e9partements o\u00f9 il avait travaill\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9, et cela, durant le moment o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait membre du comit\u00e9 pour la troisi\u00e8me application TI-06, le t\u00e9moin confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il avait entendu parl\u00e9 de telles plaintes, ce qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant des [traduction] \u00ab discussions de gestionnaires \u00bb. Ces informations originaient de monsieur Brian Bramah et non de madame Sonya Wood, ni de monsieur John Lavers.\n[140] Il confirme \u00e9galement au Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de discussions avec madame Wood ou monsieur Lavers relativement aux plaintes de monsieur Hughes dans les autres d\u00e9partements o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9. \u00c9galement, il confirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de discussion avec monsieur Ron Perkio relativement au plaignant.\n[141] Toujours dans le cadre du contre-interrogatoire du procureur du plaignant, le t\u00e9moin indique au Tribunal qu\u2019en ce qui attrait \u00e0 la mention de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son application (voir pages 595 et 596, C3 onglet 105), il indique au Tribunal qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ces mentions comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab un passe\u2011temps \u00bb et cela sur le temps personnel du plaignant.\n[142] Il a confirm\u00e9 que m\u00eame si ces mentions apparaissaient comme \u00e9tant s\u00e9rieuses, elles \u00e9taient strictement de nature priv\u00e9e. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ces informations ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie d\u2019une enqu\u00eate de fa\u00e7on extensive dans le cadre de la troisi\u00e8me application du TI-06.\n[143] Ainsi, il confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de mesurer les connaissances du plaignant dans sa compr\u00e9hension des lois. De m\u00eame il n\u2019avait aucune base afin de lui permettre de juger cette connaissance des lois chez le plaignant.\n[144] Finalement, en contre-interrogatoire par la procureure de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne relativement \u00e0 sa connaissance des plaintes ant\u00e9rieures qu\u2019auraient formul\u00e9es le plaignant et dont il a eu connaissance dans le cadre d\u2019une discussion avec monsieur Brian Bramah, le t\u00e9moin confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il avait seulement entendu parler du nom du plaignant et que ce dernier avait formul\u00e9 des plaintes aux droits de la personne sans aucune autre mention.\n[145] Comme autre t\u00e9moins au soutient de sa preuve l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait entendre madame Sonya Wood, madame Wood a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019un des trois membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection en ce qui attrait au poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04).\n[146] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, madame Wood indique au Tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournis par le plaignant. Toutefois, dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un courriel dat\u00e9 du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 lequel faisait suite \u00e0 un courriel que lui avait fait parvenir monsieur John Lavers en date du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2006 et\/ou monsieur Lavers indiquait que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournies par monsieur Hughes soulevaient [traduction] \u00ab des questions int\u00e9ressantes \u00bb. (voir C1 onglet 33).\n[147] Aussi, deux r\u00e9ponses au courriel de monsieur Lavers apparaissent donc dans cet onglet. Dans un premier temps, le courriel de monsieur Lavers fut envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Ron Perkio et ce dernier a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 monsieur Lavers ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nCe n\u2019est pas bon signe. \u00c0 toi de dire ce qu\u2019il en est de la politique minist\u00e9rielle, Sonya.\nRon\n[148] Subs\u00e9quemment, madame Sonya Wood a r\u00e9pondu aux courriels de messieurs Lavers et Perkio en date du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 comme suit :\n[traduction]\nBonjour, Comme il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence que j\u2019ai eue avec John ce matin, si un comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019obtenir ou d\u2019effectuer des v\u00e9rifications orales \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u2019un candidat (ou si les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences se refusent \u00e0 fournir des renseignements ou de la r\u00e9troaction oralement), le comit\u00e9 se doit de continuer d\u2019\u00e9valuer les qualit\u00e9s personnelles du candidat, en se servant de tous les renseignements ou outils auxquels le comit\u00e9 a acc\u00e8s.\nC\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire, en l\u2019occurrence, j\u2019ai recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 John de demander \u00e0 M. Hughes des copies de toute \u00e9valuation du rendement et lettres de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou de recommandation qu\u2019il pourrait avoir en sa possession. Je comprends que John a obtenu certains renseignements \u00e9crits relatifs au PER de M. Hughes. Ainsi, en tant que membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, nous devrons examiner et prendre en consid\u00e9ration tous les renseignements contenus dans le PER ainsi que tout renseignement\/l\u2019ensemble des renseignements que nous avons r\u00e9unis au cours du processus d\u2019entrevue et terminer notre \u00e9valuation de M.

Elle confirme au Tribunal que la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de monsieur Hughes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas possible tenant compte qu\u2019aucune des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences du plaignant n\u2019avaient fourni des informations \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une seule, soit celle qu\u2019a obtenu monsieur Lavers de monsieur Bill DiGuistini.\n[152] Elle mentionne au Tribunal que m\u00eame si l\u2019entrevue qu\u2019avait pass\u00e9e monsieur Hugues \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quate, s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournis par monsieur Hugues, \u00e0 ce moment il y avait un manque d\u2019information. Elle confirme donc que l\u2019\u00e9valuation globale fut donc faite en ce sens et ainsi, une annotation de 12\/20 fut accord\u00e9e \u00e0 monsieur Hughes pour cette raison.\n[153] Toujours en contre-interrogatoire par le procureur du plaignant, ce dernier a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 avec le t\u00e9moin, madame Sonya Wood, les documents apparaissant dans la pi\u00e8ce R-4.\n[154] De fa\u00e7on globale, madame Wood pr\u00e9tend que les renseignements fournis sur le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9taient pas essentiellement n\u00e9gatives, mais ne pr\u00e9sentait pas suffisamment d\u2019information afin de pouvoir qualifier le plaignant comme satisfaisant au crit\u00e8re de de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[155] Finalement, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a \u00e9galement r\u00e9vis\u00e9 d\u2019autres fiches de candidats avec madame Wood et les a compar\u00e9es au regard de la fiche du plaignant.\n[156] \u00c0 une question relative \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C1 onglet 41, soit un rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation sign\u00e9 par les membres du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, l\u2019avocat a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que certaines annotations \u00e9crites qui apparaissent dans les autres rapports d\u2019\u00e9valuations auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es dans celle du plaignant (Voir onglet 39, 40 41, plus particuli\u00e8rement la page 222 de l\u2019onglet 40).\n[157] En effet, dans son contre-interrogatoire l\u2019avocat a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que les lettres VG (pour tr\u00e8s bien - \u00ab very good \u00bb) auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es des pages d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la fiche du plaignant.\n[158] Le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019expliquait pas pourquoi lesdites annotations manuelles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9es.\n[159] Comme dernier t\u00e9moin dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait entendre Monsieur John Lavers.\n[160] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Lavers indique qu\u2019il avait la responsabilit\u00e9 de trouver des candidats pour le poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb, soit des positions extr\u00eamement sensibles.\n[161] Il confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les exigences apparaissant \u00e0 l\u2019onglet C1 Onglet 5, en ce qui attrait \u00e0 la recherche des candidats pour le poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04).\n[162] De m\u00eame, dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat des qualifications pour ledit poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04), soit des exigences apparaissant dans la pi\u00e8ce C1 onglet 6, en indiquant que certaines exigences apparaissaient avec un ast\u00e9risque, lesquelles \u00e9taient identifi\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant des \u00ab exigences obligatoires \u00bb.\n[163] De m\u00eame, il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que [traduction] \u00ab les candidats doivent obtenir la note de passage minimale relativement \u00e0 chacune des exigences obligatoires pour que leur candidature aille de l\u2019avant dans le processus. \u00bb (Voir page 23 de la pi\u00e8ce C1 onglet 6).\n[164] Il confirme, qu\u2019en ce qui attrait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb, il s\u2019agissait de trouver des personnes qui \u00e9taient en mesure d\u2019apporter de l\u2019attention aux d\u00e9tails, de s\u2019assurer que ces personnes feraient preuve de \u00ab diligence en mati\u00e8re d\u2019attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[165] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Lavers mentionne que rendu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 fournir, toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournis par le plaignant ont refus\u00e9 de donner des informations \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une seule, soit monsieur Bill DiGuistini.

Aucune d\u00e9viation pour quelque candidat que ce soit fut admise dans le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats.\n[174] Comme la plaignant n\u2019avait pas tout \u00e0 fait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se qualifier lors son entrevue avec le Comit\u00e9, et comme la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences faisait partie de l\u2019entrevue dans le cadre du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation, il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 essentiel d\u2019obtenir de la part du plaignant des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et de v\u00e9rifier lesdites r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[175] C\u2019est ainsi que dans une communication avec le plaignant au tout d\u00e9but du mois de f\u00e9vrier 2006, ce dernier a fourni \u00e0 monsieur Lavers une s\u00e9rie de noms soit de superviseurs ant\u00e9rieurs, soit de valideurs, ou de coll\u00e8gues de travail.\n[176] Il mentionne au Tribunal qu\u2019il recherchait d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de personnes en autorit\u00e9 ou de personnes dans une position de superviseur au regard du plaignant.\n[177] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le t\u00e9moin mentionne qu\u2019il s\u2019en \u00e9tait remis aux instructions des ressources humaines afin de valider les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences des superviseurs de chacun des candidats.\n[178] De m\u00eame, il mentionne au Tribunal que c\u2019est dans ce contexte qu\u2019il a eu des \u00e9changes de courriels avec le plaignant lesquels apparaissent dans l\u2019onglet C1 onglet 28, et pour lequel il a demand\u00e9 l\u2019avis de madame Sonya Wood.\n[179] Ainsi, le plaignant lui a donc fourni les pi\u00e8ces apparaissant dans le document R-4. En r\u00e9visant les informations en ce qui attrait aux r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournies par le plaignant dans ladite pi\u00e8ce R-4, monsieur Lavers a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fourni n\u2019avait accept\u00e9 de donner des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en faveur du plaignant si ce n\u2019est que monsieur Bill DiGuistini. En ce qui attrait \u00e0 ce dernier, monsieur Lavers a mentionn\u00e9 que monsieur DiGuistini n\u2019avait pas offert de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en ce qui attrait \u00e0 la question du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb, aucune information pertinente n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie. (voir C1 onglet 37, page 197)\n[180] En ce qui attrait \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par le plaignant, monsieur Lavers a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un document apparaissant \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C-1 onglet 32, lequel indique ses annotations au regard de chacune des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences qu\u2019il a contact\u00e9es.\n[181] \u00c0 une question pos\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat du plaignant en ce qui attrait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9ponses d\u2019un sup\u00e9rieur pour la question du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb, et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard aucune mention n\u2019apparait dans le formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation en ce qui attrait \u00e0 cette exigence (voir page 231), monsieur Lavers a alors r\u00e9pondu [traduction] \u00ab bonne question \u00e0 poser aux RH \u00bb.\n[182] Finalement, monsieur Lavers a admis qu\u2019en tenant compte des r\u00e9ponses de monsieur Bill DiGuistini qui n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse positive ni n\u00e9gative en ce qui attrait au crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb pour le plaignant, en cons\u00e9quence, il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas satisfait aux crit\u00e8res relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb ou qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une personne \u00ab soucieuse des d\u00e9tails \u00bb.\n[183] \u00c0 une autre question de l\u2019avocat du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019effet de savoir si monsieur Lavers s\u2019\u00e9tait demand\u00e9 pour quelle raison tous les contacts fournis par le plaignant avaient refus\u00e9 de fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en sa faveur, monsieur Lavers a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait pour lui d\u2019une grande question et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pos\u00e9 la m\u00eame question sans \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019y apporter une r\u00e9ponse pr\u00e9cise.\n[184] Additionnellement, monsieur Lavers mentionne ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab il s\u2019en d\u00e9gage visiblement une ligne directrice ou une tendance \u00bb (voir contre-interrogatoire de monsieur Lavers, 11 septembre 2013), indiquant que beaucoup de personnes avaient refus\u00e9 de donner des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, plus particuli\u00e8rement monsieur Bill DiGuistini et madame Kathryn Pringle.\n[185] En contre-interrogatoire par la procureure de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, monsieur Lavers fut interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet de savoir pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas appel\u00e9 l\u2019employeur du plaignant au moment o\u00f9 ce dernier travaillait pour le ICBC.\n[186] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la procureure a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du t\u00e9moin sur un courriel dat\u00e9 du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 adress\u00e9 par le plaignant \u00e0 monsieur Lavers dans lequel l\u2019on retrouve une annotation \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 par ICBC sans h\u00e9sitation et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant aurait offert une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u2019ICBC si cela s\u2019av\u00e9rait n\u00e9cessaire pour les besoins du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection.\n[187] Monsieur John Lavers a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question en indiquant que dans le document pour fin d\u2019entrevue, il n\u2019y avait aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la firme ICBC de m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par le plaignant dans son courriel du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006.\n[188] Il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun nom, titre ou t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, qui fut fourni par le plaignant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De m\u00eame, \u00e0 une autre question pos\u00e9e par la procureure de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, monsieur Lavers a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas qu\u2019il ait demand\u00e9 au plaignant un nom \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aupr\u00e8s de son employeur de ce moment, soit le ICBC.\n[189] Additionnellement, il mentionne que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences sont fournies au Comit\u00e9 par chacun des candidats et que dans le cas du plaignant, toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences qui lui furent fournies avaient un rapport avec l\u2019ARC et le CBSC et aucunement avec le ICBC.\n[190] Toujours dans le m\u00eame contre-interrogatoire, monsieur Lavers indique qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas contact\u00e9 aucun des co-travailleurs du plaignant consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il s\u2019en \u00e9tait tenu \u00e0 ne contacter que des superviseurs du plaignant comme tel.\n[191] De m\u00eame, il a soulign\u00e9 dans son contre-interrogatoire effectu\u00e9 par la repr\u00e9sentante de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne que le document ayant trait \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences plus particuli\u00e8rement celui qu\u2019il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en contactant monsieur Bill DiGuistini (C1 Onglet 37), requ\u00e9rait des r\u00e9ponses provenant de superviseurs de tout candidat tenant compte de la r\u00e9daction du document de v\u00e9rification de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\n[192] De m\u00eame, monsieur Lavers indique qu\u2019il avait besoin de parler \u00e0 une personne directement et non pas de se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer simplement \u00e0 des documents qui auraient pu lui \u00eatre fournis par des candidats.\n[193] \u00c0 une question relative aux courriels envoy\u00e9s par madame Sonya Wood dat\u00e9s du 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (7h55 am) ( C-1, Onglet 28) et du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (8h49 am) (C-1, Onglet 33) sur les recommandations de madame Wood d\u2019obtenir de la part des candidats des lettres ou des rapports d\u2019\u00e9valuation des candidats de m\u00eame que de demander des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences additionnelles ou alternatives de diff\u00e9rents contacts, monsieur Lavers a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas toutes les politiques des ressources humaines alors applicables, et qu\u2019il s\u2019en \u00e9tait tenu a obtenir directement des personnes sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences dont il avait besoin afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer les aptitudes de candidats.\n[194] Cons\u00e9quemment, dans le cas du plaignant Chris Hughes, il a contact\u00e9 les personnes qui lui furent fournies par le plaignant.\n[195] D\u2019autres questions qui lui furent pos\u00e9e par la repr\u00e9sentante de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne , en ce qui attrait aux documents fournis par le plaignant sous la c\u00f4te R-4 lesquels comprenaient diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9valuations ainsi que des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences potentielles dont celle de madame Kathryn Pringle.\n[196] Monsieur Lavers a indiqu\u00e9 que dans le cas de madame Pringle cette derni\u00e8re avait refus\u00e9 de donner des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, mais qu\u2019il ne lui avait pas demand\u00e9 plus sp\u00e9cifiquement pourquoi elle avait refus\u00e9 de donner des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en faveur du plaignant.\nIII. Droit\n[197] Au soutien de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal leurs argumentations \u00e9crites lesquelles furent \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[198] Ainsi, le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et ce, au sens de l\u2019article 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne?\n[199] Dans un premier temps, j\u2019aborderai donc cette premi\u00e8re question eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les applications pour lesquelles le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature.\n[200] Ainsi, il est utile de rappeler que les dispositions des articles 2 et 3 de la Loi en ce qui attrait \u00e0 l\u2019objet et aux motifs de distinction illicite font maintenant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des motifs de distinction illicite impliquant une d\u00e9ficience chez un plaignant.\n[201] Aussi, les dispositions de l\u2019article 25 de la Loi indiquent ce qui suit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de d\u00e9ficience :\nARTICLE 25. Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n\u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb D\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l\u2019alcool ou la drogue\n[202] Les principes juridiques sous-jacents \u00e0 l\u2019application de la loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont maintenant bien connus. Il appartient au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir sur une base prima facie un cas de discrimination ou au moins un des fondements all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[203] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le seuil requis afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve de discrimination est extr\u00eamement bas. Ainsi, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada indique que : \u00ab La preuve suffisante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9. \u00bb (Commission Ontarienne des Droits de la Personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpson-Sears, (1985) 2 RCS 536, page 558). Cette r\u00e9ponse ou explication de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre cr\u00e9dible.\n[204] De m\u00eame, la r\u00e9ponse ou l\u2019explication doit \u00eatre suffisante et ne pas \u00eatre un pr\u00e9texte (Basi c Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1), (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), paragraphe 38474).\n[205] Une fois que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il est donc sujet \u00e0 obtenir une compensation en l\u2019absence de justification de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (Commission Ontarienne des Droits de la Personne c. Etobicoke, (1982) 1 RCS 202, aux pages 202 \u00e0 208).\n[206] Afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a subi un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience, contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant n\u2019a pas besoin de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination n\u2019est pas intentionnelle. (Bhinder c Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada. (1985) 2 RCS 561).\n[207] Une fois que la preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de preuve est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 sur l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui doit d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est, soit non produite ou que cette conduite appara\u00eet comme non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9e. Il est utile de noter que cette preuve de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut se faire selon le degr\u00e9 de preuve par balance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[208] Dans la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne dans le contexte d\u2019emploi.\n[209] Ainsi, j\u2019aimerais rappeler le passage suivant de cette d\u00e9cision prononc\u00e9e par le membre instructeur Ann McTavish :\n(Par. 75) \u00ab Dans le contexte de l\u2019emploi, le cas prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme exigeant une preuve des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui suivent :\na. le plaignant avait les qualifications requises pour l\u2019emploi en cause;\nb. le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 ;\nc. une personne qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mieux qualifi\u00e9e, mais qui n\u2019avait de trait distinctif \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire race, couleur, etc.) a subs\u00e9quemment obtenu le poste. (Shakes c. Rex Pak lt\u00e9e (1989), 3 C.H.R.R. D\/1001 (1982) paragraphe D\/1002.) \u00bb\n[210] De m\u00eame, la membre McTavish ajoute ce qui suit :\n(Par.76) \u00ab Ce crit\u00e8re \u00e0 plusieurs volets a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour l\u2019ajuster \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 le plaignant n\u2019est pas engag\u00e9 et\/ou l\u2019intim\u00e9 continue de chercher un candidat appropri\u00e9. Dans ces cas, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un cas prima facie exige la pr\u00e9sence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na. que le plaignant appartienne \u00e0 l\u2019un des groupes qui sont sujets \u00e0 la discrimination en vertu de la loi, par exemple : motif religieux, handicap, ou origine ethnique ;\nb. que le plaignant a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et que l\u2019employeur d\u00e9sirait combler ;\nc. que, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 ;\nd. que, par la suite, l\u2019employeur a continu\u00e9 de chercher des candidats poss\u00e9dant les qualifications du plaignant. \u00bb (Isra\u00e9li c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Commission de la fonction publique (1983), 4 C.H.R.R. D\/1616 page 1618).\n[211] De m\u00eame, il est utile de lire le paragraphe 79 de la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision : \u00ab La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver les all\u00e9gations de discrimination par le moyen d\u2019une preuve directe. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans Basi :\nLa discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la couleur se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rare sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. (Basi vs Canadian National Railway (no1) (1998), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 au par 38474 (T.C.D.P.)\nIl appartient plut\u00f4t au Tribunal de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existe ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans la cause Basi \u00ab comme de subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb.\n[212] Finalement au paragraphe 82 de la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision, elle indique :\n\u00ab il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient la seule raison des actes en cause pour qu\u2019une plainte soit accept\u00e9e. C\u2019est suffisant si la race, la couleur, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique \u00e9taient des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l\u2019embaucher \u00bb. (Holden c.

Dans ce contexte, la jurisprudence a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un test applicable dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle en mati\u00e8re de discrimination.\n[214] Ainsi, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Basi mentionn\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, on retrouve ce qui suit :\nJe suis convaincu de la logique de B. Vizkelety dans son livre paru en 1987 chez Carswell et intitul\u00e9 Proving Discrimination in Canada. A la page 142, elle \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nOn estime que la norme Kennedy (c. Mohawk College) refl\u00e8te un degr\u00e9 de preuve criminelle par opposition \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 de preuve civile et que, en tant que telle, elle est trop rigide. Tout le monde pratiquement s\u2019entend pour dire qu\u2019en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dans les causes de discrimination, c\u2019est le degr\u00e9 de preuve civile qui pr\u00e9domine. Le test \u00e0 retenir dans les questions faisant intervenir des preuves circonstancielles, qui devraient \u00eatre en accord avec cette norme, peut \u00eatre donc formul\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible.

Le Tribunal s\u2019explique mal une telle attitude de la part de monsieur Lavers alors que diff\u00e9rents courriels entre lui et madame Sonya Wood, alors responsable des ressources humaines au soutien du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, avait clairement \u00e9tabli que le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection devait s\u2019appuyer sur toute information utile et pertinente dont la documentation qui fut fournie par le plaignant.\n[226] Le Tribunal ne peut retenir non plus le t\u00e9moignage de madame Sonya Wood \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les documents fournis s\u2019av\u00e9raient insuffisants ou incomplets quant \u00e0 elle. Devant l\u2019abondance de la documentation qui fut fourni par le plaignant pour les besoins du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection, en l\u2019absence des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences positives que recherchait monsieur Lavers et en tenant compte de la situation particuli\u00e8re du plaignant qui lui fut d\u00e9voil\u00e9e par ce dernier, le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection aurait d\u00fb avoir une approche plus lib\u00e9rale dans la situation du plaignant.\n[227] Sans parler de repr\u00e9sailles directement, le Tribunal constate que le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s largement influenc\u00e9 par l\u2019absence de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et plus particuli\u00e8rement, par les commentaires pourtant neutres de monsieur Bill DiGuistini \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant.\n[228] Or, comment se fait-il que certaines des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en cause avaient accept\u00e9 de fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences positives dans le pass\u00e9 en faveur du plaignant alors que subitement, dans le cadre de l\u2019application sous \u00e9tude, aucune d\u2019entre elle n\u2019a accept\u00e9 de fournir une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en faveur du plaignant?\n[229] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal a certainement not\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de monsieur Lavers qui a indiqu\u00e9 \u00ab a consistency or a pattern \u00bb au regard du refus d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences positives en faveur du plaignant par ces personnes.\n[230] Que ce soit de fa\u00e7on directe ou indirecte, l\u2019absence de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence positive dans le cas du plaignant aurait certainement d\u00fb \u00eatre contre balanc\u00e9e par l\u2019amplitude de la documentation positive indiquant de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante que le plaignant satisfaisait aux crit\u00e8res relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[231] Or, la preuve a \u00e9galement r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que d\u2019autres candidats qui avaient postul\u00e9s pour le m\u00eame emploi ont re\u00e7u une annotation positive les qualifiant pour les crit\u00e8res relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb alors qu\u2019un examen attentif de leur fiche indique que leurs r\u00e9ponses n\u2019\u00e9taient certainement pas meilleures que celles du plaignant. (Voir C5, C6, C7, C8, et C10).\n[232] Le Tribunal note qu\u2019au regard de ces diff\u00e9rentes applications d\u2019autres candidats, les annotations en ce qui attrait \u00e0 la question du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb au niveau de la v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences apparaissent dans certains cas comme \u00e9tant comparable ou inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle du plaignant.\n[233] \u00c0 partir de cette analyse comparative de fiches d\u2019autres candidats avec celle du plaignant, il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi la candidature du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Monsieur Lavers a indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences fournis par un candidat s\u2019av\u00e9rait essentielle afin de pouvoir confirmer l\u2019entrevue faite d\u2019un candidat et ainsi noter ad\u00e9quatement les crit\u00e8res relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb pour chacun des candidats.\n[234] En fait, au niveau de la candidature du plaignant, monsieur Lavers a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la seule r\u00e9f\u00e9rence disponible, soit celle de monsieur Bill DiGuistini, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la base de la notation finale de 12\/20 que le plaignant a re\u00e7u par le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection.\n[235] Or, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que monsieur DiGustini n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019information suffisante quant \u00e0 la candidature de monsieur Hughes et \u00e0 tout le moins, les informations fournis sur monsieur Hughes pouvaient \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de neutre.\n[236] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la notation de 12\/20 qui fut accord\u00e9e au plaignant s\u2019av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s s\u00e9v\u00e8re tenant compte du fait que le plaignant avait fournis des informations \u00e9crites au Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection lesquelles indiquaient que le plaignant poss\u00e9dait certains aspects du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00ab attention au d\u00e9tail \u00bb.\n[237] En ce sens, tenant compte des courriels envoy\u00e9s par madame Sonya Wood aux autres membres du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement dans la section des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019\u00e0 partir des informations que le Comit\u00e9 d\u00e9tenaient, une annotation diff\u00e9rente aurait pu \u00eatre accord\u00e9e au plaignant.\n[238] Or, le Tribunal ne peut faire abstraction que tous les membres du comit\u00e9 \u00e9taient au courant des probl\u00e8mes du plaignant avec d\u2019autres agences, lesquels probl\u00e8mes leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9voil\u00e9s dans le contexte de la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[239] En se basant strictement sur les informations fournis au niveau de la pi\u00e8ce R-4, en comparaison avec les fiches des autres candidats et des annotations qu\u2019on y retrouve, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 discrimin\u00e9.\n[240] \u00c0 titre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment circonstanciel additionnel, le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que certaines annotations V.G.

La question que doit r\u00e9soudre le Tribunal est de savoir si dans la d\u00e9cision amenant le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 rejeter la candidature du plaignant, ce dernier a-t-il agit de fa\u00e7on partiale ou a-t-il appliqu\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res, m\u00eame involontairement, o\u00f9 il y aurait une preuve que ledit Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection a agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans le rejet de la candidature du plaignant . Telles sont les questions que le tribunal doit r\u00e9soudre.\n[291] Dans sa preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait compara\u00eetre monsieur Michael Fu lequel \u00e9tait l\u2019un des membres du Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection en ce qui attrait \u00e0 cette troisi\u00e8me candidature.\n[292] Ainsi, dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Fu a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 ses notes dat\u00e9es du 20 juin 2007 dans lesquelles la candidature de monsieur Hughes fut rejet\u00e9e avec l\u2019annotation [traduction] \u00ab limit\u00e9e, non li\u00e9e au travail et relative \u00e0 des questions personnelles \u00bb (Voir C3 onglet 107, page 609).\n[293] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Fu indique que pour la premi\u00e8re fois, il constatait qu\u2019un candidat avait mis son exp\u00e9rience personnelle en dehors de son travail afin de d\u00e9montrer une qualification au niveau de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience comme \u00e9tant \u00ab une enqu\u00eate pouss\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[294] Monsieur Fu a qualifi\u00e9 ce qu\u2019avait mis le plaignant au niveau de ses plaintes personnelles \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019ARC et ASFC comme \u00e9tant des questions personnelles (les questions personnelles). Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ces r\u00e9ponses comme \u00e9tant un passetemps et en parlant du plaignant, il mentionne : \u00ab j\u2019ai lu la l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 la maison et je suis maintenant devenu connaissant de cette m\u00eame l\u00e9gislation\u00bb. Selon monsieur Fu, m\u00eame si vous devenez au courant de cette l\u00e9gislation, cela ne s\u2019av\u00e9rait pas suffisant afin de pouvoir obtenir les qualifications requises.\n[295] Il a donc consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 par le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab extensive \u00bb et il a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter l\u2019application du plaignant pour ce motif.\n[296] En contre-interrogatoire, monsieur Fu a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas comment le plaignant avait approch\u00e9 cette question. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne savait pas qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la compr\u00e9hension du plaignant sur la l\u00e9gislation applicable. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune base d\u2019\u00e9valuation de cette connaissance \u00e0 partir des informations fournies par le plaignant. (voir interrogatoire du 22 mars 2013, page 38, ligne 1 \u00e0 12).\n[297] \u00c0 une question pos\u00e9e par le procureur du plaignant, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il y avait une indication dans l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi au sujet d\u2019une \u00ab grande exp\u00e9rience dans la conduite d\u2019enqu\u00eates \u00bb et que cette exp\u00e9rience devait n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre reli\u00e9e au travail, le t\u00e9moin a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune mention \u00e0 cet effet dans ladite offre d\u2019emploi.\n[298] Toutefois, il appert au Tribunal que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question devient plus subjective eu \u00e9gard aux crit\u00e8res apparaissant dans l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi en cause et que le Comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection avait la latitude n\u00e9cessaire afin de v\u00e9rifier si effectivement un candidat poss\u00e9dait l\u2019exp\u00e9rience recherch\u00e9e pour les besoins de cette application.\n[299] Je consid\u00e8re donc que l\u2019explication fournie par l\u2019intim\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard au rejet de la troisi\u00e8me candidature du plaignant pour un poste TI-06 m\u2019apparait comme \u00e9tant cr\u00e9dible et raisonnable tenant compte de toutes les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[300] Cons\u00e9quemment, la plainte formul\u00e9e par le plaignant quant \u00e0 cette troisi\u00e8me application ne m\u2019appara\u00eet pas comme \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e \u00e9galement.\nE. Les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne\n[301] Dans son argumentation, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne demande au Tribunal de se prononcer sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi et adresse ses questions de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[traduction]\n8. En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, la pr\u00e9sente plainte soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes :\na) La question de savoir si l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi prot\u00e8ge les personnes qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre un minist\u00e8re ou une agence de la Couronne des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par un autre minist\u00e8re ou agence de la Couronne. Autrement dit, la question de savoir si cet article devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme visant les repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es par un autre minist\u00e8re ou agence de la Couronne que celui contre lequel la plainte en cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nb) Si on devait r\u00e9pondre affirmativement \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a a), l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle refus\u00e9 \u00e0 M Hughes un emploi du fait des plaintes qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre l\u2019ASFC et l\u2019ARC?\n[302] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites, la repr\u00e9sentante du Commission canadienne des droits de la personne fait \u00e9tat que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus et cons\u00e9quemment, elle indique que le Tribunal devrait adopter la position de la Commission laquelle ne serait pas contest\u00e9e.\n[303] Apr\u00e8s une v\u00e9rification de la documentation fournie par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en regard des repr\u00e9sentations de la Commission sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019Intim\u00e9e mentionne que le plaignant a sp\u00e9cifiquement nomm\u00e9 Transports Canada dans sa plainte et aucun autre d\u00e9partement ou agence.\n[304] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que si le plaignant avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poursuivre les autres d\u00e9partements du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, il aurait alors nomm\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que si le plaignant avait voulu poursuivre l\u2019ASFC ou l\u2019ARC, il aurait d\u00fb nommer ces agences directement comme intim\u00e9es, ce que le plaignant n\u2019a pas fait.\n[305] Subs\u00e9quemment, l\u2019Intim\u00e9e indique que l\u2019employeur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, soit Transports Canada, est le Secr\u00e9tariat Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada, et que l\u2019employeur du ARC est l\u2019ARC et que l\u2019employeur du ASFC est l\u2019ASFC, tel qu\u2019il appert \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019\u00ab employeur \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique.\n[306] \u00c9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve au dossier afin de supporter une conclusion de repr\u00e9sailles contre tout autre d\u00e9partement du gouvernement ou par Transports Canada. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que m\u00eame si les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies \u00e0 partir d\u2019individus d\u2019autres agences du gouvernement tel que l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019ASFC, aucune inf\u00e9rence n\u00e9gative ne peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e \u00e0 partir des refus de ce des derniers de fournir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences en faveur du plaignant.\n[307] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve devant le Tribunal afin de supporter l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[308] Quant \u00e0 la position du plaignant sur cette question, le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant n\u2019a manifest\u00e9 aucun d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la position de la Commission.\n[309] Afin de bien r\u00e9pondre aux questions pos\u00e9es par la Commission, le Tribunal se doit donc d\u2019\u00e9tudier les dispositions particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, lesquelles dispositions se lisent comme suit :\n14.1. Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[310] Ainsi, le texte de l\u2019article 14.1 suppose qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 deux niveaux \u00e0 savoir :\nPar une personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III;\nPour celle qui agit en son nom, afin d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[311] Le Tribunal examinera donc chacun des deux aspects de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi au regard des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n\u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb\n[312] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fait preuve de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant selon les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne par le biais de cette partie de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, \u00e0 savoir : \u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb?\n[313] Dans son m\u00e9moire, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada (2001) T.D. 06\/01. En vertu de cette d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, la preuve de repr\u00e9sailles peut se faire sans qu\u2019une partie n\u2019ait \u00e0 prouver l\u2019intention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour ce faire.\n[314] De m\u00eame, le Tribunal peut conclure qu\u2019il y a eu repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi \u00e0 partir d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, selon le degr\u00e9 de preuve de balance des probabilit\u00e9s (voir r\u00e9f\u00e9rence cit\u00e9e au paragraphe 212 ci-avant).\n[315] Ainsi, tous les autres crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence en ce qui a trait au niveau de preuve requis pour le plaignant demeurent applicables, \u00e0 savoir le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on prima facie si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de repr\u00e9sailles selon les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558, Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (No 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.)).\n[316] Mais de qui parle-t-on au juste lorsque l\u2019article 14.1 de la loi mentionne : \u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb?\n[317] S\u2019agit-il de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou du ARC et\/ou du ASFC?\n[318] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que les plaintes formul\u00e9es par le plaignant sous la partie III l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du ARC ainsi que du ASFC et non pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[319] En effet, le plaignant a clairement \u00e9tabli dans sa plainte et son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u2019existence de ses probl\u00e8mes ant\u00e9rieurs avec l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 M. John Lavers en f\u00e9vrier 2006 lors de la communication de ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 ce dernier. Nulle mention n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de plaintes formul\u00e9es sous la partie III \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment.\n[320] De plus, en relisant le m\u00e9moire de la Commission sur cette question, cette derni\u00e8re demande au tribunal de se pencher sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 en fonction de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui aurait agi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent. De m\u00eame, en relisant les motifs de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a rendue (voir C-3, onglet 131, page 727), la Commission ne mentionne que ce dernier aspect.\n[321] Or, pour les raisons que j\u2019exprimerai ci-apr\u00e8s, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Intim\u00e9e ne peut \u00eatre retenue en pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019elle aurait agi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent pour l\u2019ARC et \/ou l\u2019ASFC.\n[322] L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait-elle pu avoir fait des repr\u00e9sailles de son propre chef, sans \u00eatre l\u2019agent du ARC et\/ou du ASFC? Telle est la question qu\u2019il faut r\u00e9pondre.\n[323] Or, une analyse du texte de cette partie de l\u2019article 14.1 de la loi (\u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb), ne permet pas de conclure de fa\u00e7on positive que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut \u00eatre engag\u00e9e.\n[324] En effet, une lecture attentive de ce texte de loi permet de d\u00e9duire de fa\u00e7on claire qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019identification de la \u00ab personne \u00bb qui est recherch\u00e9e dans ce cas-ci. En effet, les personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vis\u00e9es par les plaintes formul\u00e9es par le plaignant sous la partie III sont bel et bien l\u2019ARC et l\u2019ASFC, et non pas l\u2019intim\u00e9e, selon la preuve entendue.\n[325] Le tribunal doit toutefois admettre qu\u2019il s\u2019est questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir, \u00e0 partir des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier, si M. Lavers (ou le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection) n\u2019aurait pas exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles, m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on indirecte ou involontaire, par la d\u00e9cision qui fut rendue de rejeter la candidature du plaignant., en adoptant une attitude que j\u2019ai qualifi\u00e9e de s\u00e9v\u00e8re auparavant dans la premi\u00e8re partie de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[326] L\u2019analyse que le tribunal a effectu\u00e9e au sujet des plaintes formul\u00e9es sous la partie III par le plaignant ne me permet pas d\u2019aller plus loin dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cette disposition de l\u2019article 14.1 de la loi. A cet \u00e9gard, le tribunal cite les passages suivants de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 471 (Mowat) :\n[33] Il nous faut interpr\u00e9ter le texte l\u00e9gislatif et discerner l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 partir des termes employ\u00e9s, compte tenu du contexte global et du sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la Loi, son objet et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2e \u00e9d. 1983), p. 87, cit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27, par. 21). Dans le cas d\u2019une loi relative aux droits de la personne, il faut se rappeler qu\u2019elle exprime des valeurs essentielles et vise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019objectifs fondamentaux. Il convient donc de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter lib\u00e9ralement et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre sans r\u00e9serve les droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s et \u00e0 leur donner pleinement effet (voir, p. ex., R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5e \u00e9d. 2008), p. 497\u2011500). On doit tout de m\u00eame retenir une interpr\u00e9tation de la loi qui respecte le libell\u00e9 choisi par le l\u00e9gislateur.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[\u2026]\n[62] Certes, la LCDP demeure consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une loi quasi constitutionnelle qui appelle une interpr\u00e9tation large, lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique en rapport avec cette nature particuli\u00e8re. Toutefois, on ne saurait substituer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse textuelle et contextuelle une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique dans le seul but de donner effet \u00e0 une autre d\u00e9cision de principe que celle prise par le l\u00e9gislateur (Bell Canada c. Bell Aliant Communications r\u00e9gionales, 2009 CSC 40, [2009] 2 R.C.S. 764, par. 49-50, la juge Abella; Gould, par. 50, le juge La Forest, motifs concordants).\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[327] Cons\u00e9quemment, le tribunal arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas \u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb, selon les dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la loi et la plainte du plaignant contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e sous cet aspect ne peut \u00eatre maintenue.\n[328] Au d\u00e9part, la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant est adress\u00e9e directement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, soit Transports Canada, et \u00e0 aucune autre agence\/d\u00e9partement de la Couronne. De m\u00eame, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas mis en cause de fa\u00e7on plus globale le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, soit comme partie intim\u00e9e ou comme mis-en-cause et aucune requ\u00eate pour amender n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Tribunal afin d\u2019adjoindre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, soit comme intim\u00e9 ou comme mis-en-cause.\n[329] De ce fait, le Tribunal est donc li\u00e9 avec la plainte du plaignant telle que formul\u00e9e et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question mentionn\u00e9e au niveau de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, soit quelle est la \u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte \u00bb, la r\u00e9ponse est : Transports Canada et aucune autre personne.\n[330] Dans son argumentation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que Transports Canada avait comme employeur le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) et que l\u2019employeur d\u2019ARC \u00e9tait l\u2019ARC et que l\u2019employeur d\u2019ASFC \u00e9tait l\u2019ASFC, tel qu\u2019il appert \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019employeur \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique.\n[331] Ainsi, l\u2019article 4 alin\u00e9a 2 de la loi \u00e9tablissant l\u2019ARC, soit la Loi sur l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, L.C. 1999, c. 17, \u00e9tablit que :\nProrogation de l\u2019Agence\n4. (1) L\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada, dot\u00e9e de la personnalit\u00e9 morale, est prorog\u00e9e sous le nom d\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada.\nQualit\u00e9 de mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9\n(2) L\u2019Agence ne peut exercer ses pouvoirs qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada.\n[\u2026]\n[332] De m\u00eame, \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi \u00e9tablissant l\u2019ASFC, soit la Loi sur l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, L.C. 2005, c. 38, il est indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nConstitution de l\u2019Agence\n3. (1) Est constitu\u00e9e l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, dot\u00e9e de la personnalit\u00e9 morale.\nMandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9\n(2) Elle exerce ses pouvoirs uniquement \u00e0 titre de mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada.\n[333] Ainsi, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 sa plainte formul\u00e9e contre Transports Canada, le plaignant avait fait des plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du ARC de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019encontre du ASFC, selon le texte de l\u2019article 23 (1) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif, L.R.C. 1999, c-50 [LRC\u00c9CA], comme agents de Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00ab mandataire de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada \u00bb et non pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[334] Aussi, est-il utile de rappeler les dispositions de l\u2019article 23 (1) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif, L.R.C. 1999, c-50 (ci-apr\u00e8s LRC\u00c9CA), lequel se lit comme suit :\nExercice des poursuites visant l\u2019\u00c9tat\n23. (1) Les poursuites visant l\u2019\u00c9tat peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es contre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada ou, lorsqu\u2019elles visent un organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat, contre cet organisme si la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le permet.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[335] \u00c9galement, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Carter v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2014 CHRT 3, le Tribunal a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme suit les dispositions de l\u2019article 23(1) LRC\u00c9CA :\n[traduction]\n[87] Le paragraphe 23(1) de la LRC\u00c9CA a trait aux poursuites et d\u00e9finit de quelle mani\u00e8re il convient d\u2019exercer des poursuites contre la Couronne. De telles poursuites peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es contre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, \u00e0 moins que la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale permette que les poursuites soient exerc\u00e9es contre l\u2019organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat en cause.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[88] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour obtenir r\u00e9paration des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui rel\u00e8vent de la Couronne, qui est \u00e0 son tour Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 66(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, c\u2019est le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui compara\u00eet \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 23(1) de la LRC\u00c9CA.\n[336] De fa\u00e7on compl\u00e9mentaire, le Tribunal fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux paragraphes 33 et 62 pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, [2011] 3 R.C.S. 471 (Mowat) (voir au paragraphe 323 de cette d\u00e9cision).\n[337] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019analyse de cette derni\u00e8re jurisprudence de m\u00eame que des dispositions de l\u2019article 23(1) de LRC\u00c9CA m\u2019indiquent qu\u2019on ne peut pas substituer les agences du ARC et du ASFC \u00e0 Transports Canada et que l\u2019inverse est \u00e9galement vrai, \u00e0 savoir que Transports Canada ne peut \u00eatre substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 ARC et ASFC pour des actions que ces derni\u00e8res auraient commises \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une appellation appropri\u00e9e ou qu\u2019une mise en cause appropri\u00e9e soit effectu\u00e9e afin d\u2019adjoindre l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019ASFC directement dans les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[338] A fortiori, la preuve au dossier ne m\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a eu soit un lien de subordination, ou une relation mandant-mandataire, entre l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019ASFC et Transports Canada, relativement aux faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier, mais plus particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles dont le plaignant a fait \u00e9tat dans sa plainte.\n[339] Bien que des contacts ait eu lieu entre les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection de Transports Canada pour les besoins des diff\u00e9rentes applications, la preuve n\u2019a pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 de communication directe entre les repr\u00e9sentants du ARC ou du ASFC ainsi que le comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une relation de mandant-mandataire entre ces personnes, et \u00e9tablir que Transports Canada aurait pu agir au nom d\u2019ARC ou ASFC dans le cadre de repr\u00e9sailles qui auraient pu \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es.\n[340] Cons\u00e9quemment, le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas que la preuve indique qu\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des agences, soit l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019ASFC, ait pu avoir une influence sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e Transports Canada sur le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas engag\u00e9 le plaignant (Smith c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, 2005 TCDP 23).\n[341] En conclusion, j\u2019en d\u00e9duis donc que, suivant cette partie de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, Transports Canada n\u2019a pas agit au nom de d\u2019autres entit\u00e9s ou d\u00e9partements, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019ASFC.\nIV. Conclusion\n[342] Pour les raisons que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9es auparavant, le tribunal rend les d\u00e9cisions suivantes :\n(a) La plainte du plaignant en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re demande de poste d\u2019\u00ab analyste de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 maritime \u00bb (PM-04) est maintenue en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 7a) de la LCDP;\n(b) Toutes les plaintes du plaignant sont rejet\u00e9es en ce qui a trait aux postes de TI-06 ;\n(c) Toutes les plaintes du plaignant en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la loi sont \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9es.\n[343] Consid\u00e9rant le d\u00e9sir des parties d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal en ce qui a trait au bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes formul\u00e9es par le plaignant en premier lieu, je m\u2019abstiendrai donc de toute autre conclusion \u00e0 ce stade-ci. Je demeure donc saisi du dossier pour la question des rem\u00e8des applicables et j\u2019attends que les parties me fassent conna\u00eetre leur intention \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe\n9 juillet 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1656\/01111\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nChris Hughes c.

Le contexte [1] Les plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des premi\u00e8res nations du Canada (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) et l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN), ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 l\u2019enfance dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC (1985), c H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] Le 10 juillet 2012, une formation constitu\u00e9e des membres instructeurs Marchildon, Lustig et B\u00e9langer a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de l\u2019affaire (2012 TCDP 16).\nII. Les faits pertinents [3] Le 26 septembre 2012, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) a tenu une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance (CGI) en pr\u00e9sence des parties afin de demander \u00e0 celles\u2011ci quelles \u00e9taient leurs disponibilit\u00e9s en vue de fixer les dates de l\u2019audience sur le fond. Avec l\u2019accord des parties, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019audience se tiendrait du 25 f\u00e9vrier au 1er mars 2013, et que les audiences suivantes auraient lieu \u00e0 partir d\u2019avril 2013. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli, avec le consentement des parties, un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t continu des documents \u00e0 communiquer, y compris les listes r\u00e9vis\u00e9es de t\u00e9moins. L\u2019intim\u00e9 devait produire trois ensembles de documents aux dates suivantes : le 31 octobre 2012; le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2012; et le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013 pour son troisi\u00e8me et dernier ensemble de documents \u00e0 communiquer.\n[4] Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2013, le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (CTGI) avec les parties afin de discuter d\u2019un certain nombre de questions en suspens avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en ce qui concernait la production des pi\u00e8ces, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019elle avait pu comprendre, il n\u2019y aurait aucune exigence d\u2019authentification des documents, mais les parties seraient libres de formuler des objections relatives \u00e0 la pertinence de ces documents. La Commission a manifest\u00e9 son intention de produire un cahier de preuve documentaire, pr\u00e9cisant que chaque onglet serait trait\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, au fur et \u00e0 mesure de la progression de l\u2019audience. Les onglets non pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ou jug\u00e9s irrecevables seraient retir\u00e9s du dossier \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a souscrit \u00e0 cette proposition.\n[5] Le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2013, le Tribunal a fourni aux parties un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la CTGI. L\u2019alin\u00e9a i) de ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 traitait de la pr\u00e9sentation des pi\u00e8ces. Il \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nChaque classeur d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par les parties sera vers\u00e9 au dossier \u00e0 titre de pi\u00e8ce et annot\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence (C pour plaignante, HR pour CCDP, R pour intim\u00e9 et CO pour chefs de l\u2019Ontario). Les onglets qui ne feront pas l\u2019objet d\u2019un renvoi, d\u2019une objection ou d\u2019une d\u00e9cision lors de l\u2019audience seront retir\u00e9s du classeur et ne feront pas partie du dossier officiel.\n[6] L\u2019audience a commenc\u00e9 le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice administrative de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, du 25 f\u00e9vrier au 1er mars 2013. Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs objections \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de l\u2019interrogatoire principal de Mme Blackstock. Il a exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations quant au fait que, dans son t\u00e9moignage jusqu\u2019alors, Mme Blackstock avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations extrajudiciaires pour faire preuve de leur contenu. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que ces d\u00e9clarations relevaient du ou\u00ef-dire et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient irrecevables.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les observations des parties relatives \u00e0 l\u2019objection, la formation a rendu la d\u00e9cision suivante oralement :\n[traduction]\nLe formation comprend et prend acte de la question et des pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019absence de document \u00e0 l\u2019appui et de t\u00e9moignage sous serment. Toutefois, il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire preuve de rigueur et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019examen de cette question et la proc\u00e9dure, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal qui consiste \u00e0 recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef-dire sous r\u00e9serve de leur accorder leur juste valeur.\nCompte tenu du fait que, dans le cas qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une objection, nous n\u2019avons pas vu les lettres, il ne sera accord\u00e9 que peu de poids \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment. C\u2019est de cette mani\u00e8re que nous comptons proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019avenir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de cette nature.\n[8] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstock, a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi de cinq journ\u00e9es d\u2019audience, les 2, 3, 4, 8 et 9 avril, pendant lesquelles le Tribunal a entendu les t\u00e9moignages de M. Jonathan Thompson, directeur des divisions de la Sant\u00e9 et du D\u00e9veloppement social de l\u2019APN, de M. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9, directeur du Centre de recherches sur les enfants et les familles \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 McGill, et de M. Derald Dubois, directeur administratif des services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille de Touchwood, en Saskatchewan.\n[9] Le 7 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a inform\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal que son client venait de l\u2019aviser que plus de 50 000 documents additionnels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme potentiellement pertinents, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un nombre ind\u00e9fini de courriels, que son client \u00e9tait en train de rassembler, et qui devaient encore \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en report des dates d\u2019audience au mois de novembre 2013, afin qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de communication.\n[10] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et, le 21 mai 2013, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa propre requ\u00eate, visant notamment \u00e0 contraindre l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 produire les documents pertinents dans le contexte de la plainte. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les r\u00e9percussions des communications tardives de l\u2019intim\u00e9 restaient du domaine de la sp\u00e9culation et que cela ne justifiait pas un report d\u2019audience de neuf semaines. On pouvait parer \u00e0 toute pr\u00e9occupation relative au fait que des t\u00e9moins d\u00e9posent avant que la preuve ait \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement communiqu\u00e9e en autorisant le rappel des t\u00e9moins. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a affirm\u00e9 que, quand on les comparait au pr\u00e9judice concret que les plaignantes subissaient du fait de nouveaux retards, les sp\u00e9culations relatives \u00e0 de futures atteintes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ne justifiaient pas qu\u2019on accorde \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le report qu\u2019il demandait.\n[11] Conscient de son devoir de fournir aux parties l\u2019occasion pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur cause et de pr\u00e9senter des observations, et cherchant par ailleurs \u00e0 atteindre un \u00e9quilibre entre ce devoir et celui de proc\u00e9der de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, le Tribunal a opt\u00e9 pour une solution de compromis, en annulant les dates d\u2019audience qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement fix\u00e9es en juin 2013 et en pr\u00e9voyant des dates d\u2019audience additionnelles entre juillet 2013 et janvier 2014 (2013 TCDP 16). Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les parties seraient autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 rappeler des t\u00e9moins, si n\u00e9cessaire, et sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal, et que cela serait examin\u00e9 au cas par cas.\n[12] Le 20 novembre 2013, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre afin de rappeler Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la barre. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 cette assignation le 25 novembre 2013.\n[13] Le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013, la Commission a rappel\u00e9 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la barre. Au d\u00e9but de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Blackstock a soulign\u00e9 que, lors de son dernier t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal, en f\u00e9vrier 2013, elle n\u2019avait acc\u00e8s qu\u2019\u00e0 environ 8 % des communications de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9 plus de 100 000 documents \u00e0 la suite du premier t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstock.\n[14] La Commission a invit\u00e9 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 consulter son cahier de preuve documentaire, HR-13, onglet 275. Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait appris l\u2019existence de ce document, une entente de service entre la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique et Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (AINC), maintenant connue sous le nom d\u2019Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC), intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab Entente de service concernant le financement des services de protection de l\u2019enfance destin\u00e9s aux enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations ayant leur r\u00e9sidence permanente dans une r\u00e9serve \u00bb, parce que ce document figurait parmi les documents communiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un avis d\u2019opposition, mentionnant au dossier que, bien que le t\u00e9moin ait pu reconna\u00eetre le document comme \u00e9tant un des documents re\u00e7us du fait de la communication, il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible d\u2019admettre ce document en preuve sur ce seul fondement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que Mme Blackstock n\u2019\u00e9tait ni l\u2019auteure ni la destinataire du document, et que, dans ces conditions, on ne pouvait pas admettre le document comme le proposait la Commission. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Blackstock n\u2019avait pas des connaissances suffisantes pour formuler des commentaires relatifs au document et que son t\u00e9moignage ne constituerait qu\u2019un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un th\u00e8me r\u00e9current en ce qui concernait les autres documents que la Commission souhaitait porter \u00e0 l\u2019attention de Mme Blackstock.\n[16] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 que la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre un t\u00e9moin de la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, t\u00e9moin qui aurait pu \u00eatre mieux plac\u00e9 pour formuler des commentaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019entente de service conclue entre cette province et AINC. Aux yeux de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le fait de rappeler Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la barre de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle puisse communiquer ses vues au sujet de ce document constituait un usage injuste et inappropri\u00e9 du droit de rappeler un t\u00e9moin. Un t\u00e9moin ne devrait pas \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la Commission et aux plaignantes de peaufiner leur cause ou de combler une lacune.\n[17] La Commission a r\u00e9pondu que, selon elle, le document \u00e9tait recevable vu qu\u2019il faisait partie de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. La Commission a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait rappel\u00e9 Mme Blackstock afin de permettre \u00e0 celle\u2011ci de donner son avis sur l\u2019importance de certains documents r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9s, avis fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience professionnelle de Mme Blackstock ainsi que sur sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en cause, mais aussi afin de permettre \u00e0 celle\u2011ci d\u2019expliquer dans quelle mesure le fait de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant du contenu de ces documents avait affect\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. La Commission a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait nullement l\u2019intention de revenir sur les documents communiqu\u00e9s avant que Mme Blackstock t\u00e9moigne pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\n[18] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a appuy\u00e9 la position de la Commission, soulignant que le but du rappel \u00e9tait, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de placer le t\u00e9moin dans la m\u00eame position que celle dans laquelle il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9 tous ses documents avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon elle, vu que la majorit\u00e9 des documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9s \u00e9taient des documents du gouvernement, ils \u00e9taient admissibles prima facie.\n[19] Le Tribunal a bri\u00e8vement interrompu l\u2019audience afin d\u2019examiner l\u2019objection. Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties que, consid\u00e9rant l\u2019intention de la Commission de pr\u00e9senter un certain nombre d\u2019autres documents r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Blackstock d\u2019une fa\u00e7on similaire, le Tribunal avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de trancher la question de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des documents sur le champ, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019attendre la fin de l\u2019audience comme les parties en avaient convenu au d\u00e9part.\n[20] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9senterait par cons\u00e9quent une requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 par le Tribunal des documents le jour suivant, ou peu de temps apr\u00e8s. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a communiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal et aux parties un avis de requ\u00eate intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Requ\u00eate en recevabilit\u00e9 de documents pour faire preuve de leur contenu \u00bb.\nIII. La requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien [21] C\u2019est cette requ\u00eate qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Au moyen de cette requ\u00eate, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande :\n[traduction]\nque soit rendue une ordonnance aux termes de laquelle tout document contenu dans les classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ou tout document communiqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, soit recevable en preuve pour faire preuve de son contenu, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si l\u2019auteur ou le destinataire du document en cause est cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et de la question de savoir si le document en cause est soumis \u00e0 d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins.\n[22] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fonde sa requ\u00eate sur les motifs suivants :\n[traduction]\n1. La Commission et les plaignantes ont obtenu un tr\u00e8s grand volume de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 par voie de communication dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure ou au moyen de demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels;\n2. La Commission a produit un grand nombre de ces documents en preuve dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, et ces documents se trouvent dans les classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13;\n3. Les parties s\u2019entendent au sujet de l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 et de la pertinence de ces documents;\n4. Tous les documents du gouvernement qui se trouvent dans les classeurs de la Commission sont admissibles pour preuve de leur contenu sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 leur auteur ou \u00e0 leur destinataire pour ce qui est, en tout ou en partie, des exceptions suivantes \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle traditionnelle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire :\na. L\u2019exception de principe \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire autorise la recevabilit\u00e9 des documents du gouvernement pour preuve de leur contenu;\nb. Les documents contiennent des d\u00e9clarations faites par des fonctionnaires dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions, et elles sont par cons\u00e9quent admissibles au titre de cette exception;\nc. Une grande partie de ces documents contiennent des d\u00e9clarations qui constituent des admissions allant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et elles sont par cons\u00e9quent recevables \u00e0 titre d\u2019admissions;\n5. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subit pas de pr\u00e9judice du fait que ses propres documents sont re\u00e7us en preuve, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a toujours le droit de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre afin de clarifier ou de r\u00e9futer les renseignements contenus dans les documents en cause;\n6. Consid\u00e9rant le volume et l\u2019ampleur des documents en cause ainsi que leur origine gouvernementale, il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d\u2019admettre ces documents en preuve sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de citer des fonctionnaires \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour reconna\u00eetre ces documents, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce serait extr\u00eamement inefficace et co\u00fbteux, et que le fait d\u2019exiger de la Commission ou des plaignantes qu\u2019elles citent des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour chaque document en cause ralentirait ind\u00fbment la proc\u00e9dure;\n7. Bien que les plaignantes soient d\u2019avis que les documents en cause sont recevables par un tribunal conform\u00e9ment aux exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus, le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour les accepter en preuve, qu\u2019ils soient ou non recevables par un tribunal;\n8. Le paragraphe 1(1), l\u2019article 3 et le paragraphe 9(4), des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure) et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi.\n[23] Au cours d\u2019une CGI qui s\u2019est tenue le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013 en apr\u00e8s-midi, les parties ont convenu de plaider la requ\u00eate le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Les parties ont \u00e9galement convenu de d\u00e9battre de la question des conditions relatives au rappel des t\u00e9moins, telle que l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a soulev\u00e9e.\nIV. Les observations des parties A. La position de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien [24] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que les r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 la preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place pour favoriser la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la justice et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans le processus accusatoire. Bien qu\u2019il existe une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019exclusion du ou\u00ef\u00ad\u2011dire, il existe de nombreuses exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. La r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion du ou\u00ef\u2011dire n\u2019est pas aussi rigide qu\u2019elle l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9.\n[25] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9largi le champ des exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u00ad\u2011dire dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ares c. Venner, [1970] R.C.S. 608, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les notes prises par les infirmi\u00e8res pouvaient \u00eatre recevables pour faire preuve de leur contenu sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire que les auteurs des notes en cause soient cit\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. La Cour supr\u00eame a ainsi \u00e9tabli un liste d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il faudrait tenir compte pour \u00e9tablir la recevabilit\u00e9 de ce type de preuve : le caract\u00e8re pratique du fait de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, les frais que les parties doivent assumer du fait que ces t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, les co\u00fbts assum\u00e9s par le public en raison de la dur\u00e9e accrue de la proc\u00e9dure, et la probabilit\u00e9 que les dossiers, r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le t\u00e9moin dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions, soient impartiaux et dignes de foi. \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9cision, un certain nombre de lois sur la preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es, et certaines de ces exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire ont \u00e9t\u00e9 codifi\u00e9es.\n[26] Par la suite, les arr\u00eats R. c. Khan, [1990] 2 R.C.S. 531 (Khan), et R. c. Smith, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 915 (Smith), sont venus clarifier et simplifier davantage la loi du ou\u00ef\u2011dire en instituant l\u2019exception de principe \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette exception autonome, la preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire est devenue recevable selon certains principes, des principes directeurs relatifs \u00e0 la fiabilit\u00e9 et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la preuve. Ainsi, si le juge des faits est convaincu que les documents sont fiables et n\u00e9cessaires et que leur valeur probante l\u2019emporte sur tout effet pr\u00e9judiciable pour la partie adverse, les documents peuvent \u00eatre re\u00e7us en preuve m\u00eame s\u2019ils constituent du ou\u00ef-dire.\n[27] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que l\u2019exception de principe \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien se fonde sur les d\u00e9cisions \u00c9thier c. Canada (Commissaire de la GRC) (C.A.), [1993] 2 C.F. 659 (\u00c9thier), Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), [2005] O.J. No. 5775 (PIPS), et Ault v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] O.J. No. 4924 (Ault), dans lesquelles on a appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019exception de principe \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire.\n[28] Dans la d\u00e9cision PIPS, le juge Panet s\u2019est ainsi exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des crit\u00e8res de fiabilit\u00e9 et de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nEn ce qui concerne le crit\u00e8re de fiabilit\u00e9, il est \u00e9vident que ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par de hauts fonctionnaires ou des fonctionnaires inform\u00e9s travaillant pour des minist\u00e8res ou des organismes du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Ils d\u00e9crivent ou expliquent le fonctionnement des r\u00e9gimes de pension et de ces comptes de pension. Dans de nombreux cas, il s\u2019agissait de communiquer des renseignements aux ministres et aux hauts fonctionnaires ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res au sein du gouvernement. Selon moi, il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on leur accorde une grande valeur en mati\u00e8re d\u2019exactitude. On s\u2019attend \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on y ait fait preuve de franchise, compte tenu des circonstances et du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun litige \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Cette preuve est assortie de la \u00ab garantie circonstancielle de fiabilit\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[\u2026]\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, compte tenu de la port\u00e9e des documents et du fait que leur r\u00e9daction s\u2019inscrit sur une longue p\u00e9riode, il peut \u00eatre difficile, voire totalement impossible, pour les demandeurs de retrouver tous les auteurs de ces documents. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, ces documents ou certains de ces documents pourraient ne jamais \u00eatre produits au proc\u00e8s. Dans certains cas, m\u00eame si l\u2019auteur \u00e9tait disponible, il serait inutile qu\u2019il comparaisse devant le tribunal, et il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une perte de temps pour la Cour, vu que le t\u00e9moignage de cette personne consisterait simplement \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au sujet d\u2019une question qui pourrait \u00eatre raisonnablement confirm\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire.\nCela pr\u00e9sente donc des avantages du point de vue de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de la rapidit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne la preuve propos\u00e9e.\nEn outre, dans tous les cas, il s\u2019agit de documents de la Couronne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s simultan\u00e9ment, et en l\u2019absence des plaignants. Il serait assez injuste d\u2019exiger des plaignants qu\u2019ils citent des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour pr\u00e9senter en preuve ces documents qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s, sachant qu\u2019on peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de t\u00e9moins oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la position des plaignants. Le d\u00e9fendeur est libre de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les auteurs des documents en cause ou d\u2019autres fonctionnaires afin qu\u2019ils expliquent les d\u00e9clarations contenues dans ces documents.\nPIPS, aux paragraphes 70 et 73 \u00e0 75\n[29] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les documents satisfont le crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 l\u2019exception de principe qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans PIPS. Comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans \u00c9thier et dans PIPS, la majorit\u00e9 des documents en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont des documents du gouvernement, intrins\u00e8quement fiables et recevables pour faire preuve de leur contenu. En ce qui concerne le crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les documents viennent de partout au pays et couvrent une p\u00e9riode \u00e9tendue. En outre, tous les documents ne font pas clairement \u00e9tat des noms de leurs auteurs. En tenant compte du fait que ces t\u00e9moins d\u00e9poseraient en la d\u00e9faveur de leur employeur et pourraient \u00eatre hostiles \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il serait difficile et on\u00e9reux d\u2019exiger des plaignantes qu\u2019elles citent les personnes en cause \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. En outre, citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les nombreux auteurs de ces documents simplement dans le but qu\u2019ils confirment le contenu des documents serait totalement inefficace et risquerait de prolonger inutilement la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[30] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien note que ces documents sont les propres documents du gouvernement, et, de ce fait, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour fournir des explications et des \u00e9claircissements ainsi que pour r\u00e9futer cette preuve en citant pour cela des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, si n\u00e9cessaire. Vu la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019une telle d\u00e9fense, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis que la recevabilit\u00e9 de ces documents de la mani\u00e8re qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e n\u2019est pas source d\u2019injustice pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, pas plus qu\u2019elle ne lui cause de pr\u00e9judice.\n[31] En plus de l\u2019exception de principe \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien se fonde aussi sur l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue en common law \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9clarations faites par des personnes dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette exception, les d\u00e9clarations de cette nature sont recevables en preuve : voir Ault, aux paragraphes 24 et 25. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que nombre des documents en sa possession contenaient des d\u00e9clarations faites par des fonctionnaires dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions, lesquelles tombaient sous le coup de cette exception.\n[32] Pour finir, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien se fonde sur l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue en common law \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des admissions faites \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son int\u00e9r\u00eat : voir Ault, aux paragraphes 27 et 28. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que de nombreux documents en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce contenaient des admissions faites par le gouvernement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions cl\u00e9s dont le Tribunal \u00e9tait saisi : \u00e0 savoir, que les enfants des r\u00e9serves ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient pas des m\u00eames services que les enfants r\u00e9sidant en dehors des r\u00e9serves. Ainsi, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme que ces documents tombent sous le coup de cette exception et qu\u2019ils devraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9s recevables.\n[33] En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi, le Tribunal jouit d\u2019un grand pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la recevabilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur recevabilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire. Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure, et, pourvu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne souffre d\u2019aucune injustice r\u00e9elle, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien affirme que les documents en cause devraient \u00eatre re\u00e7us prima facie pour faire preuve de leur contenu, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir s\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin. Comme tous les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, ils seront alors \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction de leur importance. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est consciente du fait que, en produisant en preuve un document pour preuve de son contenu de cette mani\u00e8re, elle court le risque que l\u2019intim\u00e9 produise des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires et que le Tribunal \u00e9value la preuve sans que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien puisse se pr\u00e9valoir de t\u00e9moignages de vive voix venant appuyer sa position. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est consciente du fait que cette approche est contraire au paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019elle exige qu\u2019il soit fait exception \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure habituelle du Tribunal \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[34] En ce qui concerne la question du rappel de Mme Blackstock, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien r\u00e9it\u00e8re sa position, selon laquelle celle\u2011ci devrait \u00eatre plac\u00e9e dans la m\u00eame position que celle dans laquelle elle se trouvait quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en f\u00e9vrier 2013. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 parler des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ainsi que de toute question ayant d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de cette communication. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis que cela ne cause aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nB. La position de la Commission [35] La Commission appuie la requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, et elle est \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que ces documents devraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9s recevables.\n[36] La Commission souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019observation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien selon laquelle il existe une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef-dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents r\u00e9dig\u00e9s dans un contexte professionnel. La Commission fait valoir que cette exception a re\u00e7u une interpr\u00e9tation large (voir Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Skomatchuk, 2006 CF 730) et que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les pi\u00e8ces r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies dans le \u00ab cours ordinaire des affaires \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 30 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, L.R.C. (1985), c. C-5, tombant ainsi sous le coup de cette exception, et qu\u2019elles devraient par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre re\u00e7ues.\n[37] La Commission fait valoir que le fait de recevoir un document pour preuve de son contenu ne signifie pas qu\u2019on doive accorder une importance pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante \u00e0 ce document. Cela signifie plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin l\u2019authentifie. Bien qu\u2019il se puisse que ce type de preuve ne respecte pas la \u00ab r\u00e8gle de la meilleure preuve \u00bb, le Tribunal peut tenir compte de cette consid\u00e9ration au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer le poids de la preuve dans son ensemble, une fois que les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us : F\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne des \u00e9tudiantes et \u00e9tudiants c. Conseil de recherches en sciences naturelles et en g\u00e9nie du Canada, 2008 CF 493, au paragraphe 44.\n[38] En outre, les tribunaux administratifs ne sont pas li\u00e9s par les r\u00e8gles de preuve strictes qu\u2019appliquent les tribunaux judiciaires. C\u2019est ce que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a reconnu au paragraphe 28 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Telus Communications Inc. c. Syndicat des travailleurs en t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, 2005 CAF 262 (Telus), arr\u00eat que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le paragraphe 50(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut recevoir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de nombreuses fa\u00e7ons, y compris les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire. La Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que ces documents soient vers\u00e9s au dossier de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que celui-ci soit aussi complet que possible. Il n\u2019est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019aucune partie que le Tribunal ne dispose pas de certains documents pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[39] La Commission souhaite distinguer la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision de celle que le Tribunal, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le membre instructeur Jensen, a rendue dans Jeffers c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2008 TCDP 25 (Jeffers). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le membre instructeur Jensen a refus\u00e9 de recevoir en preuve un rapport pour preuve de son contenu en partant du principe qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire qui ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de fiabilit\u00e9 et de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u00e9finis dans les d\u00e9cisions Khan et Telus. La Commission note que, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le membre instructeur Jensen ne disposait pas de la jurisprudence que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien cite aujourd\u2019hui, et elle ajoute que, dans la d\u00e9cision Jeffers, elle avait omis d\u2019indiquer la raison pour laquelle il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019introduire l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en question : voir Jeffers, au paragraphe 11. La Commission soutient qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignantes ont clairement indiqu\u00e9 la raison pour laquelle le fait de recevoir les documents en cause satisfaisait au crit\u00e8re de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9.\n[40] En ce qui concerne la question du rappel de t\u00e9moins, la Commission souligne qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas selon elle de jurisprudence portant sur le rappel de t\u00e9moins et que la seule jurisprudence pertinente a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une affaire. Ainsi, la Commission se fonde sur Varco Canada Limited v. Pason Systems Corp, 2011 FC 467, dans laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9fini cinq \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration en vue de d\u00e9cider de la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un proc\u00e8s : la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9, la diligence raisonnable et le pr\u00e9judice. La Commission affirme que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[41] En ce qui concerne la question de la pertinence, la Commission soutient que, vu que les documents en cause font partie des documents communiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9, celui-ci a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents. Dans ces conditions, il est maintenant difficile pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer que ces m\u00eames documents ne satisfont pas au crit\u00e8re de pertinence. La Commission fait valoir que le fait de recevoir ces documents satisfait \u00e9galement au crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Vu que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment comprend un aspect pratique, la Commission affirme que, si elle devait citer un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour chaque document, la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure s\u2019en trouverait retard\u00e9e significativement et inutilement. Vu que ces documents viennent de l\u2019intim\u00e9, des provinces ou d\u2019autres sources \u00e9tablies, la Commission affirme qu\u2019ils sont intrins\u00e8quement fiables. Pour ce qui est de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment relatif \u00e0 la diligence raisonnable, la Commission a fait de son mieux pour examiner tous les documents depuis que ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s. Pour finir, les plaignantes subiraient un pr\u00e9judice si Mme Blackstock \u00e9tait incapable de formuler des commentaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces documents et de dire dans quelle mesure leur contenu avait une incidence sur son t\u00e9moignage. Mme Blackstock n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces documents quand elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois, et ni la Commission ni la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien n\u2019en \u00e9taient responsables.\n[42] La Commission se fonde \u00e9galement sur R. c. G. (S.G.), [1997] 2 R.C.S. 716 (S.G.), affaire relevant du droit criminel qui portait sur la r\u00e9ouverture de la preuve. Notamment, la Commission souligne la conclusion de la Cour supr\u00eame selon laquelle la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une preuve \u00ab diminue \u00e0 mesure que le proc\u00e8s avance parce qu\u2019il y a plus de chances pour que la d\u00e9fense soit l\u00e9s\u00e9e \u00bb. Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame ajoute qu\u2019avant que la Couronne ait termin\u00e9 sa preuve, le juge du proc\u00e8s jouit d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire tr\u00e8s large : voir S.G., \u00e0 la page 733. La Commission fait valoir qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas encore termin\u00e9 leur preuve et que le Tribunal jouit par cons\u00e9quent d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour autoriser le rappel d\u2019un t\u00e9moin de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que celle\u2011ci t\u00e9moigne au sujet de documents qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en sa possession auparavant.\n[43] La Commission soutient que le fait de rappeler Mme Blackstock a pour but de permettre \u00e0 celle\u2011ci de s\u2019exprimer au sujet de documents qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas eu l\u2019occasion de consulter auparavant, ainsi que de discuter des r\u00e9percussions que la m\u00e9connaissance du contenu de ces documents ont pu avoir sur son t\u00e9moignage. En tant que la principale plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Mme Blackstock a une grande connaissance des questions en litige ainsi qu\u2019une vaste exp\u00e9rience professionnelle pertinente. Elle a une compr\u00e9hension unique des questions en litige et de la mani\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les documents en cause, et on devrait lui accorder la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u2019exprimer au sujet de ces documents.\n[44] La Commission est d\u2019avis que Mme Blackstock devrait \u00eatre plac\u00e9e dans la m\u00eame position que celle dans laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019elle a comparu devant le Tribunal. La Commission souligne que, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le seul facteur pris en consid\u00e9ration pour son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait la pertinence de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte. C\u2019est ce m\u00eame facteur qui devrait s\u2019appliquer aujourd\u2019hui. Toutefois, si le Tribunal \u00e9tablit que des facteurs additionnels devraient entrer en consid\u00e9ration, la Commission propose alors que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstock porte sur toute question d\u00e9coulant des documents r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9s ainsi que sur toute question aff\u00e9rente. Cela inclurait toute question au sujet de laquelle elle n\u2019aurait pas pu s\u2019exprimer ant\u00e9rieurement parce que la preuve \u00e9tait absente ou insuffisante. Cela inclurait, par exemple, la preuve relative au Yukon.\nC. La position de l\u2019APN [45] L\u2019APN soutient les interventions de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et de la Commission et souscrit \u00e0 leur position.\n[46] En ce qui concerne la question du rappel des t\u00e9moins, l\u2019APN souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019observation de la Commission selon laquelle, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision S.G., \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas encore termin\u00e9 leur preuve, le Tribunal jouit d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour leur permettre de rouvrir la preuve, notamment vu qu\u2019il est encore possible \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subit aucun pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il peut contre-interroger Mme Blackstock, citer d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et produire d\u2019autres documents pour \u00e9tayer sa position, s\u2019il le souhaite. L\u2019APN souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019avis de la Commission selon laquelle Mme Blackstock devrait t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9s comme si elle les avait eus en sa possession quand elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\n[47] L\u2019APN souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a faite des d\u00e9cisions Ault, PIPS et \u00c9thier. Au paragraphe 22 d\u2019Ault, on souligne que les documents publics constituent une exception en common law \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire, et, au paragraphe 25, que ces documents sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s fiables. Plus tard dans cette d\u00e9cision, en renvoyant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision PIPS, on souligne que le crit\u00e8re de la fiabilit\u00e9 tient compte du fait que les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par de hauts fonctionnaires du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019il est raisonnable de leur accorder une grande cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, notamment vu qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun litige \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque : voir Ault, au paragraphe 36. Au paragraphe 50 d\u2019Ault, on souligne \u00e9galement que, vu que c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les documents en cause, il est difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir quelles sont les cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables de ces documents \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. L\u2019APN fait valoir que les circonstances de cette d\u00e9cision sont comparables \u00e0 celles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et qu\u2019il serait irr\u00e9aliste de demander \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et \u00e0 la Commission de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour chacun des documents en cause afin de les authentifier. L\u2019APN souscrit \u00e0 la position selon laquelle il est possible de prendre les documents en cause pour argent comptant et que, au bout du compte, l\u2019absence d\u2019authentification sera prise en consid\u00e9ration.\n[48] L\u2019APN conclut en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle souhaiterait que la pr\u00e9sente affaire soit trait\u00e9e aussi rapidement que possible. Toute une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d\u2019enfants a d\u00e9j\u00e0 ressenti l\u2019impact des longueurs dans le dossier.\nD. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que, quand il s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 ce que Mme Blackstock t\u00e9moigne, le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013, il croyait que, compte tenu des contraintes de temps, cette objection ferait partie de son objection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en suspens relative \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 des documents pour faire preuve de leur contenu, question dont les parties avaient convenu de d\u00e9battre au terme de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il ne remet pas en cause l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 des documents provenant de sa communication, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire que la Commission et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien citent \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les auteurs des documents en cause. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 ce que ces documents soient produits du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s, qu\u2019une opinion y est exprim\u00e9e ou que, par exemple, un \u00e9change a eu lieu entre deux fonctionnaires. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que ce n\u2019est pas la m\u00eame chose que d\u2019accepter ces documents \u00ab pour faire preuve de leur contenu \u00bb, comme le demande la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour recevoir un document pour preuve de son contenu, le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir si ce document satisfait au double crit\u00e8re de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini dans R. c. Khelawon, 2006 CSC 57 (Khelawon). Cette approche moderne de l\u2019exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire est \u00e9galement l\u2019approche qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9cisions sur lesquelles la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et la Commission se sont appuy\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le fait de s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 cette approche allait dans le sens de l\u2019objectif ultime du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ainsi que de la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de la recevabilit\u00e9 des documents au cas par cas, comme il l\u2019a fait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que, dans le contexte de l\u2019analyse, quand des documents sont introduits par un t\u00e9moin qui n\u2019en est ni l\u2019auteur ni le destinataire, cela cr\u00e9e des probl\u00e8mes de fiabilit\u00e9, ce qui est ainsi susceptible d\u2019avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour faire preuve de leur contenu. Toutefois, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le t\u00e9moin de faire part de son opinion \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en cause.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a faite au Tribunal afin que celui\u2011ci rende une d\u00e9cision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ayant pour effet d\u2019autoriser la recevabilit\u00e9 de tous les documents en cause sans avoir men\u00e9 une analyse. Ce ne sont pas tous les documents qui proviennent de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas vu les documents, le Tribunal ne peut pas \u00e9tablir de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e s\u2019il s\u2019agit uniquement de documents du gouvernement et s\u2019ils contiennent d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments, tels que des admissions, qui militeraient en faveur de leur recevabilit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire.\n[53] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019interpr\u00e8te pas la jurisprudence de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et que la Commission. Les d\u00e9cisions Ault et PIPS ont toutes deux \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario et, en tant que telles, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es dans le contexte d\u2019une structure diff\u00e9rente. Dans ces deux d\u00e9cisions, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019a pas rendu de d\u00e9cision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur la recevabilit\u00e9 des documents en cause, mais elle les a plut\u00f4t examin\u00e9s un par un dans le contexte des affaires dont elle \u00e9tait saisie et en tenant compte des exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re dans l\u2019arr\u00eat \u00c9thier. Autrement dit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que ces d\u00e9cisions sont conformes au principe \u00e9tabli dans Khelawon et qu\u2019elles militent en faveur d\u2019une approche consistant \u00e0 recevoir les documents en examinant ceux-ci au cas par cas.\n[54] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019observation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien selon laquelle un document devrait \u00eatre re\u00e7u pour preuve de son contenu, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu\u2019aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, en contravention du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure. Cela placerait l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une position intenable, laquelle consisterait pour lui \u00e0 ne pas savoir quelle est la preuve qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9futer. Si les plaignantes ne disent pas au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur quelles parties des documents elles s\u2019appuient et sur quels fondements elles le font, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut pas r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e et rectifier toute interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, si les plaignantes n\u2019agissent de cette mani\u00e8re qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019argumentation, comme le laisse entendre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, cela soul\u00e8verait des questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne serait plus en mesure de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour se d\u00e9fendre.\n[55] En ce qui concerne la question du rappel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que le rappel des t\u00e9moins a pour objet, pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, de donner \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin l\u2019occasion de fournir des \u00e9claircissements sur son t\u00e9moignage dans le cas o\u00f9 il se serait mal exprim\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en possession d\u2019un certain document \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. L\u2019objet du rappel n\u2019est pas de permettre aux plaignants de peaufiner la pr\u00e9sentation de leur cause. Le t\u00e9moignage que Mme Blackstock a livr\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier dernier portait sur son exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de travailleuse sociale de premi\u00e8re ligne et n\u2019avait aucun rapport avec les politiques. La Commission avait d\u2019abord fait part de son intention de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre un t\u00e9moin de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, mais elle y a finalement renonc\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que le fait de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre Mme Blackstock \u00e0 la place de ce t\u00e9moin pour traiter de ces questions ne constitue pas un bon usage du rappel de t\u00e9moins.\n[56] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le Tribunal jouit du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019autoriser le rappel d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, mais que ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en faisant preuve d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de toutes les parties. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 Telus, le Tribunal peut autoriser la production d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire par le biais du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstock s\u2019il croit que c\u2019est l\u00e0 le seul moyen de recevoir ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que cela aurait pour effet d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de la r\u00e8gle relative au rappel des t\u00e9moins.\nV. La d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e [57] Conscient des r\u00e9percussions pratiques d\u2019une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 l\u2019audience et soucieux de fournir aux parties davantage d\u2019assurances tout en faisant progresser la cause le plus rapidement possible, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e sous la forme d\u2019une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 janvier 2014, pr\u00e9cisant que les motifs suivraient.\n[58] Cette d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate par lequel elle faisait part de son intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate devant le Tribunal le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013, ou peu de temps apr\u00e8s. L\u2019avis de requ\u00eate est intitul\u00e9 : Requ\u00eate en recevabilit\u00e9 de documents pour faire preuve de leur contenu. Par cette requ\u00eate, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande ce qui suit :\nque soit rendue une ordonnance aux termes de laquelle tout document contenu dans les classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ou tout document communiqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, soit recevable en preuve pour preuve de son contenu, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si l\u2019auteur ou le destinataire du document en cause est cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et de la question de savoir si le document en cause est soumis \u00e0 d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins.\nLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate devant le Tribunal le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate \u00e0 cette date. En sollicitant la recevabilit\u00e9 des classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9clarer que le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure) ne s\u2019applique pas dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\nAdmission de documents figurant dans les cahiers de preuve documentaire\n9(4) \u00c0 d\u00e9faut du consentement des parties, un document figurant dans un cahier de preuve documentaire ne peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admis en preuve par le membre instructeur.\nLa Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations appuyant la requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien. Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal saisisse cette occasion pour d\u00e9finir les param\u00e8tres de la r\u00e8gle relative au rappel des t\u00e9moins.\nLe Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les observations des parties ainsi que la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui tant de la requ\u00eate que de la question du rappel des t\u00e9moins. Conscient des r\u00e9percussions pratiques d\u2019une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et soucieux de fournir aux parties davantage d\u2019assurances tout en faisant progresser la cause le plus rapidement possible, le Tribunal rend la d\u00e9cision suivante, pr\u00e9cisant que les motifs suivront :\nAttendu que :\n\u2022 le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure;\n\u2022 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut \u00ab recevoir [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire \u00bb;\n\u2022 le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles traditionnelles relatives \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire;\n\u2022 le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que \u00ab [l]\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb;\nLe Tribunal a \u00e9tabli ce qui suit :\na. Le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure continuera de s\u2019appliquer. Ainsi, les documents continueront d\u2019\u00eatre re\u00e7us en preuve au cas par cas, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019audience et accept\u00e9s par le Tribunal;\nb. Il sera inutile de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre dans le seul but d\u2019authentifier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire. Le Tribunal examinera toute question relative \u00e0 l\u2019authentification de ces documents au stade de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la preuve;\nc. Au sens du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, un document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant qu\u2019un avocat ou un t\u00e9moin de la partie qui le pr\u00e9sente n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\ni. sur quelles parties du document on se fonde;\nii. quel est le lien entre ces parties du document et une des questions en litige.\nd. Si une partie souhaite se fonder sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9crite ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019argumentation finale (que ce soit avant que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ou apr\u00e8s), le Tribunal pourra prendre les mesures curatives qui s\u2019imposent, et, notamment, il lui sera possible d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate une r\u00e9ponse, notamment en citant d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et en produisant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire additionnels, conform\u00e9ment au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c0 la suite de cela, il se pourrait que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e.\nEn ce qui concerne le rappel des t\u00e9moins, le Tribunal \u00e9tablit ce qui suit :\ne. Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le fait de rappeler un t\u00e9moin a pour objet de placer celui-ci dans la m\u00eame position que celle dans laquelle il se serait trouv\u00e9 s\u2019il avait eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le t\u00e9moin aura par cons\u00e9quent le droit de s\u2019exprimer au sujet des documents r\u00e9cemment communiqu\u00e9s ainsi que de toute question qui en d\u00e9coule.\n[59] Les motifs de cette d\u00e9cision sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019analyse ci\u2011dessous.\nVI. La d\u00e9cision de clarification [60] Le 14 janvier 2014, la Commission a rappel\u00e9 Mme Blackstock. Celle\u2011ci a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les documents dont elle avait l\u2019intention de parler dans les jours suivants \u00e9taient des documents provenant de la communication faite par l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en sa possession lorsqu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois, des documents qu\u2019elle a obtenus sur Internet qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles au moment o\u00f9 elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois ainsi que des documents relatifs \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information re\u00e7us le 9 avril 2013. Mme Blackstock a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, sauf mention contraire, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019auteure d\u2019aucun des documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9s. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a ensuite invit\u00e9 Mme Blackstock \u00e0 parcourir une fois encore le cahier de preuve documentaire de la Commission, HR-13, onglet 275.\n[61] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est intervenu pour demander, \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9claircissement, si, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, la Commission avait l\u2019intention de se fonder sur l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du document ou simplement sur les parties mentionn\u00e9es par Mme Blackstock.\n[62] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est intervenue \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019intim\u00e9, d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle avait elle aussi besoin d\u2019\u00e9claircissements au sujet de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, notamment en ce qui concernait la signification du terme [traduction] \u00ab parties \u00bb, tel que ce terme appara\u00eet au point c. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. Selon la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, le degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cision exig\u00e9 par le Tribunal en ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve aux t\u00e9moins restait impr\u00e9cis. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, elle serait en mesure de fournir \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et au Tribunal un tableau exhaustif dans lequel elle pr\u00e9ciserait sur quelles parties des documents elle comptait se fonder dans son argumentation finale, et ce, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne commence \u00e0 plaider sa cause.\n[63] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la question, et, apr\u00e8s une br\u00e8ve suspension de l\u2019audience, il rendu oralement la d\u00e9cision de clarification suivante :\n[traduction]\n1. Une partie signifie \u00ab un extrait \u00bb. L\u2019utilisation du terme partie dans la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e renvoie \u00e0 la partie au sujet de laquelle quelqu\u2019un t\u00e9moigne ou la partie \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019avocat a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal. Par exemple, Mme Blackstock a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de plusieurs parties de l\u2019entente de service de la C.\u2011B. qui se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 275;\n2. Le Tribunal souhaite s\u2019assurer que la partie adverse est inform\u00e9e de la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une partie a introduit de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments;\n3. En dispensant les parties de l\u2019exigence de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre en vue d\u2019authentifier les documents, le Tribunal ne souhaite pas autoriser une partie \u00e0 produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur lesquels elle se fondera pendant son argumentation finale, \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui n\u2019auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie au point c. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, sans par ailleurs donner \u00e0 la partie adverse l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate, si n\u00e9cessaire;\n4. Si une partie \u00e0 l\u2019intention de fonder son argumentation sur des parties de documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie au point c., elle court le risque que le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer une r\u00e9ponse de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate.\nLe Tribunal prend note de la suggestion de Me Champ selon laquelle il donnera des renseignements clairs sur les parties des documents en cause qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, parties sur lesquelles il entend fonder son argumentation, et ce, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne commence \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause.\nCela pourrait contribuer \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer sa propre preuve pendant l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audition de la preuve et \u00e9viter au Tribunal d\u2019avoir \u00e0 fournir les mesures curatives pr\u00e9vues au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e.\nVII. Analyse et d\u00e9cision [64] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont soumis au Tribunal, avec un tr\u00e8s court pr\u00e9avis, un aper\u00e7u exhaustif du droit relatif \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire, et il convient de souligner les efforts qu\u2019elles ont d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cela \u00e9tant dit, la majeure partie de la jurisprudence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e de causes relevant du droit civil et du droit criminel, lesquels, notamment en ce qui a trait aux r\u00e8gles de la preuve, diff\u00e8rent du droit qui s\u2019applique en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[65] Les parties en conviennent, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et il jouit d\u2019un grand pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de recevabilit\u00e9 de la preuve. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019affirme explicitement l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi. Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit que, sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (4) et (5), le Tribunal peut \u00ab recevoir [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire \u00bb.\n[66] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019approche contextuelle de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a adopt\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 R.C.S. 27 (C.S.C.), \u00ab il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul principe ou solution : il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00bb. Tout en prenant cela en consid\u00e9ration, il est utile de lire conjointement l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) et les paragraphes 50(4) et 50(5) de la Loi, lesquels sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\nRestriction\n(4) Il ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\nLe conciliateur n\u2019est ni comp\u00e9tent ni contraignable\n(5) Le conciliateur n\u2019est un t\u00e9moin ni comp\u00e9tent ni contraignable \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\n[67] Dans ces dispositions, le Parlement a explicitement pr\u00e9vu des limites \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal d\u2019admettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de contraindre des t\u00e9moins. Sous r\u00e9serve de ces limites, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00ab recevoir [\u2026] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements \u00bb, comp\u00e9tence qui n\u2019est limit\u00e9e que par l\u2019obligation fondamentale qu\u2019a le Tribunal de garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale telle que la pr\u00e9voient les paragraphes 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi ainsi que par la pertinence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve : voir Dhanjal c. Air Canada, [1996] D.C.D.P. no 4, aux paragraphes 21 et 22; Warman c. Kouba, 2006 TCDP 50, au paragraphe 124 (Warman).\n[68] En tant que produit de la loi, le Tribunal tire ses pouvoirs exclusivement de sa loi habilitante. Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la jurisprudence a reconnu que le grand pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) permettait au Tribunal de recevoir et d\u2019accepter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par ou\u00ef\u2011dire : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mills (C.A.F.), [1984] A.C.F. no 917. Les observations que les parties ont formul\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 l\u2019approche fond\u00e9e sur les principes de la fiabilit\u00e9 et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ainsi que les exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef\u2011dire qui existe en common law ne sont que peu de secours \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[69] Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et de la Commission selon laquelle il serait on\u00e9reux et inutile d\u2019exiger que les auteurs des documents en cause soient cit\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e0 la seule fin d\u2019authentifier ces documents. Les parties conviennent qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la CTGI du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2013, avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 la pratique consistant \u00e0 admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse ou non de ou\u00ef\u2011dire, au cas par cas, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les parties les pr\u00e9sentaient en preuve, et d\u2019examiner toute question relative \u00e0 leur fiabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019\u00e9valuation. Cela permet au Tribunal de d\u00e9finir clairement le dossier qui constituera le fondement de sa d\u00e9cision finale. Le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019approche qu\u2019il entendait suivre dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il rendrait oralement le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Cette approche se fonde \u00e9galement sur la jurisprudence : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Brooks, 2006 CF 1244, aux paragraphes 36 \u00e0 38; Warman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 124. Contrairement aux observations des plaignantes et de la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019avis que les d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues dans Ault, PIPS et \u00c9thier militent en faveur de l\u2019admission de documents d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le Tribunal ne voit aucune raison de d\u00e9roger maintenant \u00e0 sa pratique et d\u2019admettre en une seule fois [traduction] \u00ab tout document contenu dans les classeurs HR 1 \u00e0 13 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, ou tout document communiqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure \u00bb, comme la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien l\u2019a demand\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate.\n[70] La requ\u00eate en question va m\u00eame plus loin, et, ainsi, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a insist\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance pour le Tribunal de saisir la pr\u00e9sente occasion pour \u00e9claircir davantage ses r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve. Dans sa requ\u00eate, en plus de demander que les documents soient re\u00e7us en preuve dans leur ensemble, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande que tout document soit [traduction] \u00ab recevable en preuve pour faire preuve de son contenu, ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de savoir si [\u2026] le document en cause est soumis \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin. \u00bb \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien demande qu\u2019il soit fait exception au paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure. Au titre du paragraphe 9(4), la pratique habituelle du Tribunal consiste, au terme de l\u2019audience, \u00e0 retirer du cahier de preuve documentaire tout document auquel les parties n\u2019ont pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au cours de la proc\u00e9dure. La Commission a confirm\u00e9 sa compr\u00e9hension de cette r\u00e8gle et de ses conditions d\u2019application \u00e0 la CTGI du 19 f\u00e9vrier 2013, et le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 toutes les parties de la teneur de cette proc\u00e9dure dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette CTGI.\n[71] Si le Tribunal accueillait la requ\u00eate, cela voudrait dire que les documents auxquels aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a jamais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au cours de l\u2019audience seraient re\u00e7us en preuve et feraient partie du dossier. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ne dit pas que, \u00e0 la place, elle fera r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces documents dans son argumentation finale, et ce, bien que son avocat ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie orale que c\u2019est ce que sa cliente avait l\u2019intention de faire autant que possible. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il est concevable que des documents dont il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement question \u00e0 quelque moment de l\u2019audience que ce soit puissent faire partie de la preuve sur laquelle le Tribunal est cens\u00e9 se fonder pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision finale.\n[72] Cette demande soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre de questions. Les plaignantes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve plusieurs centaines de documents et elles ont r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elles souhaitaient se r\u00e9server le droit de pr\u00e9senter un nombre inconnu de documents additionnels au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019elles finiront de prendre connaissance des documents ayant fait l\u2019objet de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le fait d\u2019accueillir cette demande forcerait le Tribunal \u00e0 examiner et m\u00eame \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter des documents potentiellement longs et m\u00eame techniques sans pour cela disposer de t\u00e9moignages oraux ou de plaidoiries. Bien que le Tribunal reconnaisse que le nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les plaignantes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s est significativement moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que les centaines de milliers de documents, au bas mot, qui faisaient l\u2019objet de la communication et que les parties devaient examiner, cela ne d\u00e9charge pas les plaignantes du fardeau consistant \u00e0 faire valoir leurs pr\u00e9tentions.\n[73] En outre, le fait de proc\u00e9der de cette mani\u00e8re soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement une grave question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Tant dans la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e que dans la d\u00e9cision de clarification, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que les parties soient au fait des arguments qu\u2019elles doivent r\u00e9futer. En admettant des documents sans demander aux plaignantes de pr\u00e9ciser en quoi ils \u00e9taient pertinents dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure et en quoi ils \u00e9tayaient leur position, le Tribunal pourrait placer l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une position o\u00f9 il serait incapable de r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate ou de r\u00e9futer ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[74] Compte tenu de cela, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019exception au paragraphe 9(4), et, \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, il retirera du dossier tous les documents qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en bonne et due forme et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9s, ce qui aurait ainsi permis que ces documents soient re\u00e7us en preuve. Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur les \u00e9tapes qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de respecter pour assurer la pr\u00e9sentation de documents au point c. de sa d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. Ainsi, le Tribunal a assoupli l\u2019application du paragraphe 9(4). Ce point est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nc. Au sens du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, un document n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement \u00ab pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant qu\u2019un avocat ou un t\u00e9moin de la partie qui le pr\u00e9sente n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\ni. sur quelles parties du document on se fonde;\nii. quel est le lien entre ces parties du document et une des questions en litige.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[75] Les personnes qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, en ce sens qu\u2019elles ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de parties de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve ainsi que de la pertinence de ces parties de documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019ont fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce point de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Tribunal. Les documents qui seront retir\u00e9s du dossier \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience sont tous les documents qui n\u2019ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun renvoi, que ce soit par un t\u00e9moin au cours de sa d\u00e9position ou par un avocat au cours de sa plaidoirie. Pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision finale, le Tribunal se fondera sur les parties des documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve auxquels il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[76] Les avocats de la Commission et de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ont fait savoir qu\u2019ils avaient l\u2019intention, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leurs observations finales, d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur certaines parties des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qui sont selon eux pertinents dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils proc\u00e8dent ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de parties de documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une prise de distance par rapport \u00e0 la pratique normale et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure habituelle du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Bien que, compte tenu de la souplesse de ses R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal a accueilli cette demande, cette prise de distance par rapport \u00e0 la pratique normale exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il garantisse le respect des principes de justice naturelle.\n[77] Les parties sont libres de d\u00e9finir la strat\u00e9gie qui sous-tend l\u2019expos\u00e9 de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, toutefois, les r\u00e8gles relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que les parties doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre au courant des arguments qu\u2019elles doivent r\u00e9futer et qu\u2019elles puissent se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e. Dans le cas o\u00f9 les plaignantes ou tout autre partie souhaiteraient, au cours de leur argumentation finale, produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la production de la preuve, le Tribunal a institu\u00e9 une disposition curative qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019invoquer afin de r\u00e9parer toute injustice subie par la partie adverse. Cette mesure est pr\u00e9vue au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, qui est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nd. Si une partie souhaite se fonder sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9crite ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019argumentation finale (que ce soit avant que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue ou apr\u00e8s), le Tribunal pourra prendre les mesures curatives qui s\u2019imposent, et, notamment, il lui sera possible d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la partie adverse du temps additionnel en vue de pr\u00e9parer de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate une r\u00e9ponse, notamment en citant d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et en produisant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire additionnels, conform\u00e9ment au principe de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. \u00c0 la suite de cela, il se pourrait que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e.\n[78] Les plaignantes et la Commission n\u2019ont pas encore clos leur preuve et pourraient encore d\u00e9cider de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre des t\u00e9moins additionnels. Les plaignantes, s\u2019exprimant au nom de la Commission, ont \u00e9galement fait part de leur intention de fournir au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un tableau dans lequel elles pr\u00e9ciseront quelles sont les parties des documents en cause sur lesquelles elles comptent fonder leur argumentation finale. Elles ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elles produiraient ce tableau avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 commence \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause afin de permettre \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e. Pour autant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 re\u00e7oive ce tableau avant de commencer \u00e0 faire valoir sa cause, il pourrait lui \u00eatre utile aux fins de la pr\u00e9sentation de ses arguments et \u00e9viter qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de faire appel aux mesures curatives pr\u00e9vues au point d. de la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e. Cela d\u00e9pendra bien \u00e9videmment des renseignements effectivement contenus dans le tableau en question en ce qui concerne la description des parties des documents sur lesquelles les plaignantes comptent s\u2019appuyer ainsi que du temps dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 disposera pour examiner les documents en cause avant de devoir pr\u00e9senter ses arguments.\n[79] Pour finir, en ce qui concerne la raison du rappel de Mme Blackstock, comme il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision abr\u00e9g\u00e9e, le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et de la Commission selon laquelle il se doit de placer le t\u00e9moin dans la m\u00eame position que celle dans laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si elle avait eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cela vise \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice que les plaignantes et \u00e0 la Commission ont subi du fait de la communication tardive de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et tout autre t\u00e9moin que les plaignantes souhaitent rappeler pourra s\u2019exprimer au sujet de n\u2019importe quel document qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s leur premier t\u00e9moignage ainsi que de toute question qui en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nPr\u00e9sidente de la formation\nSign\u00e9e par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre du Tribunal\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Les plaintes [1] Les plaignants all\u00e8guent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe ou la situation de la famille, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la LCDP).\n[2] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, deux des plaignants (Mme Nacey et M. Rainville) all\u00e8guent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire dans son application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui les obligent, eux-m\u00eames ou un fr\u00e8re ou une s\u0153ur, d\u2019\u00eatre n\u00e9s ou d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 4 septembre 1951 pour avoir le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits aux termes du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[3] La troisi\u00e8me plaignante (Mme Dennis) all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire en appliquant des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qui assurent aux enfants de sexe masculin n\u00e9s d\u2019un p\u00e8re indien hors mariage avant le 17 avril 1985 un meilleur traitement qu\u2019aux enfants de sexe f\u00e9minin qui se trouvent dans des circonstances par ailleurs identiques.\n[4] Les 15 mai et 5 juin 2015, en application de l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes et demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de les instruire. Les dossiers des plaignants ne sont pas joints en vue de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience unique. Cependant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Commission a fait la m\u00eame requ\u00eate dans chacune des trois plaintes, et compte tenu des similitudes de leur objet, la requ\u00eate de la Commission fera l\u2019objet d\u2019une seule d\u00e9cision.\nII. La demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019instance du Tribunal [5] Les 16 et 23 juin 2014, la Commission a propos\u00e9 que l\u2019on ajourne les plaintes en attendant que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soumette \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le judiciaire les d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Tribunal dans les affaires Matson\/Andrews, lesquelles ont trait \u00e0 des plaintes semblables \u00e0 propos de la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 a appliqu\u00e9 les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription.\n[6] Dans les d\u00e9cisions Matson (2013 TCDP 13) et Andrews (2013 TCDP 21), le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes, concluant que les plaignants contestaient les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription, par opposition \u00e0 un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournissait. Appliquant l\u2019arr\u00eat que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu dans l\u2019affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 CAF 7, le Tribunal a conclu que les contestations qui visent une loi, et rien d\u2019autre, \u00e9chappent au champ d\u2019application de la LCDP.\n[7] Toutes les parties consentent \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nIII. Le droit applicable et l\u2019analyse [8] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire consid\u00e9rable d\u2019ajourner ses instances (voir Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14).\n[9] Cela dit, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal est soumis aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de justice naturelle, de m\u00eame qu\u2019au r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. Cette derni\u00e8re exige que le Tribunal instruise une plainte quand la Commission lui en fait la demande et qu\u2019il donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur cause et de formuler des observations (voir les paragraphes 49(2) et 50(1) de la LCDP). L\u2019article 2 de la LCDP fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on \u00e9limine les actes discriminatoires. Et, d\u00e9tail particuli\u00e8rement important, le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que les plaintes soumises au Tribunal doivent \u00eatre instruites de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle. Cependant, \u00e9tant ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance, s\u2019il y a lieu, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion (voir Leger c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1999) D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15).\n[10] Les plaintes dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ressemblent \u00e0 celles qui \u00e9taient en litige dans les affaires Matson et Andrews,\ndans la mesure o\u00f9 l\u2019on y all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire en appliquant les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription. Si l\u2019on appliquait aux plaintes dont il est ici question le raisonnement formul\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans les d\u00e9cisions Matson et Andrews, l\u2019issue serait vraisemblablement la m\u00eame : les plaintes seraient rejet\u00e9es. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 ces plaintes parce qu\u2019il a conclu qu\u2019elles contestaient les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription, par opposition \u00e0 un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournissait. Le Tribunal a conclu que les contestations qui visent des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives, et rien d\u2019autre, \u00e9chappent au champ d\u2019application de la LCDP.\n[11] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la Commission fait valoir que la LCDP permet que des plaignants contestent directement la mani\u00e8re dont un minist\u00e8re applique des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives de nature imp\u00e9rative. Aux dires de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce type de plainte exc\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence de la LCDP. Le Tribunal a fait part de son avis sur la question dans les d\u00e9cisions Matson et Andrews, et cette question a maintenant \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en vue d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. De ce fait, comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est actuellement saisie de la m\u00eame question, le fait d\u2019instruire les plaintes \u00e0 ce stade-ci ne permettrait pas de r\u00e9pondre tout \u00e0 fait aux questions qu\u2019elles soul\u00e8vent. Je suis plut\u00f4t d\u2019avis que, par souci d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, les parties et le Tribunal profiteraient des pr\u00e9cisions que donnerait la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur ces questions.\n[12] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 suivi cette d\u00e9marche dans le cas d\u2019un autre ensemble de plaintes soulevant des all\u00e9gations semblables au sujet de l\u2019application, par Anciens Combattants Canada, de la Loi sur les mesures de r\u00e9insertion et d\u2019indemnisation des militaires et v\u00e9t\u00e9rans des Forces canadiennes (dossiers du Tribunal nos T1898\/12812 \u00e0 T1901\/13112). Avec le consentement de toutes les parties, ces plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9es en attendant l\u2019issue du contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Matson.\n[13] Comme dans les affaires cit\u00e9es ci-dessus, les plaignants dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont consenti \u00e0 un ajournement.\n[14] Par ailleurs, le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019instruction d\u2019un autre groupe de plaintes dans l\u2019affaire Renaud, Sutton et Morigeau c. Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, qui visait, comme ici, \u00e0 contester les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription. Au paragraphe 23 de sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a formul\u00e9 l\u2019observation suivante qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\nJe reconnais que chaque affaire poss\u00e8de ses propres particularit\u00e9s, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019individus uniques et que chaque affaire est fond\u00e9e sur des faits et des questions diff\u00e9rentes. Je reconnais aussi le r\u00f4le important que les a\u00een\u00e9s jouent dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et l\u2019importance de leur droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendus lorsqu\u2019ils exercent ce r\u00f4le. J\u2019ai aussi examin\u00e9 attentivement les r\u00e9percussions que subiront les plaignants si l\u2019affaire est ajourn\u00e9e. Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis que les d\u00e9lais suppl\u00e9mentaires possibles et les complexit\u00e9s qui seraient cr\u00e9\u00e9s si le Tribunal proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de ces plaintes sans attendre les pr\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019emportent sur ces facteurs. (Paragraphe 23)\n[15] Apr\u00e8s avoir prix en consid\u00e9ration les divers int\u00e9r\u00eats et besoins des parties et du Tribunal, j\u2019accueille la requ\u00eate de la Commission en vue de faire ajourner les pr\u00e9sentes instances.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision [16] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, les dossiers du Tribunal nos T2020\/2114, T2021\/2214 et T2023\/2414 sont ajourn\u00e9s sine die, sous r\u00e9serve des conditions suivantes :\n1) la Commission tiendra le Tribunal au fait de l\u2019\u00e9tat des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire\/appels dans les affaires Matson\/Andrews, et cela inclut les motifs du jugement, s\u2019il y en a;\n2) il sera possible de revoir et d\u2019examiner la question de tout autre ajournement ou de toute autre mise en suspens une fois que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se sera prononc\u00e9e sur la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant les affaires Matson\/Andrews;\n3) n\u2019importe quelle partie ou le Tribunal pourra demander la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance apr\u00e8s la publication des motifs du jugement relatifs aux demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire\/appels mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la clause 1) ci-dessus, en vue de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le statut d\u2019ajournement ou de mise en suspens.\nSign\u00e9 par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 22 juillet 2014",

La plainte et la requ\u00eate en rejet\n[1] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur le sexe et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi). Elle soutient par ailleurs que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre elle parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte, suivant l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[2] Avant l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire rejeter la plainte en vertu de l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi, lequel pr\u00e9voyait ce qui suit :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\n[3] L\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 par la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.C. 2008, ch. 30, mais la disposition \u00e9tait encore en vigueur lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, soit le 21 mai 2008.\n[4] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[5] \u00c0 la demande de la plaignante et de la Commission, et dans le but d\u2019\u00e9viter aux parties des frais inutiles, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 avec soin leurs observations ainsi que la jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui afin de pouvoir me prononcer sur cette requ\u00eate avant l\u2019audience. Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade-ci, je ne dispose pas d\u2019assez de renseignements pour pouvoir me prononcer sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 67 aux all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[6] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019examiner les requ\u00eates en rejet de plaintes qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant la tenue d\u2019une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 rejeter les plaintes le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, mais ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs (voir Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, au paragraphe 140). Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que le Tribunal doit \u00eatre \u00e9quitable envers chacune des parties et, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, qu\u2019il est tenu de donner \u00e0 chacune la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal et de pr\u00e9senter ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que ses observations.\n[7] \u00c0 mon avis, pour pouvoir rendre une d\u00e9cision appropri\u00e9e sur le lien entre les d\u00e9cisions contest\u00e9es, les actes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte et les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens qui requi\u00e8rent ou autorisent ces d\u00e9cisions ou ces actes contest\u00e9s, il me faudra entendre des t\u00e9moignages et tirer des conclusions de fait. Je suis d\u2019avis que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de le faire est de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond de la plainte.\n[8] Proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une audience et trancher par la suite la requ\u00eate concernant l\u2019article 67 est la m\u00eame d\u00e9marche que le Tribunal a suivie dans l\u2019affaire Malec c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2009 TCDP 9. Par ailleurs, je ne suis au courant d\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans laquelle l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 pour rejeter une plainte avant la tenue d\u2019une audience sur le fond.\n[9] En cons\u00e9quence, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(2)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal, j\u2019attendrai apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[10] Dans le cadre de l\u2019audience, les parties pourront produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate, et elles pourront ensuite pr\u00e9senter des arguments sur cette derni\u00e8re dans leur argumentation finale.

La d\u00e9cision 25\nI. La plainte et les requ\u00eates en divulgation\n[1] Le plaignant est un Canadien musulman de descendance africaine, qui se d\u00e9crit lui-m\u00eame comme ayant la peau fonc\u00e9e. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la fourniture d\u2019un service offert par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, il pr\u00e9tend que le transporteur a\u00e9rien intim\u00e9 lui a fait subir un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi du fait de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique, de sa couleur et de sa religion, et ce, \u00e0 six reprises diff\u00e9rentes entre les mois de mars et de juin 2010. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du plaignant et que, dans ses rapports avec le plaignant, elle se conformait simplement aux exigences am\u00e9ricaines et canadiennes en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a\u00e9rienne, ce qui inclut les [traduction] \u00ab listes d\u2019interdiction de vol \u00bb.\n[2] En pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, chaque partie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en divulgation de renseignements. C\u2019est sur ces requ\u00eates que porte la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[3] Aux termes du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments. \u00c0 cette fin, chaque partie a besoin, notamment, que les renseignements potentiellement pertinents qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous la garde de la partie adverse lui soient divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. De pair avec les faits et les questions que pr\u00e9sentent les parties, la divulgation de renseignements permet \u00e0 chacune de conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui lui sont reproch\u00e9s et, ainsi, de se pr\u00e9parer convenablement \u00e0 l\u2019audition. Pour cette raison, s\u2019il existe un lien logique entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties en cause, ce document doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 en application des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 [Guay]; Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28; et Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6).\n[4] Cependant, il ne faut pas que la demande de divulgation soit hypoth\u00e9tique ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaille \u00e0 une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette. Les documents demand\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9s avec une pr\u00e9cision raisonnable. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la demande ne devrait pas obliger un \u00e9tranger ou une partie au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00ab recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation \u00bb (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43).\n[5] Il convient par ailleurs de signaler que la divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents ne veut pas dire que ces derniers seront admis en preuve au stade de l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire ou qu\u2019on leur accordera un poids important lors du processus d\u00e9cisionnel (voir Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite obtenir les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et le dossier des ressources humaines du plaignant, ainsi que ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus et ses avis de cotisation. De la Commission, elle souhaite \u00e9galement recevoir les renseignements relatifs \u00e0 la plainte que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019Administration canadienne de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du transport a\u00e9rien (l\u2019ACSTA).\n[7] La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au sujet des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux est la suivante :\nII. Les principes de la divulgation\nIII. La requ\u00eate en divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\nA. Les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux\n[traduction]\na) que le plaignant produise une liste des sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9, dont des m\u00e9decins, des psychologues, des travailleurs sociaux ou des conseillers, qu\u2019il a consult\u00e9s pour des sympt\u00f4mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression, \u00e0 l\u2019insomnie ou \u00e0 toute autre affection, ou pour leur traitement, depuis janvier 2006;\nb) que le plaignant produise aux parties tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux qu\u2019il a en sa possession et qui proviennent des personnes ou des organismes pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s ci-dessous, et qu\u2019il fournisse une autorisation permettant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir les dossiers complets de ces m\u00eames personnes ou organismes, et ce, depuis janvier 2006, relativement aux traitements qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us, ou qu\u2019il les obtienne lui-m\u00eame :\n(i) Centre de sant\u00e9 communautaire de North End;\n(ii) M. Glen Campbell;\n(iii) M. Gerald Hann;\n(iv) Mme Rose;\n(v) Dr Woods.\n[8] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019en raison du pr\u00e9tendu acte discriminatoire il a subi des dommages, dont un pr\u00e9judice personnel, comme de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie et une perte d\u2019estime de soi, dommages pour lesquels il souhaite obtenir une indemnisation pour souffrance morale et physique. De ce fait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant a directement mis en cause ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux avant et apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents et, dans ce contexte, elle a besoin des documents m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s pour pouvoir se d\u00e9fendre comme il faut contre les all\u00e9gations que le plaignant a soulev\u00e9es.\n[9] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises au plaignant de produire ses documents m\u00e9dicaux; cependant, ce dernier n\u2019a fourni \u00e0 ce jour que des documents m\u00e9dicaux restreints, lesquels se composent principalement de lettres de compte rendu dans lesquelles il semble que l\u2019on ait express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 \u00e0 des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 de ne traiter que des questions demand\u00e9es par le plaignant. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, aucun des documents produits n\u2019inclut des notes de consultation, des notes et des dossiers cliniques ou un sommaire des examens effectu\u00e9s en fonction des pr\u00e9judices que le plaignant aurait subis.\n[10] Le plaignant croit que la demande concernant ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux est d\u2019une trop grande port\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9borde le cadre de l\u2019affaire et qu\u2019elle empi\u00e8te sur sa vie priv\u00e9e. Il pr\u00e9tend avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 produit des documents qui sont directement li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019effet que ses all\u00e9gations ont eu sur lui. Il soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 ces documents, mais qu\u2019il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de t\u00e9moignages de professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et de la m\u00e9decine.\n[11] La Commission fait \u00e9cho aux observations du plaignant. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, le plaignant n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas que les actes en question ont exacerb\u00e9 une affection qui existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avant les pr\u00e9tendus incidents, mais que les actes all\u00e9gu\u00e9s lui ont caus\u00e9 de la d\u00e9tresse, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, du stress, de l\u2019insomnie et un \u00e9tat d\u2019appr\u00e9hension chronique dans les a\u00e9roports. La Commission d\u00e9clare que, de ce fait, le dossier m\u00e9dical tout entier du plaignant, qui remonte \u00e0 2006, de m\u00eame que les dossiers des six personnes nomm\u00e9es, d\u00e9passent de loin ce qui est pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des faits et des questions qui sont soulev\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De l\u2019avis de la Commission, si le Tribunal faisait droit \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, il faudrait qu\u2019elle se limite aux pr\u00e9tendues souffrances morales et physiques et qu\u2019elle ne vise pas la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qui est en litige.\n[12] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet qu\u2019un plaignant a droit au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 quand il est question de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Beaudry c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CanLII 61851 (TCDP), au paragraphe 7 [Beaudry]; McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (TCDP), au paragraphe 3 [McAvinn]). Mais il est possible que ce droit s\u2019\u00e9teigne lorsque cette personne met son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause (voir McAvinn, au paragraphe 4; Guay, au paragraphe 45; Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11; voir \u00e9galement Frenette c. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., [1992] 1 RCS 647; et M. (A.) c. Ryan, [1997] 1 RCS 157 [M. (A.)]). Cela dit, \u00ab le besoin de d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9viter une injustice n\u2019\u00e9carte pas automatiquement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une protection contre une divulgation compl\u00e8te \u00bb (M. (A.), au paragraphe 33). Dans les affaires o\u00f9 le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, il a habituellement assorti cette divulgation de conditions de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e de la personne et la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements, comme restreindre les personnes pouvant les consulter et les copier (voir par exemple Guay, au paragraphe 48; McAvinn, aux paragraphes 19 et 20; Beaudry, aux paragraphes 7 et 9; Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al., 2012 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 19; et Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 37).\n[13] Le plaignant a mis son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause en disant qu\u2019il s\u2019est fait traiter pour de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie et une perte d\u2019estime de soi en raison des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes discriminatoires. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il r\u00e9clame aussi des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour souffrance morale et physique. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant qui se rapportent au traitement de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie ou de la perte d\u2019estime de soi sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, car ils permettraient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre convenablement aux all\u00e9gations concernant les effets des pr\u00e9tendus actes discriminatoires sur le plaignant. Cela oblige \u00e9galement le plaignant \u00e0 produire une liste des sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9, dont des m\u00e9decins, des psychologues, des travailleurs sociaux ou des conseillers, qu\u2019il a consult\u00e9s pour le traitement de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie ou de la perte d\u2019estime de soi.\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qui remontent \u00e0 2006. Rien n\u2019indique pourquoi cette p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9cise est demand\u00e9e. Cependant, il est raisonnable que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse \u00e9valuer si l\u2019un des sympt\u00f4mes que le plaignant a ressentis en 2010 et par la suite avait un lien avec une affection m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9existante ou une exp\u00e9rience traumatisante ant\u00e9rieure. Il se peut toutefois que la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant en 2006 soit d\u2019une port\u00e9e excessive. Il convient donc de communiquer les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux susmentionn\u00e9s qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant en janvier 2008.\n[15] Pour prot\u00e9ger le droit du plaignant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents seront communiqu\u00e9s aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de la Commission seulement, et \u00e0 nulle autre personne sans obtenir au pr\u00e9alable l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal et sans en aviser le plaignant. Les documents ne pourront servir \u00e0 aucune fin autre que la pr\u00e9sente instruction. Si le plaignant estime que l\u2019un de ces documents est de nature personnelle et n\u2019est pas potentiellement pertinent, je lui donnerai le choix de me le transmettre \u00e0 l\u2019avance et je d\u00e9ciderai s\u2019il y a lieu de le communiquer ou non. Si le plaignant se pr\u00e9vaut de cette possibilit\u00e9, un avis de mon examen de ces documents sera signifi\u00e9 aux autres parties.\nB. Le dossier des ressources humaines\n[16] Pour ce qui est du dossier des ressources humaines, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande :\n[traduction]\na) que le plaignant produise aux parties le dossier complet des ressources humaines que tient son employeur ou qu\u2019il donne l\u2019autorisation de l\u2019obtenir.\n[17] La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant le dossier des ressources humaines du plaignant est fond\u00e9e sur les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s suivants, qui figurent dans la plainte ainsi que dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant :\n[traduction] La situation s\u2019est r\u00e9percut\u00e9e sur mon travail ainsi que sur mes coll\u00e8gues, car je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te souvent des perceptions et de la stigmatisation qui s\u2019y rattachent.\nJ\u2019ai puis\u00e9 dans ma banque de jours de cong\u00e9 pour poursuivre ma gu\u00e9rison. Depuis le d\u00e9but de cette \u00e9preuve, j\u2019ai pris plus que le nombre moyen de jours de maladie au travail [\u2026]\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle ne peut v\u00e9rifier la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations que si on lui permet de consulter le dossier des ressources humaines du plaignant. Il lui serait dans ce cas possible de comparer les dates de vacances \u00e0 celles o\u00f9 le plaignant a re\u00e7u des traitements et de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par la situation au travail.\n[19] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 demander \u00e0 son directeur de produire une comparaison entre ses cong\u00e9s de maladie et une repr\u00e9sentation statistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des cong\u00e9s de maladie d\u2019autres personnes occupant un poste semblable au sein de son service, \u00e0 compter du mois de mars 2010. Il laisse aussi entendre que, si la plainte atteint le stade de l\u2019instruction, on pourrait aussi appeler le directeur \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[20] La Commission soutient que la communication du dossier des ressources humaines tout entier du plaignant exc\u00e8de de loin ce qui est pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des faits et des questions qui sont soulev\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon elle, les probl\u00e8mes d\u2019emploi associ\u00e9s aux souffrances physiques et morales dont le plaignant fait \u00e9tat sont li\u00e9s au fait qu\u2019ils causent des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019absent\u00e9isme. Le plaignant n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas que les actes en question ont exacerb\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes qui existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 au travail ou que son rendement au travail en a souffert. Par cons\u00e9quent, de l\u2019avis de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tout au plus droit aux documents d\u2019emploi \u00e9tablis depuis les pr\u00e9tendus incidents. La Commission ajoute \u00e9galement que, pour des raisons de comparaison, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut aussi avoir droit \u00e0 certains documents li\u00e9s \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode directement ant\u00e9rieure au mois de mars 2010, celui o\u00f9 le premier incident aurait eu lieu. Cependant, elle soutient que les documents d\u2019emploi communiqu\u00e9s devraient se limiter aux pr\u00e9sences, car il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du seul aspect sur lequel, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, les pr\u00e9tendus actes discriminatoires ont eu une incidence.\n[21] Je suis d\u2019avis que le dossier des ressources humaines du plaignant est potentiellement pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle les pr\u00e9tendus actes discriminatoires ont eu une incidence sur lui au travail. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande le dossier des ressources humaines complet du plaignant. M\u00eame si celui-ci ne dit pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019incidence de la situation sur son travail, il all\u00e8gue bel et bien qu\u2019il y a eu une telle incidence. Il est donc raisonnable, je crois, que le plaignant communique l\u2019ensemble de son dossier des ressources humaines afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse \u00e9valuer une p\u00e9riode raisonnable qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et qui suit le pr\u00e9tendu comportement discriminatoire. Ce dossier devrait \u00eatre complet et comporter la totalit\u00e9 des renseignements qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de janvier 2007 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Il devrait aussi inclure un compte rendu des cong\u00e9s de maladie que le plaignant a pris au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, car cette information est potentiellement pertinente \u00e0 des fins comparatives. Par ailleurs, comme le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019est servi de jours de cong\u00e9 pour poursuivre sa gu\u00e9rison, je crois qu\u2019il est potentiellement pertinent que le plaignant divulgue les dates auxquelles il a pris cong\u00e9 depuis le mois de mars 2010, soit celui o\u00f9 le premier incident aurait eu lieu.\nC. Les d\u00e9clarations de revenus et les avis de cotisation\n[22] Le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu\u2019\u00e0 cause des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s :\n[traduction]\nJ\u2019ai annul\u00e9 ou manqu\u00e9 de nombreuses occasions de voyager \u00e0 divers endroits pour mon avantage personnel et celui de ma famille et j\u2019ai donc subi des pertes s\u00e9rieuses sur le plan de mon bien-\u00eatre et de celui de ma famille.\n[23] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails sur ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re comme des occasions manqu\u00e9es ou sur la fa\u00e7on dont ces occasions auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 son avantage ou \u00e0 celui de sa famille. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas non plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 si ces occasions manqu\u00e9es ont occasionn\u00e9 une perte p\u00e9cuniaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande donc :\n[traduction]\na) que le plaignant produise aux parties ses d\u00e9clarations de revenus et ses avis de cotisation depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006;\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande que ces documents soient produits afin que l\u2019on puisse v\u00e9rifier si le plaignant a subi des pertes de nature p\u00e9cuniaire quelconques en raison des pr\u00e9tendus incidents.\n[25] Tant le plaignant que la Commission soutiennent que les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu sont sans rapport avec les questions qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Commission fait remarquer que l\u2019indemnisation r\u00e9paratrice que demande le plaignant se limite \u00e0 des souffrances physiques et morales ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 une discrimination d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de demande d\u2019indemnisation pour perte de salaire, pas plus que le plaignant n\u2019all\u00e8gue que les pr\u00e9tendus actes discriminatoires ont occasionn\u00e9 une perte de revenus. De ce fait, selon la Commission, il y a lieu de rejeter la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les d\u00e9clarations de revenus et les avis de cotisation.\n[26] Je ne vois pas la pr\u00e9tendue pertinence des d\u00e9clarations de revenus et des avis de cotisation du plaignant, car la pr\u00e9sente demande n\u2019inclut pas de r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire ou de revenu par suite du pr\u00e9tendu comportement discriminatoire. Si la demande comprenait une telle r\u00e9clamation, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 potentiellement pertinent, selon moi, de produire les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Comme ce n\u2019est actuellement pas le cas, la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir les d\u00e9clarations de revenus et les avis de cotisation du plaignant est rejet\u00e9e.\nD. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ce qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u jusqu\u2019ici comporte de nombreux documents faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une autre plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant contre l\u2019ACSTA. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que, dans les documents qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us, le plaignant confirme que les all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre l\u2019ACSTA ont eu lieu entre ou pendant les formalit\u00e9s d\u2019enregistrement et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent l\u2019embarquement \u00e0 bord d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef, et ce, \u00e0 au moins deux des m\u00eames dates que celles des incidents dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ces documents comprenaient une note au dossier pr\u00e9cisant que l\u2019ACSTA avait fourni des d\u00e9tails ou des documents qui impliquaient l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les pr\u00e9tendus incidents. De l\u2019avis de cette derni\u00e8re, les all\u00e9gations \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans les deux plaintes sont inextricablement li\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles ont eu lieu en m\u00eame temps et qu\u2019une part importante de la pr\u00e9sente plainte est li\u00e9e \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le secondaire que l\u2019ACSTA a men\u00e9.\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, de ce fait, les renseignements figurant dans le dossier de l\u2019ACSTA jetteraient de la lumi\u00e8re sur les circonstances factuelles qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte et qu\u2019ils lui donneraient aussi la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner toutes les r\u00e9percussions qui lui sont reproch\u00e9es. Elle ajoute qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les circonstances des deux plaintes sont semblables, elle aimerait aussi v\u00e9rifier si le plaignant souhaite obtenir des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 la fois de l\u2019ACSTA et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les m\u00eames pr\u00e9tendus pr\u00e9judices. Si c\u2019est le cas, soutient l\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle ne peut pas \u00eatre tenue responsable de pr\u00e9judices pour lesquels l\u2019ACSTA peut \u00eatre \u2013 ou a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u2013 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e responsable.\n[29] Cela \u00e9tant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande les documents suivants \u00e0 la Commission :\n[traduction]\na) que la Commission produise le dossier complet sur la plainte que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019Administration canadienne de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 du transport a\u00e9rien (l\u2019ACSTA) pour les m\u00eames dates de voyage que celles dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte;\nb) subsidiairement, que la Commission fournisse des d\u00e9tails sur les all\u00e9gations que le plaignant a port\u00e9es contre l\u2019ACSTA pour les m\u00eames dates de voyage que celles qui sont l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, de m\u00eame que l\u2019\u00e9tat de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA.\n[30] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme avoir demand\u00e9 le consentement du plaignant et de l\u2019ACSTA au sujet de la production du dossier que tient cette derni\u00e8re. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ACSTA a fait savoir qu\u2019elle consentira \u00e0 la communication \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019on lui donne la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les documents afin de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019ils comportent des renseignements sensibles sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de proposer peut-\u00eatre des mesures visant \u00e0 les prot\u00e9ger.\n[31] La Commission pr\u00e9tend que son dossier, dans la plainte port\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA, n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon elle, les all\u00e9gations faites en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne visent que les mandataires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Bien que le plaignant fasse mention \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de l\u2019ACSTA dans ses documents, selon la Commission, ces mentions concernent presque enti\u00e8rement des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a cibl\u00e9 en vue d\u2019un contr\u00f4le secondaire effectu\u00e9 par l\u2019ACSTA. En outre, la Commission soutient que les mesures de redressement que souhaite obtenir le plaignant visent enti\u00e8rement les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle signale \u00e9galement que les plaintes port\u00e9es contre l\u2019ACSTA et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es comme des dossiers distincts, qu\u2019elles ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate distincte et que, en fin de compte, la plainte port\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[32] La Commission ajoute que, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e obtient l\u2019accord de l\u2019ACSTA et du plaignant pour ce qui est de la divulgation des renseignements figurant dans le dossier, ces derniers seront fournis.\n[33] Bien que la Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on communique les documents relatifs \u00e0 la plainte port\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA pour cause d\u2019absence de pertinence, elle est tout de m\u00eame dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir les renseignements si l\u2019ACSTA et le plaignant y souscrivent. L\u2019ACSTA a donn\u00e9 son accord. Par cons\u00e9quent, le seul obstacle \u00e0 la divulgation de ces renseignements est le plaignant. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant n\u2019a pas dit pourquoi il s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation de ces renseignements. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je suis convaincu que ces renseignements sont potentiellement pertinents.\n[34] Les proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui sont appliqu\u00e9es depuis l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019enregistrement \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport, qu\u2019ex\u00e9cute l\u2019intim\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 celle du contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, qu\u2019ex\u00e9cute l\u2019ACSTA, se succ\u00e8dent et il semble y a voir des liens entre les proc\u00e9dures distinctes. Vu la position qu\u2019adopte l\u2019intim\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019a fait que suivre les r\u00e8glements canadiens et am\u00e9ricains en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle a cens\u00e9ment trait\u00e9 le plaignant, je crois qu\u2019il serait potentiellement pertinent de conna\u00eetre le point de vue de l\u2019ACSTA sur les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, y compris la mani\u00e8re dont elle per\u00e7oit le r\u00f4le que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a jou\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9tendu traitement du plaignant. Compte tenu de la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle les all\u00e9gations \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans les deux plaintes paraissent semblables, je crois aussi que les renseignements figurant dans le dossier de l\u2019ACSTA peuvent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents pour mieux comprendre les circonstances factuelles qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. De plus, comme on laisse entendre que l\u2019ACSTA a sous-entendu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait commis des actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles, il est donc juste que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit elle aussi mise au courant de ces actes. Je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019il faudrait divulguer les renseignements que d\u00e9tient la Commission dans son dossier sur la plainte port\u00e9e par le plaignant contre l\u2019ACSTA.\nIV. La requ\u00eate en communication du plaignant\n[35] Le plaignant demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournisse quatre types de documents. Deux des demandes peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de renseignements concernant la formation dispens\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le plaignant souhaite aussi obtenir des documents faisant \u00e9tat de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 propos des droits de la personne ainsi que des renseignements sur des plaintes semblables \u00e0 celles dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nA. Les renseignements concernant la formation dispens\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[36] Le texte int\u00e9gral des demandes que le plaignant a formul\u00e9es sous cette rubrique est le suivant :\n[traduction] 1. Toutes les ressources pertinentes concernant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 organisationnelle en mati\u00e8re de diversit\u00e9 et de comp\u00e9tences culturelles, y compris, notamment, les strat\u00e9gies, les programmes de formation, les politiques, les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de principe sur la diversit\u00e9, l\u2019inclusion et les comp\u00e9tences culturelles, de m\u00eame que toute \u00e9tude connexe.\n2. Tous les documents relatifs aux activit\u00e9s de formation sur la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles et les comp\u00e9tences culturelles qu\u2019ont suivies les membres du personnel et les personnes qui ont eu affaire avec moi \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport, de m\u00eame que le contenu de ces programmes.\n[37] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la requ\u00eate en communication de la Commission porte \u00e9galement sur :\n[traduction]\nd. Les renseignements concernant la formation dispens\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur la mani\u00e8re de r\u00e9pondre aux plaintes de passagers soumis \u00e0 un interrogatoire plus pr\u00e9cis ou \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi ou interdits de vol \u00e0 cause de pr\u00e9tendues pr\u00e9occupations sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\ne. Les renseignements concernant la formation dispens\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada sur les droits de la personne ou sur la formation \u00e0 la sensibilit\u00e9 que dispense Air Canada \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s qui s\u2019occupent, directement ou indirectement, du contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers.\n[38] Selon le plaignant, la position qu\u2019adopte une organisation et la strat\u00e9gie qu\u2019elle suit sur le plan de la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles ont une incidence directe sur les attitudes et le comportement des membres de son personnel. Le plaignant parle d\u2019une atmosph\u00e8re de crainte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des musulmans \u00e0 la suite des tragiques \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 11 septembre 2001 et, de ce fait, il croit qu\u2019il est important de savoir ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait pour s\u2019assurer que ses employ\u00e9s sont ouverts aux diff\u00e9rences culturelles. Si l\u2019on fournit bel et bien une formation de sensibilisation aux diff\u00e9rences culturelles aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant aimerait \u00e9galement savoir si les membres du personnel qui ont pris part aux pr\u00e9tendus incidents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019ont suivie, et quand.\n[39] Pour sa part, la Commission demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournisse tous les documents de formation demand\u00e9s ou confirme par \u00e9crit qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun document de ce genre. \u00c0 son avis, ces renseignements sont potentiellement pertinents parce que les all\u00e9gations, en partie, concernent directement les rapports entre le plaignant et les membres du personnel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui ont pris des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnelles ou qui ont r\u00e9pondu aux questions du plaignant sur ces mesures.\n[40] Par ailleurs, la Commission est d\u2019avis que la plainte soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre d\u2019indices d\u00e9notant qu\u2019il y a vraisemblablement en cause des questions syst\u00e9miques. Premi\u00e8rement, elle affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend avoir tout simplement appliqu\u00e9 les exigences l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires des \u00c9tats-Unis et du Canada dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle a trait\u00e9 le plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon elle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se conformait \u00e0 une politique ou \u00e0 une pratique, qu\u2019elle a appliqu\u00e9e au plaignant et qui comporte vraisemblablement des r\u00e9percussions syst\u00e9miques. De l\u2019avis de la Commission, ce fait est renforc\u00e9 par le caract\u00e8re r\u00e9p\u00e9titif des contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnels auxquels le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, le fait qu\u2019au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode que celle qui est en litige, le plaignant a voyag\u00e9 \u00e0 bord d\u2019un a\u00e9ronef d\u2019un autre transporteur, mais sans \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 d\u2019autres mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de plaintes d\u2019autres personnes \u00e9voquant les m\u00eames all\u00e9gations que celles dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Commission soutient qu\u2019il y a vraisemblablement des questions syst\u00e9miques qui sont en jeu dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte et elle estime que le fait de conna\u00eetre les activit\u00e9s de formation fournies aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est possible de tirer des inf\u00e9rences de discrimination au sujet de la conduite de ces employ\u00e9s ou mandataires, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9cider quelles mesures de redressement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public sont appropri\u00e9es si la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\n[41] Pour ce qui est des droits de la personne ou de la formation de sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que ni le plaignant ni la Commission n\u2019ont fourni une preuve quelconque qui \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la religion. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, dans ce contexte, la pertinence des documents de formation demand\u00e9s sur la [traduction] \u00ab sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles et les comp\u00e9tences culturelles \u00bb n\u2019a aucune incidence sur la principale question de savoir si le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement ou si ce qu\u2019il a subi \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 un protocole normalis\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les documents demand\u00e9s seraient peu pertinents, \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien logique qui justifierait leur communication.\n[42] Pour ce qui est d\u2019autres documents de formation, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019occupe pas du contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers. Elle est plut\u00f4t tenue de contr\u00f4ler chacun de ces derniers en fonction de proc\u00e9dures fix\u00e9es par le gouvernement du Canada et celui des \u00c9tats-Unis. L\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9crit ces proc\u00e9dures en ces termes :\n[traduction]\nLorsque le nom d\u2019un passager pr\u00e9sente une correspondance \u00e9troite avec un nom quelconque qui appara\u00eet dans la liste d\u2019interdiction de vol ou la liste de personnes s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es des \u00c9tats-Unis ou du Canada, une invite automatique appara\u00eet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cran de l\u2019agent, pr\u00e9cisant que ce passager est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 \u00ab risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00bb. L\u2019agent est ensuite tenu de communiquer avec une division du Service de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, appel\u00e9 le Centre de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations (le CSO). L\u2019agent du CSO demande ensuite d\u2019autres renseignements sur le passager, ce qui am\u00e8ne souvent un agent en poste \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport \u00e0 interroger le passager en question \u00e0 des fins d\u2019identification. Il est possible que le CSO ait besoin d\u2019une confirmation de l\u2019instance gouvernementale charg\u00e9e de la liste applicable, \u00e0 la suite de quoi le CSO prescrit si une carte d\u2019embarquement sera remise sans restriction, si elle sera remise \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un contr\u00f4le secondaire ou si elle ne sera pas remise du tout. L\u2019agent en poste \u00e0 l\u2019a\u00e9roport et le transporteur a\u00e9rien n\u2019auraient pas acc\u00e8s aux discussions entre le CSO et les organismes gouvernementaux comp\u00e9tents. De plus, elle ne prend part \u00e0 aucune d\u00e9cision ou n\u2019ex\u00e9cute aucune des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnelles qui peuvent \u00eatre exig\u00e9es.\n[43] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni tous les renseignements potentiellement pertinents, dont un document intitul\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Autorisation s\u00e9curitaire des passagers consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u2013 Politique et conditions \u00bb de m\u00eame que ses [traduction] \u00ab Politique et lignes directrices sur la conduite des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019entreprise \u00bb.\n[44] Les demandes de documents de formation qu\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es le plaignant et la Commission sont semblables, et peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es ensemble. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que ni le plaignant ni la Commission n\u2019ont fourni une preuve quelconque qui \u00e9tablit l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la religion. De ce fait, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tout document de formation portant sur les droits de la personne ou la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles n\u2019est pas pertinent. Cependant, au stade de la communication, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le plaignant ou la Commission prouvent ou justifient leurs all\u00e9gations pour avoir droit \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e leur transmette des documents. La seule exigence applicable, comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus t\u00f4t, est que les renseignements doivent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents.\n[45] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je crois que les documents de formation qu\u2019ont demand\u00e9s le plaignant et la Commission sont potentiellement pertinents, car certaines des all\u00e9gations du plaignant portent sur les actes et les d\u00e9clarations des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par ailleurs, ces renseignements sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique que la Commission a expos\u00e9es et, s\u2019il s\u2019av\u00e8re que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des mesures de redressement connexes.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 communiqu\u00e9 des renseignements potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 ce sujet, mais sa r\u00e9ponse n\u2019indique pas clairement si ses employ\u00e9s suivent bel et bien une formation sur la mani\u00e8re de se comporter avec les voyageurs dans le cadre des proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou une formation sur les droits de la personne ou la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles. Les r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux demandes ne permettent pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de dire s\u2019il existe de telles activit\u00e9s de formation. On peut donc pr\u00e9sumer, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qu\u2019aucune activit\u00e9 de cette nature n\u2019est offerte \u00e0 ces employ\u00e9s. Je crois toutefois qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que l\u2019intim\u00e9e confirme si les activit\u00e9s de formation existent ou pas et, dans l\u2019affirmative, qu\u2019elle divulgue les renseignements potentiellement pertinents aux autres parties.\n[47] En cons\u00e9quence, pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes du plaignant et de la Commission, je prescrirais que l\u2019intim\u00e9e : 1) confirme si elle dispense ou non une formation \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de premi\u00e8re ligne qui sont en poste dans les a\u00e9roports, comme ceux qui ont eu affaire au plaignant, sur la fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux plaintes des passagers que l\u2019on soumet \u00e0 un interrogatoire plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 ou \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi ou qui sont interdits de vol en raison de pr\u00e9tendues pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9; et, si elle dispense bel et bien une telle formation, qu\u2019elle communique les documents de formation connexes; et 2) qu\u2019elle confirme si elle dispense ou non une formation \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de premi\u00e8re ligne qui sont en poste dans les a\u00e9roports, comme ceux qui ont eu affaire au plaignant, sur les droits de la personne ou sur la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles; et, dans l\u2019affirmative, qu\u2019elle communique les documents de formation connexes.\nB. Les documents faisant \u00e9tat de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne\n[48] Le plaignant demande :\n[traduction]\nTous les documents, \u00e9lectroniques ou autres, faisant \u00e9tat de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne ou d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation \u00ab s\u00e9rieuse \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des violations des droits de la personne, lors des n\u00e9gociations, des communications ou des r\u00e9unions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les instances qui se soucient de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, au pays et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, et qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adoption des pr\u00e9tendues mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, lesquelles sont cit\u00e9es comme pr\u00e9misse de la mani\u00e8re dont moi-m\u00eame et d\u2019autres personnes avons \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s.\n[49] Le plaignant justifie sa demande en ces termes :\n[traduction]\nIl incombe \u00e0 Air Canada de veiller \u00e0 ce que les n\u00e9gociations visant \u00e0 entreprendre n\u2019importe quelle op\u00e9ration ne comportent aucune violation directe ou indirecte des lois canadiennes. Au cours de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a syst\u00e9matiquement justifi\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et ses pr\u00e9tendues mesures. Ce dont nous n\u2019avons pas entendu parler beaucoup est l\u2019exercice de mise en balance de la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de la personne dans le cadre de ce processus ou les efforts qu\u2019Air Canada a faits pour pr\u00e9server les droits de la personne. Il est essentiel de savoir \u00e0 quel stade, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, Air Canada a fait montre de s\u00e9rieuses pr\u00e9occupations et a adopt\u00e9 une position claire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de la personne au cours du processus susmentionn\u00e9. Existe-t-il des documents, des d\u00e9clarations publiques, etc., qui le prouvent? Dans l\u2019affirmative, quelles parties de ces documents peuvent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9es? Quelles pr\u00e9occupations, s\u2019il y en a, justifieraient la non\u2011communication de la totalit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une partie d\u2019un tel document?\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la demande du plaignant n\u2019est pas claire et qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u peu d\u2019informations pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer exactement ce qui est demand\u00e9. Cela \u00e9tant, elle soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas pu examiner comme il faut la demande du plaignant et v\u00e9rifier sa position quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si les documents demand\u00e9s seraient potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions qui sont en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[51] Je ne suis pas tout \u00e0 fait s\u00fbr non plus de ce que le plaignant demande ici et, de ce fait, il me faut rejeter cette demande \u00e0 ce stade-ci. Cependant, il est loisible au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9claircir sa demande et de la pr\u00e9senter de nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de proc\u00e9der par voie d\u2019avis de requ\u00eate. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait alors la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner la demande et de faire part de ses observations, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\nC. Les renseignements sur les plaintes semblables port\u00e9es contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[52] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le plaignant demande :\n[traduction]\nToutes les plaintes port\u00e9es contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour de pr\u00e9tendu actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la religion islamique\/musulmane et aussi d\u2019autres religions, l\u2019origine ethnique, la race ou d\u2019autres caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, entre le 11 septembre 2001 et l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013, inclusivement, ainsi que pour la p\u00e9riode de m\u00eame dur\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de le 11 septembre 2001.\n[53] La requ\u00eate de la Commission contient elle aussi une demande semblable pour la divulgation des plaintes :\n[traduction]\nLes renseignements concernant les plaintes de passagers au sujet de questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont Air Canada applique les listes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement, comme les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences faites \u00e0 des questions plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9es ou un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi et les voyageurs interdits de vol \u00e0 cause de pr\u00e9tendues pr\u00e9occupations sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de m\u00eame que les renseignements concernant les solutions et les issues syst\u00e9miques qui se rapportent aux plaintes de cette nature.\n[54] Le plaignant soutient que sa plainte soul\u00e8ve la question s\u00e9rieuse de savoir si le pr\u00e9tendu traitement qu\u2019il a subi \u00e9tait un incident isol\u00e9 ou s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une forme de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. \u00c0 son avis, par cons\u00e9quent, des renseignements sur d\u2019autres plaintes semblables \u00e0 la sienne seraient potentiellement pertinents pour \u00e9tablir si cette forme de discrimination syst\u00e9mique existe effectivement.\n[55] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, au paragraphe 40, la Commission est d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9sente plainte soul\u00e8ve un certain nombre d\u2019indices d\u00e9notant qu\u2019il y a de fortes chances que des questions de nature syst\u00e9mique soient en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle soutient que, s\u2019il existe effectivement des probl\u00e8mes de nature syst\u00e9mique, la divulgation de plaintes ant\u00e9rieures faisant \u00e9tat des m\u00eames all\u00e9gations qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ou d\u2019all\u00e9gations semblables, aiderait \u00e0 mieux saisir l\u2019\u00e9tendue du probl\u00e8me : savoir si les politiques et les pratiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont un effet d\u00e9favorable disproportionn\u00e9 sur des personnes identifi\u00e9es par les motifs illicites qui sont cit\u00e9s dans la plainte. De plus, la Commission dit que, s\u2019il s\u2019av\u00e8re que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, ce type de renseignements sera important pour que le Tribunal \u00e9tablisse une mesure de redressement, car il lui faudra examiner le syst\u00e8me tout entier.\n[56] Pour ce qui est de la vie priv\u00e9e des parties qui ont formul\u00e9 les plaintes, ni le plaignant ni la Commission ne cherchent \u00e0 savoir leurs noms ou leurs renseignements personnels.\n[57] L\u00e0 encore, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019aucune preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que le r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable qu\u2019elle a fait subir au plaignant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur la race et la religion. Selon elle, tant que la Commission ou le plaignant n\u2019a pas justifi\u00e9 les faits importants qui se rapportent au r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur ce plan, leurs requ\u00eates en divulgation de plaintes semblables sont pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9e croit qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de tout fondement valide de ce genre, la demande de divulgation \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette \u00bb, ce qui ne saurait justifier une communication de documents.\n[58] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que, m\u00eame si les plaintes semblables \u00e9taient pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la demande du plaignant est d\u2019une port\u00e9e excessive, car ce dernier souhaite obtenir des documents portant sur plus de dix ans et ne fournit aucun renseignement additionnel sur le contexte dans lequel les plaintes semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il lui est interdit de divulguer les renseignements, car ceux-ci contiendraient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments priv\u00e9s et confidentiels au sujet de tiers non vis\u00e9s, et que ces renseignements ne peuvent pas \u00eatre retranch\u00e9s des documents.\n[59] L\u00e0 encore, au stade de la divulgation, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le plaignant ou la Commission prouvent ou justifient leurs all\u00e9gations pour avoir le droit de recevoir des renseignements de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La seule exigence est que ces derniers soient potentiellement pertinents.\n[60] Je conviens que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui soul\u00e8vent les m\u00eames all\u00e9gations qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ou des all\u00e9gations semblables, y compris leur issue, sont potentiellement pertinentes pour la question de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Cependant, je m\u2019inqui\u00e8te du fait que la demande, telle qu\u2019elle est actuellement formul\u00e9e, en mati\u00e8re de p\u00e9riode et de sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9, est d\u2019une port\u00e9e excessivement large. \u00c0 mon avis, pour \u00eatre potentiellement pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures doivent faire \u00e9tat d\u2019actes discriminatoires, ou d\u2019un ou plusieurs des m\u00eames motifs que ceux du plaignant (race, origine nationale ou ethnique, couleur ou religion), et elles doivent d\u00e9couler de la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e applique des listes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement.\n[61] Pour ce qui est de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e, je signale ce qui suit, tir\u00e9 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\n[traduction] 48.

Le paragraphe 3(1) du R\u00e8glement sur le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019identit\u00e9 prescrit :\nLe transporteur a\u00e9rien effectue le contr\u00f4le de toute personne qui semble \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9e de 18 ans ou plus en comparant son nom avec ceux des personnes qui lui sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par le ministre en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4.81(1)b) de la Loi avant de lui remettre une carte d\u2019embarquement.\n[63] Le R\u00e8glement sur le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019identit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 le 26 avril 2007 (R\u00e8glement sur le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019identit\u00e9, DORS\/2007-82, et il est possible de le consulter sur le site Web du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, \u00e0 : http:\/\/laws-lois.justice.gc.ca\/fra\/reglements\/DORS-2007-82\/).\n[64] De ce fait, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e est oblig\u00e9e d\u2019appliquer la liste de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par le gouvernement depuis, semble-t-il, 2007, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une limite de temps raisonnable pour divulguer des plaintes semblables.\n[65] En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019ordonnerais \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de divulguer les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures que des passagers ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre elle, depuis mars 2007, qui font \u00e9tat d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur ou la religion, et qui r\u00e9sultent de l\u2019application, par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, des listes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e poss\u00e8de des renseignements sur l\u2019issue de ces plaintes, ces derniers seraient eux aussi potentiellement pertinents. Pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 et les renseignements personnels des personnes vis\u00e9es par ces plaintes, il faudrait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e retranche tout renseignement personnel des documents divulgu\u00e9s.\nV. La requ\u00eate en divulgation de la Commission\n[66] Outre les demandes d\u00e9j\u00e0 analys\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t, la Commission demande \u00e9galement, dans sa requ\u00eate en divulgation, les renseignements qui obligent l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 soumettre certains passagers inscrits sur les [traduction] \u00ab listes de passagers pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s \u00bb \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnel, ainsi que les renseignements ou les ententes entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e (ou les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) et divers gouvernements qui pr\u00e9cisent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est plus tenue de soumettre certains passagers \u00e0 des contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondis.\nA. Les renseignements qui obligent l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 soumettre certains passagers inscrits sur les \u00ab listes de passagers pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s \u00bb \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 additionnel\n[67] La Commission soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de l\u2019intim\u00e9e toutes les sources l\u00e9gislatives ou r\u00e9glementaires pertinentes des \u00c9tats-Unis et du Canada qui l\u2019obligent \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au type de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers qui est en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle fait valoir que ces renseignements sont potentiellement pertinents, car l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle se conformait simplement aux exigences tant am\u00e9ricaines que canadiennes dans ses rapports avec le plaignant. Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle est en droit de conna\u00eetre la totalit\u00e9 des exigences de nature r\u00e9glementaire et l\u00e9gislative qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9taient en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ont eu lieu les pr\u00e9tendus incidents, de m\u00eame que les changements, s\u2019il y en a, que l\u2019on a apport\u00e9s par la suite au r\u00e9gime de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[68] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission pr\u00e9cise ce qu\u2019elle croit \u00eatre certaines des sources canadiennes et am\u00e9ricaines pertinentes qui se rapportent \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e; cependant, elle cherche \u00e0 obtenir la divulgation des lois, des r\u00e8glements et des r\u00e8gles qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 elle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le plaignant a formul\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations, de m\u00eame que la connaissance qu\u2019a l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re dont ces lois, ces r\u00e8glements et ces r\u00e8gles ont chang\u00e9 depuis ce temps. La Commission demande qu\u2019on lui fournisse les parties pertinentes de ces documents, en plus des autres lois ou r\u00e8glements canadiens et am\u00e9ricains pertinents.\n[69] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette demande. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, elle \u00e9num\u00e8re les lois qui, selon elle, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es et fournies \u00e0 la Commission. De plus, elle soutient avoir produit une lettre de la Transportation Security Administration du Department of Homeland Security des \u00c9tats-Unis, qui d\u00e9crit plus en d\u00e9tail la nature de la \u00ab liste d\u2019interdiction de vol \u00bb et de la [traduction] \u00ab liste de personnes s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es \u00bb, de m\u00eame que la responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ont les transporteurs a\u00e9riens de v\u00e9rifier la totalit\u00e9 des passagers par rapport \u00e0 ces deux listes. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cette lettre fait de plus \u00e9tat des lois am\u00e9ricaines pertinentes. Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle n\u2019est au courant d\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision jurisprudentielle qui conclurait qu\u2019une loi, m\u00eame si elle est publiquement accessible \u00e0 toutes les parties depuis de nombreuses sources, doit \u00eatre produite par une partie en particulier.\n[70] \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019incombe pas aux parties de produire une copie des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives qu\u2019elle invoque. Elles sont tenues de divulguer et de produire les documents qui sont en leur possession (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et le paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures (03\u201105\u201104) du Tribunal), mais je ne crois pas que l\u2019on puisse qualifier \u00e0 juste titre les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives accessibles au public de documents en la possession d\u2019une partie. On peut en dire autant du fait de se fonder sur de la jurisprudence et de la citer. Si la disposition l\u00e9gislative ou le fondement juridique en question n\u2019est pas accessible au public, il pourrait s\u2019agir d\u2019une affaire diff\u00e9rente, mais ce n\u2019est pas ce que l\u2019on fait valoir en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[71] Cela dit, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)b) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal requiert que chaque partie fasse \u00e9tat dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de sa position sur les questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a, je m\u2019attendrais \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait expos\u00e9 et cit\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions la totalit\u00e9 des sources l\u00e9gislatives ou r\u00e9glementaires am\u00e9ricaines et canadiennes qui, selon elle, l\u2019obligent \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au type de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers qui est en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait. Cela suffit pour garantir que la Commission est au courant de ce qu\u2019on lui reproche. Il n\u2019y a donc aucune raison, selon moi, pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande de la Commission.\n[72] Cependant, nous rappelons \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019une partie qui ne soul\u00e8ve pas une question en vertu de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles ne peut la soulever \u00e0 l\u2019audience (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9(3)a) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal). S\u2019il existe effectivement d\u2019autres sources l\u00e9gislatives ou r\u00e9glementaires am\u00e9ricaines et canadiennes qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019obligent \u00e0 proc\u00e9der au type de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des passagers dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faudrait qu\u2019elles soient divulgu\u00e9es avant l\u2019audience.\nB. Renseignements ou ententes entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e (ou les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) et divers gouvernements qui pr\u00e9cisent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est plus tenue de soumettre certains passagers \u00e0 des contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondis\n[73] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de son argument portant sur la divulgation de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, la Commission soutient qu\u2019elle est en droit de conna\u00eetre le cadre tout entier dans lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certaines proc\u00e9dures de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, car cela concerne directement les faits et les questions qui sont soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Pour cette demande particuli\u00e8re, la Commission est d\u2019avis que le cadre qui prescrit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 certaines op\u00e9rations de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a chang\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre de reprises au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Elle estime \u00e9galement qu\u2019il y a eu certaines exceptions pour les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes canadiennes et mexicaines exploitant des vols int\u00e9rieurs qui survolent le territoire continental des \u00c9tats-Unis, de m\u00eame que des changements aux exigences relatives aux vols internationaux. Elle consid\u00e8re donc que sa demande a trait aux changements apport\u00e9s au cadre r\u00e9glementaire et l\u00e9gislatif en vigueur aux \u00c9tats-Unis et au Canada, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux ententes conclues entre ces gouvernements et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s a\u00e9riennes. Cependant, elle soutient que, s\u2019il existe de telles ententes, de telles exceptions sp\u00e9ciales ou de telles modalit\u00e9s qui concernent l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le r\u00f4le qu\u2019elle joue sur le plan des contr\u00f4les de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ces renseignements seraient eux aussi potentiellement pertinents.\n[74] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que toutes les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives pertinentes, y compris les changements apport\u00e9s au cadre r\u00e9glementaire et l\u00e9gislatif, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies. Selon elle, cela inclut certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments figurant \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, lesquels \u00e9l\u00e9ments concernent le [traduction] \u00ab Programme de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des vols \u00bb ainsi que d\u2019autres changements mis en \u0153uvre en 2011, relativement aux manifestes \u00e9lectroniques de contr\u00f4le.\n[75] L\u00e0 encore, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)b) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal, je m\u2019attendrais \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait expos\u00e9 et cit\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions le cadre juridique tout entier dans lequel elle affirme qu\u2019elle est tenue d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certaines proc\u00e9dures de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, y compris tous les changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 ce cadre depuis qu\u2019ont eu lieu les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e dit l\u2019avoir fait. Il n\u2019y a donc pas lieu selon moi d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande de la Commission. Toutefois, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te qu\u2019une partie qui ne soul\u00e8ve pas une question en vertu de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles ne peut la soulever \u00e0 l\u2019audience (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9(3)a) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal).\nVI. La d\u00e9cision\n[76] Conform\u00e9ment aux motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal ordonne :\n1) Le plaignant est tenu de produire une liste contenant les noms et les adresses de tous les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019il a consult\u00e9s, dont des m\u00e9decins, des psychologues, des travailleurs sociaux ou des conseillers, pour des sympt\u00f4mes de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie ou d\u2019une perte d\u2019estime de soi, ainsi que pour leur traitement, et ce, depuis janvier 2008.\n2) Le plaignant est tenu d\u2019obtenir et de produire, ou d\u2019autoriser l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 obtenir et \u00e0 produire, tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux, sous forme imprim\u00e9e ou \u00e9lectronique, aupr\u00e8s des professionnels des soins de sant\u00e9 \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au point 1) qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, relativement aux sympt\u00f4mes ou au traitement de la d\u00e9pression, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de l\u2019insomnie ou de la perte d\u2019estime de soi, et ce, depuis janvier 2008.\n3) Pour prot\u00e9ger le droit du plaignant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents ne seront communiqu\u00e9s qu\u2019aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la Commission seulement, et \u00e0 nulle autre personne sans obtenir au pr\u00e9alable l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal et sans en aviser le plaignant. Les documents ne pourront servir \u00e0 aucune fin autre que le pr\u00e9sent examen. Si le plaignant est d\u2019avis que l\u2019un de ces documents est de nature personnelle et n\u2019est pas potentiellement pertinent, je lui donnerai le choix de me faire part de ce document \u00e0 l\u2019avance et je d\u00e9ciderai s\u2019il y a lieu de le communiquer ou non. Si le plaignant se pr\u00e9vaut de cette possibilit\u00e9, un avis de mon examen de ces documents sera signifi\u00e9 aux autres parties.\n4) Le plaignant est tenu d\u2019obtenir et de produire son dossier de ressources humaines complet que tient son employeur pour la p\u00e9riode de janvier 2007 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Ce dossier doit aussi inclure un compte rendu des cong\u00e9s de maladie que le plaignant a pris pendant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode et pr\u00e9ciser les dates auxquelles il a pris cong\u00e9 depuis mars 2010, soit le mois o\u00f9 le premier incident aurait eu lieu.\n5) La Commission est tenue de produire son dossier concernant la plainte que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019ACSTA pour les m\u00eames dates de voyage que celles sur lesquelles porte la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n6) L\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue de : 1) confirmer si elle dispense ou non une formation \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de premi\u00e8re ligne qui sont en poste dans les a\u00e9roports, comme ceux qui ont eu affaire au plaignant, sur la fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux plaintes des voyageurs qui sont soumis \u00e0 un interrogatoire plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 ou \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 approfondi ou qui sont interdits de vol en raison de pr\u00e9tendues pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9; et, si elle fournit bel et bien une telle formation, qu\u2019elle communique les documents de formation connexes; et 2) confirmer si elle dispense ou non une formation \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de premi\u00e8re ligne qui sont en poste dans les a\u00e9roports, comme ceux qui ont eu affaire au plaignant, sur les droits de la personne ou sur la sensibilisation aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s culturelles; et, dans l\u2019affirmative, qu\u2019elle communique les documents de formation connexes.\n7) L\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue de divulguer les plaintes ant\u00e9rieurement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre elle, depuis 2007, faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur ou la religion, et d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application, par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de listes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 impos\u00e9es par le gouvernement. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e poss\u00e8de des renseignements sur l\u2019issue de ces plaintes, ces derniers doivent \u00eatre eux aussi divulgu\u00e9s.\n8) Pour prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 et les informations personnelles des parties vis\u00e9es par les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures qui peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es en application du point 7 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est tenue de retrancher toutes les informations personnelles qui figurent dans les documents divulgu\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid Thomas\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe 8 ao\u00fbt 2014",

Le contexte\n[1] Le 31 juillet 2012, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6, version modifi\u00e9e (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb ou la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte de Brian William Carter (le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb) d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada (le \u00ab MPO \u00bb).\n[2] Le plaignant porte plainte aux motifs que le MPO aurait fait preuve de discrimination envers lui pour avoir omis ou refus\u00e9 de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience; que le MPO , l\u2019aurait soumis \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable en adoptant des lignes de conduite discriminatoires et lui refusant en cons\u00e9quence une occasion d\u2019emploi, en violation de la Loi, au titre des articles 7 et 10.\n[3] Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dans laquelle il ordonnait que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada soit substitu\u00e9 au MPO \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9, et que l\u2019intitul\u00e9 soit modifi\u00e9 afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit le \u00ab Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada et la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada) \u00bb.\n[4] La Commission participait \u00e0 l\u2019instruction et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Le 20 juin 2014, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle ne participerait plus \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[5] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pour certains documents (la \u00ab requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb ou la \u00ab requ\u00eate \u00bb). L\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nA. L\u2019annexe 2 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant\n[6] L\u2019annexe 2 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant est intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab M\u00c9DICAL \u2013 CONFIDENTIEL \u00bb, et sous ce titre se trouve le sous-titre \u00ab Annexe 2 \u2013Documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb. Le sous-titre est suivi d\u2019une liste de documents comptant 24 pages. Le plaignant a revendiqu\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge pour ces documents qui, soutient-il, sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9tat m\u00e9dical (les \u00ab documents de l\u2019annexe 2 \u00bb).\nII. La requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9\n[7] Dans sa requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, le plaignant demande que soient rendues les ordonnances suivantes :\nles documents de l\u2019annexe 2 ne seront divulgu\u00e9s qu\u2019aux avocats et parajuristes des parties;\nles documents de l\u2019annexe 2 ne seront pas copi\u00e9s et ne seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9s d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re, y compris par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur et par courriel, par une partie ou un individu \u00e0 une autre partie ou un autre individu;\nsi l\u2019avocat d\u2019une partie souhaite que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 soient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 une autre personne, l\u2019avocat doit d\u2019abord suivre toutes les \u00e9tapes prescrites aux alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 f) ci-dessous :\ndemander l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal;\ndonner un avis pr\u00e9alable au plaignant;\nfournir le nom de la personne \u00e0 qui la partie souhaite montrer ces documents;\njustifier la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour cette personne de voir le document;\nrestreindre la divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cette personne afin qu\u2019elle ne puisse que voir le document;\nobtenir un engagement sign\u00e9 de la personne \u00e0 qui l\u2019on propose de montrer le document, dans lequel cette personne reconna\u00eet que l\u2019existence et le contenu du document sont strictement confidentiels et que le document ne doit pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 ou mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre personne sauf si le Tribunal l\u2019autorise express\u00e9ment;\ntous les avocats doivent pr\u00e9server la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et les ranger dans un lieu d\u2019entreposage autoris\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du gouvernement du Canada;\n\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019instruction, tous les avocats doivent confirmer au Tribunal et au plaignant que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du gouvernement du Canada ou encore, les retourner au plaignant;\ntous les renseignements concernant le plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenus par application de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C. (1985), ch. P-21, sont assujettis aux ordonnances rendues par le Tribunal dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9;\nles manquements aux ordonnances rendues par le Tribunal dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu doivent \u00eatre rapport\u00e9s au Tribunal et au plaignant afin que les risques d\u00e9coulant de ces manquements puissent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s et r\u00e9gl\u00e9s.\n[8] Le plaignant invoque les motifs suivants :\nla nature hautement personnelle, sensible et confidentielle des documents de l\u2019annexe 2;\nle fait que la divulgation des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 au public serait hautement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 la r\u00e9putation et \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 du plaignant, c\u2019est pourquoi il revendique un privil\u00e8ge pour ces documents;\nl\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e par le plaignant est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 152 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales du Canada, DORS\/98-106 (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00bb);\nLeslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson et Cliff Willicome, 2013 TCDP 19, paragraphes 40 et 45 [Palm #3];\nles d\u00e9cisions suivantes, qui contiennent une ou plusieurs des dispositions relatives \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 qu\u2019il souhaite voir ordonner : Harjinder Kaur Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, paragraphe 37 [Rai]; Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 48 [Guay]; Montreuil c. Forces canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 45, au paragraphe 12 [Montreuil]; AFPC c. Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2004 TCDP 38, aux paragraphes 19, 20 et 21 [Mus\u00e9e canadien]; Day c. MDN et Robert Hortie, 2003 TCDP 3, aux paragraphes 3 et 4 [Day]; Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 35 [Gaucher];\nbien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit assujetti \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, des lacunes dans cette loi affaiblissent les mesures de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9voit, ce qui confirme que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 que le plaignant demande est n\u00e9cessaire;\nla recherche de documents \u00e0 divulguer qu\u2019a effectu\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 si vaste qu\u2019elle constitue une \u00ab recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette \u00bb, et elle contrevient \u00e0 la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, c. 11 (la \u00ab Charte \u00bb) parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une recherche d\u00e9raisonnable.\nIII. La question principale\n[9] Le Tribunal doit en d\u00e9finitive d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient ou non d\u2019accueillir la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[10] Cependant, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision traitera d\u2019autres questions que les parties ont soulev\u00e9es :\nles documents de l\u2019annexe 2 jouissent-ils de la protection d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge?\nles documents de l\u2019annexe 2 sont-ils confidentiels?\nle Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour contr\u00f4ler et surveiller le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation?\nquelle est l\u2019incidence de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels dans l\u2019instruction?\nsi le Tribunal rend une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, quelles doivent en \u00eatre les modalit\u00e9s?\nIV. Le droit et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal\n[11] L\u2019article 52 de la LCDP est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n52(1) L\u2019instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\na) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique;\nb) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n(2) Le membre instructeur peut, s\u2019il l\u2019estime indiqu\u00e9, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la demande vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1).\nA. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal\n[12] Le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00bb) pr\u00e9voit que chaque partie \u00e0 une plainte doit communiquer aux autres parties un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui comprend, entre autres :\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9 en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\nf) les noms des divers t\u00e9moins \u2013 autres que les t\u00e9moins experts \u2013 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux.\n[13] Le paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que lorsqu\u2019une partie a fait mention d\u2019un document pour lequel aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9, elle doit en fournir une copie \u00e0 toutes les autres parties.\n[14] Le paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit essentiellement que la divulgation est une obligation continue et qu\u2019une partie doit rectifier la situation si elle constate qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e correctement ou compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\nB. Courte analyse des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d), e) et f)\n[15] Pour se conformer aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d), e) et f) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, les parties peuvent \u00eatre tenues d\u2019effectuer toutes les t\u00e2ches suivantes, ou une partie de celles-ci :\nchercher dans tous leurs documents pour trouver ceux qui, \u00e0 leur avis, pourraient \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte;\ns\u00e9lectionner et d\u00e9cider quels documents trouv\u00e9s sont r\u00e9ellement li\u00e9s \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de r\u00e9paration vis\u00e9s par la plainte et mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u00e9cider si un tel document est \u00ab potentiellement pertinent \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte \u2013 cette expression est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e ci-dessous);\nd\u00e9cider lesquels de ces documents ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge et peuvent imm\u00e9diatement \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie;\nd\u00e9terminer quels documents sont vis\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge et pourquoi;\nchercher des t\u00e9moins, discuter avec eux et d\u00e9cider quels t\u00e9moins la partie a l\u2019intention de citer, autres que les t\u00e9moins experts;\npr\u00e9parer un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus de chacun des t\u00e9moins que la partie compte citer (r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9).\n[16] Pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, il n\u2019est pas suffisant de simplement chercher des documents et des t\u00e9moins, mais il faut aussi d\u00e9cider quels documents seront utilis\u00e9s et les divulguer, quels t\u00e9moins seront cit\u00e9s et en divulguer le choix, et quels documents et t\u00e9moins ne seront pas utilis\u00e9s et, par cons\u00e9quent, n\u2019auront pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.

Analyse : la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal\n[23] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi exige que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur position.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et dans la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient communiqu\u00e9s aux parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal (Rai, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 28).\n[24] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision Rai et la d\u00e9cision Gaucher, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, la norme accept\u00e9e pour la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments preuve, y compris les documents, au sens de l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, est celle de la pertinence potentielle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[25] Pour qu\u2019un document soit potentiellement pertinent, il doit exister \u00ab un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9es par les parties \u00bb (Rai, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 28, citant Guay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 42, et Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\nLe seuil quant \u00e0 la pertinence all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la tendance est maintenant orient\u00e9e vers une plus grande, et non une moins grande, communication. (Gaucher, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, paragraphe 11)\n[26] Appliquant les principes susmentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, tout d\u2019abord, toutes les parties conviennent que le plaignant a mis en cause son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019il avait une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\n[27] Toutes les parties conviennent \u00e9galement que la norme applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal est celle de la \u00ab pertinence potentielle \u00bb du document.\n[28] Les parties ne contestent pas que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 sont pertinents.\n[29] Je n\u2019ai pas vu le texte des documents de l\u2019annexe 2. Y sont cependant indiqu\u00e9s, pour chaque document, la date, une br\u00e8ve description du contenu, le nom de l\u2019auteur du document et les noms des personnes \u00e0 qui le document a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9. Au paragraphe 6 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant explique ce qu\u2019il croit que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 \u00e9tabliront concernant l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre une d\u00e9ficience.\n[30] Je conclus que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 peuvent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents quant aux faits, aux questions et aux formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par le plaignant.\nVI. Question : privil\u00e8ge\n[31] Le plaignant a revendiqu\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge pour les documents de l\u2019annexe 2. Ni son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni ses documents de requ\u00eate ne pr\u00e9cisent le type de privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019il revendique.\n[32] Le paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\nRestriction \u2013 [Le membre instructeur] ne peut admettre en preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le paragraphe 50(4) rend inadmissible devant le Tribunal les renseignements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la loi.\n[34] M\u00eame si les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 sont potentiellement pertinents, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le privil\u00e8ge revendiqu\u00e9 par le plaignant \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard en emp\u00eache la divulgation.\nA. Analyse : privil\u00e8ge\n[35] Voici mes observations :\nAu paragraphe 6 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant soutient que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 pour lesquels il revendique un privil\u00e8ge prouvent qu\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, \u00e9tablissent la gravit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9ficience (au d\u00e9part, et au moment o\u00f9 des mesures d\u2019adaptation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es) \u00bb et il demande ensuite \u00ab que le Tribunal prot\u00e8ge ces documents de la divulgation, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb. Ce passage est suivi de la note de bas de page 2, qui cite l\u2019article 52 de la Loi, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9;\nDans sa requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab toujours pr\u00eat \u00e0 divulgu[er] les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux prot\u00e9g\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 identifi\u00e9s \u00bb [c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 \u2013 je note].\n[36] En revendiquant le privil\u00e8ge, le plaignant a communiqu\u00e9 sa position selon laquelle les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 devraient rester confidentiels, m\u00eame s\u2019il reconna\u00eet leur pertinence potentielle.\n[37] Le plaignant lui-m\u00eame a offert de divulguer les documents de l\u2019annexe 2, sous condition que le Tribunal impose une protection de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 la divulgation de ces documents, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la Loi.\n[38] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu\u2019il a renonc\u00e9 conditionnellement au privil\u00e8ge.\n[39] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur la divulgation avant l\u2019audience et non sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Comme le plaignant a conditionnellement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa revendication du privil\u00e8ge, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de d\u00e9terminer si les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 sont r\u00e9ellement prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la loi.\nVII. Question : confidentialit\u00e9\nA. Position de la Commission\nLes renseignements m\u00e9dicaux sont de nature d\u00e9licate, ce qui justifie qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 soit impos\u00e9e.\nLes ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 rendues dans les d\u00e9cisions Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al, 2013 TCDP 1 [Palm #2] et Palm #3 peuvent servir de base \u00e0 une ordonnance qui concilie la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de garantir la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 avec celle de divulguer ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il puisse pr\u00e9parer sa cause.\nLa Commission propose des modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises pour l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle.\nB. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9 justifie sa position, selon laquelle il n\u2019existe pas de motifs pour que le Tribunal prononce l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par le plaignant, par les raisons suivantes.\nLes documents de l\u2019annexe 2 ne sont pas intrins\u00e8quement confidentiels du seul fait qu\u2019ils contiennent des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux.\nLe plaignant a \u00ab tacitement \u00bb renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux lorsqu\u2019il a mis en cause son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\nLe crit\u00e8re applicable pour juger de la confidentialit\u00e9 veut que les documents soient confidentiels tant objectivement que subjectivement, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans les d\u00e9cisions Apotex Inc. c. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. [1993] A.C.F. No 1117 [Apotex] et AB Hassle c. Canada (Ministre de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social) [1998] A.C.F. No 497 [AB Hassle].\nL\u2019opinion subjective d\u2019un plaignant selon laquelle une telle ordonnance est justifi\u00e9e n\u2019est pas suffisante. La requ\u00eate ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas un besoin objectif de maintenir la confidentialit\u00e9.\nCertains des renseignements concernant ce qu\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant se trouvent d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans les dossiers du Tribunal.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 certains des documents de l\u2019annexe 2, parce que ces documents ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux auxquels le plaignant les avait envoy\u00e9s.\nUne partie de l\u2019ordonnance que demande le plaignant emp\u00eacherait l\u2019intim\u00e9 de consulter des employ\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sujet des documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a en sa possession et emp\u00eacherait aussi ce dernier d\u2019utiliser ces documents dans le cadre de consultations avec des tiers, tels que des experts ou d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins possibles.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, si le Tribunal rend une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 au sujet des documents de l\u2019annexe 2, l\u2019ordonnance ne devrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 ces documents seulement [traduction] \u00ab au moment o\u00f9 ils sont divulgu\u00e9s aux autres parties au cours du processus de divulgation pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00bb [soulign\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9].\nSi le Tribunal conclut que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 sont confidentiels, l\u2019intim\u00e9 accepte la majorit\u00e9 des modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la Commission.\nC. Analyse : confidentialit\u00e9\n[41] Dans les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son argument selon lequel le crit\u00e8re applicable pour \u00e9tablir si un document est confidentiel est aussi bien subjectif qu\u2019objectif, les int\u00e9r\u00eats dont il \u00e9tait question \u00e9taient des biens commerciaux, tels que des brevets et des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle exclusifs. Le pr\u00e9judice \u00e9ventuellement subi si ces documents \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9s \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9judice commercial, mon\u00e9taire.\n[42] Il est raisonnable d\u2019affirmer que, dans un recours civil portant sur des droits commerciaux et des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, les Cours appliquent des normes pour d\u00e9terminer si ces droits n\u00e9cessitent une protection de confidentialit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes des normes qui sont applicables aux affaires relatives aux droits de la personne. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai pour un tribunal administratif dont la loi constitutive \u2013 la LCDP \u2013 \u00e9nonce les normes applicables.\n[43] Ainsi est-ce la norme de confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[44] M\u00eame lorsque des renseignements personnels sensibles sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s potentiellement pertinents aux fins de divulgation, l\u2019article 52 de la Loi donne au Tribunal le pouvoir de les prot\u00e9ger, tant qu\u2019il est satisfait aux crit\u00e8res des alin\u00e9as 52(1)c) ou 52(1)d).\n[45] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas, tacitement ou explicitement, renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9. Il a renonc\u00e9 au privil\u00e8ge, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, mais \u00e0 condition que les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 restent confidentiels en application de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi.\n[46] M\u00eame si le plaignant ne travaille plus au MPO, il travaille toujours dans un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 les documents de l\u2019annexe 2, comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, je conclus qu\u2019ils contiennent des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux personnels qui sont de nature priv\u00e9e et sensible. Si ces renseignements se trouvaient dans le domaine public, sans protection de la confidentialit\u00e9, il est raisonnable de conclure que la situation pourrait causer un pr\u00e9judice au plaignant \u00e0 son travail, et avoir des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur sa vie professionnelle et sa vie personnelle. Aussi le plaignant subirait-il un pr\u00e9judice indu si les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 se retrouvaient dans le domaine public.\n[47] Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que chaque d\u00e9tail de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 pertinent du plaignant ainsi que des d\u00e9tails m\u00e9dicaux qui ne sont pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 se retrouvent dans le domaine public pour que le d\u00e9roulement et le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction reste accessibles et compr\u00e9hensibles pour le public.\n[48] De plus, le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou ses clients ou d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux poss\u00e8dent une partie des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 ne diminue pas la nature personnelle, sensible, priv\u00e9e et confidentielle de ces documents.\n[49] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Rai, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, \u00ab [d]ans les cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, il a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impos\u00e9 des conditions \u00e0 la divulgation afin de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019information \u00bb (Rai, paragraphe 30).\n[50] Je suis convaincue, pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, que si les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 \u00e9taient rendus publics dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction ou en raison d\u2019une instruction publique, il y a, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi, un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation, dans ces documents, de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux personnels du plaignant, et ainsi de pr\u00e9judice indu pour lui, de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation, autrement qu\u2019aux conditions pos\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordonnance ci-apr\u00e8s, dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[51] Comme les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 contiennent des renseignements qui peuvent \u00eatre potentiellement pertinents pour la divulgation, les autres parties ont le droit de les voir afin d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de d\u00e9fendre leurs arguments, tel que le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi.\n[52] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence impos\u00e9e au plaignant de divulguer les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 aux autres parties, cette divulgation devra respecter les conditions \u00e9tablies dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, qui visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements contenus dans les documents en question.\n[53] Dans la d\u00e9cision Palm #3, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a \u00e9largi l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 rendue dans la d\u00e9cision Palm #2, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, pour permettre au pr\u00e9sident d\u2019un intim\u00e9 et \u00e0 deux particuliers intim\u00e9s de voir les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante, dans la mesure n\u00e9cessaire afin que les avocats puissent obtenir des instructions \u00e9clair\u00e9es et puissent fournir des conseils.\n[54] Dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, il n\u2019est pas productif \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019une partie d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate ou demande des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires au Tribunal pour que les avocats puissent discuter des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 avec leurs clients leur donner des instructions. Il faudra certainement le faire au moment venu et, comme ce fut le cas dans la d\u00e9cision Palm #3, le Tribunal peut traiter de ce processus in\u00e9vitable dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Il en va de m\u00eame pour les experts m\u00e9dicaux que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou le plaignant pourraient consulter. La d\u00e9cision ci-dessous refl\u00e8te cette conclusion.\nD. Renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes\n[55] Au paragraphe 30 de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral doit [traduction] \u00ab recueillir et examiner tous les documents que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a en sa possession et qui sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte. Les documents pertinents comprennent ceux qui pourraient contenir des renseignements au sujet de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant et de tout \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 connexe \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[56] Dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou une autre partie entend divulguer des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux potentiellement pertinents au sujet de la d\u00e9ficience et de tout \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 connexe du plaignant qui ne font pas partie des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 (les \u00ab renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes \u00bb), la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et les ordonnances qu\u2019elle contient s\u2019appliquent, avec les adaptations n\u00e9cessaires, aux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes.\nE. Transmission \u00e9lectronique de documents\n[57] La transmission des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et de tout renseignement m\u00e9dical connexe et les communications au sujet de ces documents entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ses clients et d\u2019autres minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux impliqu\u00e9s dans la plainte, et entre la Commission et ces m\u00eames entit\u00e9s, sont des communications entre des institutions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales au sein du gouvernement du Canada. Il s\u2019agit de communications internes du gouvernement du Canada qui sont r\u00e9gies par la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels.\n[58] Il convient \u00e9galement de respecter les r\u00e8glements, proc\u00e9dures et protocoles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 gouvernementaux qui r\u00e9gissent les transmissions \u00e9lectroniques, y compris les courriels, aux entit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s, dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission, et entre elles. Les r\u00e8glements, proc\u00e9dures et protocoles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 incluent le chiffrement, l\u2019utilisation de mots de passe, la classification d\u2019un document comme \u00e9tant \u00ab Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 A \u00bb et \u00ab Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 B \u00bb, les d\u00e9signations de confidentialit\u00e9 et d\u2019autres protocoles.\n[59] Il serait d\u00e9raisonnable d\u2019interdire \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019utiliser des transmissions \u00e9lectroniques, dans l\u2019environnement de travail actuel, lorsque leur utilisation est omnipr\u00e9sente et lorsque des protections de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont disponibles et obligatoires, car cela entraverait la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer sa d\u00e9fense et emp\u00eacherait la Commission d\u2019effectuer le travail qu\u2019elle juge n\u00e9cessaire pour aider \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte.\n[60] N\u00e9anmoins, la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e dans toutes les communications \u00e9lectroniques (et les autres communications) entre les entit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es, entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission, et entre ces derniers et des tiers autoris\u00e9s. Pour respecter la confidentialit\u00e9, les protocoles, r\u00e8glements et proc\u00e9dures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 requis devront \u00eatre suivis pour toutes les transmissions \u00e9lectroniques portant sur les documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes.\n[61] Cependant, les transmissions par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux connexes ne sont permises que si :\nelles sont effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 partir d\u2019une application de t\u00e9l\u00e9copie d\u2019un ordinateur \u00e0 un t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur dans un ordinateur;\ntous les r\u00e8glements, proc\u00e9dures et protocoles applicables auxquels l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou la Commission sont assujettis, selon le cas, sont suivis lors de la transmission par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur;\nla page couverture porte la mention que les documents sont r\u00e9gis par la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et font l\u2019objet d\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 du Tribunal.\n[62] Les exigences susmentionn\u00e9es pour les transmissions par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur tiennent compte du fait que si une transmission par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur est envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 un t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur autonome, \u00e0 moins que le destinataire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 soit sur place pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la t\u00e9l\u00e9copie, cette derni\u00e8re peut \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e par n\u2019importe qui dans le service ou le bureau du destinataire.\nVIII. Question : ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019article 52 et la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels\n[63] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse du plaignant aux r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la Commission \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il existe une lacune dans la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, plus particuli\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab comprend peu de mesures ou de processus pr\u00e9cis qui doivent \u00eatre suivis pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb et que le Tribunal devrait tenir compte de ce fait en rendant une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[64] Le plaignant a joint trois documents du Commissariat \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada (CPVP) \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ces observations. Ces documents sont les suivants :\nM\u00e9moire de l\u2019intervenant, Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e du Canada (le \u00ab m\u00e9moire \u00bb) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bernard c. Canada, 2014 CSC 13, Dossier no 34819 [Bernard];\nDocument d\u2019orientation \u2013 Divulgation de renseignements personnels par voie \u00e9lectronique dans les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux administratifs, f\u00e9vrier 2010(le \u00ab document d\u2019orientation du CPVP \u00bb);\nRemarques de Chantal Bernier, commissaire adjointe \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e au Canada (CAPVP), au premier forum sur la technologie judiciaire,22 septembre 2010 (les \u00ab remarques de la CAPVP \u00bb).\n[65] J\u2019ai lu ces pi\u00e8ces jointes. Les lacunes que j\u2019ai d\u00e9cel\u00e9es \u00e0 partir des documents sont les suivantes :\nune personne qui est d\u2019avis qu\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels en recueillant, utilisant ou divulguant ind\u00fbment ses renseignements personnels n\u2019a aucun recours judiciaire;\nla Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ne comprend aucune disposition d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire pour les pr\u00e9judices d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une telle violation et ne comprend aucune sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pour une telle violation;\nla Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ne r\u00e9git pas les syndicats de la fonction publique;\ncertains tribunaux administratifs ont des politiques claires restreignant la divulgation de renseignements personnels dans leurs d\u00e9cisions publi\u00e9es en ligne, et certains n\u2019en ont pas. Pour les tribunaux qui n\u2019en ont pas, il existe un risque que les renseignements sensibles et personnels d\u2019un particulier, qui pourraient ne pas \u00eatre pertinents quant \u00e0 la publication de la d\u00e9cision, deviennent n\u00e9anmoins facilement accessibles au public.\n[66] Les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la Commission ne traitaient pas de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels.\nA. Analyse : l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019article 52 et la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels\n[67] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour corriger les lacunes de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. L\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels pr\u00e9voit la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour d\u00e9poser une plainte en cas de violation.\n[68] Le Tribunal rend une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 seulement si les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la situation satisfont aux exigences de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP. M\u00eame si elle r\u00e9pond \u00e0 une lacune constat\u00e9e dans la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 du Tribunal doit satisfaire aux exigences de l\u2019article 52 en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[69] Les observations du Commissaire \u00e0 la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e sur le fait que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ne pr\u00e9voit aucun recours judiciaire ni indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire en cas de violation de ses dispositions en mati\u00e8re de collecte, d\u2019utilisation et de divulgation de renseignements personnels, n\u2019ont aucune pertinence au regard des exigences pos\u00e9es par l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et le Tribunal ne peut ordonner de mesures correctrices.\n[70] Aucun syndicat de la fonction publique n\u2019est partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[71] La question de la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la publication en ligne des d\u00e9cisions n\u2019est pas actuellement pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne sera pas publi\u00e9e en ligne tant que la question de l\u2019anonymisation de la plainte ne sera pas tranch\u00e9e. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e auparavant, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Commission pourrait la soulever \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience. Bien que la Commission ne comparaisse plus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la question de l\u2019anonymisation reste toujours d\u2019actualit\u00e9.\nB. Analyse : l\u2019article 152 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales\n[72] G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne lient pas le Tribunal, sauf s\u2019il y est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. La seule r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qui est faite dans les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal se trouve au paragraphe 9(7). Ce paragraphe incorpore l\u2019article 57 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7 (la \u00ab Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00bb) et le formulaire 69 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019article 152 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne lie pas le Tribunal.\n[73] Cependant, si le Tribunal d\u00e9cide qu\u2019il est raisonnable d\u2019int\u00e9grer une partie quelconque de l\u2019article 152 des R\u00e8gles des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, selon les circonstances, l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP l\u2019y autorisera.\nC. Analyse : la Charte\n[74] Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans le cadre de son processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation, s\u2019est lanc\u00e9 dans une \u00ab recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette \u00bb qui constitue aussi une recherche d\u00e9raisonnable, en violation de l\u2019article 8 de la Charte. Cette disposition est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\nChacun a droit \u00e0 la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives.\n[75] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Je suppose, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u un avis de l\u2019intention du plaignant d\u2019invoquer la Charte, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(7) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\n[76] Le plaignant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun autre argument ni aucune jurisprudence sur cette question. L\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission n\u2019ont pas abord\u00e9 cette question.\n[77] Aucune preuve ne vient \u00e9tayer l\u2019argument du plaignant fond\u00e9 sur la Charte. Je ne peux pas conclure que le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation enfreint les droits du plaignant ench\u00e2ss\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 8 de la Charte.\nIX. Analyse : la demande de r\u00e9paration r\u00e9troactive\n[78] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9paration, que tout manquement \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate qui aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu soit signal\u00e9 au Tribunal et au plaignant pour \u00e9valuation et examen des risques qui en d\u00e9couleraient.\n[79] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses documents de requ\u00eate et lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2014 qu\u2019il avait obtenu une partie des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 dans le cadre de sa recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation aupr\u00e8s de ses minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux clients. Les clients avaient en leur possession de nombreux documents de l\u2019annexe 2, que le plaignant leur avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de p\u00e9riodes en apparence pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte.\n[80] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses documents de requ\u00eate et lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique susmentionn\u00e9e que, lorsque le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 le gel temporaire du processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les ordonnances.\n[81] Bien que le Tribunal, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, doive examiner certaines questions de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9troactive, il ne peut pas rendre d\u2019ordonnance en vue d\u2019officiellement examiner ou \u00e9valuer, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9trospective, s\u2019il y a eu \u00ab manquement \u00bb dans le pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue ci-dessous. Y proc\u00e9der porterait atteinte au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, qui est expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessous. Ce serait s\u2019immiscer dans la \u00ab zone de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb assur\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en pr\u00e9paration du litige. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre forc\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir ces renseignements. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne peut pas se prononcer sur un tel manquement pr\u00e9existant ou ordonner une r\u00e9paration.\nX. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour contr\u00f4ler et pour surveiller le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation\n[82] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision d\u00e9coule de la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[83] De plus, le plaignant craint qu\u2019en suivant son processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 se soit lanc\u00e9 dans une \u00ab recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette \u00bb incontr\u00f4l\u00e9e des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant, y compris les documents de l\u2019annexe 2. Cette d\u00e9marche compromettrait grandement la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents d\u00e8s lors que, du fait de l\u2019absence de m\u00e9canismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ad\u00e9quats, elle permettrait \u00e0 un nombre incalculable d\u2019employ\u00e9s non identifi\u00e9s de minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, y compris des employ\u00e9s non identifi\u00e9s dans les minist\u00e8res qui sont les clients de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s, de manipuler, d\u2019utiliser et de diffuser \u00e0 d\u2019autres les renseignements et de divulguer le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 cherche ces renseignements, sans restriction.\nA. La conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2014\n[84] La conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue afin de discuter des pr\u00e9occupations continues du plaignant.\n[85] Pendant cette conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait su que deux personnes dans le ou les minist\u00e8res repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce savaient, ou avaient \u00ab appris \u00bb que des personnes cherchaient \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements au sujet du plaignant. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas en mesure de le prouver. Il n\u2019a pas fourni les noms de ces deux personnes. Cette all\u00e9gation ne se trouve pas dans les documents de requ\u00eate.\n[86] L\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission n\u2019ont pas relev\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation pendant la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[87] Je ne dispose pas de preuves suffisantes pour conclure que l\u2019all\u00e9gation est fond\u00e9e.\n[88] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 au plaignant que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels s\u2019applique \u00e0 ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux, y compris les documents de l\u2019annexe 2, et aux minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui poss\u00e8dent ces renseignements, y compris dans le cadre du processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation. Toute personne ayant communiqu\u00e9 les renseignements susmentionn\u00e9s au plaignant a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. J\u2019analyserai la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels de mani\u00e8re plus approfondie plus loin.\n[89] Le plaignant a n\u00e9anmoins demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que toute personne avec qui une partie communique durant le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation au sujet des documents de l\u2019annexe 2 et de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant soit contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, que son identit\u00e9 soit r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e aux autres parties et qu\u2019elle restreinte dans l\u2019utilisation qu\u2019elle fait des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux afin de prot\u00e9ger les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux du plaignant pendant le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation.\nB. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\nLe Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence sur les documents dont le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a la possession ou le contr\u00f4le [traduction] \u00ab avant leur divulgation aux autres parties en application du paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, m\u00eame si ces documents contiennent des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00bb.\nL\u2019article 52 de la Loi autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 \u00ab rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction \u00bb [soulign\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9].Les documents dont une partie a le contr\u00f4le ne rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019instruction que lorsqu\u2019ils sont divulgu\u00e9s aux autres parties ou d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve [traduction] \u00ab devant le Tribunal \u00bb.Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019article 52 ne donne pas au Tribunal la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019ordonner la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents qui \u00ab ne sont pas divulgu\u00e9s aux autres parties ou d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u00bb. En particulier, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour \u00ab restreindre la fa\u00e7on dont le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral recueille, examine et\/ou utilise les documents qui sont actuellement contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb.\nUne ordonnance restreignant ainsi l\u2019intim\u00e9 contreviendrait \u00e0 son privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\nC.

La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada conclu que le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige constituait une notion distincte.\n[100] La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9fini le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige comme \u00e9tant une branche du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat (Blank, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 28, et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 au paragraphe 40) :\nLe privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige est bas\u00e9 sur le besoin d\u2019une zone prot\u00e9g\u00e9e destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faciliter, pour l\u2019avocat, l\u2019enqu\u00eate et la pr\u00e9paration du dossier en vue de l\u2019instruction contradictoire.\n[101] La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 34 :\nL\u2019objet du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige est, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, de cr\u00e9er une \u00ab zone de confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019occasion ou en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019un litige.\n[102] Les parties qui agissent pour leur propre compte ont aussi droit au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[103] Le fait d\u2019exiger d\u2019une partie qu\u2019elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le sa pr\u00e9paration et sa strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 son adversaire dans un litige, y compris les noms des personnes \u00e0 qui cette partie parle, la fa\u00e7on dont elle compile ses documents et prend des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de ses documents et de ses t\u00e9moins contreviendrait au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige de cette partie.\n[104] De plus, toute tentative non r\u00e9gul\u00e9e de surveiller, de contr\u00f4ler et de r\u00e9glementer la pr\u00e9paration avant l\u2019audience d\u2019une partie enfreindrait le paragraphe 50(4) de la LCDP, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\n[105] En outre, le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction doivent avoir \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter [...] des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb. Les tentatives intrusives de surveiller, de contr\u00f4ler et de r\u00e9glementer la pr\u00e9paration avant l\u2019audience d\u2019une partie ne constituent pas seulement des manquements au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, mais aussi des violations du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi.\n[106] Le Tribunal doit mettre en balance le droit d\u2019une partie \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses renseignements personnels sensibles qui peuvent \u00eatre pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire et qui sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige, avec les droits des autres parties de pleinement pr\u00e9parer leur cause, en application du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi.\n[107] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige et, en application de ce privil\u00e8ge, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019avocat ne sont pas tenus de divulguer l\u2019identit\u00e9 des personnes \u00e0 qui l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 parle pendant le processus de recherche pr\u00e9-divulgation, ni de divulguer la teneur de la discussion.\nXI.

Introduction\n[1] Le Tribunal a instruit la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Leslie Hicks contre Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada et a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 18 septembre 2013 (voir Hicks v. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 20 [Hicks]).\n[2] La d\u00e9cision rendue \u00e9tait favorable au plaignant. Essentiellement, le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation, interpr\u00e9tation l\u2019ayant conduit \u00e0 refuser la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour l\u2019occupation temporaire de deux r\u00e9sidences (l\u2019IOTDR) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant, constituait un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 [la Loi]. Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 au plaignant diverses r\u00e9parations, mais a remis \u00e0 plus tard la d\u00e9cision portant sur le montant de l\u2019IOTDR devant \u00eatre vers\u00e9e, dans l\u2019espoir que les parties puissent r\u00e9gler cette question par elles\u2011m\u00eames (voir Hicks, aux paragraphes 89 \u00e0 91). Or, ces derni\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de parvenir \u00e0 une entente dans le d\u00e9lai de trois (3) mois fix\u00e9 par le Tribunal.\n[3] Les parties s\u2019adressent maintenant au Tribunal afin qu\u2019il \u00e9tablisse le montant de l\u2019IOTDR pouvant \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. Le 22 novembre 2013, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses arguments \u00e9crits; le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse, que le plaignant a fait suivre d\u2019une r\u00e9plique le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[4] Les deux parties conviennent que la directive sur la r\u00e9installation qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la demande du plaignant est la \u00ab Directive sur la r\u00e9installation \u2013 En vigueur jusqu\u2019au 31 mars 2003 (Archiv\u00e9) \u00bb, entr\u00e9e en vigueur en mars 1993. La Directive sur la r\u00e9installation et l\u2019IOTDR sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie int\u00e9grante de la convention collective r\u00e9gissant les conditions d\u2019emploi du plaignant.\n[5] Le plaignant r\u00e9clame 19 406,62 $ \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9dommagement au regard de sa demande d\u2019IOTDR. Cette demande d\u2019IOTDR comprend diverses d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de frais de d\u00e9placement et d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, qui sont \u00e9tay\u00e9es par des pi\u00e8ces justificatives. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste que deux des d\u00e9penses dont le plaignant demande le remboursement : les frais d\u00e9coulant de la responsabilit\u00e9 relative au bail pour la location d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9sidence dans la ville d\u2019Ottawa, o\u00f9 se trouvait son nouveau lieu de travail, et les frais aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 trois voyages.\n[6] Avant de traiter des questions susmentionn\u00e9es, j\u2019aimerais apporter quelques pr\u00e9cisions au sujet de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant. Ce dernier demande que l\u2019IOTDR r\u00e9clam\u00e9e porte sur une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois. Soulignons que le plaignant a maintenu deux r\u00e9sidences pendant une p\u00e9riode plus longue que les 12 d\u2019indemnisation qu\u2019il r\u00e9clame.\n[7] Le paragraphe 2.18.2 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation \u00e9nonce que la p\u00e9riode normalement couverte par l\u2019IOTDR est de neuf mois. Toutefois, le paragraphe 2.18.4 pr\u00e9voit que, dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, cette p\u00e9riode peut \u00eatre prolong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 douze mois :\nII. P\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 : 9 ou 12 mois?\n2.18.4 Si, dans des circonstances exceptionnelles d\u00e9coulant de facteurs qui ne d\u00e9pendent pas de la volont\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9, celui-ci doit avoir deux r\u00e9sidences pendant plus de neuf mois, l\u2019administrateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou un cadre sup\u00e9rieur investi du pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire peut approuver l\u2019octroi d\u2019une aide financi\u00e8re pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois de plus au maximum.\n[8] Sur ce point, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir, au paragraphe 5 de ses observations, que le plaignant n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019aide soit prolong\u00e9e de neuf \u00e0 douze mois \u2013 et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019y a jamais consenti. Toutefois, un peu plus loin dans ses observations, au paragraphe 17, l\u2019intim\u00e9 calcule le droit du plaignant \u00e0 une IOTDR en supposant que la p\u00e9riode de paiement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 douze mois, supposition qu\u2019il dit [traduction] \u00ab reposer sur une tentative de r\u00e9pondre de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9trospective et hypoth\u00e9tique \u00e0 la question de savoir si RHDCC aurait prolong\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019aide, si le plaignant en avait fait la demande \u00bb.\n[9] Malgr\u00e9 ces d\u00e9clarations, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9tend pas que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la prolongation pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 2.18.4 ni qu\u2019il lui aurait refus\u00e9 une telle prolongation. En fait, comme nous venons de le voir, l\u2019intim\u00e9 calcule le droit du plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR en tenant pour acquis qu\u2019il aurait fait passer la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnisation de neuf \u00e0 douze mois. De plus, il d\u00e9clare, au paragraphe 12 de ses observations, qu\u2019il ne [traduction] \u00ab conteste [que] deux des d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par le plaignant en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9placements et d\u2019h\u00e9bergement \u00bb. La p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la r\u00e9clamation ne fait donc pas partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l\u2019intim\u00e9 remet en question.\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019IOTDR demand\u00e9e par le plaignant devrait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e en fonction d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de douze mois, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 2.18.4 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation.\n[11] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des photocopies du recto de treize ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 titre de preuve du loyer pay\u00e9 pour maintenir une seconde r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Ottawa, son nouveau lieu de travail. Le verso de ces ch\u00e8ques n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit. Le premier ch\u00e8que, dat\u00e9 du 22 septembre 2002, \u00e9tait de 900 $ et comportait la mention [traduction] \u00ab loyer oct. et dernier mois \u00bb. Les douze autres ch\u00e8ques, dat\u00e9s du premier jour de chaque mois et allant du 1er novembre 2002 au 1er septembre 2003, \u00e9taient de 450 $. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la valeur probante de ces ch\u00e8ques.\n[12] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le droit du plaignant \u00e0 une aide au logement comprend notamment le loyer d\u2019un studio meubl\u00e9 qui correspond aux co\u00fbts moyens de logement dans le nouveau lieu de travail (alin\u00e9a 2.12.5a) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation). Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a droit, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, au remboursement de ses frais de location pour douze mois, \u00e0 raison de 450 $ par mois.\n[13] Or, le plaignant r\u00e9clame une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire de 450 $ au titre des frais d\u00e9coulant de sa responsabilit\u00e9 pour le bail. Il pr\u00e9tend que, de son premier ch\u00e8que de 900 $, 450 $ \u00e9taient destin\u00e9s au paiement du premier mois de loyer (oct. 2002) et le solde, \u00e0 celui du dernier mois de loyer, comme cela est indiqu\u00e9 au bas du document en question. Si le plaignant avait d\u00fb, pour quelque raison que ce soit, r\u00e9silier son bail avant l\u2019expiration du terme convenu, son propri\u00e9taire aurait conserv\u00e9 la somme de 450 $ garantissant le paiement du dernier mois de loyer. Comme fondement de son droit au remboursement de cette somme, le plaignant invoque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.12.5d) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation :\nIII. Les frais d\u00e9coulant de la responsabilit\u00e9 relative au bail\nd) des frais de sous-location ou des frais d\u00e9coulant de la responsabilit\u00e9 relative au bail, lorsque l\u2019employ\u00e9 est oblig\u00e9 de signer un bail pour un logement temporaire. (Ces d\u00e9penses doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9es par la direction avant que l\u2019employ\u00e9 ne signe le bail.)\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose au remboursement de cette somme de 450 $ : il estime qu\u2019elle fait double emploi (paragraphe 17 de sa r\u00e9ponse), car elle devait simplement servir \u00e0 acquitter le loyer du dernier mois de location du plaignant.\n[15] Soulignons que le bail n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en preuve. Durant l\u2019audience, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une entente verbale ou \u00e9crite. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objection sur ce point. Au paragraphe 11 des observations formul\u00e9es dans sa r\u00e9plique, le plaignant conjecture :\n[Traduction] Aux termes des conditions de son bail, si M. Hicks avait eu, pour quelque raison que ce soit, \u00e0 mettre fin au bail avant la fin de la dur\u00e9e convenue, il lui aurait fallu payer 450 $, car le d\u00e9p\u00f4t vers\u00e9 en garantie du dernier mois de loyer aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9.\nToutefois, lorsqu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les 450 $ vers\u00e9s au titre de sa responsabilit\u00e9 relative au bail avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 encaiss\u00e9s, parce que le bail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t que convenu.\n[16] En outre, le plaignant fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fourni de conseils ni d\u2019aide au sujet de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation, de sorte que le Tribunal devrait conclure que le plaignant en a fait une interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accorde la r\u00e9clamation de 450 $ du plaignant au titre des frais d\u00e9coulant de la responsabilit\u00e9 relative au bail.\n[18] Au total, le plaignant demande le remboursement du co\u00fbt de six voyages : son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement initial de son domicile jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Ottawa; deux voyages effectu\u00e9s par sa femme pour lui rendre visite; deux voyages effectu\u00e9s par le plaignant pour rendre visite \u00e0 sa famille; et un dernier voyage pour r\u00e9gler les derniers d\u00e9tails de son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Le litige entre les parties porte sur le co\u00fbt de trois de ces voyages : les deux voyages effectu\u00e9s par la femme du plaignant, du 7 au 10 novembre 2002 (717,85 $) et du 7 au 10 f\u00e9vrier 2003 (931,75 $), afin de lui rendre visite, et le deuxi\u00e8me voyage effectu\u00e9 par le plaignant pour retourner \u00e0 son domicile du 17 au 21 avril 2003 (939,70 $).\nIV. Le co\u00fbt de trois voyages\nComme fondement de son droit au remboursement du co\u00fbt des voyages, le plaignant invoque les alin\u00e9as 2.13.2c), d) et e) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation :\n2.13.2 Les employ\u00e9s qui sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s de leurs personnes \u00e0 charge et qui entretiennent deux r\u00e9sidences ont droit \u00e0 ce qui suit :\n[\u2026]\nc) lorsque la r\u00e9sidence secondaire temporaire est occup\u00e9e pendant plus d\u2019un mois, les frais de transport, y compris par voie de terre, d\u2019un aller et retour \u00e0 l\u2019ancien lieu de travail. L\u2019employ\u00e9 peut retourner \u00e0 son ancien lieu de travail pour y passer la fin de semaine de son choix pendant la p\u00e9riode de transition, si son horaire de travail le permet, afin de rendre visite aux personnes \u00e0 charge qui habitent encore l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9sidence;\nd) un autre voyage peut \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode, si n\u00e9cessaire, pour les dispositions finales touchant la vente de sa maison ou son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Dans ce dernier cas, l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit utiliser les jours de cong\u00e9 acquis s\u2019il ne peut voyager pendant ses jours de repos;\ne) un voyage aller et retour \u00e0 l\u2019ancien lieu de travail en cas d\u2019urgence au foyer (p. ex. en cas de maladie) si, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019employeur ou du m\u00e9decin traitant, l\u2019employ\u00e9 devrait rentrer chez lui.\n[19] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces dispositions ne visent ni les frais de d\u00e9placement des personnes \u00e0 charge du plaignant ni ceux engag\u00e9s par ce dernier pour rendre visite \u00e0 ces personnes au-del\u00e0 d\u2019un premier et seul voyage, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2e). Il s\u2019ensuit que les deux voyages effectu\u00e9s par la femme du plaignant et le deuxi\u00e8me voyage effectu\u00e9 plaignant pour retourner \u00e0 son domicile ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par l\u2019IOTDR.\n[20] Aucune des dispositions ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR, en particulier celles du paragraphe 2.13.2, ne pr\u00e9voit le remboursement des frais de d\u00e9placement engag\u00e9s par la femme du plaignant. Toutefois, le plaignant invoque les dispositions de la Directive sur les voyages de 2002 du Conseil national mixte, qui traitent des situations o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 est en d\u00e9placement. La Directive sur les voyages mentionne d\u2019autres chefs de r\u00e9clamation eu \u00e9gard aux frais de d\u00e9placement, notamment en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9placements des personnes \u00e0 charge de l\u2019employ\u00e9. De l\u2019avis du plaignant, cela montre que les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es pour sa femme peuvent \u00eatre remboursables. Il ajoute que sa demande correspond \u00e0 une appr\u00e9ciation raisonnable des d\u00e9penses qu\u2019il avait le droit de r\u00e9clamer \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u des conseils et des renseignements de l\u2019employeur.\n[21] Rappelons que le prononc\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance, en vertu des dispositions du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, ne vise pas \u00e0 punir la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, mais \u00e0 \u00e9liminer \u2013 autant que possible \u2013 les effets discriminatoires de l\u2019acte (voir Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13). En ce qui concerne la question des d\u00e9placements des personnes \u00e0 charge, le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 2.13.2 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation ne comporte aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 faisant en sorte qu\u2019elle doive \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 d\u2019autres politiques. Le voyage effectu\u00e9 par la femme du plaignant ne faisait pas partie des d\u00e9penses que ce dernier pouvait r\u00e9clamer. Si le plaignant devait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour ces d\u00e9penses, il se retrouverait dans une situation plus avantageuse que celle qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la sienne si l\u2019acte discriminatoire n\u2019avait pas eu lieu. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa demande de remboursement des deux voyages effectu\u00e9s par sa femme pour lui rendre visite du 7 au 10 novembre 2002 (717,85 $) et du 7 au 10 f\u00e9vrier 2003 (931,75 $) est rejet\u00e9e.\n[22] Pour ce qui est du deuxi\u00e8me voyage de retour au domicile, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9, au paragraphe 14 de sa r\u00e9plique, qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2c) l\u2019autorisait \u00e0 rentrer chez lui tous les mois pour rendre visite \u00e0 sa famille. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que cette disposition limite \u00e0 un seul le nombre de voyages pouvant \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s pendant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l\u2019IOTDR, sous r\u00e9serve des alin\u00e9as 2.13.2d) et e).\n[23] \u00c0 mon sens, pour clarifier la situation, il est utile d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les alin\u00e9as 2.13.2c) et d) conjointement.\n[24] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2c) \u00e9nonce : \u00ab lorsque la r\u00e9sidence secondaire temporaire est occup\u00e9e pendant plus d\u2019un mois, [\u2026] un aller et retour \u00bb. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2d), quant \u00e0 lui, \u00e9nonce qu\u2019\u00ab un autre voyage peut \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode \u00bb.\n[25] Lus ensemble, ces deux alin\u00e9as montrent qu\u2019un seul aller-retour est couvert durant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit entretenir deux r\u00e9sidences. Les mots \u00ab un mois \u00bb ne servent qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9tablir le crit\u00e8re donnant droit au remboursement de cet unique aller-retour. La pr\u00e9sence des mots \u00ab un autre voyage \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2d) signifie qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir eu plus d\u2019un voyage au pr\u00e9alable. Ainsi, selon mon interpr\u00e9tation, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2c) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation n\u2019autorise pas le plaignant \u00e0 retourner chez lui chaque mois.\n[26] Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019une telle interpr\u00e9tation restrictive est d\u00e9raisonnable, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9savantage injustement les employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par une demande de r\u00e9installation et qu\u2019elle est contraire \u00e0 la lettre et \u00e0 l\u2019esprit des dispositions de cet alin\u00e9a, ainsi qu\u2019en t\u00e9moignent non seulement la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation, mais \u00e9galement d\u2019autres politiques semblables. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5.11.2c) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation permet aux employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par une r\u00e9installation \u00e0 court terme d\u2019effectuer un aller-retour \u00e0 la maison toutes les trois fins de semaine. La Directive sur les voyages de 2002 du Conseil national mixte autorise quant \u00e0 elle un aller-retour \u00e0 la maison toutes les trois fins de semaine pour les employ\u00e9s en d\u00e9placement se prolongeant au-del\u00e0 d\u2019un mois. Aussi, de l\u2019avis du plaignant, l\u2019actuelle Directive sur la r\u00e9installation autoriserait de tels voyages.\n[27] Encore une fois, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.13.2c) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation ne comporte aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard au droit du plaignant de r\u00e9clamer les d\u00e9penses engag\u00e9es pour effectuer un voyage \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence. Aux termes de cet alin\u00e9a, le plaignant n\u2019avait pas droit au remboursement des d\u00e9penses aff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 plus d\u2019un aller-retour \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence, sauf en cas d\u2019application des exceptions pr\u00e9vues aux alin\u00e9as 2.13.2c) et d). La Directive sur la r\u00e9installation \u00e9tablit une distinction, sur le plan des droits, selon qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 est vis\u00e9 par l\u2019IOTDR ou par une r\u00e9installation \u00e0 court terme. La Directive sur les voyages de 2002 du Conseil national mixte pr\u00e9voit elle aussi des mesures distinctes pour les employ\u00e9s en d\u00e9placement. Cela dit, il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal, lorsqu\u2019il est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le montant de l\u2019IOTDR, de remettre en question ces diff\u00e9rences de traitement. De plus, m\u00eame si la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation actuellement en vigueur pr\u00e9voit des droits qui ne figuraient pas dans sa version pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, il demeure que ce n\u2019est pas cette politique qui s\u2019appliquait au plaignant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que le fait d\u2019indemniser le plaignant pour le deuxi\u00e8me voyage de retour au domicile qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 du 17 au 21 avril 2003 aurait pour effet de le placer dans une situation plus avantageuse que celle qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la sienne s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019acte discriminatoire.\n[28] Il s\u2019ensuit que la demande de remboursement du plaignant pour les voyages effectu\u00e9s par sa femme du 7 au 10 novembre 2002 (717,85 $) et du 7 au 10 f\u00e9vrier 2003 (931,75 $) afin de lui rendre visite, et pour le deuxi\u00e8me voyage qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 pour retourner \u00e0 son domicile du 17 au 21 avril 2003 (939,70 $), est refus\u00e9e.\n[29] Au paragraphe 112 de la d\u00e9cision Hicks, le Tribunal a adjug\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats au plaignant sur le montant de son IOTDR :\nV. Int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[Traduction] Au moment de r\u00e9gler les derniers d\u00e9tails aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant conform\u00e9ment aux instructions re\u00e7ues ci\u2011dessus, les parties devraient \u00e9galement tenir compte de l\u2019adjudication d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats en appliquant les directives \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 111.\n[30] Le paragraphe 111 de la d\u00e9cision Hicks est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[Traduction] Aussi, j\u2019adjuge des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3), soit des int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s annuellement au taux de la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada, \u00e0 compter du 23 novembre 2004, date du refus de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal portant sur la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant comprendra l\u2019adjudication d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter du 23 novembre 2004 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\n[32] Puisque le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 la demande de remboursement du co\u00fbt des trois voyages (2 589,30 $), ces sommes seront retranch\u00e9es des 19 406,62 $ demand\u00e9s par le plaignant au titre de l\u2019IOTDR. Le plaignant a donc droit \u00e0 une IOTDR de 16 817,32 $.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal rend l\u2019ordonnance suivante :\nVI.

Contexte [1] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) est saisi d\u2019une requ\u00eate de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019International Longshore and Warehouse Union, local 500 (ci-apr\u00e8s I.L.W.U.), dans laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande le rejet des plaintes de la plaignante, Madame Leslie Palm, dans les dossiers mentionn\u00e9s en rubrique.\n[2] Dans sa requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les plaintes de la plaignante contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi que les autres intim\u00e9s Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome constitueraient un abus de proc\u00e9dure selon elle.\n[3] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue dans sa requ\u00eate que la plaignante aurait modifi\u00e9e et retenue certains documents, lesquels auraient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une condition pr\u00e9existante de sa condition de d\u00e9pression.\n[4] Ce faisant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que la plaignante aurait commis une fraude en modifiant lesdits documents avant de les soumettre. De plus, elle aurait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment retenu de l\u2019information de m\u00eame que ces documents. La conduite n\u00e9gligente de la plaignante aurait ainsi induit en erreur les intim\u00e9s et le Tribunal au sujet de la r\u00e9clamation de perte de salaire, laquelle serait non support\u00e9e en totalit\u00e9 par la preuve m\u00e9dicale existante.\n[5] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les plaintes de la plaignante doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es sans audition au fond de la preuve, laquelle audition comporterait des co\u00fbts non n\u00e9cessaires et injustifi\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de m\u00e9sentente en ce qui \u00e0 trait aux faits mat\u00e9riels du pr\u00e9sent dossier. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle soutient que les plaintes de la plaignante ne peuvent \u00eatre accueillies l\u00e9galement.\n[6] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019appel aurait confirm\u00e9 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du Tribunal de rejeter des plaintes qui constitueraient des abus de proc\u00e9dure et pour lesquelles il n\u2019y aurait pas de conflit quant \u00e0 l\u2019aspect mat\u00e9riel des faits et qui ne comporteraient que des questions de droit.\n[7] Dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de sa requ\u00eate qui comporte pr\u00e8s de 181 paragraphes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n\u00ab 178. En 2009, Mme Palm a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes distinctes contre chacun des trois autres intim\u00e9s ainsi que contre ses deux employeurs. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un enqu\u00eateur eut conclu que les plaintes de Mme Palm devaient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a renvoy\u00e9 les cinq plaintes au Tribunal. Toutefois, depuis lors, les circonstances ont chang\u00e9 du tout au tout, de la mani\u00e8re suivante.\na. Mme Palm a conclu un r\u00e8glement amiable ex\u00e9cutoire avec l\u2019employeur et le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019employeur et a re\u00e7u de chacun d\u2019eux pr\u00e8s de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue par la loi pour pr\u00e9judice moral. En plus de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objet r\u00e9parateur du Code, ce r\u00e8glement a eu pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher de conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des deux employeurs, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que toute conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des autres intim\u00e9s comporterait n\u00e9cessairement une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des employeurs \u2013 ce qui est impossible en droit \u2013 aucune conclusion de ce genre ne peut \u00eatre tir\u00e9e.\nb. M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible en droit de tirer une telle conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des autres intim\u00e9s, les faits n\u2019\u00e9tayeraient nullement cette conclusion. Ni les actes de proc\u00e9dure ni le processus exhaustif de divulgation des documents n\u2019ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u2019ombre d\u2019une preuve que Mme Palm a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe \u2013 une condition pr\u00e9alable fondamentale pour que l\u2019on puisse tirer une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 au titre du Code.\nc. Mme Palm a fait preuve de mauvaise foi tout au long du processus de divulgation des documents en retenant des documents et en modifiant des documents de mani\u00e8re frauduleuse dans le but apparent d\u2019induire en erreur le Tribunal et les intim\u00e9s au sujet de son \u00e9tat pathologique pr\u00e9existant.\nd. Mme Palm a commis des abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal \u00e0 maintes reprises dans le but d\u2019augmenter les frais assum\u00e9s et d\u2019accro\u00eetre les retards subis par les intim\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[8] Et \u00e9galement, elle ajoute ce qui suit :\n\u00ab 179. Les intim\u00e9s demandent au Tribunal de rejeter les trois autres plaintes de Mme Palm compte tenu du fait que la poursuite des plaintes constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n180. Compte tenu de la mauvaise foi dont Mme Palm a fait preuve et des abus de proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019elle a commis relativement aux pr\u00e9sentes plaintes, les intim\u00e9s demandent aussi que le Tribunal adjuge des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Mme Palm.\n181. Les intim\u00e9s demandent la tenue d\u2019une audience de vive voix devant le Tribunal afin de pr\u00e9senter des observations. \u00bb\nII. R\u00e9ponse de la plaignante [9] En date du 3 mars 2014, la plaignante a fait valoir les arguments suivants \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[10] La plaignante a fait valoir que les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas fourni une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et dat\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les plaintes qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de mauvaise foi ou sous des motifs non-fond\u00e9s. La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle est d\u2019opinion qu\u2019une preuve d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des \u00e9v\u00e9nements au soutien de ses plaintes, et cela avec pr\u00e9sentation de t\u00e9moins, donnerait une meilleure appr\u00e9ciation des \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cause.\n[11] De m\u00eame, la plaignante indique \u00e9galement que les arguments des intim\u00e9es sont mensongers et comportent des divergences et des modifications des faits dans leur d\u00e9fense.\n[12] Les plaintes que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, originent du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait support\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s masculins sujets \u00e0 ces plaintes et cela, dans le maintien d\u2019une campagne connue d\u2019alt\u00e9rer ses heures de travail dans le cadre de l\u2019obtention de travail additionnel lors des fins de semaine.\n[13] La plaignante a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019harc\u00e8lement, d\u2019intimidation, d\u2019isolation et de discrimination, et ces actions r\u00e9primandables auraient eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable quant \u00e0 elle. Elle r\u00e9f\u00e8re le Tribunal au rapport d\u2019investigation effectu\u00e9 par le \u00ab British Columbia Maritime Employers Association \u00bb (BCMEA) au sujet de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de harc\u00e8lement qui a eu lieu sur ces agissements.\n[14] Elle fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat d\u2019une divergence en ce qui \u00e0 trait aux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e relativement aux heures travaill\u00e9es contrairement aux repr\u00e9sentations que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a faites.\n[15] \u00c9galement, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que Monsieur Wilkinson aurait intentionnellement et frauduleusement alt\u00e9r\u00e9 ses heures de travail. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, ses coll\u00e8gues masculins auraient continu\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier financi\u00e8rement de cette fraude contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 9(1) et 10 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (la Loi).\n[16] Elle nie de fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique que Monsieur Wilkinson aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sujet de sanctions disciplinaires relativement \u00e0 son inconduite envers elle.\n[17] Elle soutient qu\u2019au tout d\u00e9but du pr\u00e9sent dossier, elle aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cinq plaintes s\u00e9par\u00e9es relativement aux intim\u00e9es et qu\u2019il y aurait eu r\u00e8glement en ce qui \u00e0 trait \u00e0 deux d\u2019entre elles.\n[18] La plaignante all\u00e8gue que ces r\u00e8glements sont non-pertinents au regard du pr\u00e9sent dossier et elle soutient que ces r\u00e8glements ne modifient en rien la responsabilit\u00e9 des autres intim\u00e9es eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur conduite \u00e0 son endroit.\n[19] \u00c9galement, la plaignante nie de fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique avoir modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on frauduleuse certains documents qu\u2019elle aurait soumis et soutient que les documents m\u00e9dicaux qu\u2019elle a produits contiennent des informations qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant pertinentes.\n[20] Elle soutient \u00e9galement que l\u2019all\u00e9gation \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait aucun autre rem\u00e8de valable en ce qui \u00e0 trait aux autres intim\u00e9s tenant compte de ses plaintes actuelles constitueraient un insulte \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du Tribunal et elle nie de fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique la proposition suivante de l\u2019intim\u00e9e : \u00ab l\u2019employeur est la seule partie qui peut fournir d\u2019autres redressements utiles \u00bb (voir page 4 de l\u2019argumentation de la plaignante).\n[21] La plaignante n\u2019est absolument pas d\u2019accord avec la proposition des intim\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le syndicat n\u2019est pas en mesure de contr\u00f4ler la conduite des membres sur les lieux de travail et elle soutient qu\u2019elle est au courant de certaines contradictions courantes et pass\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 cette assertion.\n[22] La plaignante nie que les amendements de repr\u00e9sailles qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s constitueraient un abus de proc\u00e9dure et elle indique que le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 ses plaintes en repr\u00e9sailles, et cela, bas\u00e9 sur des faits et des repr\u00e9sentations qu\u2019elle a fournis.\n[23] Ainsi, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que les amendements en repr\u00e9sailles constitue une plainte distincte des plaintes originales qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9alablement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, et ainsi que toute requ\u00eate qui pourrait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e afin de rejeter ses plaintes originales ne devraient pas affecter ses plaintes en repr\u00e9sailles qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[24] Au regard de certaines affirmations de Monsieur Mark Keserich, longshoreman and President of ILWU, local 500, particuli\u00e8rement au regard du fait que le syndicat aurait pris des mesures \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de ses pouvoirs afin d\u2019identifier et de corriger des situations impliquant une femme travaillant dans un milieu o\u00f9 l\u2019environnement physique est sous contr\u00f4le de membres masculins comme dans un milieu de d\u00e9bardeurs, la plaignante indique qu\u2019aucune mesure n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en ce sens.\n[25] Elle soutient que des mesures appropri\u00e9es et raisonnables auraient pu \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es depuis fort longtemps par les intim\u00e9s afin de pr\u00e9venir les plaintes comme celles qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[26] Finalement, la plaignante fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la page 8, paragraphe 30 de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et elle soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une tactique claire d\u2019harc\u00e8lement et d\u2019intimidation de la part des intim\u00e9s. Elle soutient encore une fois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une indication claire du peu de mesure instaur\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate par le syndicat afin de corriger la situation en place ainsi que la mentalit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant \u00ab le club des anciens \u00bb.\nIII. La position de la Commission des droits de la personne (la Commission) [27] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal peut rejeter une plainte sommairement si le Tribunal consid\u00e9rerait que l\u2019audition d\u2019une plainte constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[28] La Commission all\u00e8gue que le Tribunal errerait en droit et exc\u00e9derait sa juridiction s\u2019il rejetterait sommairement une plainte qui ne constituerait pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission cite l\u2019arr\u00eat Cremasco[1].\n[29] La Commission soutient que dans le syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des droits de la personne, la juridiction de rejeter de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9liminaire une plainte, laquelle ne pr\u00e9senterait pas de chances raisonnables de succ\u00e8s, appartiendrait \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et non pas au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, tel qu\u2019il appert dans la d\u00e9cision Harkin.[2]\n[30] \u00c0 partir des dispositions l\u00e9gales constituantes du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, le Tribunal ne poss\u00e8derait pas de pouvoir inh\u00e9rent afin de rejeter une plainte sans une audition compl\u00e8te afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[31] Cette situation serait diff\u00e9rente de celle pr\u00e9valant en Colombie-Britannique, o\u00f9 le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique dispose de pouvoirs statutaires lui permettant de rejeter une plainte sans audition en consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de chances de r\u00e9ussite raisonnables d\u2019une telle plainte (article 27(1)(c) du \u00ab Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique) \u00bb\n[32] La Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions de l\u2019article 41 de la Loi, lequel indique que la Commission doit \u00e9tudier toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il lui apparaitrait qu\u2019elle soit frivole, vexatoire, sans fondement ou faite de mauvaise foi.\n[33] De m\u00eame, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, lorsqu\u2019une plainte est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate, cette situation origine du fait que la Commission est satisfaite du fait que, tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, une plainte est justifi\u00e9e.\n[34] Ainsi, \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 la Commission a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 une plainte au Tribunal, ce dernier est alors assujetti \u00e0 un processus qui garantirait l\u2019audition d\u2019une plainte au m\u00e9rite.\n[35] Lorsqu\u2019une requ\u00eate pour rejet de plainte en raison d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Tribunal \u00e0 titre de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, le Tribunal doit utiliser son pouvoir de rejeter une plainte sur une telle requ\u00eate qu\u2019avec une tr\u00e8s grande prudence et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs (voir la jurisprudence soumise par la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard)[3].\nIV. La r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e I.L.W.U. au regard des r\u00e9ponses de la plaignante et de la Commission [36] Dans sa r\u00e9plique, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 l\u2019argumentation de la plaignante au regard de la r\u00e9ponse de cette derni\u00e8re sur sa requ\u00eate pour rejet.\n[37] Elle indique que la plaignante n\u2019aurait pas fourni d\u2019explications suffisantes relativement aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans ses plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9s.\n[38] Elle maintient que les all\u00e9gations contenues dans les plaintes de la plaignante ne reposent pas sur une preuve cr\u00e9dible et que ces all\u00e9gations demeureraient vagues malgr\u00e9 de nombreuses opportunit\u00e9s qui lui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes d\u2019\u00e9claircir ces all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[39] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9e maintient que la plaignante n\u2019aurait pas fourni d\u2019explications suffisantes en ce qui \u00e0 trait au fait que la plaignante aurait retenu ou modifi\u00e9 certains documents m\u00e9dicaux. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le comportement de la plaignante serait fourbe. De plus, la plaignante aurait commis des actes de fraude, lesquels auraient n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses de la plaignante sur son comportement.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante aurait induit en erreur et produit de fausses d\u00e9clarations dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[41] De m\u00eame, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la plaignante en ce qui a trait aux ordres de confidentialit\u00e9 du Tribunal relativement \u00e0 la divulgation de ses rapports m\u00e9dicaux, et \u00e9galement elle a r\u00e9pondu a la plaignante en ce qui a trait au caract\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement qui serait intervenu entre d\u2019autres intim\u00e9s et la Commission. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les discussions relatives \u00e0 ce r\u00e8glement sont non-pertinentes aux proc\u00e9dures actuellement pendantes dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[42] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s apparaissant dans la r\u00e9ponse de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a repris les dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2012] CF 445 (\u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien) (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada,)\u201d), dans lequel la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019Honorable juge Justice Mactavish avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu par la Cour d\u2019appel (2013 CAF 75).\n[43] Particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir les dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, cit\u00e9 ci-dessus dans lequel on a repris certaines dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cremasco et Harkin cit\u00e9s ci-dessus (voir par. 138, 139 et 140 de l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada).\n[44] Dans son argumentation en r\u00e9plique \u00e9galement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que la doctrine sur l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est applicable dans des cas o\u00f9 les faits ne sont pas discut\u00e9s et o\u00f9 la question sous-jacente est une pure question de droit, (par. 143 de l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada).\n[45] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier ne seraient pas contest\u00e9s ou qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de conflit dans la preuve et il y aurait donc un abus clair du processus actuellement en cours.\n[46] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e note que la plaignante n\u2019aurait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve \u00e9vidente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la plaignante au niveau du sexe et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la plaignante seraient trop vagues, non particularis\u00e9s et non support\u00e9s par les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s apparaissant dans les plaintes de la plaignante. \u00c9galement, elle maintient toujours que la plaignante aurait modifi\u00e9 et retenu certains documents et que par cela, elle aurait tent\u00e9 d\u2019induire le Tribunal en erreur.\n[47] En conclusion, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019apr\u00e8s six ans de proc\u00e9dures dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, la plaignante n\u2019aurait pas fourni de pr\u00e9cisions suffisantes et que cela constituerait un manquement \u00e0 la Loi. \u00c9galement, le d\u00e9roulement du dossier aurait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve suffisante pour supporter les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante et que, encore une fois, la plaignante aurait abus\u00e9 du processus pr\u00e9sentement en cours devant le Tribunal ainsi que des ressources des parties.\nV. Le droit [48] Le Tribunal a bien r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pour rejet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi que la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante et de la Commission, et la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tel que d\u00e9crit dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[49] Toutefois, apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 les dispositions l\u00e9gales pertinentes ainsi que la jurisprudence applicable, le Tribunal en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion de ne pas faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour rejet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et ce, pour les motifs exprim\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[50] Dans un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, soit l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a eu l\u2019occasion de traiter sp\u00e9cifiquement de la question du pouvoir du Tribunal de pouvoir trancher des questions pouvant entra\u00eener le rejet d\u2019une plainte sans proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction au fond compl\u00e8te permettant ainsi aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de faire entendre des t\u00e9moins.\n[51] Dans cette demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les principes sous-jacents applicables au sujet d\u2019une telle question.\n[52] Particuli\u00e8rement, elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la question transmise par la Commission, qui indiquerait que la Loi et la jurisprudence ne permettait pas au Tribunal de rejeter une plainte sans audition au fond que dans des circonstances limit\u00e9es, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en cas d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, ce qui inclurait les retards indus.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9vision des dispositions applicables, \u00e0 savoir les articles 48.9(1), 48.9(2), 49(1), 53(1), 50(1), 50(3)(c), 50(3)(e) de la Loi, dans son analyse, l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que les tribunaux administratifs sont \u00ab ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (voir para. 129 de la d\u00e9cision)\n[54] De m\u00eame, elle cite l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad c.

Nous traitons ici des pouvoirs d'un tribunal administratif \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de sa proc\u00e9dure. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ces tribunaux sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s ma\u00eetres chez eux. En l'absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, ils fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la condition de respecter les r\u00e8gles de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et, dans l'exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Il est donc clair que l'ajournement de leurs proc\u00e9dures rel\u00e8ve de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. \u00bb\n[55] Or, le Tribunal a \u00e9dict\u00e9 ses propres r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, et ce, en date du 3 mai 2004, ce qui implique une distinction avec l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci-dessus.\n[56] Toutefois, l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish pr\u00e9cise, en ce qui a trait au pouvoir du Tribunal pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi :\n[132] Ni la Loi ni les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal n\u2019emp\u00eachent non plus le Tribunal de statuer sur une telle requ\u00eate, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il donne aux parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter la preuve n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher la question et de pr\u00e9senter les observations. Le processus suivi par le Tribunal pour l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate doit aussi \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et le Tribunal doit respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[133] Les demanderesses soutiennent qu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli en jurisprudence que le Tribunal ne peut rejeter une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire que dans les cas o\u00f9 cette d\u00e9cision s\u2019impose de toute \u00e9vidence et uniquement si la poursuite de l\u2019instance \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure. (Nous soulignons)\n[57] En soulignant certains passages de l\u2019arr\u00eat Cremasco, arr\u00eat rendu sous la plume de l\u2019Honorable juge von Finckenstein, elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que dans cet arr\u00eat, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de tenir une enqu\u00eate en r\u00e8gle sur chaque plainte que lui renvoie la Commission.\n[58] De m\u00eame, l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish a cit\u00e9 certains passages des arr\u00eats Harkin et Terry Buffett c. les Forces canadiennes (Buffet), et plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019arr\u00eat Buffet :\n[140] Je comprends cependant que le gouvernement soit d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation, formul\u00e9e dans Buffet, selon laquelle la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au par. 39. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9claration. \u00bb (Nous soulignons)\n[141] La majorit\u00e9 des affaires en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont tr\u00e8s fortement tributaires de faits qui leur sont propres, lesquels sont vigoureusement contest\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, de nombreux cas mettent en jeu de graves questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. Bien que le Tribunal puisse recevoir des preuves par affidavit, plus les faits sont \u00e2prement contest\u00e9s et plus les enjeux li\u00e9s \u00e0 des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont importants, moins il convient de proc\u00e9der de la sorte. En pareils cas, il pourrait bien \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre l\u2019affaire au fond, ce qui implique l\u2019audition de t\u00e9moins en preuve principale et en contre-interrogatoire en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un membre du Tribunal. (Nous soulignons)\n[142] De m\u00eame, dans les cas o\u00f9 les questions de fait et de droit sont complexes et entrem\u00eal\u00e9es, il serait peut-\u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, pour des raisons d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, d\u2019attendre la tenue d\u2019une instruction compl\u00e8te avant de trancher la question pr\u00e9liminaire : voir Newfoundland (Human Rights Commission) c. Newfoundland (Department of Health), [1998] CanLII 18107 (NL CA), (1998), 164 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 251, 13 Admin. L.R. (3d) 142 au par. 21. \u00bb\n[59] Tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, le Tribunal \u00ab doit examiner les faits et les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans le but de garantir un processus d\u2019audience aussi informel et rapide que le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure le permet. \u00bb (voir par. 148 de la d\u00e9cision).\n[60] \u00c9galement, le Tribunal retient les propos de l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish au paragraphe 149 o\u00f9 elle indique ce qui suit :\n[149] Le processus retenu par le Tribunal doit cependant \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et il doit en toutes circonstances donner \u00e0 chacune des parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, [\u2026] de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb en ce qui concerne la question en litige.\n[61] Au regard de la jurisprudence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, le Tribunal aimerait \u00e9galement faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission) (Blencoe), [2000] A.C.S. no 43.\n[62] Dans cet arr\u00eat o\u00f9 une \u00e9tude de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure f\u00fbt effectu\u00e9e par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, on peut y lire ce qui suit :\n[120] Pour conclure qu\u2019il y a eu abus de proc\u00e9dure, la cour doit \u00eatre convaincue que [Traduction] \u00able pr\u00e9judice qui serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus administratif, si les proc\u00e9dures suivaient leur cours, exc\u00e9derait celui qui serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public dans l\u2019application de la loi, s\u2019il \u00e9tait mis fin \u00e0 ces proc\u00e9dures\u00bb (Brown et Evans, op. cit., \u00e0 la p. 9 68). Le juge L\u2019Heureux Dub\u00e9 affirme dans Power, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 616, que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence, il y a \u00ababus de proc\u00e9dure\u00bb lorsque la situation est \u00e0 ce point vici\u00e9e qu\u2019elle constitue l\u2019un des cas les plus manifestes. \u00c0 mon sens, cela s\u2019appliquerait autant \u00e0 l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re administrative. Pour reprendre les termes employ\u00e9s par le juge L\u2019Heureux Dub\u00e9, il y a abus de proc\u00e9dure lorsque les proc\u00e9dures sont \u00ab injustes au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb (p. 616). \u00ab Les cas de cette nature seront toutefois extr\u00eamement rares \u00bb (Power, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 616). Dans le contexte administratif, il peut y avoir abus de proc\u00e9dure lorsque la conduite est tout aussi oppressive. (Nous soulignons)\n[63] Dans l\u2019analyse du Tribunal au regard de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les parties en pr\u00e9sence ont eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter leur argumentation \u00e9crite.\n[64] En ce sens, les parties ont donc eu l\u2019occasion de s\u2019exprimer, et le Tribunal estime que les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale au regard de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es. Le Tribunal ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019une audition viva voce soit n\u00e9cessaire afin de d\u00e9cider du sort de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les raisons qui suivent.\n[65] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e9galement l\u2019expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9 de la plaignante ainsi que celui de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lequel comporte des faits qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de part et d\u2019autre, ainsi qu\u2019un amendement ayant trait afin d\u2019ajouter une plainte en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi en mati\u00e8re de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[66] Le Tribunal est \u00e0 m\u00eame de constater qu\u2019il existe une divergence profonde en ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ainsi que ceux de la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante eu \u00e9gard aux faits sous-jacents et ayant trait aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9es.\n[67] En ce sens, il n\u2019y a donc pas consensus entre les parties en ce qui a trait aux faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de part et d\u2019autre et je ne consid\u00e8re donc pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un des cas les plus clairs tel que le sugg\u00e8re la jurisprudence afin de rejeter une plainte sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire comme celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (voir les paragraphes 58 et 62 ci-dessus).\n[68] Sans vouloir restreindre le s\u00e9rieux des all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et des reproches qui apparaissent dans la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de conclure, selon les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qu\u2019il y aurait abus de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que d\u00e9cider du sort du pr\u00e9sent dossier \u00e0 partir de cette requ\u00eate sans donner l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de pr\u00e9senter de fa\u00e7on pleine et compl\u00e8te sa preuve en ce qui a trait aux plaintes qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9s, serait grandement pr\u00e9judiciable aux droits de la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[69] En effet, la requ\u00eate tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue une s\u00e9rie de faits qui sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre admis par la plaignante telle qu\u2019en fait foi la r\u00e9ponse de la plaignante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[70] Consid\u00e9rant ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, et tenant compte que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 lors de la d\u00e9cision la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, mentionn\u00e9e ci-avant, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019une audition au fond respecterait davantage les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale eu \u00e9gard aux plaintes formul\u00e9es par la plaignante et r\u00e9pondrait certainement mieux aux int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice.\n[71] De fait, tenant compte de la complexit\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les r\u00e9ponses des autres parties tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision et des expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions amend\u00e9s des parties, ces proc\u00e9dures indiquent au Tribunal qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit certainement de proc\u00e9dures qui seraient injustes \u00ab au point qu\u2019elles sont contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice \u00bb (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, para. 120).\n[72] A fortiori, je fais donc mien les commentaires de l\u2019Honorable juge Mactavish dans l\u2019arr\u00eat la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, o\u00f9 elle indique au paragraphe 141 que : \u00ab plus les faits sont \u00e2prement contest\u00e9s et plus les enjeux li\u00e9s \u00e0 des questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 sont importants, moins il convient de proc\u00e9der de la sorte. En pareils cas, il pourrait bien \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre la preuve au fond, ce qui implique l\u2019audition de t\u00e9moins en preuve principale et en contre-interrogatoire en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un membre du Tribunal. \u00bb\n[73] C\u2019est donc cette attitude que j\u2019entends adopter dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier et si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de ses plaintes \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des intim\u00e9es, cette preuve n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, selon l\u2019avis des intim\u00e9s, il appartiendra \u00e0 ceux-ci de pr\u00e9senter de nouveau leur requ\u00eate pour rejet ou en non-lieu, et \u00e0 ce moment, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera du sort de cette nouvelle requ\u00eate, mais dans un cadre qui aura tr\u00e8s certainement permis \u00e0 toutes les parties d\u2019\u00e9tablir de fa\u00e7on claire la preuve n\u00e9cessaire quant \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9tentions et cela, dans le respect des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelles et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[74] Cons\u00e9quemment j\u2019estime donc que la requ\u00eate pour rejet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e m\u2019appara\u00eet comme \u00e9tant pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e suivant toutes les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent dossier et elle est donc rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nVI. Conclusion [75] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-avant, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en rejet des plaintes de la plaignante est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 25 ao\u00fbt 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210 et T1627\/17310\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Leslie Palm c.

Contexte\n[1] Dans une requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2013, adress\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Tribunal), par voie de lettre, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante, Madame Marie Mache\u2011Rameau, demande au Tribunal de convoquer les parties afin de trancher une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation restreinte portant sur l\u2019application de protocoles d\u2019entente intervenue entre les parties, \u00e0 savoir la plaignante Madame Marie Mache-Rameau et l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international (ACDI), ainsi que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission), dans une entente sign\u00e9e le 29 novembre 2006.\n[2] Le Tribunal a tenu une audience sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le repr\u00e9sentant de Madame Marie Mache-Rameau en date du 8 ao\u00fbt 2014 au Tribunal \u00e0 Ottawa, mais en l\u2019absence de la Commission qui avait avis\u00e9 les parties en date du 10 juin 2014 qu\u2019elle ne soumettrait aucune soumission au regard de la requ\u00eate de la plaignante.\n[3] En date du 1er ao\u00fbt 2003, la plaignante, Madame Marie Mache-Rameau, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, plainte all\u00e9guant des pratiques discriminatoires en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail au sein de l\u2019ACDI , contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (Loi).\n[4] Tel que le pr\u00e9voit les proc\u00e9dures internes du Tribunal, le Tribunal a alors offert, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019accord de toutes les parties, que celles-ci tentent d\u2019en venir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement par la voie de la m\u00e9diation.\n[5] Ainsi, une premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation s\u2019est tenue entre les parties en date du 6 septembre 2006 devant un membre du Tribunal, et \u00e9galement une reprise de ladite s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 29 novembre 2006.\n[6] \u00c0 ce moment, un r\u00e8glement est intervenu lors du processus de m\u00e9diation et l\u2019instance dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e (voir lettre du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2006 par le gestionnaire des activit\u00e9s du greffe, Madame Gwen Zappa).\n[7] En date du 16 janvier 2007, une lettre de la Commission adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal f\u00fbt achemin\u00e9e au Tribunal afin d\u2019indiquer que le protocole d\u2019entente relatif au dossier ci-mentionn\u00e9 \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Commission en vertu de l\u2019article 48(1) de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[8] Il f\u00fbt alors requis par le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9mettre un avis de d\u00e9sistement dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier (voir lettre du 16 janvier 2007 de la Commission).\n[9] En date du 17 janvier 2007, le gestionnaire des activit\u00e9s du greffe du Tribunal, Monsieur Guy Gr\u00e9goire, faisant suite \u00e0 la lettre de Me Ikram Warsame, dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2007, le Tribunal a alors avis\u00e9 la conseill\u00e8re juridique de la Commission qu\u2019il arr\u00eatait les proc\u00e9dures et fermait son dossier dans cette affaire.\n[10] En date du 23 juin 2010, dans une lettre sign\u00e9e par Me Fran\u00e7ois Lumbu, avocat aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9posait une demande au Tribunal afin d\u2019avoir recours aux services d\u2019un des membres du Tribunal pour pr\u00e9sider une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[11] La demande en question faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que les parties ne s\u2019entendaient pas sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la clause 6 du protocole d\u2019entente.\n[12] Ladite lettre faisait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que par la clause 16 du protocole, les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es \u00e0 reprendre la m\u00e9diation afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige (voir lettre du 23 juin 2010, 3e paragraphe).\n[13] Tel qu\u2019en fait foi ladite lettre, la Commission ne demandait pas la r\u00e9ouverture du dossier du Tribunal. Toutefois, la Commission faisait \u00e9tat qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 discuter des modalit\u00e9s afin de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la prestation de services du Tribunal, \u00e0 titre gracieux ou non, afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la reprise de la m\u00e9diation dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[14] En date du 24 septembre 2010, par le biais de la directrice des activit\u00e9s du greffe du Tribunal, le Tribunal a alors r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 offrir le service requis. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le Tribunal fait \u00e9tat de la situation suivante :\nII. Les faits\nNous constatons que le dossier est ferm\u00e9 depuis le 17 janvier 2007, que le Membre (Membre Hadjis) qui avait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation ant\u00e9rieure dans le dossier, avait termin\u00e9 son mandat avec le Tribunal et que la Commission a approuv\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement dans cette affaire en vertu de l\u2019article 48 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne. Cons\u00e9quemment, nous jugeons qu\u2019il serait inappropri\u00e9 pour le Tribunal de participer \u00e0 cette m\u00e9diation consid\u00e9rant les circonstances nomm\u00e9es ci-dessus. (Voir lettre du 24 septembre 2010)\n[15] Additionnellement, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 24 octobre 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aux pr\u00e9sentes, soit l\u2019ACDI, a alors indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait toujours d\u2019accord \u00e0 avoir recours aux services d\u2019un m\u00e9diateur afin de d\u00e9finir l\u2019application de la clause 6 du protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties en date du 29 novembre 2006.\n[16] Lors de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, les parties ont admis qu\u2019une m\u00e9diation additionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue entre les parties, laquelle s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e infructueuse quant au r\u00e8glement de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la clause 6 en question.\n[17] En date du 29 mai 2012, une ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise par la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale par l\u2019entremise de l\u2019Honorable juge Yvon Pinard, laquelle se lit comme suit :\nLe r\u00e8glement entre Marie Mache-Rameau et l\u2019Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement internationale approuv\u00e9 par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en date du 29 novembre 2006 est assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[18] En date du 2 novembre 2012, une autre d\u00e9cision de la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable juge Richard Boivin relativement \u00e0 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la demanderesse, Madame Marie Mache-Rameau, en vertu de l\u2019article 466 des R\u00e8gles de la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de justification \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la pr\u00e9sidente de l\u2019ACDI sur la base qu\u2019elle aurait commis un outrage au tribunal.\n[19] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard il est utile de relire les dispositions du paragraphe 19 de ladite d\u00e9cision, laquelle se lit comme suit :\nApr\u00e8s avoir entendue les parties, la Cour ne peut que constater qu\u2019une diff\u00e9rence dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et la conduite des parties n\u2019est donc pas clairement \u00e9nonc\u00e9e. Dans ce cas de figure, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que \u00ab la conduite dict\u00e9e doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement dans l\u2019ordonnance \u00bb (Syndicat des travailleurs des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications c. Telus Mobilit\u00e9, 2004 CAF 59 au para 4, [2004] ACF no 273 (QL)), ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, la juge Hansen de cette Cour a rappel\u00e9 que \u00ab le fait que l\u2019ordonnance soit ambig\u00fce interdit une conclusion d\u2019outrage au tribunal [..] \u00bb et que la personne accus\u00e9e d\u2019outrage \u00ab a droit \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus favorable \u00bb (Sherman c. Canada (Agence des douanes et du revenu), 2006 CF 1121 aux para 29 et 14, [2006] ACF no 1413 (QL)).\n[20] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019Honorable juge Boivin a conclu que la plaignante n\u2019a pas fait la preuve prima facie qu\u2019il lui fallait, et la requ\u00eate de la plaignante f\u00fbt donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[21] Suite \u00e0 ce jugement, laplaignante a donc proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par la voie de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, soit une lettre de son procureur dat\u00e9e du 16 janvier 2013 demandant au Tribunal de se ressaisir du pr\u00e9sent dossier afin de trancher une question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation survenant dans le contexte de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 du protocole, qui n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 ni approuv\u00e9 par la Commission selon la plaignante.\n[22] Dans son argumentation \u00e9crite dat\u00e9e du 26 mai 2014 reprise \u00e0 l\u2019audience en date du 8 ao\u00fbt dernier, la plaignante soul\u00e8ve trois arguments principaux qui d\u00e9finiraient la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de reconsid\u00e9rer l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole d\u2019entente, et cela, suivant trois motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s :\nIII. Pr\u00e9tentions de la demanderesse\n1) Une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale existe dans les circonstances de ce dossier que le Tribunal est comp\u00e9tent afin de trancher la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ;\n2) La contestation de la comp\u00e9tence de ce Tribunal par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est injuste et in\u00e9quitable et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e ;\n3) Le protocole d\u2019entente et son approbation par la Commission d\u00e9clenche l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui n\u00e9cessite l\u2019intervention du Tribunal et qui d\u00e9clenche les pr\u00e9-conditions statutaires \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa comp\u00e9tence (voir para 1, argumentation \u00e9crite de la demanderesse).\n[23] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante indique que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas functus officio d\u2019une part, et dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9finir sa comp\u00e9tence selon la Loi afin de r\u00e9gler cette question.\n[24] Aussi, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante a repris les dispositions de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Berberi (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Detra Berberi, 2013 CF 921), d\u00e9cision prononc\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable juge O\u2019Keefe.\n[25] Dans cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9paration, ayant trait \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure du Tribunal, qui avait statu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait comp\u00e9tence pour tenir une audience sur la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une mesure de r\u00e9paration mentionn\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure.\n[26] Dans cette d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, prononc\u00e9e le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2011, (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et Detra Berberi, (2011 TCDP 23) (Berberi) par la Pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, soit Madame Shirish P. Chotalia, le procureur a alors attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur les passages du paragraphe 17 de ladite d\u00e9cision dans laquelle on peut lire ce qui suit :\nL\u2019application du principe de droit de functus officio aux tribunaux administratifs doit \u00eatre souple et ne doit pas \u00eatre formaliste (voir Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, [1989] 2 R.C.S. 848 au para 21).\n[27] S\u2019appuyant donc sur ce principe tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante indique qu\u2019il faut donc faire preuve de souplesse consid\u00e9rant que le Tribunal est un tribunal administratif.\n[28] \u00c9galement, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence avec la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision du 30 ao\u00fbt 2013 prononc\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable juge O\u2019Keefe, l\u2019arr\u00eat Berberi, le procureur de la plaignante a repris les dispositions contenues au paragraphe 21 de cette d\u00e9cision, dispositions qui ont trait \u00e0 la doctrine du functus officio qui doit assurer le principe du respect du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires et administratives.\n[29] En ce qui a trait au deuxi\u00e8me point, soit quelle est la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal envertu de la Loi de r\u00e9gler le pr\u00e9sent dossier, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une reprise de la m\u00e9diation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9e entre les parties en vertu de l\u2019article 16 de l\u2019entente qui pr\u00e9voyait une telle possibilit\u00e9, mais que la m\u00e9diation a \u00e9chou\u00e9, et que par la suite, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait refus\u00e9 de continuer ladite m\u00e9diation.\n[30] Dans son argumentation, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante indique qu\u2019il existe un pouvoir r\u00e9siduel du Tribunal d\u2019intervenir en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que l\u2019origine de ce pouvoir r\u00e9siduel se trouverait en partie dans une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dont j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ant\u00e9rieurement, soit d\u00e9cision du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2011, prononc\u00e9e par la Pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, soit Me Shirish P. Chotalia (2011 TCDP 23).\n[31] Finalement, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante soul\u00e8ve que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice justifierait l\u2019intervention du Tribunal consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de se faire, et que si le dossier ne trouvait pas d\u2019autres aboutissements que par le biais du Tribunal, la plaignante se trouverait sans recours, ce qui obligerait cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 recommencer \u00e0 z\u00e9ro tout le pr\u00e9sent processus, ce qui serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019esprit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Loi.\n[32] Dans son argumentation, le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e indique au Tribunal que la doctrine du functus officio n\u2019est pas applicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[33] D\u2019autre part, il indique que l\u2019entente sign\u00e9e entre les parties et dat\u00e9e du 29 novembre 2006 ne permet au Tribunal de se saisir de nouveau de ce dossier.\n[34] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions du paragraphe 11 de l\u2019entente, laquelle indique que le r\u00e8glement intervenu entre les parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties et sans reconnaissance de responsabilit\u00e9 ou de m\u00e9fait de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations faites dans la plainte de laplaignante.\n[35] De m\u00eame, il indique que le Tribunal n\u2019a \u00e9mis aucune d\u00e9cision en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la doctrine du functus officio, il constate que l\u2019absence de d\u00e9cision par le Tribunal ne permet donc pas l\u2019application de la doctrine du functus officio.\n[36] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a repris les dispositions du paragraphe 23 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell Canada v. CTEA (2003) 1 S.C.R. 884 (Bell), o\u00f9 on retrouve ce qui suit dans la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada :\nIV. Pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\nLa principale fonction du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est de nature juridictionnelle. Il tient des audiences formelles sur les plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission.\n[37] De m\u00eame, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal prononc\u00e9e le 29 juillet 2009 dans l\u2019affaire Pawal Kowalski et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Kowalski) et Ryder Integrated Logisistics (2009 TCDP 22), d\u00e9cision prononc\u00e9e par le Membre Athanasios D. Hadjis o\u00f9 l\u2019on retrouve ce qui suit au paragraphe 7 de ladite d\u00e9cision :\n7. Le Tribunal tire sa comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, en vertu duquel le Pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal doit instruire une plainte sur r\u00e9ception de la demande de la Commission (para 49 al.2). La port\u00e9e des instructions du Tribunal est ainsi port\u00e9e aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes qui accompagnent une telle demande.\n[38] Dans son argumentation, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de plainte pendante comme tel devant le Tribunal actuellement, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de r\u00e9paration \u00e0 r\u00e9interpr\u00e9ter comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Berberi de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\n[39] \u00c9galement, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a repris les dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Powell c. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (2008 TCDP 43), o\u00f9 le m\u00eame Membre Athanasios D. Hadjis a alors rejet\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e UPS afin de confirmer un pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 r\u00e8glement mettant fin \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal.\n[40] Dans cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision, tenant compte que l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne n\u2019avait pas encore commenc\u00e9 et tenant compte qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucune approbation de la part de la Commission sur un r\u00e8glement all\u00e9gu\u00e9, on ne pouvait donc pas affirmer que la plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[41] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, les parties ont confirm\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif de l\u2019entente sign\u00e9e entre elles puisqu\u2019elle f\u00fbt approuv\u00e9e par la Commission et de plus, l\u2019entente sign\u00e9e entre les parties dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier en date du 29 novembre 2006 a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir para. 15 de l\u2019entente).\n[42] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9cliner comp\u00e9tence relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la demanderesse.\n[43] Le Tribunal a bien r\u00e9vis\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sent dossier et a tenu compte des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9crites de m\u00eame que verbales des parties et en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il ne peut faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante afin de se ressaisir de nouveau du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[44] Cons\u00e9quemment, le Tribunal rejettera la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, et ce, pour les motifs ci-apr\u00e8s exprim\u00e9s.\n[45] Aux fins d\u2019une meilleure compr\u00e9hension de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, je r\u00e9f\u00e9rerai donc aux dispositions suivantes de la Loi, soit premi\u00e8rement :\nV. D\u00e9cision\nArt. 44. (3) Sur r\u00e9ception du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission :\na) peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer, en application de l\u2019article 49, un membre pour instruire la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport, si elle est convaincue :\n(i) d\u2019une part, que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9,\n(ii) d\u2019autre part, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de renvoyer la plainte en application du paragraphe (2) ni de la rejeter aux termes des alin\u00e9as 41c) \u00e0 e) ;\nb) rejette la plainte, si elle est convaincue :\n(i) soit que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9,\n(ii) soit que la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour l\u2019un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux alin\u00e9as 41c) \u00e0 e).\n[46] De m\u00eame, je cite les dispositions de l\u2019article 48 de la Loi en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement dans un dossier :\nArt.48 (1) Les parties qui conviennent d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, mais avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience d\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne, en pr\u00e9sentent les conditions \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission.\n(2) Dans le cas pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission certifie sa d\u00e9cision et la communique aux parties.\n(3) Le r\u00e8glement approuv\u00e9 par la Commission peut, par requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie ou de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de cette juridiction et \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 comme telle.\n[47] De m\u00eame, il est utile de relire les dispositions de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes :\n49. (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. Il peut, s\u2019il estime que la difficult\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire le justifie, d\u00e9signer trois membres, auxquels d\u00e8s lors les articles 50 \u00e0 58 s\u2019appliquent.\u00bb\n[48] Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de la plaignante, le Tribunal est effectivement functus officio dans ce dossier.\n[49] Ainsi, le Tribunal constate qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision pertinente n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante.\n[50] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, un r\u00e8glement est intervenu entre les parties et ledit r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par la Commission en date du 19 novembre 2006 qui en a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal. Subs\u00e9quemment, le Tribunal a ferm\u00e9 son dossier en date du 17 janvier 2007.\n[51] Suite au r\u00e8glement intervenu dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la fermeture subs\u00e9quente du dossier par le Tribunal, la Commission n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture du dossier comme tel devant le Tribunal (voir lettre du 23 juin 2010).\n[52] Tel que je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux pr\u00e9tentions du repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience du 8 ao\u00fbt dernier, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal origine des plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). De m\u00eame, je fais \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au passage que j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kowalski \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 qui fait lui-m\u00eame r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de plainte tel que l\u2019indique l\u2019article 49 de la Loi.\n[53] Au moment de la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate de la plaignante de m\u00eame que l\u2019audition des arguments des parties en date du 8 ao\u00fbt 2014, le Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait saisi d\u2019aucune plainte comme tel de la part de la Commission.\n[54] Ce seul argument m\u2019appara\u00eet comme \u00e9tant fatal quant \u00e0 la poursuite de la requ\u00eate de la plaignante afin de demander au Tribunal de se saisir de nouveau du dossier de la plaignante en vertu de la requ\u00eate qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en date du 16 janvier 2013.\n[55] Mais il y a plus. Le Tribunal note que dans le protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties en date du 29 novembre 2006, protocole d\u2019entente qui fut subs\u00e9quemment approuv\u00e9 par la Commission, aucune disposition de ladite entente n\u2019a maintenu quelque juridiction que ce soit du Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[56] Au contraire, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que les parties ont accept\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sent r\u00e8glement soit assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et ce, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi, m\u2019indique de toute \u00e9vidence que le Tribunal est devenu functus officio et que toute d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente appartient \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale afin de r\u00e9gler tout diff\u00e9rend relatif \u00e0 cette entente.\n[57] De m\u00eame, au paragraphe 16 du protocole d\u2019entente, les m\u00eames dispositions sont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9saccord donnant lieu \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre devant permettre de reprendre la m\u00e9diation afin de ren\u00e9gocier les points en litige. Ainsi, cette disposition indique que les parties ont convenu que toute modification sera soumise \u00e0 l\u2019approbation de la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 48 de la Loi et qu\u2019elle aura force ex\u00e9cutoire en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que le r\u00e8glement initial.\n[58] Je ne peux faire autrement que d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter cette disposition comme retirant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive toute comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal au regard de ce protocole d\u2019entente, lequel a identifi\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le nouveau forum l\u00e9gal applicable afin de r\u00e9gler toute m\u00e9sentente en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties.\n[59] Cons\u00e9quemment, tenant compte des dispositions de la lettre du Gestionnaire des activit\u00e9s du greffe en date du 17 janvier 2007 qui a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures et la fermeture du dossier du Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, et tenant compte \u00e9galement que le protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9 entre les parties en date du 29 novembre 2006, par ailleurs devenu une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, n\u2019indique aucune possibilit\u00e9 devant permettre au Tribunal de garder une comp\u00e9tence quelconque quant au r\u00e8glement de tout diff\u00e9rend en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ce protocole d\u2019entente.\n[60] Tenant compte des dispositions l\u00e9gales pertinentes, et plus particuli\u00e8rement les dispositions de l\u2019article 48 (1) et 49 de la Loi dont j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ant\u00e9rieurement, de l\u2019absence d\u2019une plaintependante devant le Tribunal, de m\u00eame de l\u2019absence de dispositions pertinentes dans le protocole d\u2019entente devant permettre au Tribunal de garder sa comp\u00e9tence, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que le Tribunal peut intervenir suivant la demande formul\u00e9e par la plaignante afin de r\u00e9gler tout diff\u00e9rend relativement \u00e0 l\u2019entente intervenue entre les parties en date du 29 novembre 2006.\n[61] Tel que je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, les parties ont d\u00e9sign\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant le forum l\u00e9gal appropri\u00e9 afin de r\u00e9gler tout autre diff\u00e9rend pouvant na\u00eetre du protocole d\u2019entente en faisant en sorte d\u2019indiquer dans le m\u00eame protocole d\u2019entente que ce dernier deviendrait une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et ce, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 48(3) de la Loi.\n[62] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019argument qu\u2019il est de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public que le Tribunal intervienne de nouveau, je constate que le procureur de la plaignante n\u2019a fourni aucune autorit\u00e9 pertinente afin d\u2019\u00e9tayer cet argument dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent dossier o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a pas de plainte dont le Tribunal aurait pu \u00eatre saisie, et cela, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de toutes les d\u00e9cisions dont il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son argumentation.\n[63] De plus, je constate que la Commission, normalement garante de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, n\u2019est pas intervenue dans les d\u00e9bats afin de faire valoir un tel argument.\n[64] \u00c0 mon point de vue, les dispositions l\u00e9gales dont j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ci-avant suffisent \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cet argument dans le cadre des intentions du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la juridiction du tribunal. De plus, je r\u00e9it\u00e8re et je fais mien le passage du jugement que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bell de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada au paragraphe 36 ci-dessus de m\u00eame que celui dans la d\u00e9cision Kowalski du Tribunal au paragraphe 37 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[65] Cons\u00e9quemment, et pour toutes les raisons ci-avant \u00e9nonc\u00e9es, aucune comp\u00e9tence ne peut \u00eatre reconnue devant permettre au Tribunal de pouvoir adjuger \u00e0 nouveau sur le protocole d\u2019entente sign\u00e9e entre les parties en date du 29 novembre 2006.\n[66] Pour toutes ces raisons, la requ\u00eate de la plaignante est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nVI.

Ulyatt\n[1] Le 12 janvier 2012, le plaignant, John Francis Zieger, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Osborne Trucking Ltd., dans laquelle il all\u00e9guait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, son employeur, selon l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] Jamais, tout au long de l\u2019instance, le plaignant ne fut repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat, et particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019audience qui a eu lieu \u00e0 Regina, en Saskatchewan, les 20 et 21 janvier 2014.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui agissait initialement pour son propre compte, a produit Wayne Osborne, le directeur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a par la suite retenu les services des avocats du cabinet McDougall Gauley LLP, qui ont en fait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, le plaignant n\u2019a pas produit les documents qu\u2019on lui avait dit de d\u00e9poser au Tribunal. Le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019affaire pendant un certain nombre d\u2019heures pour permettre au plaignant d\u2019aller chercher les documents requis chez lui.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, il est devenu \u00e9vident que le plaignant \u00e9tait vague et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant, Bobbie Zieger, qui devait initialement compara\u00eetre comme t\u00e9moin, plaiderait la cause du plaignant, m\u00e8nerait l\u2019interrogatoire principal du plaignant et le contre\u2011interrogatoire du t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et pr\u00e9senterait la plaidoirie. Le Tribunal a clairement avis\u00e9 le plaignant et Mme Zieger que, comme Mme Zieger jouerait un r\u00f4le si actif, elle ne pourrait pas t\u00e9moigner.\n[6] L\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 bri\u00e8vement ajourn\u00e9e et, \u00e0 leur retour, le plaignant et Mme Zieger ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant en sachant que Mme Zieger ne t\u00e9moignerait pas.\n[7] Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination du fait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience caus\u00e9e par une blessure subie alors qu\u2019il travaillait pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La d\u00e9ficience faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte d\u00e9coulait d\u2019une blessure des tissus mous au bas du dos.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est une petite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de camionnage situ\u00e9e \u00e0 White City, en Saskatchewan. Elle emploie plus ou moins cinq autres chauffeurs et exerce ses activit\u00e9s principalement en Saskatchewan, bien qu\u2019il lui arrive r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de faire des livraisons \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la province.\n[9] Le plaignant avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en octobre et en novembre 2010. Cependant, il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2011 en tant que chauffeur de camion titulaire d\u2019un permis de classe 1A.\n[10] Le principal contrat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu avec Sysco Foods Ltd., aux termes duquel l\u2019intim\u00e9e effectuait la livraison de produits alimentaires \u00e0 divers endroits \u00e0 Regina et \u00e0 Saskatoon, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres endroits en Saskatchewan et, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la province.\n[11] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 14 juin 2011, il s\u2019\u00e9tait fait une \u00ab entorse lombaire \u00bb alors qu\u2019il d\u00e9chargeait des palettes du camion. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait imm\u00e9diatement rendu \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00e0 Moose Jaw en raison de spasmes musculaires, o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9. Le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 des messages texte \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 14 juin 2011, dont un \u00e0 6 h 20 min 6 s, dans lequel il disait : [traduction] \u00ab Merci Wayne, mon dos est en compote. Je suis \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. \u00bb\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 un certain nombre de messages textes au plaignant, mais elle ne s\u2019est jamais renseign\u00e9e au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tat du plaignant. Cependant, le 14 juin 2011, \u00e0 7 h 48 min 50 s, le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une demande quant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 il se trouvait en disant : [traduction] \u00ab Je suis encore \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. \u00c7a prend une \u00e9ternit\u00e9. \u00bb\n[13] Le 14 juin 2011, \u00e0 19 h 34 min 29 s, le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 le message texte suivant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e : [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9sol\u00e9, le m\u00e9decin m\u2019a donn\u00e9 une piq\u00fbre et je dormais depuis ce temps\u2011l\u00e0. Il a dit que je m\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9chir\u00e9 un muscle et il m\u2019a mis au repos pour cinq jours. \u00bb\n[14] Le message texte suivant produit au Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e au plaignant le 20 juin 2011, \u00e0 16 h 35 min 39 s, et disait : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai besoin que tu travailles demain. Il faut que tu ailles \u00e0 Saskatoon pour y laisser une remorque puis que tu reviennes. \u00bb\n[15] La preuve m\u00e9dicale, soit le rapport initial du m\u00e9decin dat\u00e9 du 14 juin 2011 (pi\u00e8ce C\u20114), pr\u00e9cise que la blessure consiste dans des spasmes musculaires et comporte la mention suivante :\n[traduction] Les effets de la blessure peuvent avoir une incidence sur les activit\u00e9s pendant cinq jours.\n[16] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le retour au travail du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2011 a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e2ch\u00e9 par des d\u00e9saccords entre Wayne Osborne et lui. Le plaignant avait l\u2019impression que son employeur ne l\u2019avait pas appuy\u00e9 \u00e0 maints \u00e9gards, notamment en ne lui fournissant pas un assistant, en lui attribuant toujours des itin\u00e9raires con\u00e7us pour un seul chauffeur et en ne lui faisant pas exercer des fonctions modifi\u00e9es.\n[17] Il ressort \u00e9galement de la preuve que, \u00e0 une occasion, le plaignant a embauch\u00e9 son fils comme assistant et l\u2019a pay\u00e9 de sa poche. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a contredit cette all\u00e9gation en montrant qu\u2019elle avait en fait remis directement au plaignant le salaire de son fils.\n[18] Le plaignant a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que Sysco, la principale cliente de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, avait sabot\u00e9 ses chargements afin de le discr\u00e9diter et de lui causer d\u2019autres d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments.\n[19] La preuve ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir clairement quand le plaignant est retourn\u00e9 au travail. Dans sa plainte, le plaignant mentionne que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] le message texte [de l\u2019intim\u00e9e] me dit que je dois travailler le jeudi 16 juin 2011 \u00bb. Le message texte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve qui est dat\u00e9 du 20 juin 2011, \u00e0 16 h 35, est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en ces termes : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai besoin que tu travailles demain. Il faut que tu ailles \u00e0 Saskatoon pour y laisser [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[20] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail jusqu\u2019au 24 juin 2011; l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que le plaignant est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 17 juin 2011; dans son rapport m\u00e9dical (pi\u00e8ce C\u20114), Dr Sanderson mentionne que le plaignant lui a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 au travail le 23 juin 2011.\n[21] Wayne Osborne a tenu son propre registre des heures sur un calendrier, qui comportait les entr\u00e9es suivantes relativement au plaignant :\nMardi 14 juin 2011, [traduction] \u00ab John a fait la livraison et a dit qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9 au dos \u00bb;\nMercredi 15 juin 2011, [traduction] \u00ab John est absent \u00bb;\nJeudi 16 juin 2011, [traduction] \u00ab John est absent \u00bb;\nVendredi 17 juin 2011, \u00ab John ROC \u00bb;\nSamedi 18 juin 2011, pas d\u2019entr\u00e9e concernant John;\nDimanche 19 juin 2011, pas d\u2019entr\u00e9e concernant John;\nLundi 20 juin 2011, [traduction] \u00ab John ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail \u00bb;\nMardi 21 juin 2011, \u00ab John SKOON \u00bb;\nMercredi 22 juin 2011, \u00ab John ROC \u00bb;\nJeudi 23 juin 2011, \u00ab John ASS \u00bb;\nVendredi 24 juin 2011, [traduction] \u00ab John est absent et donne sa d\u00e9mission \u00bb.\n[22] Les probl\u00e8mes entre le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e se sont aggrav\u00e9s le 24 juin 2011, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a avis\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019il y avait un retard de paiement de la part de son client principal, Sysco, et que la paie pour le 24 juin 2011 serait report\u00e9e au lundi 27 juin 2011.\n[23] Le plaignant avait essay\u00e9 d\u2019encaisser son ch\u00e8que deux fois, et une s\u00e9rie de courriels \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre les parties atteste l\u2019existence de tensions accrues. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait envoy\u00e9 un message texte au plaignant pour lui dire qu\u2019il devrait encaisser son ch\u00e8que. Le 24 juin 2011, les choses sont arriv\u00e9es au point critique entre le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant. Le plaignant \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019on s\u2019en prenait \u00e0 lui parce qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait bless\u00e9, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au comble de l\u2019irritation envers le plaignant. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et celle\u2011ci soutient que le plaignant a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni des talons de ch\u00e8que pour la p\u00e9riode de paie du 18 juin 2011 au 1er juillet 2011 montrant qu\u2019un paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 pour trois jours. Cela co\u00efnciderait avec le paiement pour les 21, 22 et 23 juin dans le registre de l\u2019employeur.\n[25] Lors de l\u2019interrogatoire, en ce qui concerne la question de la connaissance que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait de la blessure du plaignant, Wayne Osborne a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Je ne savais pas qu\u2019il (John) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de travailler [\u2026] Il exer\u00e7ait toutes les fonctions de son poste. \u00bb\n[26] Le plaignant soutient que sa th\u00e8se selon laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis fin \u00e0 son emploi est \u00e9tay\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision rendue dans le cadre du Programme du travail de RHDCC, qui lui a accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9avis (pi\u00e8ce C-12). L\u2019intim\u00e9e rejette cet argument, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 attention \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure.\n[27] Tout au long de l\u2019audience, le plaignant a bien pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne demandait pas d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire ni d\u2019\u00eatre rembours\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9penses, et qu\u2019il voulait simplement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui pr\u00e9sente ses excuses et soit tenue responsable de ses actes. Le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui avait [traduction] \u00ab vol\u00e9 sa vie \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab personne ayant une vie sociale tr\u00e8s active \u00bb \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab personne handicap\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[28] Le plaignant r\u00e9clames des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats en vertu du paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP.\n[29] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 du droit sur les questions de la d\u00e9mission volontaire, de la r\u00e9pudiation du contrat de travail et du manquement au devoir d\u2019att\u00e9nuation.\n[30] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e0 se pencher sur la question du manquement au devoir d\u2019att\u00e9nuation, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire. Le plaignant a en fin de compte re\u00e7u des prestations de la Workers\u2019 Compensation Board.\n[31] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, vu le d\u00e9faut par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer le plaignant comme elle \u00e9tait tenue de la faire, et compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans le cadre du Programme du travail de RHDCC, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant.\n[32] La principale question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est la d\u00e9ficience et la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de cette d\u00e9ficience.\n[33] La question de la d\u00e9ficience est un crit\u00e8re cl\u00e9 que le plaignant doit remplir. Pour avoir gain de cause dans une plainte relevant de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte de discrimination. Dans la d\u00e9cision Chaudhary c. Smoother Movers, 2013 TCDP 15, le Tribunal a fait observer ce qui suit au paragraphe 33 :\n[33] Dans une affaire soumise au Tribunal, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie \u00ab [\u2026] est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur [du plaignant], en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de [l\u2019]intim\u00e9 \u00bb. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28)\n[\u2026]\n[35] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Dans les plaintes relevant de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a), le plaignant est tenu d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre un motif de distinction illicite et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur de refuser de l\u2019employer ou de continuer de l\u2019employer (voir Roopnarine c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 49). Cela dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la distinction soit le seul motif de la d\u00e9cision; il suffit qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un seul des facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision (voir Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 419 (C.A.F.) (QL), et Khiamal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, au paragraphe 61).\n[34] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le motif de distinction illicite est la d\u00e9ficience. La question de ce qui constitue une d\u00e9ficience a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Desormeaux c. Ottawa (Ville), 2005 CAF 311, au paragraphe 15, o\u00f9 la Cour a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nAinsi que l\u2019expliquait la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Granovsky c. Canada, [2000] 1 R.C.S. 703, au paragraphe 34, et dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ville de Montr\u00e9al, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 71, la d\u00e9ficience au sens juridique consiste en un handicap physique ou mental, qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d\u2019un handicap.\n[35] Pour avoir gain de cause, le plaignant doit tout d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue :\nqu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience;\nque sa d\u00e9ficience a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP.\n[36] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de sa d\u00e9ficience et que sa cessation d\u2019emploi \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en partie sur sa d\u00e9ficience ou que celle\u2011ci avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans sa cessation d\u2019emploi.\n[37] Le message texte que le plaignant a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 14 juin 2011 pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019il serait absent du travail pendant cinq jours. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par le rapport m\u00e9dical, dat\u00e9 du 14 juin 2011, selon lequel la blessure pourrait avoir une incidence sur les activit\u00e9s du plaignant pendant cinq jours.\n[38] Le registre des heures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les talons de ch\u00e8que r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 pour trois jours au cours de la p\u00e9riode de paie du 18 juin 2011 au 1er juillet 2011. Cela correspond effectivement au registre des heures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De plus, le rapport m\u00e9dical sign\u00e9 par Dr Sanderson pr\u00e9cise ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Il a pris quelques jours de cong\u00e9 et est retourn\u00e9 au travail le 23 juin. \u00bb\n[39] La preuve que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal est insuffisante. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas produit d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9e savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience le 24 juin 2011. En fait, la preuve d\u00e9montrait le contraire.\n[40] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est montr\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 Mme Zieger et au plaignant d\u2019aller au-del\u00e0 de ce qui serait normalement admis \u00e0 l\u2019audience et dans la plaidoirie.\n[41] Dans les circonstances, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que sa cessation d\u2019emploi \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur un motif discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\nORDONNANCE\n[42] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ordonne que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e.\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT1879\/10912\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nJohn Francis Zieger c.

Clayton Starblanket, est un d\u00e9tenu incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC), intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il souffre de multiples d\u00e9ficiences mentales. Il soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 des politiques ou des pratiques discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales et qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9pondait pas ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 leurs besoins. Sur ce fondement, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne le 19 mars 2010, affirmant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait commis un acte discriminatoire, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP), fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] Le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2011, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte devant le Tribunal pour instruction. La Commission participe \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est rendu coupable de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales.\n[3] Le 30 mai 2014, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate, demandant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on d\u00e9finisse la port\u00e9e de la plainte dont le Tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question litigieuse entre les parties. Elle demande \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 divulgue des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, le 12 septembre 2014, la Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale relatif au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu, \u00e0 titre de pi\u00e8ce additionnelle \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate.\n[5] La requ\u00eate de la Commission, et sa demande connexe d\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser une pi\u00e8ce additionnelle \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. Analyse [6] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission demande \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer certains documents relatifs \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 1998 et 2007 et \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 2013 et aujourd\u2019hui. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, elle demande au Tribunal d\u2019affirmer que la p\u00e9riode en cause dans la plainte est comprise entre novembre 1998 et aujourd\u2019hui : toute la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[7] En outre, la Commission demande la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\n\u2022 des documents additionnels dont il est fait mention dans des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s, mais qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s;\n\u2022 des versions non caviard\u00e9es de certains documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s;\n\u2022 des versions compl\u00e8tes et lisibles de certains documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s;\n\u2022 des renseignements statistiques sur les d\u00e9tenus plac\u00e9s en isolement pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause.\n[8] Pour finir, la Commission demande une ordonnance exigeant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il produise les versions \u00e9lectroniques de tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s.\n[9] Le plaignant appuie la requ\u00eate en divulgation de la Commission et adopte tous les arguments que celle\u2011ci a avanc\u00e9s.\nA. La port\u00e9e de la plainte et les documents relatifs aux p\u00e9riodes comprises entre 1998 et 2007 et entre 2013 et aujourd\u2019hui [10] Selon la Commission, le plaignant purge actuellement sa seconde peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il a purg\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re entre novembre 1998 et juin 2002. C\u2019est en juillet 2003 qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 purger sa peine actuelle, toujours en cours. La Commission soutient que, bien que la plainte tourne essentiellement autour d\u2019all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010, un examen des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent r\u00e9v\u00e8le que les probl\u00e8mes faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte sont \u00e9galement survenus pendant la premi\u00e8re incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, et qu\u2019ils continuent jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission, les incidents suivants se sont \u00e9galement produits au cours de la premi\u00e8re incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant : le plaignant s\u2019est automutil\u00e9 et a tent\u00e9 de se suicider; l\u2019intim\u00e9 a eu recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant; le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet de transf\u00e8rements entre des p\u00e9nitenciers et des centres de traitement.\n[11] La Commission est \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que les faits relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte soul\u00e8vent des questions actuelles de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, dont sont victimes les d\u00e9tenus souffrant de d\u00e9ficiences mentales. Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique de la Commission portent sur les points suivants : 1) le placement ad\u00e9quat des d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d. des centres de traitement\/psychiatriques par opposition aux p\u00e9nitenciers); 2) la mise en isolement des d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales; 3) le traitement des d\u00e9tenus ayant des comportements autodestructeurs chroniques et la prise de mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 leur endroit; 4) l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des programmes \u00e0 l\u2019intention des d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales.\n[12] Selon la Commission, le fait de restreindre l\u2019examen de la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode de trois mois de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2010 couperait artificiellement cet examen de celui des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 des faits survenus avant et apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode. Par cons\u00e9quent, en vue d\u2019entendre et d\u2019appr\u00e9cier pleinement la preuve relative aux all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte, tant sur le plan individuel que syst\u00e9mique, la Commission demande au Tribunal d\u2019affirmer que la p\u00e9riode en cause est la p\u00e9riode comprise entre novembre 1998 et aujourd\u2019hui. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 des documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant pendant la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 2007 et la fin de 2012, la Commission demande \u00e9galement qu\u2019il divulgue les renseignements suivants, pour les p\u00e9riodes comprises entre 1998 et 2007 et entre 2013 et aujourd\u2019hui :\n(1) des dossiers permettant de savoir dans quelles institutions le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du SCC, et de quels transf\u00e8rements il a fait l\u2019objet au sein de ces institutions et entre celles\u2011ci.\n(2) des dossiers permettant de cerner les types et les conditions de l\u2019isolement dans lequel le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au cours de ses p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du SCC (notamment en ce qui concerne le fait d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un programme et de le mener \u00e0 bien dans le contexte du plan correctionnel du plaignant, et en ce qui a trait \u00e0 chaque fois o\u00f9 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en isolement formel et en isolement, en pr\u00e9cisant les p\u00e9riodes exactes de ces mises en isolement).\n(3) des dossiers faisant \u00e9tat de chaque cas consign\u00e9 d\u2019automutilation ou de tentative de suicide, en plus des rapports psychologiques connexes.\n[13] La Commission affirme qu\u2019il est possible pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir ces renseignements dans un format simplifi\u00e9 en passant par son Syst\u00e8me de gestion des d\u00e9linquants (le SGD). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser une pi\u00e8ce additionnelle dans le contexte de sa requ\u00eate : un rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico\u2011l\u00e9gale relative au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu. Selon la Commission, ce rapport contient une d\u00e9finition utile qui pourrait aider le Tribunal et les parties \u00e0 mieux comprendre ce qu\u2019est le SGD et la pertinence de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de divulgation.\n[14] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni au plaignant les renseignements du SGD relatifs \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 se prononcer sur les faits en litige entre les parties, et ceux\u2011ci doivent \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions tant de la Commission que du plaignant ne contiennent aucun fait ayant trait \u00e0 un incident pr\u00e9cis qui serait survenu avant 2009. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que, si la plainte a maintenant une port\u00e9e telle qu\u2019elle comprend des incidents ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2009, il en subirait un pr\u00e9judice parce qu\u2019il ne conna\u00eetrait pas la preuve pesant contre lui. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il subirait \u00e9galement un pr\u00e9judice en raison du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 (souvenirs flous, d\u00e9tails oubli\u00e9s et t\u00e9moins non disponibles).\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement valoir que, avant 2007, le plaignant se trouvait dans d\u2019autres institutions, dans d\u2019autres provinces. Par cons\u00e9quent, il devrait retrouver des t\u00e9moins dans ces autres provinces, ce qui, selon lui, compliquerait les choses ind\u00fbment et inutilement. Il ajoute qu\u2019il se pourrait que le Tribunal et les t\u00e9moins souhaitent voir les installations, et, finalement, qu\u2019il lui faudrait divulguer des dizaines de milliers de documents additionnels. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ajouteront un nombre consid\u00e9rable de difficult\u00e9s d\u2019ordre pratique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[16] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que le fait d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de la plainte \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle comprenne des ann\u00e9es qui n\u2019\u00e9taient vis\u00e9es ni par la plainte originale, ni par l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, ni par le renvoi devant le Tribunal, contrevient \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9solution des plaintes pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP, notamment au traitement exp\u00e9ditif des plaintes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute qu\u2019on ne devrait pas traiter les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne comme on m\u00e8nerait une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[17] Pour finir, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de la Commission visant \u00e0 d\u00e9poser le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ce document et pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas admissible dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Il est d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucune question ne se pose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qu\u2019est le SGD. M\u00eame si des questions se posaient, le site Web de l\u2019intim\u00e9 offre une explication de ce dont il s\u2019agit. Au lieu de cela, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que la Commission tente de d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 un d\u00e9tenu qui s\u2019est suicid\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il se trouvait sous la garde de l\u2019intim\u00e9 afin de le faire mal para\u00eetre. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 consid\u00e8re que le rapport, en l\u2019absence de tout fait ou contexte, est hautement pr\u00e9judiciable et qu\u2019il soul\u00e8ve des questions en mati\u00e8re de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il y est question d\u2019un autre d\u00e9tenu, et non du plaignant.\n(i) La demande de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale [18] Dans sa demande d\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale dat\u00e9e du 12 septembre 2014, la Commission a en fait envoy\u00e9 le document au Tribunal. Dans un courriel subs\u00e9quent, dat\u00e9 du 25 septembre 2014, la Commission a expliqu\u00e9 que le rapport ne devait \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019aux parties et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses excuses pour cette erreur consistant \u00e0 l\u2019avoir \u00e9galement envoy\u00e9 au Tribunal. Toutefois, \u00e0 ce stade, le Tribunal avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu le rapport. En dehors de la partie de ce rapport qui traite du SGD, le contenu du rapport n\u2019est pas par ailleurs pertinent dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 du fait que la mani\u00e8re dont le rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciable. Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de la Commission de d\u00e9poser le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\n[19] Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n(ii) La port\u00e9e de la plainte [20] La Commission se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate que le Tribunal a rendue dans Desmarais c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2014 TCDP 5 (Desmarais), pour affirmer que la plainte devrait porter sur la p\u00e9riode allant de 1998 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. Dans l\u2019affaire Desmarais, on a \u00e9galement formul\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re de traiter les d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales. M. Desmarais y all\u00e8gue que des actes discriminatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, de fa\u00e7on continue, au cours de deux peines f\u00e9d\u00e9rales purg\u00e9es entre 2001 et 2003 et entre 2005 et 2007. En outre, M. Desmarais y all\u00e8gue que la discrimination dont il a fait l\u2019objet r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019existence de questions syst\u00e9miques. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en radiation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019instruction portant sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 limiter leur port\u00e9e aux p\u00e9riodes pendant lesquelles M. Desmarais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir entre 2001 et 2003 et entre 2004 et 2006.\n[21] Le Tribunal a conclu que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ne pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9tablies qu\u2019une fois que les parties auraient eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter, lors d\u2019une audience, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 cette affaire. Il n\u2019y avait aucune raison de rejeter ces all\u00e9gations sur un fondement pr\u00e9liminaire. En outre, le Tribunal n\u2019a vu aucune raison de restreindre la port\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations syst\u00e9miques aux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. En se fondant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (Moore), de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 comme motif qu\u2019\u00ab une preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique commise par le SCC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, pendant les p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de M. Desmarais et en dehors de ces p\u00e9riodes, [pouvait] appuyer la plainte individuelle de discrimination du plaignant \u00bb (Desmarais, au paragraphe 102).\n[22] La question \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal a d\u00fb r\u00e9pondre dans la d\u00e9cision Desmarais est similaire \u00e0 la question qui se pose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, je ne vois pas de raison de restreindre la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instruction \u00e0 la seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant. Bien que tous les faits pertinents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte et dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions tant du plaignant que de la Commission ont trait \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui sont survenus pendant la seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration, en 2009-2010, il est fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue par le plaignant lors de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 titre de contexte pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la mani\u00e8re dont on l\u2019a trait\u00e9 pendant cette seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. En fait, le plaignant et la Commission laissent entendre qu\u2019on a trait\u00e9 le plaignant exactement de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re pendant ses premi\u00e8re et seconde p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\n[23] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ne vise pas \u00e0 modifier la plainte ou \u00e0 associer de nouvelles cons\u00e9quences ou responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 des faits qui sont survenus pendant la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant. Je comprends plut\u00f4t que la requ\u00eate de la Commission a pour objet de demander au Tribunal de confirmer qu\u2019il sera tenu compte des faits ant\u00e9rieurs et post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode 2009-2010 pour \u00e9tablir quelles cons\u00e9quences, s\u2019il y en a, devraient \u00eatre associ\u00e9es aux faits constituant le sujet de la plainte (2009-2010).\n[24] Selon moi, le fait de tenir compte de ce qui est ant\u00e9rieur et post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode 2009\u20112010 pour \u00e9tablir si la pr\u00e9sente plainte est fond\u00e9e se justifie par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, pour le Tribunal, de comprendre pleinement le contexte dans lequel le plaignant est entr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me correctionnel et comment il y a \u00e9volu\u00e9. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9crit le plaignant comme un d\u00e9linquant dangereux ayant des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de comportements violents (voir l\u2019Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, dat\u00e9 du 19 septembre 2012, aux paragraphes 3 et 23). Le fait de se concentrer sur la p\u00e9riode 2009-2010 et de fonder une audience uniquement sur cette p\u00e9riode aurait pour effet de ne pas tenir compte d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de contexte potentiellement pertinents pour toutes les parties. \u00c0 la fin, cela pourrait \u00e9galement mener \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision injuste, que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e ou non. Le plaignant est entr\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me correctionnel en 1998 et il y est retourn\u00e9 en 2003, et il s\u2019y trouve encore \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle; il est certain que ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents criminels et m\u00e9dicaux sont dans leur ensemble d\u2019une importance primordiale en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019il convient de les consid\u00e9rer. Le fait de ne se concentrer que sur une partie de l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant manquerait de contexte et pourrait conduire \u00e0 des conclusions inexactes. Je note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a avanc\u00e9 un argument semblable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du contexte et des faits relatifs \u00e0 la demande de la Commission de pr\u00e9senter le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate publique m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gale.\n[25] Je distingue \u00e9galement la pr\u00e9sente instance des agissements d\u2019un plaignant qui d\u00e9poserait une plainte et y rajouterait constamment de nouvelles all\u00e9gations, ce qui ferait de cette plainte une cible en mouvement et ce qui, par cons\u00e9quent, ferait en sorte qu\u2019il serait impossible \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la preuve pesant contre lui. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; les all\u00e9gations, y compris les articles de la LCDP invoqu\u00e9s et les motifs de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, demeurent inchang\u00e9es. La demande d\u2019\u00e9largissement de la port\u00e9e de la plainte de la Commission n\u2019introduit pas \u00ab fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte \u00bb (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313; Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1; Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 61849 (TCDP)).\n[26] Dans ses observations relatives \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la Commission fait valoir que c\u2019est au cours de la premi\u00e8re incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant (1998-2002) qu\u2019on a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019automutilation et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait suicidaire (voir les Observations \u00e9crites de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la divulgation et de la plainte), dat\u00e9es du 29 mai 2014, au paragraphe 8). La Commission all\u00e8gue que, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, le plaignant s\u2019est automutil\u00e9 \u00e0 25 reprises et a commis quatre tentatives de suicide.\n[27] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques, m\u00e9dicaux et criminels du plaignant, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration, et ce, afin de mettre les gestes que le plaignant a pos\u00e9s pendant sa seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration en contexte. Il y a aussi reproduit des extraits de rapports de profil criminel datant d\u2019aussi loin que 1993 afin de situer le contexte. De plus, les passages suivants de cet expos\u00e9 sont particuli\u00e8rement pertinents :\n[traduction]\n3. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une plainte d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu ayant de longs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de violence, de nombreuses d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 au criminel ainsi que des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de grave automutilation. Le comportement instable du plaignant pose de s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes au SCC pour ce qui est de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement raisonnable sans s\u2019exposer \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s excessives.\n4. Le SCC nie toute discrimination et dit que les menaces et les actes de violence constants de M. Starblanket pr\u00e9sentent un risque s\u00e9rieux pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du personnel, d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus et de M. Starblanket lui-m\u00eame. Des actes de violence et de graves pr\u00e9judices ne peuvent \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9s en aucune circonstance.\n15. [...] En d\u2019autres termes, m\u00eame si la plainte porte sur la p\u00e9riode de 2009-2010, il est possible d\u2019observer le m\u00eame comportement dans les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures.\n23. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents criminels de M. Starblanket sont tr\u00e8s longs et pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n30. En 2007 cependant, apr\u00e8s sept ann\u00e9es dans les Prairies, son comportement s\u2019est aggrav\u00e9 au point o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019un transf\u00e8rement involontaire \u00e0 l\u2019Unit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de d\u00e9tention (l\u2019USD) de Qu\u00e9bec, qui est class\u00e9e comme un \u00e9tablissement \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 renforc\u00e9e.\n(Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, 19 septembre 2012, aux paragraphes 3, 4, 15, 23 et 30.)\n[28] La plainte initiale de m\u00eame que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant et de la Commission font \u00e9galement \u00e9tat du d\u00e9faut syst\u00e9mique constant de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des d\u00e9tenus souffrant de d\u00e9ficiences, et le plaignant en fait partie. Ce dernier et la Commission demandent que l\u2019on prenne des mesures de redressement en vue de contrer cette discrimination syst\u00e9mique all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. Pour cela, il est n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal sache non seulement quelle est la cause de cette discrimination, mais aussi si cette cause existe toujours. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je signale \u00e9galement ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Desmarais : \u00ab l\u2019affaire Desmarais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas aussi appropri\u00e9e et aussi justifi\u00e9e que l\u2019affaire Starblanket, qui est aussi actuellement devant le Tribunal, aux fins d\u2019une analyse de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique touchant les d\u00e9tenus qui sont atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle \u00bb (Desmarais, au paragraphe 110).\n[29] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver qu\u2019il existe de longue date une discrimination syst\u00e9mique all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, ou que cette derni\u00e8re est ancr\u00e9e dans l\u2019histoire, pour que le plaignant ou la Commission puissent plaider leur cause, ces renseignements peuvent situer le contexte et permettre de mieux saisir la situation dans laquelle se trouve actuellement le plaignant. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, c\u2019est au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il appartient de d\u00e9cider comment ils veulent pr\u00e9senter leur cause, et il n\u2019y a pas lieu selon moi, \u00e0 ce stade\u2011ci, de limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte \u00e0 la seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\n[30] De ce fait, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les observations que les parties ont formul\u00e9es jusqu\u2019ici ainsi que la nature de la plainte, je suis d\u2019avis que la port\u00e9e de la plainte peut englober des arguments et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve portant sur la totalit\u00e9 de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 : de 1998 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. Cela n\u2019en change ou n\u2019en \u00e9largit pas la port\u00e9e, pas plus que cela ne met le Tribunal dans la position d\u2019une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Cela confirme plut\u00f4t la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a chaque partie de pr\u00e9senter sa cause de mani\u00e8re pleine et enti\u00e8re. Le fait d\u2019exclure la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de la port\u00e9e de la plainte ou de faire abstraction de la situation actuelle du plaignant pourrait se solder par un processus de recherche des faits artificiel. Il y aurait un risque que l\u2019on fasse d\u2019abstraction d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019affaire en apparence importants, comme l\u2019a fait valoir plus t\u00f4t la Commission. Ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t \u00e9galement, il semble que des aspects de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant soient \u00e9galement importants pour la cause de l\u2019intim\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, par souci de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je crois qu\u2019il est important que le Tribunal comprenne bien les circonstances entourant l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant dans son ensemble.\n(iii) La divulgation de documents datant de 1998 \u00e0 2007 et de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui [31] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, je conclus que les renseignements que la Commission a demand\u00e9s pour les p\u00e9riodes de 1998 \u00e0 2007 et de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la port\u00e9e de la plainte. La demande de la Commission au sujet de documents indiquant les \u00e9tablissements dans lesquels le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 pendant toutes ses p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et les transf\u00e8rements dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet au sein de ces \u00e9tablissements et entre ceux-ci, de m\u00eame que les documents indiquant les types et les conditions de d\u00e9tention pendant toutes les p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont directement li\u00e9s aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, et cela inclut l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration appropri\u00e9e des d\u00e9tenus souffrant d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale et le fait de les placer en isolement. De plus, ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, tant le plaignant que la Commission sollicitent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques. De ce fait, les documents que la Commission souhaite obtenir sont assimilables \u00e0 une demande raisonnable et l\u00e9gitime de renseignements au sujet des questions en litige et des mesures de redressement qui s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit donc divulguer les documents institutionnels et d\u2019isolement du plaignant que demande la Commission.\n[32] Les documents faisant \u00e9tat de chaque incident d\u2019automutilation ou de tentative de suicide qui figure au dossier, en plus des rapports psychologiques connexes, pour la p\u00e9riode de 1998 \u00e0 2007 ainsi que de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, sont eux aussi potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les observations de la Commission sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ont trait au fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que c\u2019est lors de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant que l\u2019on a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que celui-ci avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019automutilation et des tendances suicidaires. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux et psychologiques du plaignant, surtout pendant sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration, afin de situer le contexte et les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents des gestes qu\u2019il a pos\u00e9s pendant la seconde p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 mon avis, les documents faisant \u00e9tat de chaque incident d\u2019automutilation ou de tentative de suicide qui figure au dossier, en plus des rapports psychologiques connexes, pour la p\u00e9riode de 1998 \u00e0 2007 ainsi que de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, sont potentiellement pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[33] Dans la mesure du possible, les documents datant de 1998 \u00e0 2007 et de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui devraient \u00eatre fournis par l\u2019entremise du SGD de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer ces documents avant le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2014.\n(iv) Le pr\u00e9judice possible pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 [34] Aux dires de l\u2019intim\u00e9, s\u2019il faut maintenant que la port\u00e9e de la plainte englobe les incidents ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2009, il en subira un pr\u00e9judice, car il ignore la preuve qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9futer. Il soutient que le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis les faits en question (souvenirs flous, d\u00e9tails oubli\u00e9s et t\u00e9moins non disponibles) lui serait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[35] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, jusqu\u2019ici la plainte porte principalement sur la p\u00e9riode 2009-2010 de la seconde incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque un argument de pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 propos de la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Cependant, comme il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus t\u00f4t, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate n\u2019a pas pour but de modifier la plainte ou ne comporte pas de cons\u00e9quences ou de responsabilit\u00e9s nouvelles se rapportant \u00e0 des faits survenus lors de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant. Mon interpr\u00e9tation de la requ\u00eate de la Commission est que cette derni\u00e8re demande au Tribunal de confirmer que l\u2019on prendra en consid\u00e9ration des faits survenus avant et apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de 2009-2010 en vue de d\u00e9terminer quelles sont les cons\u00e9quences, s\u2019il y en a, qui devraient d\u00e9couler des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui constituent l\u2019objet de la plainte (2009-2010). Je crois donc que le pr\u00e9judice possible dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat peut \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s, dans lesquels le plaignant et la Commission devraient exposer en d\u00e9tail les arguments qu\u2019ils entendent soumettre au Tribunal, y compris les aspects de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant qui seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cela permettra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9futer et d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre convenablement.\n[36] Par ailleurs, c\u2019est apr\u00e8s que l\u2019on aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9es et, plus encore, une fois que l\u2019on pr\u00e9sentera l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019audience que l\u2019on appr\u00e9ciera le mieux l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019indisponibilit\u00e9 de t\u00e9moins et du souvenir qu\u2019ils ont de certains \u00e9v\u00e8nements, de m\u00eame que les autres difficult\u00e9s pratiques possibles que cela suscite sur le plan de la port\u00e9e de la plainte. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le Tribunal et l\u2019intim\u00e9 seront mieux plac\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer si des t\u00e9moins sont bel et bien disponibles et, dans l\u2019affirmative, le souvenir qu\u2019ils ont de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Cette d\u00e9marche est semblable \u00e0 celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans l\u2019affaire Uzoaba c. Canada (Service correctionnel), 1994 CanLII 1636 (TCDP), aux pages 4 \u00e0 7, o\u00f9 le Tribunal a eu affaire \u00e0 une situation analogue \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente.\n[37] Les autres difficult\u00e9s pratiques possibles, comme la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner des installations et la quantit\u00e9 de documents \u00e0 communiquer, sont conjecturales \u00e0 ce stade-ci. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je signale que la demande de divulgation de la Commission se limitait \u00e0 des cat\u00e9gories pr\u00e9cises de documents (voir, par exemple, le paragraphe 12) et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de la nature d\u2019une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette. Cependant, s\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente bel et bien de telles difficult\u00e9s pratiques, j\u2019encourage l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire \u00e9tat d\u00e8s que possible.\n[38] Je signale aussi qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal selon laquelle la port\u00e9e de la plainte peut englober des arguments et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant, de m\u00eame que la divulgation connexe de renseignements \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, cela ne veut pas forc\u00e9ment dire que ces renseignements sont admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019audience ou ne d\u00e9note pas quelle importance, s\u2019il y en a, ils auront pour une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. C\u2019est pendant ou apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience que l\u2019on r\u00e8gle le mieux ces questions.\n[39] Je crois donc qu\u2019il est possible de r\u00e9gler la question du pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut subir en d\u00e9posant des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s et en appr\u00e9ciant correctement la disponibilit\u00e9, l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019importance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Un calendrier relatif aux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s sera fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de la divulgation des documents additionnels qui est ordonn\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nB. Les documents additionnels mentionn\u00e9s dans des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s [40] La Commission demande que l\u2019on divulgue 75 \u00e9l\u00e9ments additionnels, dont l\u2019existence a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e lors d\u2019un examen de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s. Parmi les documents demand\u00e9s, 33 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments concernent des documents pr\u00e9cis, tandis que les autres demandent des d\u00e9tails li\u00e9s \u00e0 un incident ou \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode par voie de documentation.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9 indique que, dans le cas d\u2019un grand nombre des documents, les demandes exc\u00e8dent la fourchette de dates applicable, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses observations sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Pour ce qui est des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments demandant des d\u00e9tails li\u00e9s \u00e0 un incident ou \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il est tenu de communiquer des documents, et non des d\u00e9tails. De plus, ajoute-t-il, la meilleure fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux questions relatives \u00e0 des d\u00e9tails additionnels est d\u2019interroger des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Pour les autres documents que demande la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9 convient de chercher des documents additionnels ou de citer des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[42] Comme j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019il y avait lieu de divulguer les documents datant de 1998 \u00e0 2007 et de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, tout document additionnel se rapportant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande doit maintenant \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9. Pour ce qui est des documents restants, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a convenu de chercher des documents additionnels ou de citer des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s. Il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande de documents additionnels avant le 2 novembre 2014.\nC. Les versions non caviard\u00e9es de certains documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s [43] La Commission se pr\u00e9occupe de passages caviard\u00e9s dans certains documents o\u00f9 l\u2019on fait \u00e9tat de lieux (dans des \u00e9tablissements, des \u00e9tablissements particuliers en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et m\u00eame des palais de justice), de noms de membres du personnel et d\u2019incidents mettant en cause des membres du personnel, des questions de nature psychologique et d\u2019autres sujets qui se situent au c\u0153ur des questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La Commission ajoute que cela est sp\u00e9cialement le cas lorsque les copies de documents caviard\u00e9s ne sont pas elles aussi caviard\u00e9es ou le sont diff\u00e9remment, ce qui d\u00e9note donc des incoh\u00e9rences dans le recours \u00e0 cette pratique. Elle reconna\u00eet toutefois que les noms d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus, d\u2019indicateurs ou d\u2019autres personnes ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et qu\u2019ils pourraient donc rester caviard\u00e9s. La Commission demande donc que l\u2019on divulgue les versions non caviard\u00e9es de certains documents, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des noms d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus.\n[44] L\u2019intim\u00e9 scinde en quatre cat\u00e9gories sa r\u00e9ponse aux documents que demande la Commission : 1) les documents peu pertinents sur d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mal class\u00e9s dans les dossiers du plaignant; 2) les copies de documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a caviard\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment; 3) les documents pour lesquels il acceptera de supprimer ou de r\u00e9duire les caviardages; 4) les documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels il invoque l\u2019immunit\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[45] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie, l\u2019intim\u00e9 explique qu\u2019il a divulgu\u00e9 des documents qui, par erreur, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mal class\u00e9s dans les dossiers du plaignant, mais qui ne sont pas pertinents, car ils concernent d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la seule raison pour laquelle ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits est qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de les examiner avant de les inscrire en raison de leur grand nombre et du d\u00e9lai de divulgation. Il soutient avoir simplement \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 chacun des documents contenus dans les dossiers du plaignant et avoir ensuite, avant de produire les documents en question, proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 leur examen et caviard\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de caviarder. Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de caviarder simplement le document tout entier afin de ne pas perturber la num\u00e9rotation des documents en le retirant de la liste.\n[46] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents caviard\u00e9s se compose de copies de documents, mais comportant moins de caviardages, sinon aucun. Il explique que ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s par des employ\u00e9s distincts et que, en d\u00e9pit des efforts d\u2019uniformisation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, les caviardages effectu\u00e9s dans certaine copies de documents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas les m\u00eames. Il soutient que la Commission peut simplement se fonder sur la version qui comporte moins de caviardages, sinon aucun.\n[47] Pour ce qui est de la troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents caviard\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 convient de supprimer ou de r\u00e9duire consid\u00e9rablement les caviardages. Il esp\u00e8re que la Commission jugera ces changements satisfaisants; sinon, il sera peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 son avis de produire d\u2019autres observations.\n[48] Du point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9, c\u2019est la quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents qui est mati\u00e8re \u00e0 controverse et dans laquelle il est peu dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 supprimer des caviardages. Il soutient que ces sept documents traitent de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019indicateurs et de cas d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9, ainsi que des circonstances connexes. \u00c0 son avis, le droit accorde une protection importante aux indicateurs dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale, y compris un privil\u00e8ge relatif aux indicateurs. Il a attest\u00e9 par \u00e9crit, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, que les renseignements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. L\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\n37. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve des articles 38 \u00e0 38.16, tout ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou tout fonctionnaire peut s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un tribunal, d\u2019un organisme ou d\u2019une personne ayant le pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements, en attestant verbalement ou par \u00e9crit devant eux que, pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9termin\u00e9es, ces renseignements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n(1.1) En cas d\u2019opposition, le tribunal, l\u2019organisme ou la personne veille \u00e0 ce que les renseignements ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s, sauf en conformit\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n(2) Si l\u2019opposition est port\u00e9e devant une cour sup\u00e9rieure, celle-ci peut d\u00e9cider la question.\n(3) Si l\u2019opposition est port\u00e9e devant un tribunal, un organisme ou une personne qui ne constituent pas une cour sup\u00e9rieure, la question peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e, sur demande, par :\na) la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019organisme ou la personne investis du pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne constituent pas un tribunal r\u00e9gi par le droit d\u2019une province;\nb) la division ou le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance de la cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province dans le ressort de laquelle le tribunal, l\u2019organisme ou la personne ont comp\u00e9tence, dans les autres cas.\n[49] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque \u00e9galement l\u2019article 58 de la LCDP :\n58. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), dans le cas o\u00f9 un ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou une autre personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements demand\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eateur ou le membre instructeur, la Commission peut demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de statuer sur la question et celle-ci peut prendre les mesures qu\u2019elle juge indiqu\u00e9es.\n(2) Il est dispos\u00e9 de l\u2019opposition \u00e0 divulgation en conformit\u00e9 avec la Loi sur la preuve au Canada dans les cas suivants :\na) le ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un fonctionnaire porte son opposition au titre du paragraphe (1) dans le cadre des articles 37 \u00e0 37.3 ou 39 de cette loi;\nb) dans les quatre-vingt-dix jours suivant la demande de la Commission \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le ministre f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou un fonctionnaire s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la divulgation dans le cadre des articles 37 \u00e0 37.3 ou 39 de cette loi;\nc) en tout \u00e9tat de cause, l\u2019opposition \u00e0 divulgation est port\u00e9e, ou un certificat est d\u00e9livr\u00e9, en conformit\u00e9 avec les articles 38 \u00e0 38.13 de cette loi.\nSelon l\u2019intim\u00e9, comme les documents caviard\u00e9s d\u00e9clenchent l\u2019application de l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada et de l\u2019article 58 de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner que l\u2019on supprime les caviardages. Il soutient que, compte tenu de ces dispositions, c\u2019est la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non le Tribunal, qui a comp\u00e9tence sur la divulgation de renseignements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels on revendique un privil\u00e8ge fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada.\n[50] Malgr\u00e9 les attestations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Commission conteste le privil\u00e8ge revendiqu\u00e9. Elle all\u00e8gue que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9cider si \u2013 et dans quelle mesure \u2013 des privil\u00e8ges pr\u00e9cis s\u2019appliquent en common law. Elle soutient de ce fait qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de traiter en premier du privil\u00e8ge revendiqu\u00e9 en common law, plut\u00f4t que de retarder davantage le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance en invoquant le processus expos\u00e9 dans la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette th\u00e8se, la Commission se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Ministre du Personnel du gouvernement des Territoires du Nord-Ouest), 2000 CanLII 28887 (TCDP) (AFPC).\n[51] Pour ce qui est des trois premi\u00e8res cat\u00e9gories de documents que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9es, les explications de ce dernier paraissent raisonnables et acceptables. S\u2019il subsiste encore des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es au sujet de ces documents, le plaignant ou la Commission pourront les soulever \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[52] En ce qui concerne la quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a attest\u00e9 par \u00e9crit, aux termes de l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, qu\u2019il y a sept documents qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas divulguer pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Comme il l\u2019a fait, selon moi, l\u2019article 37 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada et l\u2019article 58 de la LCDP sont bien clairs : le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour traiter des objections de la Commission quant au privil\u00e8ge revendiqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces sept documents. Le recours appropri\u00e9 dont dispose la Commission, si elle souhaite poursuivre l\u2019affaire, est de pr\u00e9senter une demande \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[53] M\u00eame si la Commission invoque la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate AFPC \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le Tribunal devrait se prononcer en premier sur la question du privil\u00e8ge, avant de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il convient de signaler que cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Territoires du Nord-Ouest, 2000 CanLII 16337 (CF) (AFPC (CF)); confirm\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs par 2001 CAF 259). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal avait commis une erreur de droit en d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019elle avait le pouvoir de statuer sur les oppositions \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements gouvernementaux pour des raisons d\u2019immunit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public lorsque celles-ci \u00e9taient formul\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou par l\u2019un de ses organismes. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : \u00ab [u]ne opposition de cette nature doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux art. 37 \u00e0 39 de la [Loi sur la preuve au Canada] [\u2026] \u00bb et, en cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal n\u2019a aucun pouvoir autre que de laisser la d\u00e9cision au soin de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (AFPC (CF), aux paragraphes 35 et 40). Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement suivi cette voie dans Warman c. Lemire, 2007 TCDP 21. C\u2019est donc dire que le Tribunal d\u00e9cline avoir comp\u00e9tence pour traiter des oppositions de la Commission quant au privil\u00e8ge fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 37 de Loi sur la preuve au Canada que revendique l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sept documents.\nD. Les versions compl\u00e8tes et lisibles de certains documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s [54] La Commission soutient que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 renvoyer ces documents en mars 2014; cependant, comme ces documents n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us et vu les difficult\u00e9s longues et continues que suscitent les questions de divulgation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission demande que le Tribunal ordonne la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\n[55] L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il s\u2019occupe d\u2019obtenir de meilleures copies des documents, s\u2019il y en an, et certaines, soutient-il, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies.\n[56] Compte tenu du temps requis pour fournir des copies lisibles des documents que demande la Commission, s\u2019il y en a, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir les documents avant le 2 novembre 2014.\nE. Les renseignements statistiques sur les d\u00e9tenus plac\u00e9s en isolement pendant toute la p\u00e9riode en litige [57] Selon la Commission, l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de d\u00e9tenus souffrant d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience mentale est l\u2019une des principales questions en jeu dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, tant pour ce qui est des all\u00e9gations individuelles que des all\u00e9gations syst\u00e9miques. Elle soutient donc que les renseignements statistiques sur les d\u00e9tenus plac\u00e9s en isolement pendant toute la p\u00e9riode en litige sont directement li\u00e9s au litige et contribuent \u00e9galement \u00e0 faire la preuve de l\u2019existence de r\u00e9gimes discriminatoires, \u00e0 titre tant individuel que syst\u00e9mique.\n[58] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 des statistiques sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions soulev\u00e9es, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que le SCC les fournisse et il a fait savoir qu\u2019il les transmettra \u00e0 toutes les parties.\n[59] Comme cet aspect semble r\u00e9gl\u00e9, il en sera question \u00e0 la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, et, si les statistiques n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, le Tribunal fixera un d\u00e9lai pour leur divulgation.\nF. Les versions \u00e9lectroniques des documents divulgu\u00e9s [60] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission, depuis la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate d\u2019octobre 2013 par laquelle le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une preuve \u00e9lectronique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience (Starblanket c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2013 TCDP 28 (Starblanket (audience \u00e9lectronique)), l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 refuse de divulguer d\u2019autres documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique, et ce, ajoute la Commission, m\u00eame s\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 en main une version \u00e9lectronique des documents divulgu\u00e9s. De l\u2019avis de la Commission, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige non seulement que les documents soient divulgu\u00e9s, mais aussi qu\u2019ils le soient sous une forme facile \u00e0 utiliser en vue de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 une audience. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la forme sous laquelle les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience proprement dite ne dicte pas sous quelle forme les documents doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s au stade pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience de l\u2019instance du Tribunal.\n[61] La Commission soutient que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer les versions \u00e9lectroniques sera un gaspillage inutile des ressources humaines et financi\u00e8res de la Commission, parce qu\u2019il faudra que le personnel de soutien proc\u00e8de au balayage de tous les documents non \u00e9lectroniques, tant pour les int\u00e9grer dans les dossiers de la Commission que pour les communiquer \u00e0 son expert. Elle ajoute que cela est inacceptable, compte tenu de son mandat d\u2019agir dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public et du fait qu\u2019elle dispose pour ses activit\u00e9s de ressources financi\u00e8res publiques limit\u00e9es.\n[62] De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles) n\u2019exigent pas que des documents soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et signifi\u00e9s sous une forme particuli\u00e8re; habituellement, ils sont divulgu\u00e9s sous forme imprim\u00e9e, sauf si les parties en conviennent autrement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019on se servirait de versions imprim\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et il n\u2019est pas logique d\u2019obliger par la suite une partie \u00e0 communiquer des documents sous une forme autre qu\u2019imprim\u00e9e. \u00c0 son avis, une telle mesure ajoute des co\u00fbts inutiles et fait \u00e9chec au mandat qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditive et informelle.\n[63] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans l\u2019affaire Starblanket (audience \u00e9lectronique) au sujet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue d\u2019obtenir une audience \u00e9lectronique avait trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et non au format des documents au stade de la divulgation. La distinction est importante, et je ne puis donc souscrire au point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur la question. Si l\u2019on examine les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, il y a une nette distinction entre les stades \u00ab divulgation \u00bb et \u00ab audience \u00bb des instances du Tribunal. L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles porte sur les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions ainsi que sur la divulgation et la production de la preuve. Je signale en particulier l\u2019alin\u00e9a 9(3)c) et le paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles, qui clarifient et confirment la distinction qui existe entre l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation et celle de l\u2019audience :\n9(3) \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation du membre instructeur, laquelle doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 des conditions conformes aux fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1), et sous r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019une partie de pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en r\u00e9plique,\n[...]\nc. une partie ne peut produire en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience un document qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 et produit conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 6;\n9(4) \u00c0 d\u00e9faut du consentement des parties, un document figurant dans un cahier de preuve documentaire ne peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admis en preuve par le membre instructeur.\n[64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a raison de mentionner que les R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9cisent pas la mani\u00e8re dont la production doit avoir lieu, mais le Tribunal a conclu que \u00ab l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que la divulgation et la production de documents soient suffisantes pour que chaque partie ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre \u00bb (Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2013 TCDP 3, au paragraphe 14). La divulgation de documents \u00e9lectroniques assisterait la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et il semble que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse disposer facilement des documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique. M\u00eame si ce dernier soutient que la production de documents \u00e9lectroniques ajoutera des co\u00fbts inutiles et fait \u00e9chec au mandat qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditive et informelle, il n\u2019explique pas pourquoi il en est ainsi. \u00c0 en juger par les arguments de la Commission, il semble que c\u2019est cette derni\u00e8re qui subit un pr\u00e9judice plus grave \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[65] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni des documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique ou les cas o\u00f9 il a converti des documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique, il produira ces documents au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission sous cette forme. Cela vaut aussi pour les documents qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 produits. L\u2019intim\u00e9 aura jusqu\u2019au 2 novembre 2014 pour reproduire et fournir ces documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [66] Conform\u00e9ment aux motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal ordonne :\n(1) L\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de divulguer les renseignements qui suivent pour les p\u00e9riodes de 1998 \u00e0 2007 et de 2013 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui :\na. les dossiers permettant de savoir dans quelles institutions le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du SCC, et de quels transf\u00e8rements il a fait l\u2019objet au sein de ces institutions et entre celles\u2011ci;\nb. les dossiers permettant de cerner les types et les conditions de l\u2019isolement dans lequel le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au cours de ses p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du SCC (notamment en ce qui concerne le fait d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un programme et de le mener \u00e0 bien dans le contexte du plan correctionnel du plaignant, et en ce qui a trait \u00e0 chaque fois o\u00f9 le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en isolement formel et en isolement, en pr\u00e9cisant les p\u00e9riodes exactes de ces mises en isolement);\nc. les dossiers faisant \u00e9tat de chaque cas consign\u00e9 d\u2019automutilation ou de tentative de suicide, en plus des rapports psychologiques connexes\n(2) Dans la mesure du possible, les documents mentionn\u00e9s au point 1) qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de doivent \u00eatre fournis par l\u2019entremise du SGD de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avant le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2014.\n(3) L\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de divulguer les documents, s\u2019il y en a, qui r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la demande de la Commission au sujet de 75 \u00e9l\u00e9ments additionnels, dont l\u2019existence a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e lors d\u2019un examen de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s. Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer cette divulgation avant le 2 novembre 2014.\n(4) L\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de divulguer une copie lisible, s\u2019il y en a, des documents qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s (et que la Commission a demand\u00e9s). Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir ces documents avant le 2 novembre 2014.\n(5) Dans les cas o\u00f9 des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 sous forme \u00e9lectronique ou les cas o\u00f9 il a converti des documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique, il est tenu de produire ces documents au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission sous cette forme.

Brian William Carter (le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada (le \u00ab minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans \u00bb, ou \u00ab MPO \u00bb, ou l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb). Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le MPO a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch.

Le 3 janvier 2014, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la demande que j\u2019avais faite au cours de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 d\u00e9cembre, les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant deux autres instances qui, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9taient pertinentes par rapport \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nIII. Les parties de la plainte pertinentes au regard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate\n[9] Les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte qui sont pertinentes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont reproduites ci-apr\u00e8s :\nLe plaignant a un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 son avis, constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de la Loi.\nEn juin 2008, il a soumis sa candidature \u00e0 un poste ENG-05 non encore cr\u00e9\u00e9 au sein du MPO, sans pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et sans solliciter de mesures d\u2019adaptation.\nEn avril 2009, au terme du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation, qui comprenait une entrevue, le MPO l\u2019a inclus dans le bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour occuper le poste.\nLe plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que son entrevue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab passable \u00bb, tout au plus, et que sa candidature ne serait pas envisag\u00e9e une fois que le poste serait cr\u00e9\u00e9.\nLe plaignant a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s\u2019identifier comme une personne atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience n\u00e9cessitant des mesures d\u2019adaptation, ce qu\u2019il a fait en ao\u00fbt 2009. En septembre 2009, il a soumis au MPO un formulaire de \u00ab demande d\u2019adaptations \u00bb.\nLe MPO a propos\u00e9 comme mesure d\u2019adaptation de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le plaignant apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u de la CFP des informations concernant les mesures d\u2019adaptation particuli\u00e8res appropri\u00e9es.\nLe MPO a demand\u00e9 au plaignant de se pr\u00e9senter au Centre de psychologie du personnel afin que la CFP puisse d\u00e9terminer les mesures d\u2019adaptation particuli\u00e8res requises par le plaignant, pour ensuite en faire part au MPO.\nLe plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec les mesures d\u2019adaptation propos\u00e9es et ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Centre de psychologie du personnel de la CFP. Il a fait valoir aupr\u00e8s du MPO que la mesure d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9e \u00e9tait de le nommer au poste ENG-05, pour les motifs suivants :\nil faisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie du bassin des candidats qualifi\u00e9s;\nla r\u00e8gle ou la pratique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb appliqu\u00e9e par le MPO \u00e9tait intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoire vis\u2011\u00e0-vis du plaignant et d\u2019autres personnes pr\u00e9sentant la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui;\nla mesure d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il proposait ne constituerait pas une contrainte excessive pour le MPO.\nLe MPO a rejet\u00e9 la proposition du plaignant.\nSelon les documents dont je dispose, en date du 3 juin 2011, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission sa plainte contre le MPO \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9.\nIV. Les questions en litige\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les questions soulev\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sont les suivantes :\nLe Tribunal devrait-il ajouter la Commission de la fonction publique comme intim\u00e9e?\nLe Tribunal devrait-il ensuite remplacer le MPO et la CFP par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9, puisqu\u2019ils ont tous un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019instance?\n[11] Par ailleurs, il existe une question sous-jacente aux deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, \u00e0 savoir :\nQui peut agir comme intim\u00e9 dans une plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi? Autrement dit, la Commission de la fonction publique et le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans sont-ils des entit\u00e9s pouvant \u00eatre nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9es \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9es dans le cadre de la plainte port\u00e9e devant le Tribunal? Cette question a une incidence directe sur celle de savoir si la CFP peut ou non \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e en son nom propre, de m\u00eame que sur la question de savoir si le PG devrait remplacer le MPO et la CFP en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[12] Je souligne que, dans l\u2019ensemble des documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la CFP ont recouru \u00e0 divers termes et expressions comme \u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb, \u00ab partie intim\u00e9e \u00bb et \u00ab partie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00bb. Ces appellations portaient \u00e0 confusion et, lors de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 d\u00e9cembre, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ce qu\u2019ils voulaient dire. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, pour chacun de ces termes, il aurait plut\u00f4t fallu lire \u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb.\nV. Le droit\nL\u2019adjonction de parties par le Tribunal en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne\n[13] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi dispose essentiellement que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant notamment \u00ab l\u2019adjonction de parties ou d\u2019intervenants \u00e0 l\u2019affaire \u00bb.\nLes R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal\n[14] La disposition des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03\u201105\u201104) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) qui traite en particulier de l\u2019adjonction de parties est l\u2019article 8, dont voici le libell\u00e9 :\n\u00ab Requ\u00eate pour agir en qualit\u00e9 de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\n8(1) Une personne qui n\u2019est pas une partie et qui souhaite \u00eatre reconnue par le membre instructeur comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cet effet.\nN\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser dans la requ\u00eate la participation souhait\u00e9e\n(2) Toute requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 8(1) doit se conformer aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 3 et doit pr\u00e9ciser le degr\u00e9 de participation \u00e0 l\u2019instruction recherch\u00e9.\nAdjonction d\u2019une partie \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une autre partie\n(3) La Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou le plaignant qui d\u00e9sire ajouter une partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet, qui doit \u00eatre signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle, laquelle a droit \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des arguments au sujet de la requ\u00eate.\nAdjonction d\u2019une partie \u00e0 sa propre demande\n(4) Une personne qui n\u2019est pas une partie et qui souhaite \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 3 visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet. \u00bb\nLe droit relatif au remplacement par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9\n[15] Le paragraphe 23(1) de la LRCECA pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n\u00ab Les poursuites visant l\u2019\u00c9tat peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es contre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada ou, lorsqu\u2019elles visent un organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat, contre cet organisme si la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le permet. \u00bb\n[16] Selon le paragraphe 66(1) de la LCDP, celle-ci \u00ab lie Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada \u00bb, sauf en ce qui concerne les gouvernements du Yukon, des Territoires du Nord-Ouest et du Nunavut.\nVI. Qui peut agir comme intim\u00e9 dans une plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi?\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[17] En ce qui concerne celui qui, en d\u00e9finitive [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original], devrait agir comme intim\u00e9 dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le MPO et la CFP sont tous les deux des \u00e9manations de la Couronne, et ne sont pas des personnes juridiques. Par cons\u00e9quent, ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre ne peut agir en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019intim\u00e9. Il existe une jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, par exemple la d\u00e9cision Shelly Ann Gravel c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CF 832, au paragraphe 6 [Gravel].\n[18] La pratique du Tribunal consistant \u00e0 substituer le PG \u00e0 des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux ou entit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s dans des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne vient \u00e9galement appuyer la th\u00e8se selon laquelle les \u00e9manations de la Couronne sont d\u00e9nu\u00e9es d\u2019identit\u00e9 juridique. On peut en trouver des exemples dans les d\u00e9cisions Plante c. GRC, 2003 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 7 [Plante] et Tremblay c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Commission de la fonction publique, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada et le Bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des transports du Canada), 2004 TCDP 15 [Tremblay].\nLa position du plaignant\n[19] Lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue par les R\u00e8gles.\n[20] Voici ce qu\u2019\u00e9nonce le paragraphe 1(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal :\n(i) \u00ab partie \u00bb, dans le cas d\u2019une instruction, d\u00e9signe la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, le plaignant et la personne faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte;\n(ii) \u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb d\u00e9signe la personne faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte.\n[21] Ainsi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre une personne. Or, ni le MPO ni la CFP ne sont des personnes juridiques. Au vu du paragraphe 1(3), la partie intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre l\u2019ancienne sous-ministre du MPO, car elle est une personne. Elle occupait le poste de sous-ministre lorsque les faits pertinents se sont produits; c\u2019est elle qui, \u00e0 l\u2019origine, \u00e9tait vis\u00e9e par la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant.\nLa position de la Commission des droits de la personne\n[22] Au d\u00e9part, la Commission ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019adjonction de la CFP \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e, ni au remplacement, par la suite, du MPO et de la CFP par le PG, ayant compris que toute ordonnance \u00e9ventuelle d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019audience aurait force ex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du MPO et de la CFP, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait que le PG soit ou non l\u2019intim\u00e9 nomm\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9.\n[23] Les observations de la Commission dat\u00e9es du 3 janvier 2014 traitent plus en profondeur de la question de la d\u00e9signation du PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LRCECA et de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de la Justice, LRC 1985, ch. J-2. La position de la Commission est donc d\u00e9crite ci-apr\u00e8s, sous la section intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Le remplacement par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb.\nAnalyse \u2013 La proc\u00e9dure\n[24] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate du MPO, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9, vise dans un premier temps \u00e0 ajouter la CFP \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire. Le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sentant cette requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les dispositions pertinentes des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\n[25] Le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal s\u2019applique \u00e0 cette partie de la requ\u00eate. Le paragraphe 3(1) est \u00e9galement applicable.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son avis de requ\u00eate. Dans son dossier de requ\u00eate et dans d\u2019autres documents relatifs \u00e0 celle-ci, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir qu\u2019il agissait non seulement pour le compte du MPO, mais aussi pour celui de la CFP. En outre, selon ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9, les documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de m\u00eame que les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es verbalement par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au cours de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 d\u00e9cembre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au nom du MPO et de la CFP. Le Tribunal peut donc pr\u00e9sumer que la CFP, en tant que partie \u00e9ventuelle, a re\u00e7u avis de cette requ\u00eate, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la position de la CFP. Le fait que les observations \u00e9crites figurant dans les documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9manent aussi bien de la CFP que du MPO signifie que la CFP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal des observations sur la requ\u00eate.\n[27] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les exigences pr\u00e9vues aux paragraphes 8(3) et 3(1) des R\u00e8gles.\nAnalyse \u2013 Qui peut agir \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 devant le Tribunal?\n[28] Il s\u2019agit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un employeur. L\u2019employeur officiel, le MPO, fait partie du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. En cons\u00e9quence, la LCDP est la principale loi qui s\u2019applique relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elle constitue \u00e9galement la principale source pour d\u00e9terminer qui peut agir \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[29] La Loi ne pose pas comme exigence que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit une entit\u00e9 juridique. L\u2019article 4 dispose que \u00ab [\u2026] toute personne reconnue coupable de ces actes [discriminatoires] peut faire l\u2019objet des ordonnances pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[30] Je reprends \u00e9galement ici les dispositions suivantes de la Loi, dont j\u2019ai mis en gras certains passages afin qu\u2019ils soient en \u00e9vidence :\n1. Selon l\u2019article 14.1, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait \u00ab [\u2026] pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer [\u2026] des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e \u00bb.\n2. Selon le paragraphe 40(1) : \u00ab un individu ou un groupe d\u2019individus ayant des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire peut d\u00e9poser une plainte devant la Commission [\u2026] \u00bb.\n3. Le paragraphe 50(1) (Fonctions) \u00e9nonce notamment ce qui suit : \u00ab [\u2026] apr\u00e8s avis \u00e0 la Commission, aux parties [\u2026] \u00bb [version anglaise : After due notice to the Commission, the complainant, the person against whom the complaint was made\u2026 \u00bb].\n4. Le paragraphe 53(2) se lit comme suit :\n\u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut [\u2026] ordonner [\u2026] \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\n[version anglaise :\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice\u2026\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice\u2026\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the wages\u2026\n(d) that the person compensate the victim for any and all of the additional costs\u2026\n(e) that the person compensate the victim\u2026for any pain and suffering\u2026.]\n5. Selon le paragraphe 53(3): \u00ab Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer [\u2026] \u00bb [version anglaise : order the person to pay].\n[31] Comme l\u2019illustrent les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes dispositions, la notion d\u2019intim\u00e9 en tant que \u00ab personne \u00bb [person] est utilis\u00e9e partout dans la Loi, notamment dans des expressions comme \u00ab la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00bb et \u00ab la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00bb.\n[32] Par ailleurs, les termes \u00ab individu \u00bb et \u00ab individus \u00bb sont employ\u00e9s dans diverses dispositions d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre de la Loi pour renvoyer \u00e0 ceux dont la Loi vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances.\nAinsi, l\u2019article 2 dispose notamment que la Loi a pour objet \u00ab de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet [\u2026] au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus [\u2026] \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement [\u2026] \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\nSelon l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a), constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait \u00ab a) [de] priver un individu [de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public] \u00bb. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b), il pr\u00e9voit que le fait de \u00ab d\u00e9favoriser [un individu] sur [le fondement d\u2019un] motif de distinction illicite \u00bb constitue un acte discriminatoire. Les alin\u00e9as 6a) et b) traitent du fait de priver \u00ab un individu \u00bb de l\u2019occupation de locaux commerciaux ou de logements et de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]. Tant l\u2019article 7, qui porte sur la discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, que l\u2019article 9, qui concerne les \u00ab organisations syndicales \u00bb, font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la personne victime de pratiques discriminatoires en tant qu\u2019\u00ab individu \u00bb [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\nSelon ce que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 10, constitue un acte discriminatoire, \u00ab s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus \u00bb, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale, de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite ou de conclure des ententes touchant un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original].\n[33] D\u2019autres dispositions de la Loi d\u00e9signent l\u2019entit\u00e9 faisant l\u2019objet de discrimination en tant qu\u2019\u00ab individu \u00bb ou \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, au sens de la Loi, le plaignant potentiel est tour \u00e0 tour \u00ab un individu \u00bb ou une \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus \u00bb, termes qui renvoient aux entit\u00e9s l\u00e9s\u00e9es.\n[34] La Loi \u00e9tablit donc une distinction entre l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui y est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en tant que \u00ab personne \u00bb, et le plaignant, qui y est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019\u00ab individu \u00bb ou \u00ab cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus \u00bb.\n[35] J\u2019en conclus que le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment fait figurer dans la Loi ces diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9signations afin que l\u2019on puisse distinguer ceux qui peuvent agir comme plaignants de ceux qui peuvent agir comme intim\u00e9s dans une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne.\n[36] Je conclus \u00e9galement que, compte tenu de ces diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9signations, la Loi exige que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit une \u00ab personne \u00bb.\n[37] Toutefois, la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit aucune d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab personne \u00bb. Je traiterai de cette question plus loin, dans la section intitul\u00e9e \u00ab Le remplacement par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb.\nVII. La Commission de la fonction publique est-elle une \u00ab personne \u00bb au sens de la Loi?\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[38] En d\u00e9pit du fait que, dans un premier temps, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 vise \u00e0 ajouter la CFP en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle laisse ensuite entendre que la CFP est une entit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non une entit\u00e9 juridique. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00e9manation de la Couronne, et non d\u2019une personne; elle ne serait donc pas une intim\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nLa position du plaignant\n[39] Le plaignant convient que ni la CFP ni le MPO ne sont des entit\u00e9s juridiques. Toutefois, pour en faire des entit\u00e9s juridiques et, par cons\u00e9quent, des intim\u00e9s appropri\u00e9s, il suffirait d\u2019ajouter la mention \u00ab sous-ministre \u00bb devant celle du minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans.\nLa position de la Commission\n[40] La Commission n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation sur la question de savoir si la CFP est une \u00ab personne \u00bb ou non au sens de la Loi. N\u00e9anmoins, dans ses observations suppl\u00e9mentaires dat\u00e9es du 3 janvier 2014, elle a soutenu que la question fondamentale \u00e0 trancher dans la plainte \u00e9tait celle de savoir si la structure et l\u2019application de la politique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb est discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant et de ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui, ce qui serait contraire \u00e0 la Loi. La CFP a des pouvoirs d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de dotation des minist\u00e8res, y compris le MPO, lequel applique la norme de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb \u00e0 ses proc\u00e9dures de dotation. Aussi la Commission consid\u00e8re-t-elle la CFP comme une entit\u00e9 essentielle dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nAnalyse\n[41] La loi constitutive de la Commission de la fonction publique est la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, art. 12 et 13 (la \u00ab LEFP \u00bb).\n[42] Le paragraphe 4(1) de la LEFP maintient l\u2019existence de la CFP et \u00e9nonce que celle-ci est compos\u00e9e du pr\u00e9sident et d\u2019au moins deux autres commissaires.\n[43] La LEFP ne caract\u00e9rise pas la CFP comme un organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat contre lequel des poursuites peuvent \u00eatre intent\u00e9es en son nom propre. La CFP n\u2019est pas non plus une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat.\n[44] Bien que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant quant \u00e0 la question en litige, je prends acte du fait que la CFP est inscrite \u00e0 l\u2019annexe IV de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, 1985 L.R.C., ch. F-11 (la \u00ab Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques \u00bb), en tant que secteur de l\u2019administration publique centrale.\n[45] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que sa loi constitutive ne la caract\u00e9rise pas comme un organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat, et ne l\u2019autorise pas \u00e0 engager des poursuites en son nom propre, la CFP n\u2019est pas une personne. Elle tient davantage d\u2019un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[46] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gravel, la plaignante, en vertu de la Loi, avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la CFP. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 sa plainte. Elle a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en nommant le Tribunal, la CFP et le PG \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fendeurs. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que \u00ab les minist\u00e8res gouvernementaux ne constituent pas des entit\u00e9s juridiques, de sorte qu\u2019ils ne peuvent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme parties \u00bb (Gravel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 6, citant la d\u00e9cision Mahmood c. Canada (1998), 154 FTR 102, au paragraphe 14). Elle a donc mis hors de cause la CFP \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fenderesse, ayant constat\u00e9 que celle-ci \u00e9tait un minist\u00e8re gouvernemental.\n[47] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la loi constitutive de la CFP, de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Gravel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et de la reconnaissance, par l\u2019intim\u00e9, du fait que la CFP n\u2019est ni une personne ni une intim\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e, je conclus que la CFP n\u2019est pas une \u00ab personne \u00bb au sens de la Loi, et qu\u2019elle ne peut par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e dans une plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[48] En cons\u00e9quence, la premi\u00e8re partie de la requ\u00eate, qui vise l\u2019adjonction de la CFP \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e, est rejet\u00e9e.\nVIII. Le Minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans est-il une \u00ab personne \u00bb au sens de la Loi?\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le MPO est un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, donc une \u00e9manation de la Couronne, et non une entit\u00e9 juridique.\nLa position du plaignant\n[50] Le plaignant soutient que le MPO n\u2019est pas une entit\u00e9 juridique, d\u00e8s lors qu\u2019il est un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Pour en faire une personne aux fins de la plainte, il suffirait de faire pr\u00e9c\u00e9der le MPO du nom de l\u2019ancienne sous-ministre dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9.\nLa position de la Commission\n[51] La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position sur cette question pr\u00e9cise.\nAnalyse\n[52] La loi constitutive du MPO est la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans, L.R.C., 1985, ch. F-15 (la \u00ab Loi sur le MPO \u00bb). Son pr\u00e9ambule \u00e9nonce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la \u00ab Loi concernant le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans \u00bb.\n[53] Le paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur le MPO pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n\u00ab Est constitu\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans, plac\u00e9 sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du ministre des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans. Celui-ci est nomm\u00e9 par commission sous le grand sceau \u00bb.\n[54] Par cons\u00e9quent, le MPO, l\u2019Intim\u00e9, est un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada.\n[55] La br\u00e8ve Loi sur le MPO, qui compte six articles, ne renferme aucune disposition constituant le MPO en tant que mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat ou l\u2019habilitant \u00e0 agir comme repr\u00e9sentant ou \u00e0 intervenir en son nom propre dans le cadre de litiges ou d\u2019actions en justice.\n[56] Le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la Commission conviennent que le MPO est un minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada.\n[57] Vu le contenu de la loi constitutive du MPO, qui en fait un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, et non un organisme ou une entit\u00e9 ayant le pouvoir d\u2019agir dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires en son nom propre, et compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision Gravel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, dans laquelle la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise clairement que les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux ne peuvent \u00eatre des intim\u00e9s, je conclus que le MPO n\u2019est pas une \u00ab personne \u00bb au sens de la Loi, et ne peut donc pas \u00eatre l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte dont est saisi le Tribunal.\n[58] Il reste que le MPO et la CFP jouent un r\u00f4le essentiel dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Le personnel des deux minist\u00e8res sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction. La raison en est que la plainte contient des all\u00e9gations quant au d\u00e9faut du MPO de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant au cours d\u2019un processus de dotation dans le cadre duquel la norme et la pratique de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es, et quant au fait que le recours \u00e0 cette norme et \u00e0 cette pratique a engendr\u00e9 de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant et de ceux pr\u00e9sentant la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui. La norme dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb est \u00e9tablie par la CFP, qui d\u00e9l\u00e8gue son pouvoir de dotation aux minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, dont le MPO.\n[59] La question de savoir qui, dans les faits, peut agir comme intim\u00e9 devant le Tribunal en vertu de la Loi, dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur ou l\u2019employeur potentiel qui est l\u2019auteur all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la discrimination est un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, reste cependant ouverte.\nIX. Le remplacement par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[60] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont expos\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nDans le contexte de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019employeur est Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine du chef du Canada. En effet, suivant la d\u00e9finition qui se trouve au paragraphe 2(1) de la LEFP, l\u2019\u00ab employeur \u00bb, dans le cas d\u2019une administration figurant aux annexes I ou IV de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, est le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor. (Le MPO figure \u00e0 l\u2019annexe I; et la CFP, \u00e0 l\u2019annexe IV \u2013 ma note.)\nDans les faits, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est une \u00e9manation de la Couronne.\nLa Reine ne peut \u00eatre mise en cause.\nLe MPO et la CFP sont des \u00e9manations de la Couronne et ne sont pas des entit\u00e9s juridiques. Il existe une jurisprudence qui confirme cette th\u00e8se; voir par exemple la d\u00e9cision Gravel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 6.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, le PG est la partie qu\u2019il convient de d\u00e9signer comme intim\u00e9.\nLe Tribunal a pour pratique de substituer le PG \u00e0 des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux ou entit\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s. La d\u00e9cision Plante c. GRC, 2003 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 7 [Plante], en est un exemple.\nEn outre, le paragraphe 23(1) de la LRCECA commande cette substitution.\nLa substitution ne sera pas pr\u00e9judiciable au plaignant pour les raisons suivantes :\nle PG ne r\u00e9clame pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions additionnel, et la CFP non plus;\nla substitution ne compliquera pas le traitement de la plainte, car un seul avocat repr\u00e9sentera l\u2019intim\u00e9;\nla substitution n\u2019entra\u00eenera aucun retard dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte.\nToute ordonnance \u00e9ventuelle aurait force ex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Couronne, et le MPO et la CFP seraient responsables des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance et de la mise en application de mesures de r\u00e9paration. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne cherche pas \u00e0 embrouiller les responsabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019une ordonnance \u00e9ventuelle du Tribunal pourrait lui imposer.\nDans la d\u00e9cision Lacroix c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2009 TCDP 35 [Lacroix], o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la GRC avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 plusieurs affaires mettant en cause la GRC et dans lesquelles le PG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la partie vis\u00e9e par les all\u00e9gations de discrimination : Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48 [Maillet]; Berberi c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2009 TCDP 21 [Berberi].\nDans la d\u00e9cision Lacroix, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 8, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 que la GRC ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e en son nom propre, puisque sa loi constitutive ne le permettait pas.\nComme on peut le voir dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Tremblay c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Commission de la fonction publique, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada et le Bureau de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des transports du Canada, 2004 TCDP 15 [Tremblay], le Tribunal a suivi la pratique consistant \u00e0 ce que le PG agisse comme intim\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 les intim\u00e9s sont des \u00e9manations de la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nLes faits de l\u2019affaire Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Brown, 2008 CF 734 [Brown] diff\u00e8rent de ceux de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. (Je n\u2019aborderai pas en plus grand d\u00e9tail les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant la d\u00e9cision Brown, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, car j\u2019estime qu\u2019elle traite de l\u2019ajout de parties \u00e0 une plainte devant le Tribunal. Lorsque j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je consid\u00e9rais que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait importante pour la question qui se posait alors, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il fallait ajouter la CFP en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9e. Toutefois, cette question \u2014 et, en cons\u00e9quence, la d\u00e9cision Brown \u2014 est devenue sans objet au vu de ma conclusion sur la question sous-jacente.)\nLa position du plaignant\n[61] Le plaignant s\u2019oppose au remplacement du MPO et de la CFP par le PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 pour les motifs suivants :\nLa requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 des R\u00e8gles.\nLa substitution demand\u00e9e ferait en sorte de rendre incertain le statut juridique du MPO et de la CFP au cours de l\u2019instruction.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre Claire Dansereau, l\u2019ancienne sous\u2011ministre du MPO, puisque c\u2019est \u00e0 son encontre que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 l\u2019origine; tout ce qu\u2019il faudrait, c\u2019est ins\u00e9rer son nom avant celui du MPO dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9.\nD\u00e8s lors que le terme \u00ab peuvent \u00bb est employ\u00e9 au paragraphe 23(1) de la LRCECA, le PG n\u2019est pas le seul \u00e0 pouvoir \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 dans une instance contre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La d\u00e9signation du PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 est donc discr\u00e9tionnaire, et non obligatoire.\nQui plus est, la LRCECA fait uniquement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des poursuites judiciaires; elle est muette au sujet du Tribunal.\nC\u2019est la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques ainsi que ses annexes, et non la LRCECA, qui \u00e9tablit quels secteurs du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral peuvent agir \u00e0 titre de personnes juridiques dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. La conclusion tir\u00e9e dans Lacroix sur cette question est erron\u00e9e.\nAu regard des plaintes soumises au Tribunal, il n\u2019existe aucune pratique \u00e9tablie relativement au remplacement par le PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est initialement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9. De fait, la substitution propos\u00e9e est hautement irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et totalement illogique.\nEn outre, cette partie de la requ\u00eate est trop tardive, et le remplacement propos\u00e9 porterait pr\u00e9judice au plaignant en ce qu\u2019il ne saurait pas quels r\u00f4les le MPO et la CFP joueraient dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction, ni les r\u00e8gles qui les r\u00e9giraient au cours de celle-ci.\nLa Politique sur les services juridiques et l\u2019indemnisation du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (la \u00ab politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00bb) d\u00e9crit la fa\u00e7on dont la LRCECA doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e. L\u2019article 8 de cette politique \u00e9nonce les r\u00f4les et responsabilit\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re de la Justice. Rien, ni dans cette disposition ni ailleurs dans la politique, n\u2019exige le remplacement par le PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 dans les instances devant le Tribunal, et rien non plus n\u2019oblige le minist\u00e8re de la Justice \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter le PG dans de tels cas.\nLa position de la Commission\n[62] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse dat\u00e9e du 27 ao\u00fbt 2013, la Commission ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, \u00e9tant entendu que [traduction] \u00ab [...] le remplacement par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada rendra toute ordonnance \u00e9ventuelle ex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 son encontre, comme \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada \u00bb.\n[63] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la position de la Commission t\u00e9moignait d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab mauvaise compr\u00e9hension \u00bb des demandes qu\u2019il avait formul\u00e9es dans sa requ\u00eate, mais il n\u2019a pas clarifi\u00e9 en quoi se manifestait cette mauvaise compr\u00e9hension. Il y a rem\u00e9di\u00e9 au cours de la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 d\u00e9cembre, pr\u00e9cisant que, \u00e0 supposer que le Tribunal accueille la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, que le plaignant \u00e9tablisse le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte \u00e0 l\u2019audience et que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la CFP ou au MPO de prendre des mesures ou de verser des sommes d\u2019argent, le PG lui-m\u00eame ne serait pas tenu, sur le plan interne, de prendre ces mesures ou d\u2019effectuer ces paiements. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le PG pourrait faire et ferait en sorte que la CFP et le MPO respectent une telle ordonnance du Tribunal.\n[64] Dans ses observations \u00e9crites suppl\u00e9mentaires dat\u00e9es du 3 janvier 2014, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, selon sa compr\u00e9hension de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, celle-ci visait \u00e0 remplacer l\u2019intim\u00e9, le MPO, par le PG, mais aussi \u00e0 inclure la CFP comme intim\u00e9e, et que toute ordonnance du Tribunal aurait force ex\u00e9cutoire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du MPO et de la CFP, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Couronne. C\u2019est au regard des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9sente plainte et de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate que, dans sa r\u00e9ponse du 27 ao\u00fbt 2013, la Commission ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019y oppose toujours pas.\n[65] La Commission a \u00e9galement fourni une liste de deux pages d\u2019instances devant le Tribunal o\u00f9 le PG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 sans \u00eatre pour autant l\u2019auteur de la discrimination. Cette liste comprend des instances dans lesquelles une requ\u00eate \u2013 par ailleurs accueillie \u2013 qui visait \u00e0 changer l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour le remplacer par le PG avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours des proc\u00e9dures; la d\u00e9cision Lacroix y figure.\n[66] Bien qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les observations suivantes :\na) En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la LRCECA ne pr\u00e9voit pas d\u2019approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui exigerait que le PG soit nomm\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 dans toutes les plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\nb) La LRCECA traite des litiges concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle. Dans les arr\u00eats Seneca College c. Bhaduria [1981] 2 RCS. 181 [Seneca College] et Honda Canada Inc. c. Keays [Honda Canada], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que la discrimination ne constitue pas un d\u00e9lit civil. Les plaintes de discrimination doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es par les entit\u00e9s de d\u00e9fense des droits de la personne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi. Dans les secteurs de l\u2019emploi et des services qui rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, seule la Loi offre un recours en cas de plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. D\u00e8s lors que la Commission et le Tribunal sont constitu\u00e9s par la Loi, une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne visant le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n\u2019est pas une \u00ab poursuite \u00bb au sens de la LRCECA.\nc) L\u2019article 21 de la LRCECA mentionne la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les cours sup\u00e9rieures des provinces en tant qu\u2019instances ayant comp\u00e9tence pour instruire les actions intent\u00e9es contre la Couronne. La LRCECA est toutefois silencieuse au sujet des proc\u00e9dures administratives, et l\u2019instruction des plaintes renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal est une proc\u00e9dure administrative.\nd) Bien que la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de la Justice dispose que le PG est charg\u00e9 \u00ab des int\u00e9r\u00eats de la Couronne et des minist\u00e8res dans tout litige o\u00f9 ils sont parties et portant sur des mati\u00e8res de comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb, elle n\u2019exige pas que le PG soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 ou d\u00e9fendeur dans le cadre de tels litiges o\u00f9 la Couronne est partie.\nAnalyse\nLoi sur la gestion des finances publiques\n[67] L\u2019objectif de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 en ces termes dans le passage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019article 1 : \u00ab [l]oi relative \u00e0 la gestion des finances publiques, \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation et \u00e0 la tenue des comptes du Canada et au contr\u00f4le des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb.\n[68] Cette loi a donc pour objet la gestion des finances et des ressources humaines, et non la gestion du syst\u00e8me judiciaire. Elle renferme des annexes qui classent les diff\u00e9rents secteurs de l\u2019administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en tant que minist\u00e8res, agences et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019\u00c9tat, mais avec pour objectif ultime d\u2019appuyer la gestion des finances publiques et des ressources humaines. Il n\u2019y est pas question de la fa\u00e7on dont les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires doivent \u00eatre men\u00e9es.\nLa Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor\n[69] La Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor indique comment et dans quelles circonstances le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor fournit aux fonctionnaires de l\u2019\u00c9tat des services juridiques ou une indemnisation pour les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s et les prot\u00e8ge d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle s\u2019ils font l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation ou d\u2019une poursuite. L\u2019un des objectifs de la Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est de \u00ab prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019\u00c9tat en ce qui concerne sa responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou \u00e9ventuelle r\u00e9sultant des actes ou des omissions de ses fonctionnaires [\u2026] \u00bb (Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, article 5.1).\n[70] Bien que les responsabilit\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re de la Justice \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 8.2 de la Politique n\u2019incluent aucune mention portant que le PG doit agir comme intim\u00e9 de remplacement chaque fois qu\u2019une action est intent\u00e9e contre un minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, cet article doit \u00eatre situ\u00e9 dans le contexte de l\u2019objectif poursuivi par la Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, \u00e0 savoir prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019\u00c9tat en ce qui concerne sa responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou \u00e9ventuelle. Et cette politique constitue l\u2019un des moyens pour y parvenir. Elle ne vise pas \u00e0 \u00e9noncer ou \u00e0 d\u00e9crire les concepts juridiques ench\u00e2ss\u00e9s dans les lois, pas plus qu\u2019elle ne mentionne la LRCECA.\n[71] En outre, la Politique du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor n\u2019est pas une loi du Canada; il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif. Cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, elle est une politique qui sert \u00e0 des fins indicatives et informatives, et qui n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de la loi ni l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e.\n[72] Les raisons pour lesquelles le PG est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Tremblay ne sont pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans cette d\u00e9cision. Je ne peux donc accorder beaucoup de poids \u00e0 cette affaire, sauf pour mentionner que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est le PG.\nLa Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne\n[73] Le terme \u00ab personne \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi elle-m\u00eame. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut tenter de d\u00e9gager une telle d\u00e9finition en cherchant \u00e0 discerner l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 partir du terme employ\u00e9 et des dispositions o\u00f9 il se trouve, en tenant compte du contexte et du sens clair et ordinaire, mais aussi en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019esprit et l\u2019objet de la loi (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral)), 2011 CSC 53). Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une loi relative aux droits de la personne, il faut \u00ab se rappeler qu\u2019elle exprime des valeurs essentielles et vise la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019objectifs fondamentaux \u00bb (ibidem). La Cour a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il convient de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter lib\u00e9ralement et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologiquement de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre sans r\u00e9serve les droits qui y sont pr\u00e9vus et \u00e0 leur donner pleinement effet.\n[74] L\u2019analyse de l\u2019esprit de la Loi met en lumi\u00e8re les points suivants :\na) les plaintes sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une \u00ab personne \u00bb ou de plusieurs personnes (par. 40(1));\nb) la personne vis\u00e9e par la plainte a le droit de prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal (art. 50.1);\nc) le Tribunal peut rendre une ordonnance contre \u00ab la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00bb (par. 53(2) et (3));\nd) la Loi lie Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada (par. 66(1)).\n[75] L\u2019analyse de l\u2019esprit de la loi permet ainsi de conclure que le terme \u00ab personne \u00bb, aux fins de la Loi, s\u2019entend notamment de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada. Le Tribunal est ainsi habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre des ordonnances contre Sa Majest\u00e9.\n[76] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la Loi, le langage non \u00e9quivoque utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 r\u00e9v\u00e8le que celle-ci, en somme, vise \u00e0 favoriser la capacit\u00e9 de tous les individus de \u00ab s\u2019\u00e9panouir \u00bb en leur garantissant \u00e0 cette fin l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019y parvenir sans \u00eatre victimes de discrimination et d\u2019actes discriminatoires. Elle vise aussi bien \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 une telle discrimination, si celle-ci est av\u00e9r\u00e9e, qu\u2019\u00e0 la pr\u00e9venir (CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, [1987] 1 RCS 1114).\n[77] Le Tribunal s\u2019inscrit dans l\u2019esprit et les objectifs de la Loi. La raison d\u2019\u00eatre de sa fonction juridictionnelle est de veiller \u00e0 ce que les objectifs de la Loi \u2013 pr\u00e9venir la discrimination et y rem\u00e9dier \u2013 soient mis en \u0153uvre. \u00c0 cette fin, le Tribunal doit interpr\u00e9ter toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans la Loi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 favoriser, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 contrecarrer, la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs de la Loi (Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36, au paragraphe 26).\nLoi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif (LRCECA)\n[78] L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 qui se trouve au-dessus de l\u2019article 1 de la LRCECA d\u00e9crit celle-ci en tant que \u00ab [l]oi relative \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et aux proc\u00e9dures applicables en mati\u00e8re de contentieux \u00bb.\n[79] Bien que la LRCECA ne mentionne pas express\u00e9ment les proc\u00e9dures administratives, et qu\u2019elle semble limiter \u00e0 la \u00ab responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle \u00bb l\u2019objet des poursuites engag\u00e9es contre l\u2019\u00c9tat en Ontario, elle ne renferme aucune d\u00e9finition du terme \u00ab poursuites \u00bb. J\u2019estime que, puisque la LRCECA est d\u00e9crite comme une loi concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et les poursuites auxquelles l\u2019\u00c9tat est partie, on peut se reporter \u00e0 ses dispositions et les appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 promouvoir les objets de la LCDP \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en son article 2.\n[80] Selon l\u2019article 2 de la LRCECA, \u00ab \u00c9tat \u00bb s\u2019entend de \u00ab Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada \u00bb ou d\u2019une province.\n[81] L\u2019article 2.1 de la LRCECA d\u00e9finit le terme \u00ab personne \u00bb de la mani\u00e8re suivante : \u00ab Pour l\u2019application des articles 3 \u00e0 5, personne s\u2019entend d\u2019une personne physique majeure et capable autre que Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[82] Les articles 3 \u00e0 5 de cette m\u00eame loi portent sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat.\n[83] Les minist\u00e8res, les commissions et les autres entit\u00e9s du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, qui ne sont pas des \u00ab personnes \u00bb juridiques au sens de la LRCECA, ne peuvent \u00eatre parties \u00e0 des litiges (en poursuite ou en d\u00e9fense) en leur nom propre, \u00e0 moins que leurs lois constitutives ne leur accordent ce pouvoir. Ces entit\u00e9s ne sont pas non plus des personnes au sens de la LCDP. Elles sont des \u00e9manations de l\u2019\u00c9tat, qui, pour sa part, s\u2019entend de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada ou d\u2019une province. Une bonne partie de la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement celle du Tribunal, confirme cette interpr\u00e9tation, tout comme la d\u00e9cision Gravel de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[84] L\u2019\u00c9tat forme donc une seule et m\u00eame entit\u00e9, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019incarne en la personne de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada. Les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, commissions et autres institutions, qui ne sont pas des personnes, sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019\u00c9tat, lequel est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la personne de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada. Le MPO et la CFP font ainsi partie de l\u2019\u00c9tat, qui est une entit\u00e9 unique.\n[85] Toutefois, l\u2019article 2.1 de la LRCECA exon\u00e8re la personne de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada de toute responsabilit\u00e9. Le paragraphe 66(1) de la LCDP dispose que cette loi lie Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada. Par ailleurs, la LCDP exige qu\u2019une \u00ab personne \u00bb agisse comme intim\u00e9. Ces dispositions semblent donc contradictoires.\n[86] Mais la LRCECA n\u2019exon\u00e8re pas l\u2019\u00c9tat lui-m\u00eame de toute responsabilit\u00e9.\n[87] Le paragraphe 23(1) de la LRCECA traite des poursuites, et d\u00e9finit de quelle mani\u00e8re il convient d\u2019exercer des poursuites contre la Couronne. De telles poursuites peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9es contre le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, \u00e0 moins que la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale permette qu\u2019elles soient exerc\u00e9es contre l\u2019organisme mandataire de l\u2019\u00c9tat en cause.\n[88] Ainsi, pour que l\u2019on puisse obtenir r\u00e9paration des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019\u00c9tat, lequel est \u00e0 son tour Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada, comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 66(1) de la LCDP, c\u2019est le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui doit \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 23(1) de la LRCECA.\n[89] Tel est l\u2019effet conjugu\u00e9 de la LCDP et de la LRCECA, laquelle permet de promouvoir l\u2019esprit, les valeurs et les objectifs qui sous-tendent la LCDP en d\u00e9signant le PG \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 dans la plainte.\n[90] Les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es, y compris celles jointes en annexe aux observations additionnelles de la Commission dat\u00e9es du 3 janvier2014, confirment qu\u2019au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, le Tribunal a eu comme pratique de substituer le PG \u00e0 des minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux lorsque ceux-ci avaient initialement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s.\n[91] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lacroix (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 devait \u00eatre le PG, et qu\u2019aucune mention de l\u2019entit\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le PG ne devait suivre le nom de celui-ci dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9. Toutefois, dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, le MPO et la CFP sont des \u00e9manations de la Couronne qui se trouvent au c\u0153ur de la plainte \u2013 le MPO, en raison des all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte selon lesquelles il aurait omis de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant dans le cadre d\u2019un processus de dotation o\u00f9 la norme et la pratique dite de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es; et la CFP, en tant que responsable de la conception et de la mise en \u0153uvre de cette norme et de cette pratique dont elle d\u00e9l\u00e8gue l\u2019application au MPO, et dont le recours, selon la plainte, engendre de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant et de ceux pr\u00e9sentant la m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience que lui.\n[92] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, il convient de d\u00e9signer le PG en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9, et de pr\u00e9ciser, dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9, qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente les \u00e9manations de la Couronne que sont la CFP et le MPO. En effet, cette pr\u00e9cision ne contredit en rien la d\u00e9signation du PG en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9. L\u2019intitul\u00e9 sera libell\u00e9 de la sorte par souci de clart\u00e9 et de transparence de l\u2019instruction.\nX. La d\u00e9signation de l\u2019ancienne sous-ministre \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e\nLa position du plaignant\n[93] Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de requ\u00eate sur la question, le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, dans les documents qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre Claire Dansereau, qui \u00e9tait sous-ministre du MPO \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte.\n[94] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 le nom de Mme Dansereau \u00e0 l\u2019intitul\u00e9 afin que la partie intim\u00e9e soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme suit : \u00ab Claire Dansereau, P\u00caCHES ET OC\u00c9ANS CANADA \u2013 Intim\u00e9e (MPO) \u00bb. Ailleurs dans les documents qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Dansereau devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait l\u2019intim\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e selon le droit.\nLe plaignant fonde sa position sur les arguments suivants :\nla plainte mentionnait initialement le nom de Mme Dansereau en tant qu\u2019intim\u00e9e;\nelle est une \u00ab personne \u00bb au sens de la Loi et des R\u00e8gles;\nelle \u00e9tait la personne responsable du d\u00e9faut all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du MPO de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du plaignant, ainsi que de la mise en \u0153uvre, par le MPO, de la politique de la \u00ab bonne personne \u00bb;\nle MPO n\u2019est pas une personne juridique;\nle plaignant avait inform\u00e9 Mme Dansereau, entre autres personnes, de son insatisfaction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019adaptation mise de l\u2019avant par le MPO;\nMme Dansereau \u00e9tait au fait de la question des mesures d\u2019adaptation et de la discrimination, et, \u00e0 la connaissance du plaignant, elle n\u2019a rien fait pour mettre un terme \u00e0 celle-ci;\nelle \u00e9tait personnellement au courant, mais aussi responsable, du point de vue organisationnel, de la conduite reproch\u00e9e au personnel du MPO, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la plainte.\nLa position de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[95] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que Mme Dansereau soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme partie. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas agi au-del\u00e0 du cadre de ses fonctions, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a agi \u00e0 titre personnel relativement \u00e0 quelque question li\u00e9e \u00e0 la plainte, mais qu\u2019elle agissait seulement \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e de la Couronne. Puisque le PG repr\u00e9sente la Couronne, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019ajouter Mme Dansereau comme partie.\nLa position de la Commission\n[96] La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette question.\nAnalyse\nProc\u00e9dure\n[97] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles s\u2019applique \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue lorsque le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou la Commission souhaite ajouter une partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction. Le fait de se conformer au paragraphe 8(3), et particuli\u00e8rement au passage de cette disposition qui exige de signifier la requ\u00eate \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle \u2013 en lui donnant ainsi avis de la proc\u00e9dure \u2013 de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 celui qui donne \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle le droit de pr\u00e9senter des arguments au sujet de la requ\u00eate, donne l\u2019occasion \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle de savoir de quoi il retourne et de s\u2019exprimer sur la question de son ajout comme partie, et ce, avant que le Tribunal ne d\u00e9cide si elle devrait ou non \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme telle.\n[98] Autrement dit, la partie \u00e9ventuelle a le droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle, qui comprennent l\u2019occasion de se faire entendre avant que ne soit rendue une d\u00e9cision touchant directement ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le fait d\u2019\u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme partie intim\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur la LCDP peut avoir des cons\u00e9quences importantes. Ce serait un manquement aux principes de justice naturelle que de simplement d\u00e9signer une personne comme partie \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, avec toutes les obligations et cons\u00e9quences qui s\u2019ensuivent, sans lui donner un pr\u00e9avis suffisant de l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e et lui donner ensuite la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de prendre connaissance des questions auxquelles elle fait face et de pr\u00e9senter des observations au Tribunal \u00e0 ce sujet. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai dans les circonstances actuelles, alors que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9e n\u2019occupe plus le poste de sous-ministre au MPO. Elle n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pas au courant de la pr\u00e9sente instance, ni de l\u2019intention du plaignant de l\u2019ajouter comme partie.\n[99] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 d\u2019avis de requ\u00eate \u00e0 Mme Dansereau afin de l\u2019informer qu\u2019il souhaitait l\u2019ajouter comme intim\u00e9e; cet avis aurait pu lui donner l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal des arguments sur la question. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 au paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles en ce qui concerne sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 d\u00e9signer Mme Dansereau comme partie.\n[100] Qui plus est, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a formul\u00e9 de br\u00e8ves objections quant \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de Mme Dansereau, je ne suis pas convaincue que ces objections signifient pour autant que les paragraphes 8(3) et 3(1) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en application. Il m\u2019est impossible d\u2019en d\u00e9duire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a avis\u00e9 Mme Dansereau de la requ\u00eate et qu\u2019il a le mandat de pr\u00e9senter des observations en son nom.\n[101] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je ne puis, dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019ajouter Mme Claire Dansereau \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e vis\u00e9e par la plainte.\nXI. Ordonnance\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte doit \u00eatre identifi\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante : \u00ab Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans Canada et la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada) \u00bb, avec prise d\u2019effet imm\u00e9diate.\nDans la mesure o\u00f9 le plaignant d\u00e9sire ajouter Mme Claire Dansereau ou toute autre personne comme partie \u00e0 la plainte :\nil doit se conformer aux paragraphes 3(1) et 8(3) des R\u00e8gles;\nil peut utiliser, en guise d\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie \u00e9ventuelle o\u00f9 est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019il recherche.

Introduction [1] La plaignante, Shelley Annette MacEachern (la plaignante), travaille pour le Service correctionnel du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou le SCC) et se dit diab\u00e9tique. Le 7 mai 2012, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal), en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), d\u2019instruire la plainte que la plaignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le SCC. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, \u00e0 cause d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience, son diab\u00e8te.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir de la plaignante qu\u2019elle communique divers documents. Pour sa part, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de modifier la liste des mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle souhaite se voir accorder en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La d\u00e9cision qui suit porte sur ces deux requ\u00eates.\nII. Contexte [3] Le 6 juillet 2010, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission une plainte dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que, vers le d\u00e9but de janvier 2010, le SCC lui a refus\u00e9 un emploi d\u2019agent correctionnel (le poste de CX\u20111) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de Grande Cache (l\u2019\u00c9GC) en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, le diab\u00e8te.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient avoir fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de ne pas offrir \u00e0 la plaignante le poste de CX\u20111 sur un rapport \u00e9tabli par Sant\u00e9 Canada au sujet de l\u2019aptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 occuper ce poste compte tenu de son diab\u00e8te. Selon lui, Sant\u00e9 Canada a conclu que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler comme CX-1, sous r\u00e9serve de certaines restrictions quant au travail qui pouvait \u00eatre accompli. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme avoir remis \u00e0 la plaignante, le 14 avril 2010, une lettre l\u2019informant qu\u2019il ne pouvait prendre les mesures d\u2019accommodement exig\u00e9es par ces restrictions et qu\u2019elle ne se verrait donc pas offrir le poste de CX-1.\n[5] Quant \u00e0 la plaignante, elle a fait valoir devant le Tribunal que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de se fier au rapport de Sant\u00e9 Canada et, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, son d\u00e9faut de prendre les mesures d\u2019accommodement d\u00e9coulant des restrictions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans ce rapport constituent de la discrimination au sens de la Loi.\n[6] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas l\u2019employer comme CX-1, la plaignante travaillait pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9GC en qualit\u00e9 de CR-4, poste qu\u2019elle continue d\u2019occuper depuis. Cependant, entre octobre 2013 et ao\u00fbt 2014, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 pour des raisons qui n\u2019avaient apparemment rien \u00e0 voir avec son diab\u00e8te.\nIII. La requ\u00eate en communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [7] Le 4 mai 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demandait la production de divers documents qui, selon lui, sont pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations en personne relativement \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate le 7 ao\u00fbt 2014, \u00e0 Grande Cache, en Alberta.\n[8] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les documents dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande la communication rel\u00e8vent de quatre cat\u00e9gories diff\u00e9rentes.\n[9] La premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie se compose des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux se rapportant au suivi, au contr\u00f4le et au traitement du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante, ou faisant mention de son diab\u00e8te, de 2006 jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui offrir le poste de CX\u20111. La plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 ces documents parce qu\u2019ils ne sont pas pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que leur communication constituerait une atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e.\n[10] La deuxi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents se compose des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux constitu\u00e9s de 2010 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui et comportant tout renseignement relatif au suivi, au contr\u00f4le et au traitement du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante, ou faisant mention de son diab\u00e8te, ainsi que des autres dossiers m\u00e9dicaux concernant les mesures de redressement que r\u00e9clame la plaignante, dont la restitution de ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9 et des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Encore une fois, la plaignante affirme que ces documents ne sont pas pertinents, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils concernent son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 suivant la d\u00e9cision de ne pas lui offrir le poste de CX\u20111.\n[11] La troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents demand\u00e9s vise le dossier ou les documents se rapportant \u00e0 la demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la plaignante et tous les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux aff\u00e9rents au traitement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. La plaignante soutient que ces documents ne sont pas pertinents en raison de l\u2019absence de lien entre sa demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et son diab\u00e8te.\n[12] La quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents comprend un relev\u00e9 \u00e0 jour des prestations vers\u00e9es par les services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta de janvier 2013 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. La plaignante soutient que son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 suivant la d\u00e9cision de ne pas l\u2019employer comme CX\u20111 n\u2019est pas pertinent et que les documents de cette cat\u00e9gorie n\u2019ont donc pas \u00e0 \u00eatre produits.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [13] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties \u00e0 une instance du Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur position. Pour se pr\u00e9valoir de cette possibilit\u00e9, les parties ont besoin, entre autres choses, que leur soient communiqu\u00e9s les renseignements qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents et qui sont en la possession ou sous le contr\u00f4le de la partie adverse avant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire. Conjugu\u00e9e aux faits et aux questions en litige soumis de part et d\u2019autre, la communication de renseignements permet \u00e0 chaque partie de conna\u00eetre la preuve r\u00e9unie par la partie adverse et, ainsi, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l\u2019audience. C\u2019est pourquoi un document devrait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal s\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre ce document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 [Guay]; Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 28; et Seeley c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2013 TCDP 18, au paragraphe 6).\n[14] Cela dit, la demande de communication ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb. Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise. Autrement dit, la demande ne devrait pas obliger une partie ou une personne \u00e9trang\u00e8re au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation (voir Guay, au paragraphe 43).\n[15] Selon la plaignante, les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont qu\u2019elle est atteinte du diab\u00e8te de type 1 et qu\u2019elle a postul\u00e9 un emploi de CX-1 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2009. Elle a suivi la formation de septembre \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2009. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, elle a d\u00fb se soumettre \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale aupr\u00e8s de Sant\u00e9 Canada dans le but de d\u00e9terminer si son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 lui permettait de remplir les fonctions d\u2019un CX\u20111. Dans le cadre de cette \u00e9valuation, plusieurs des m\u00e9decins traitants de la plaignante ont fourni des renseignements d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical \u00e0 Sant\u00e9 Canada. Au final, Sant\u00e9 Canada a jug\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler comme CX\u20111 moyennant certaines restrictions. Sant\u00e9 Canada a ensuite remis un rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire modifi\u00e9 dans lequel il confirmait l\u2019aptitude de la plaignante \u00e0 occuper le poste de CX\u20111, y ajoutant cependant d\u2019autres conditions, dont celles de ne travailler ni seule, ni de nuit.\n[16] La plaignante a mis son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Elle pose notamment la question de savoir si on peut pr\u00e9tendre que son diab\u00e8te restreignait l\u2019ampleur des t\u00e2ches qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 effectuer en 2009 et en 2010 et continue de restreindre ce qu\u2019elle peut effectuer maintenant. Elle conteste non seulement le rapport de Sant\u00e9 Canada et les restrictions pos\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 son aptitude \u00e0 occuper le poste de CX\u20111, mais \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision du SCC de ne pas tenir compte des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et d\u2019autres documents, en sus de ce rapport de Sant\u00e9 Canada, lorsqu\u2019il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen de son aptitude \u00e0 occuper le poste de CX-1 sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, \u00e0 la fin de 2009 et au d\u00e9but de 2010.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie de documents se rapportant au suivi, au contr\u00f4le et au traitement du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante, ou faisant mention de son diab\u00e8te, de 2006 jusqu\u2019au moment de l\u2019\u00e9valuation faite par Sant\u00e9 Canada, en avril 2010, pourrait \u00eatre pertinente et assujettie \u00e0 la divulgation. En effet, les documents pourraient \u00eatre pertinents en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de savoir quel \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9tat diab\u00e9tique de la plaignante au moment de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de Sant\u00e9 Canada et avant.\n[18] Les documents de cette cat\u00e9gorie qui doivent \u00eatre produits comprennent \u00e9galement les dossiers relatifs au suivi, au contr\u00f4le et au traitement du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante, ou faisant mention de son diab\u00e8te, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9s par les dispensateurs de traitements qui ne figurent pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la liste dress\u00e9e par la plaignante, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[19] Il importe de souligner que, bien que la plaignante ait fourni une liste exhaustive de m\u00e9decins, celle\u2011ci a reconnu dans les observations qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate que certains de ces dossiers sont vraisemblablement pertinents. Plusieurs des m\u00e9decins dont le nom figure dans la liste semblent appartenir au m\u00eame cabinet, ce qui fait qu\u2019il ne sera probablement n\u00e9cessaire de produire qu\u2019un seul dossier m\u00e9dical.\n[20] Si les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la premi\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie se rapportent essentiellement aux ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante, ceux de la seconde cat\u00e9gorie concernent son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 depuis la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. La plaignante a confirm\u00e9 que ce qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame au titre de la perte de revenus se limite \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre les sommes qu\u2019elle aurait gagn\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de CX\u20111 et celles qu\u2019elle a touch\u00e9es comme CR\u20114, que ce soit sous forme de salaire ou de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Toutefois, la plaignante demande \u00e0 la fois une indemnisation pour perte de revenus et la nomination au poste de CX\u20111. Dans sa plaidoirie, la plaignante a fait valoir que son diab\u00e8te ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait pas de travailler sur une base permanente comme CX\u20111 et qu\u2019elle continuait \u00e0 contester les restrictions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le rapport de Sant\u00e9 Canada en ce qui concerne sa demande en vue d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9sormais employ\u00e9e comme CX\u20111. Elle soutient qu\u2019on devrait lui assigner le poste de CX\u20111 sans restrictions, ind\u00e9pendamment des directives contenues dans le rapport de Sant\u00e9 Canada; \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, elle ajoute que ces restrictions devraient \u00eatre \u00e9tablies en fonction d\u2019une nouvelle \u00e9valuation de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 par le SCC. La plaignante demande par ailleurs le r\u00e9tablissement de ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s, dont les cong\u00e9s de maladie, et une indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante depuis la perp\u00e9tration de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause.\n[21] Il s\u2019ensuit, \u00e0 mon sens, que les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la seconde cat\u00e9gorie, qui couvrent la p\u00e9riode allant de la d\u00e9cision de ne pas offrir \u00e0 la plaignante le poste de CX\u20111, en avril 2010, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui et qui comportent des renseignements se rapportant au suivi, au contr\u00f4le et au traitement du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante, ou faisant mention de son diab\u00e8te, ainsi que tous les autres dossiers m\u00e9dicaux concernant les mesures de redressement que r\u00e9clame la plaignante, dont la restitution de ses cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9 et des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice, pourraient \u00eatre pertinents et assujettis \u00e0 la divulgation. Ces dossiers comprennent ceux constitu\u00e9s par les m\u00e9decins dont les noms figurent d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la liste \u00e9tablie par la plaignante, entre 2010 et aujourd\u2019hui, ainsi que ceux des dispensateurs de traitements qui n\u2019y figurent pas, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[22] La troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents est constitu\u00e9e du dossier de demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la plaignante et des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux aff\u00e9rents. Alors qu\u2019elle occupait le poste de CR\u20114, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019octobre 2013 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2014. Il est important de noter que la plaignante ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour la perte de revenus qu\u2019elle a subie pendant cette p\u00e9riode, mais plut\u00f4t pour la diff\u00e9rence entre les prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9es au poste de CX\u20111 et celles qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ues en tant que CR-4. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, bien que la plaignante affirme que son diab\u00e8te n\u2019a rien eu \u00e0 voir avec sa demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a le droit de v\u00e9rifier si c\u2019est r\u00e9ellement le cas. En outre, la plaignante continue d\u2019exiger qu\u2019on lui assigne le poste de CX\u20111 sans restrictions; or, il est possible que l\u2019\u00e9volution de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 soit pertinente pour statuer sur le redressement demand\u00e9.\n[23] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que les dossiers de la troisi\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie pourraient \u00eatre pertinents et assujettis \u00e0 la divulgation, y compris le dossier de demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la plaignante et les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux aff\u00e9rents au traitement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\n[24] La quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie de documents dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande la production comprend un relev\u00e9 \u00e0 jour des prestations vers\u00e9es par les services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta de janvier 2013 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. Pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la pertinence des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux courants de la plaignante, les documents de cette quatri\u00e8me cat\u00e9gorie pourraient \u00eatre pertinents, et donc, assujettis \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 la production.\nV. Directives concernant la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience [25] L\u2019obligation de la plaignante de communiquer les documents susmentionn\u00e9s qui sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre pertinents doit toutefois \u00eatre pond\u00e9r\u00e9e par ses attentes l\u00e9gitimes en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux et les documents se rapportant \u00e0 son invalidit\u00e9.\n[26] Le Tribunal a reconnu qu\u2019un plaignant a droit au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Beaudry c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CanLII 61851 (TCDP), au paragraphe 7 [Beaudry]; McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (TCDP), au paragraphe 3 [McAvinn]). Toutefois, ce droit peut cesser d\u2019exister quand cette personne invoque son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (voir McAvinn, au paragraphe 4; Guay, au paragraphe 45; Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier et Femmes\u2011Action c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11; voir aussi Frenette c. M\u00e9tropolitaine (La), cie d\u2019assurance\u2011vie, 1992 CanLII 85 (CSC); et M. (A.) c. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (CSC) [M. (A.)]). Cela dit, \u00ab le besoin de d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9viter une injustice n\u2019\u00e9carte pas automatiquement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une protection contre une divulgation compl\u00e8te \u00bb (M. (A.), au paragraphe 33). Dans les cas o\u00f9 il a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on communique les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, le Tribunal a normalement assujetti cette communication \u00e0 certaines conditions afin de prot\u00e9ger le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements, par exemple en pr\u00e9cisant qui peut en prendre connaissance et en faire des copies (voir, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, Guay, au paragraphe 48; McAvinn, aux paragraphes 19 et 20; Beaudry, aux paragraphes 7 et 9; Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Section locale 500 et al., 2012 TCDP 11, au paragraphe 19; Rai c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2013 TCDP 6, au paragraphe 37; et Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au paragraphe 15).\n[27] Par cons\u00e9quent, les restrictions suivantes s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les documents communiqu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision :\n(1) Les documents seront communiqu\u00e9s uniquement aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9; ceux-ci ne pourront en divulguer le contenu sans avoir obtenu l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal et en avoir avis\u00e9 la plaignante au pr\u00e9alable.\n(2) Les avocats du SCC utiliseront les documents pour se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire de m\u00eame que lorsqu\u2019ils communiqueront avec leur client en vue de demander les instructions n\u00e9cessaires. Les documents ne pourront servir \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins que cette instruction.\n(3) Les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec le suivi, le traitement ou le contr\u00f4le du diab\u00e8te de la plaignante ou avec les mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle demande) (restitution des cr\u00e9dits de cong\u00e9s, pr\u00e9judice moral, etc.) devront \u00eatre retranch\u00e9s des documents communiqu\u00e9s.\n[28] Le Tribunal fixera la date et l\u2019heure d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance visant \u00e0 discuter du processus de collecte et de communication des documents vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nVI. Modification des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par la plaignante [29] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier les redressements qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Lors de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019y opposait, mais il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, certains des redressements demand\u00e9s ne relevaient peut-\u00eatre pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et qu\u2019il se r\u00e9servait le droit de pr\u00e9senter des arguments \u00e0 cet effet lors de l\u2019audience. Autrement dit, le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 consente \u00e0 la modification des redressements demand\u00e9s ne signifie nullement qu\u2019il reconna\u00eet le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat de ces redressements.\n[30] Compte tenu des observations faites par la plaignante et de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante en vue d\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier express\u00e9ment la liste des redressements afin qu\u2019ils correspondent \u00e0 ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans ses documents dat\u00e9s du 23 mai 2014 est accueillie.\nSign\u00e9 par\nRicki Johnston\nMembre instructrice\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 23 octobre 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties inscrites au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T1823\/5312\nIntitul\u00e9 : Shelley Annette MacEachern c.

Les moyens invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate sont que le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation, qu\u2019il a omis \u00e0 maintes reprises de se conformer aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et que, en raison de son inconduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, tant le Tribunal que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contrecarr\u00e9s dans leurs efforts pour faire avancer le dossier. L\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que permettre l\u2019instruction de la plainte constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[2] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessous, je fais droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et je rejette la plainte.\nII. Contexte\n[3] La plainte dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission par M. Ronald Wayne Mattice (le plaignant), le 29 septembre 2010. Le 24 avril 2012, la Commission a demand\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que Westower Communications Ltd. s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la couleur, en le traitant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente par rapport aux autres employ\u00e9s puis en le cong\u00e9diant, ce qui contrevient aux articles 7 et 14 de la Loi. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, il all\u00e8gue que, lorsqu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e durant la p\u00e9riode de septembre 2007 \u00e0 avril 2010, il faisait l\u2019objet de commentaires racistes m\u00e9prisants de la part de ses coll\u00e8gues. La plainte laisse entendre qu\u2019il croit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il se plaignait de cette situation \u00e0 la direction.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le mandat d\u2019instruire la plainte, le 8 mai 2012, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit \u00e0 toutes les parties pour leur demander si elles voulaient participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation. Le d\u00e9lai imparti pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e9tait le 30 mai 2012. Toutes les parties ont confirm\u00e9 leur participation avant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai.\n[5] Le 20 juin 2012, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel aux parties pour leur confirmer que toutes les parties avaient accept\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence de m\u00e9diation en vue d\u2019un r\u00e8glement. Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 deux dates d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance aux parties : elles avaient a) jusqu\u2019au 28 juin 2012 pour confirmer leurs dates de disponibilit\u00e9 et b) jusqu\u2019au 29 juillet 2012 pour d\u00e9poser leur m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation.\n[6] Le 26 juin 2012, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation et, le 27 juin 2012, elle a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal de ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9.\n[7] Le 27 juin 2012, Westower a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9 et soumis son m\u00e9moire.\n[8] Le 28 juin 2012, M. Mattice a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de ses dates de disponibilit\u00e9, en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il d\u00e9poserait sous peu son m\u00e9moire et les documents connexes. Or, M. Mattice n\u2019a pas soumis son m\u00e9moire dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 au 29 juillet 2012.\n[9] Le 10 septembre 2012, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel aux parties pour confirmer qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u les m\u00e9moires de m\u00e9diation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de la Commission, mais pas celui du plaignant.\n[10] Le 27 novembre 2012, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 M. Mattice pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait toujours pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9.\n[11] Le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2012, M. Mattice a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019il entendait produire son m\u00e9moire au plus tard le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Il a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u son dernier envoi. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal lui a envoy\u00e9 des copies des documents et de la correspondance par service de messagerie pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il aurait tout le dossier en main.\n[12] Le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2012 a pass\u00e9, et M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son m\u00e9moire.\n[13] Le 23 janvier 2013, M. Mattice a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019il entendait produire son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation au plus tard le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[14] Le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2013 a pass\u00e9, et M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son m\u00e9moire.\n[15] Le 25 avril 2013, le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait de nouveau entretenu avec M. Mattice, qui avait accept\u00e9 de produire son m\u00e9moire le lendemain.\n[16] Le 26 avril 2013 a pass\u00e9, et M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son m\u00e9moire.\n[17] Le 26 juillet 2013, le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 une nouvelle date pour permettre \u00e0 M. Mattice de produire son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation : il devait le d\u00e9poser au plus le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, sans quoi une date serait fix\u00e9e pour la tenue d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas.\n[18] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013 a pass\u00e9, et M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son m\u00e9moire.\n[19] Le 15 novembre 2013, le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties que M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation. Le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre aux parties le 26 novembre 2013 : une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 21 janvier 2014, mais elle n\u2019a pas eu lieu.\n[20] Le 17 janvier 2014, le Tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait de nouveau entretenu avec M. Mattice, qui avait promis de soumettre son m\u00e9moire le m\u00eame jour.\n[21] M. Mattice a bel et bien fourni, le 17 janvier 2014, une d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite concernant sa situation en tant que membre d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible. Toutefois, le Tribunal l\u2019a avis\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9claration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour servir de m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation et il l\u2019a encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir un document plus substantiel.\n[22] Le 6 mars 2014, M. Mattice a produit un tr\u00e8s court m\u00e9moire, qui faisait environ un paragraphe de long.\n[23] La conf\u00e9rence de m\u00e9diation a eu lieu le 14 mai 2014, mais elle n\u2019a abouti \u00e0 aucun r\u00e8glement. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation des documents et de la production de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[24] Le 15 mai 2014, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour fixer les dates butoirs de la production des expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions et de la production des documents. Le Tribunal a enjoint \u00e0 M. Mattice de produire ses documents au plus tard le 23 juin 2014 et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de fournir, en r\u00e9ponse, son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au plus tard le 14 juillet 2004.\n[25] Le 23 juin 2014 a pass\u00e9, et M. Mattice n\u2019avait pas produit sa liste de documents \u00e0 divulguer ni son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Il n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9alablement communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal ou les autres parties pour demander une prorogation du d\u00e9lai.\n[26] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 24 juin 2014, le Tribunal a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mattice qu\u2019il lui incombait de divulguer ses documents. M. Mattice n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu.\n[27] Le 10 juillet 2014, Westower a \u00e9crit aux parties et demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal impose \u00e0 M. Mattice une date pour la production de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et la divulgation de ses documents. Westower a \u00e9galement averti les parties que, si M. Mattice continuait de passer outre aux d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal, elle pr\u00e9senterait une requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte pour d\u00e9faut de poursuite.\n[28] Le 17 juillet 2014, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mattice jusqu\u2019au 2 septembre 2014 pour produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et divulguer ses documents. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que toutes les parties fournissent, au plus tard le 18 juillet 2014, leurs dates de disponibilit\u00e9 en vue de la tenue d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas.\n[29] Le 28 juillet 2014, le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les parties la tenue d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas le 26 ao\u00fbt 2014.\n[30] Le 21 ao\u00fbt 2014, l\u2019agent du greffe a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mattice et lui a rappel\u00e9 que la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas aurait lieu la semaine suivante et qu\u2019il lui incombait de terminer son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et sa divulgation de documents au plus tard le 2 septembre 2014. M. Mattice a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il participerait \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas et il n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 savoir qu\u2019il aurait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter la date butoir du 2 septembre 2014.\n[31] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2014, la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas a eu lieu, tel qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. Toutefois, M. Mattice n\u2019y a pas particip\u00e9 et n\u2019a fourni aucune explication pour justifier son absence. L\u2019agent du greffe a tent\u00e9 de le joindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ce matin-l\u00e0. Le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de M. Mattice a sonn\u00e9 plusieurs fois, et il n\u2019y a pas eu de r\u00e9ponse. Lorsque l\u2019agent a rappel\u00e9 quelques minutes plus tard, le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de M. Mattice a sonn\u00e9 deux fois avant que l\u2019appel ne soit achemin\u00e9 \u00e0 sa bo\u00eete vocale. M. Mattice n\u2019avait pas fait savoir \u00e0 l\u2019avance qu\u2019il ne participerait pas \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas.\n[32] Le 2 septembre 2014, M. Mattice n\u2019avait pas fourni son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la divulgation de ses documents.\n[33] Le 4 septembre 2014, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour les informer qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mattice et que celui\u2011ci avait accept\u00e9 de produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et de divulguer ses documents le m\u00eame jour.\n[34] \u00c0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e du 4 septembre 2014, M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ni divulguer ses documents.\n[35] Le 5 septembre 2014, le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 aux autres parties que M. Mattice n\u2019avait toujours pas produit son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas divulgu\u00e9 ses documents.\n[36] Le 15 septembre 2014, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u copie de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en rejet de la plainte pour d\u00e9faut de poursuite.\n[37] Une copie de cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Mattice par courriel le 15 septembre 2014 \u00e0 16 h 45. L\u2019agent du greffe lui a ensuite parl\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone : il lui a donn\u00e9 des informations sur la requ\u00eate et dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait imp\u00e9ratif qu\u2019il y r\u00e9ponde.\n[38] Pour s\u2019assurer que M. Mattice re\u00e7oive une copie de la requ\u00eate, le Tribunal a fait affaire avec une entreprise de services professionnels de signification. Le 20 octobre 2014, M. Mattice s\u2019est vu signifier une copie papier de la requ\u00eate en rejet et une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 octobre 2014 dans laquelle le Tribunal l\u2019avisait qu\u2019il disposait de sept jours \u00e0 partir de la date de signification pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la motion jointe.\n[39] M. Mattice n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la motion en rejet dans le d\u00e9lai imparti, \u00e0 savoir au plus tard le 27 octobre 2014, ni par la suite.\nIII. Analyse\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9e avance que M. Mattice a omis \u00e0 maintes reprises de se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation et aux R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Westower all\u00e8gue que M. Mattice a agi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et que, par cons\u00e9quent, permettre l\u2019instruction de la plainte constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[41] Le Tribunal a le droit de prot\u00e9ger sa proc\u00e9dure contre les abus (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 15, conf. par Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363). Dans Labelle c. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 TCDP 4, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail les principes applicables \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en rejet pour d\u00e9faut du plaignant de donner suite \u00e0 sa plainte de mani\u00e8re active (voir les paragraphes 73 \u00e0 88). Le Tribunal peut rejeter une plainte lorsque l\u2019affaire demeure trop longtemps au m\u00eame point parce qu\u2019une partie \u00ab ne tient absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal, si bien que le retard occasionn\u00e9 constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal (voir Tourangeau c. Greyhound Canada Transportation Corporation, 2008 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 8; Johnston c. Force arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 34).\n[42] \u00c0 mon avis, M. Mattice n\u2019a tenu absolument aucun compte des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal et a abus\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[43] Il a pass\u00e9 outre cinq fois \u00e0 la date butoir pr\u00e9vue pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation. Il n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 de prorogation de d\u00e9lai ni donn\u00e9 avis qu\u2019il n\u2019arriverait pas \u00e0 respecter les dates pr\u00e9vues.\n[44] M. Mattice a fait d\u00e9faut deux fois de soumettre son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L\u00e0 encore, sans demande de prorogation ni pr\u00e9avis.\n[45] Il a \u00e9galement omis de participer \u00e0 une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e principalement pour r\u00e9gler ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. M. Mattice a re\u00e7u un pr\u00e9avis de quatre semaines pour cette t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence et un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour la lui rappeler quelques jours avant sa tenue.\n[46] Enfin, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019on l\u2019ait mis au courant de la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Mattice ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9valu de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre.\n[47] Le paragraphe (5) de l\u2019article premier des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit que les dates et les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal sont obligatoires :\n1(5) \u00c0 moins que le membre instructeur n\u2019accorde une prorogation ou un ajournement, tous les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis pour l\u2019observation des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles et toutes les dates fix\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 des audiences, \u00e0 des requ\u00eates ou \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires sont imp\u00e9ratifs.\n[48] M. Mattice n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019ajournements pour participer \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas du 26 ao\u00fbt 2014 ni de prorogations de d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation, la production de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et la divulgation de documents. Il n\u2019a m\u00eame pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de sa plainte.\n[49] Dans le cours normal de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, un dossier fera l\u2019objet d\u2019une m\u00e9diation dans les trois \u00e0 six mois du renvoi, selon le consentement et la disponibilit\u00e9 de toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, si l\u2019on exclut les questions pr\u00e9liminaires, les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions sont communiqu\u00e9s et les dates d\u2019audience sont \u00e9tablies en moins d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le renvoi. La pr\u00e9sente plainte outrepasse de beaucoup la p\u00e9riode normale de traitement des dossiers du Tribunal : pourtant, aucune question pr\u00e9liminaire ni autre circonstance n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas non plus fourni d\u2019explications d\u2019aucune sorte pour justifier ses manquements r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s dans l\u2019observation des d\u00e9lais.\n[50] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 24 avril 2012. \u00c0 partir de cette date, apr\u00e8s cinq d\u00e9fauts d\u2019observation des dates butoirs fix\u00e9es pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un m\u00e9moire de m\u00e9diation, il a fallu deux ans pour que la plainte de M. Mattice atteigne la m\u00e9diation. Apr\u00e8s une m\u00e9diation qui s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par un \u00e9chec, et malgr\u00e9 les efforts du Tribunal, six autres mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis que l\u2019on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Mattice de produire un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et de divulguer ses documents pour l\u2019audience. Pr\u00e8s de trois ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal, et rien n\u2019indique encore qu\u2019il instruira la plainte dans un proche avenir. \u00c0 mon avis, la plainte est demeur\u00e9e trop longtemps au m\u00eame point parce que le plaignant a fait fi des d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par le Tribunal, et c\u2019est pour cette raison qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[51] Le Tribunal est charg\u00e9 d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, de sorte que les Canadiens puissent se pr\u00e9valoir des recours pr\u00e9vus par la Loi de mani\u00e8re efficace, rapide et \u00e9conomique (voir le paragraphe 48.9(1)). Le r\u00e9gime juridique canadien en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne est con\u00e7u non seulement pour assurer le respect des droits constitutionnels des plaignants, qui sont parfois des personnes tr\u00e8s vuln\u00e9rables, mais aussi pour prot\u00e9ger certaines valeurs fondamentales de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans leur ensemble. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal s\u2019emploie d\u00fbment \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties qui se repr\u00e9sentent elles-m\u00eames pour leur donner amplement et pleinement la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur cause, mais elle ne le fait pas au d\u00e9triment des autres parties ou du Tribunal. En plus d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, le Tribunal a l\u2019obligation de respecter les principes de justice naturelle. Autrement dit, le Tribunal a le devoir d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement envers toutes les parties.\n[52] Il n\u2019est pas impossible d\u2019imaginer qu\u2019une partie \u00e0 une plainte pourrait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment chercher \u00e0 \u00e9tirer la proc\u00e9dure simplement dans le but d\u2019infliger des dommages financiers \u00e0 la partie adverse, sachant que chaque retard ou chaque date butoir manqu\u00e9e fait monter le co\u00fbt d\u2019une d\u00e9signation comme partie \u00e0 la plainte. Les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires qui durent trop longtemps peuvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler co\u00fbteuses pour les parties. Ainsi, si une partie a retenu les services d\u2019un conseiller juridique externe, pour chaque retard, chaque date butoir manqu\u00e9e, chaque t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas report\u00e9e, toutes les fois qu\u2019une partie de la proc\u00e9dure doit \u00eatre reprise une seconde, une troisi\u00e8me ou une quatri\u00e8me fois, cela se traduit par un co\u00fbt financier r\u00e9el pour la partie. En plus de voir \u00e0 ce que les retards soient \u00e9vit\u00e9s et \u00e0 ce que les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure soient observ\u00e9es, le Tribunal doit aussi se pr\u00e9munir contre ces possibles abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[53] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e, parce que M. Mattice a refus\u00e9 de donner suite \u00e0 sa plainte de mani\u00e8re active.\nSign\u00e9e par\nDavid L.

Contexte [1] Dans une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) dat\u00e9e du 21 avril 2007, les plaignantes pr\u00e9tendent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination \u00e0 cause de leur race. La Commission a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 19 ao\u00fbt 2008.\n[2] Dans leur plainte, les plaignantes indiquent qu\u2019elles sont enseignantes \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve de Natashquan et qu\u2019elles consid\u00e8rent qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas les m\u00eames avantages que certains professeurs non autochtones qui y travaillent.\n[3] Elles indiquent \u00e9galement dans leur plainte que dans leur travail, certaines personnes auraient un meilleur salaire \u00e0 cause du fait qu\u2019elles sont non autochtones et, pourtant, les plaignantes effectuent le m\u00eame travail que ces derni\u00e8res.\n[4] Elles argumentent que cette situation existe en raison du fait que le Conseil de bande des Montagnais (l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sentes) serait compos\u00e9 d\u2019hommes \u00ab grassement pay\u00e9s et quand ils manquent d\u2019argent pour se payer, il est habituel pour eux de se servir en \u00e9ducation \u00bb (voir la plainte des plaignantes page 1).\n[5] De fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise, la plaignante reproche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de les traiter de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rentielle en ce qui a trait aux professeurs non autochtones qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9, et cela, par l\u2019octroi de certaines primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, de sorties annuelles, ainsi que d\u2019allocation au logement.\n[6] Pour sa part, l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pond aux arguments des plaignantes en indiquant que les montants d\u2019allocation mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus sont fournis en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la notion de r\u00e9sidence et non pas en fonction du crit\u00e8re de la race.\n[7] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve prima facie qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par les plaignantes eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur plainte et, en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 en demande le rejet.\n[8] De plus, m\u00eame si le Tribunal devait faire droit \u00e0 la plainte en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il ferait face \u00e0 une contrainte excessive tenant compte de sa situation largement d\u00e9ficitaire pour les ann\u00e9es en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte des plaignantes ne saurait \u00eatre retenue \u00e9galement pour ce motif.\n[9] Pour les motifs que j\u2019exprimerai dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il est de mon intention de ne pas faire droit \u00e0 la plainte des plaignantes.\nII. Les faits A. Preuve des plaignantes Rodrigue Wapistan\n[10] \u00c0 titre de premier t\u00e9moin, les plaignantes ont fait entendre monsieur Rodrigue Wapistan, chef de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2002.\n[11] Monsieur Wapistan nous indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la communaut\u00e9, et cela, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004.\n[12] Monsieur Wapistan informe le Tribunal que la communaut\u00e9 d\u00e9nombre 1100 membres \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9serve et pr\u00e8s de 300 membres vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des limites de la m\u00eame r\u00e9serve.\n[13] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Wapistan confirme au Tribunal que la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan re\u00e7oit des subventions du minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien (le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes) et que la situation financi\u00e8re de la communaut\u00e9 est pr\u00e9caire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il confirme qu\u2019un cogestionnaire a d\u00fb \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 afin d\u2019aider le Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan \u00e0 mieux administrer les d\u00e9ficits qu\u2019il encourait.\n[14] \u00c9galement, il confirme au Tribunal les pi\u00e8tres conditions de logements, lesquelles sont lamentables dans la communaut\u00e9. Il indique qu\u2019il y a surpeuplement eu \u00e9gard au nombre de logements disponibles, ce qui engendre des probl\u00e8mes sociaux au niveau des familles et de la jeunesse de la communaut\u00e9. Il confirme que trois \u00e0 quatre familles peuvent vivre sous le m\u00eame toit.\n[15] Durant son mandat de Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, soit entre les ann\u00e9es 2002 et 2004, le dossier des plaignantes, en ce qui a trait aux probl\u00e8mes des primes de logement, lui a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que le Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de transf\u00e9rer le dossier \u00e0 leur avocat.\n\u00c9velyne Malec\n[16] \u00c0 titre de deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin, la plaignante, madame \u00c9velyne Malec, est venue apporter son t\u00e9moignage au Tribunal.\n[17] Dans un premier temps, elle a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elle est enseignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, laquelle \u00e9cole est situ\u00e9e dans la communaut\u00e9 innue de Natashquan (pour de plus amples r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, voir le document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Nutashquan et le Plan Nord \u00bb dat\u00e9 de mars 2012 \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 1).\n[18] Madame Malec d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation pr\u00e9scolaire et en enseignement primaire ainsi que les attestations suivantes :\n- Brevet d\u2019enseignement ;\n- Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sur mesure en intervention psychosociale en milieu \u00e9ducatif ;\n- Certificat en \u00e9tude autochtone ;\n- Certificat en enseignement en milieu am\u00e9rindien ;\n- Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales.\n(Voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 4)\n[19] Madame Malec habite dans un endroit situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Natashquan connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la Pointe-Parent, soit une petite communaut\u00e9 de 50 personnes. Elle n\u2019habite pas directement dans la communaut\u00e9 de Natashquan puisqu\u2019elle est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un non-autochtone, monsieur Richard Boies, et aussi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas beaucoup de logements \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la communaut\u00e9.\n[20] Madame Malec enseigne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun depuis 2001 et, avant 2001, elle avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission scolaire de la Moyenne-C\u00f4te-Nord o\u00f9 elle aurait obtenu toutes les primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de r\u00e9tention requises.\n[21] Madame Malec a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019elle a d\u00fbment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les enseignants non autochtones \u00e9taient avantag\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 elle, et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard elle se sentait d\u00e9valoris\u00e9e.\n[22] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la politique des ressources humaines en ce qui a trait au personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, car elle a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une entente intervenue entre le Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan et le personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun de Natashquan en juin 2005 (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 6, \u00e0 la page 314). Dans cette politique des ressources humaines, la plaignante a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 10.7 qui a trait aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement accord\u00e9es au personnel enseignant et au personnel professionnel non r\u00e9sident, de m\u00eame qu\u2019au paragraphe 10.8 qui concerne les allocations pour sorties annuelles accord\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s non r\u00e9sidents. Elle fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 10.9 en ce qui a trait aux allocations pour le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement des employ\u00e9s non r\u00e9sidents, ainsi qu\u2019au paragraphe 10.10 qui a trait aux allocations de logement pour employ\u00e9s non r\u00e9sidents. Dans tous ces cas, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle n\u2019a eu aucune des sommes qui sont mentionn\u00e9es.\n[23] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, la plaignante a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, dans son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 l\u2019entente intervenue entre le Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan et le personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun de Natashquan (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 7), entente qui fut sign\u00e9e au mois de mai 2005 par tous les enseignants, dont la plaignante.\n[24] Encore une fois, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u les primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement qui apparaissent dans ledit document.\n[25] Madame Malec a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004 lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e par le Conseil de bande de Natashquan, et porta plainte en vertu du Code canadien du travail pour cong\u00e9diement injuste. Cette plainte a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision arbitrale en date du 27 juillet 2004 (voir la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 57).\n[26] Dans cette d\u00e9cision arbitrale, l\u2019arbitre conclut que l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire 2002-2003 s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans un contexte politique et financier difficile, alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9 faisait face \u00e0 des contraintes budg\u00e9taires.\n[27] La plaignante a eu gain de cause dans cette d\u00e9cision arbitrale et a obtenu une ordonnance de r\u00e9embauchement avec le remboursement de certains revenus d\u2019emploi.\n[28] Suite \u00e0 cette ordonnance, les parties sign\u00e8rent une quittance le 19 ao\u00fbt 2004 dans laquelle on retrouve plusieurs modalit\u00e9s de remboursement ainsi que de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration de la plaignante dans un poste d\u2019enseignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet11). La plaignante indique que ce document fut sign\u00e9 par monsieur Antoine Ishpatao ainsi que monsieur Gilles Auclair, cogestionnaire pour la firme BDL, en charge du redressement de la situation financi\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment.\n[29] Aussi, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la somme de 20 000 $, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas eu le 1 000 $ par mois, tel que pr\u00e9vu dans la quittance, pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode de temps et qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb intenter une poursuite \u00e0 la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir ces sommes (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 12).\n[30] \u00c0 la fin de son interrogatoire, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle veut \u00eatre reconnue comme une professionnelle qui travaille en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que tous les enseignants non autochtones.\n[31] Ainsi, elle veut obtenir le paiement des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2001, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui.\n[32] Elle r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement des dommages moraux pour perte d\u2019estime de soi, consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas sentie consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nB. Contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante principale [33] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante, madame \u00c9velyne Malec, a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e \u00e0 monsieur Richard Boies depuis 22 ans. Monsieur Boies est \u00e9galement un enseignant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun.\n[34] Au moment de son embauche, monsieur Boies demeurait \u00e0 L\u00e9vis (Qu\u00e9bec). Madame Malec a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que monsieur Boies re\u00e7oit des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de logement depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2001. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs en 2001, apr\u00e8s avoir pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 monsieur Boies, que la plaignante r\u00e9alisa que ce dernier recevait effectivement ces primes. Elle s\u2019informa alors aupr\u00e8s des membres du corps professoral non autochtones de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun et constata qu\u2019ils avaient aussi droit aux primes puisqu\u2019ils r\u00e9sidaient en r\u00e9gion \u00e9loign\u00e9e.\n[35] La s\u0153ur de la plaignante, Anna Malec, lui aurait aussi dit que dans le temps de \u00ab la belle \u00e9poque \u00bb, soit pour les ann\u00e9es 1970-1980, il y avait des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour les enseignants autochtones.

Elle est limitrophe au territoire de la r\u00e9serve de Natashquan.\n[72] Monsieur Boies a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a eu, par le pass\u00e9, des difficult\u00e9s avec le Conseil de bande qui n\u2019a pas voulu lui reconna\u00eetre le paiement de ses primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de logement, tenant compte du fait qu\u2019il vivait avec une autochtone, soit madame Malec.

En ce sens, il existait des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de transport lors des sorties et ces primes ont souvent fait l\u2019objet de discussions. Quant au m\u00e9contentement constat\u00e9 des enseignants ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant pas des primes, il a toujours r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au Conseil de bande qui prenant les d\u00e9cisions finales.\n[82] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, monsieur Tanguay a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait des diff\u00e9rences de traitement entre les r\u00e9sidents et les non r\u00e9sidents, mais non pas entre autochtones et non autochtones.

En 1985-1986, il a fait une prise en charge administrative de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun dans le cadre d\u2019une acquisition d\u2019autonomie par les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et de la mise en \u0153uvre du programme du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation.\n[85] Au regard de la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 35, laquelle est le rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation de services \u00e9ducatifs de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun \u00e0 Natashquan, l\u2019\u00e9valuation en question fut faite dans le cadre d\u2019une reddition de comptes afin de savoir si les services \u00e9taient rendus correctement. Une analyse de la gestion de l\u2019\u00e9cole appara\u00eet \u00e0 la page 48 de ce rapport. On y fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un fort taux de roulement au niveau de la direction et du fort taux d\u2019absent\u00e9isme chez les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, ainsi que du manque de normes et de r\u00e8glements dont il existe une interpr\u00e9tation vari\u00e9e. Monsieur Leclerc confirme \u00e9galement que les dossiers du personnel sont mal g\u00e9r\u00e9s, ce qui explique la frustration exprim\u00e9 par les enseignants.\n[86] Au mois de septembre 2007, la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole lui fut confi\u00e9e.\n[87] De m\u00eame, il confirme que la firme BDL avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e comme s\u00e9questre de la r\u00e9serve des autochtones de Natashquan.\n[88] Monsieur Leclerc fut interrog\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019un document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Politique de gestion des ressources humaines; Clauses sp\u00e9cifiques relatives au secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00bb, dat\u00e9 de novembre 2007 (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 24). En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question portant sur la clause 4.9 du document et la d\u00e9finition du mot \u00ab r\u00e9sident \u00bb, monsieur Leclerc a indiqu\u00e9 que les primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et les allocations au logement existaient dans le but de recruter de nouveaux professeurs qui venaient de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9serve autochtone. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que d\u2019autres communaut\u00e9s autochtones avaient \u00e9galement adopt\u00e9 les m\u00eames politiques.\n[89] Il explique au Tribunal que la firme BDL g\u00e9rait tout le programme alors que lui g\u00e9rait le personnel au plan p\u00e9dagogique avec madame Estelle Kaltush. Ainsi, il confirme \u00e9galement que la grille salariale des enseignants pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab 1 \u00bb de la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 24 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par la firme BDL et fut adopt\u00e9e par le Conseil de bande de Natashquan.\n[90] Au mois de juin 2008, il a quitt\u00e9 ses fonctions de directeur d\u2019\u00e9cole.\n[91] En contre-interrogatoire, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignantes, le t\u00e9moin indique au Tribunal que dans la partie du rapport faisant \u00e9tat des t\u00e2ches et conditions de travail (voir la page 17 du rapport \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 35), il n\u2019y avait pas de distinction entre un enseignant autochtone et non autochtone.\n[92] Aussi, au niveau des constats et des recommandations apparaissant au chapitre 7.2 du m\u00eame rapport, le t\u00e9moin indique au Tribunal que le coup de barre n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ussi par lui, tenant compte d\u2019un manque de collaboration et de la frustration g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e au niveau du personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il confirme que l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun pr\u00e9sente des lacunes importantes sur plusieurs aspects, et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00ab les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l\u2019\u00e9cole ne re\u00e7oivent pas les services \u00e9ducatifs auxquels ils ont droit \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 7.2, premier alin\u00e9a, \u00e0 la page 47 de la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 35). Devant les nombreux probl\u00e8mes constat\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, il confirme qu\u2019il existait des d\u00e9rogations afin d\u2019autoriser un enseignant \u00e0 enseigner m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas toutes les qualifications requises, et cela, justement \u00e0 cause des probl\u00e8mes de recrutement.\n[93] Il a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait un conflit interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel surtout au niveau secondaire d\u2019o\u00f9 certaines difficult\u00e9s qui ont engendr\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de frustration, et cela, en tenant compte des coupures salariales appliqu\u00e9es. En cela, il a confirm\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes interrelationnels entre la firme BDL et le personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole, de m\u00eame que le Conseil de bande. Cette situation pr\u00e9valait au mois de juin 2007.\n[94] En ce qui a trait aux frustrations existantes envers l\u2019employeur, le t\u00e9moin indique au tribunal qu\u2019il a eu des conflits avec certains employ\u00e9s et que ces conflits persistaient en tenant compte que certains employ\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9taient oppos\u00e9s aux coupures salariales envisag\u00e9es par le s\u00e9questre et le Conseil de bande.\nGenevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit\n[95] Madame Genevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit est une retrait\u00e9e du domaine de l\u2019enseignement. Elle a toutefois enseign\u00e9 dans des communaut\u00e9s autochtones pendant pr\u00e8s de 40 ans.\n[96] Elle a \u00e9pous\u00e9 un autochtone en 1972 et qu\u2019elle a donc acquis son statut d\u2019autochtone par le fait m\u00eame. Elle \u00e9tait divorc\u00e9e depuis au moins une ann\u00e9e au moment de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[97] Durant les ann\u00e9es 2005-2006 ainsi que 2006-2007, elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. Elle avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9e par madame Alice Kaltush puisqu\u2019il y avait de la disponibilit\u00e9 pour un emploi d\u2019enseignant.\n[98] Dans son t\u00e9moignage elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 20, laquelle est un formulaire de nouvel emploi qu\u2019elle a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de son employeur, soit le Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan.\n[99] Subs\u00e9quemment, madame Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 son contrat d\u2019engagement \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, et ce, pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2006-2007 (voir la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet14).\n[100] Elle a alors confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal son statut de non r\u00e9sidente aupr\u00e8s de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan, et qu\u2019\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard elle avait droit aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, de logement ainsi que de sorties.\n[101] Interrog\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, Madame Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit a confirm\u00e9 que la m\u00eame politique existait dans d\u2019autres communaut\u00e9s autochtones et qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait, quant \u00e0 elle, cette situation tout \u00e0 fait normale.\nJules Wapistan\n[102] Monsieur Jules Wapistan est directeur des ressources humaines de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et ce, depuis le mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2014. Il est au Conseil de bande depuis 1979 et a occup\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes fonctions administratives au sein de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone.\n[103] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Monsieur Wapistan confirme au Tribunal qu\u2019il existe un cogestionnaire avec le Conseil de bande, lequel cogestionnaire fut requis par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes tenant compte de la solvabilit\u00e9 fragile de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone.\n[104] Il a indiqu\u00e9 que cette situation existait depuis 1995-1996 et qu\u2019en 2006, un s\u00e9questre administrateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9. Cette nomination fut effectu\u00e9e sur la base de ratios impos\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes qui indiquait que l\u2019\u00e9tat de la sant\u00e9 financi\u00e8re de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone \u00e9tait pr\u00e9caire.\n[105] Ainsi, la firme BDL fut nomm\u00e9e s\u00e9questre de 2006 \u00e0 2009 et a fait plusieurs propositions concordataires \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents fournisseurs afin de diminuer leurs cr\u00e9ances.\n[106] Il a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal que le mandat du s\u00e9questre administrateur provenait du minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes, qui g\u00e9rait le budget de la communaut\u00e9 et avait le dernier mot sur les d\u00e9cisions de gestion \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de celle-ci.\n[107] En 2009, un changement de cogestionnaire fut effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment. La firme Malette fut alors d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tant une firme comptable. Elle a continu\u00e9 le travail initi\u00e9 par la firme BDL qui avait \u00e9tabli des politiques de gestion dans le cadre d\u2019une recherche d\u2019\u00e9quilibre de budget.\n[108] Aussi, Monsieur Wapistan attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 32, dans laquelle on fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un plan de redressement qui fut accept\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes, et cela, en date du 30 novembre 2006.\n[109] \u00c0 la m\u00eame date, il confirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait coordonnateur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre du plan de redressement et il indique que ce plan fut mis en \u0153uvre, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux r\u00e9solutions apparaissant dans les onglets 36 \u00e0 39 de la pi\u00e8ce I-1.\n[110] Devant la situation des coupures budg\u00e9taires qui devaient \u00eatre impos\u00e9es afin d\u2019obtenir un \u00e9quilibre budg\u00e9taire, la formule du 50 kilom\u00e8tres fut donc mise en place en 2006, et cela, afin de d\u00e9terminer qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9sident et non r\u00e9sident dans l\u2019octroi des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et d\u2019habitation pour lesquelles les plaignantes ont port\u00e9 plainte.\n[111] Cette politique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par le s\u00e9questre administrateur BDL alors cogestionnaire avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. Depuis sept ans, la m\u00eame politique a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la situation financi\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en date de l\u2019audition des pr\u00e9sentes, Monsieur Wapistan confirme au Tribunal que le dernier exercice financier en date du 31 mars 2014 est toujours d\u00e9ficitaire.\n[112] Entre le 31 mars 2007 et le 31 mars 2014, il n\u2019y a eu que deux ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles des surplus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s.\n[113] Interrog\u00e9 \u00e9galement quant \u00e0 un autre document ayant trait \u00e0 un rapport d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, document dat\u00e9 du mois d\u2019avril 2009 par un comit\u00e9 ad hoc (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 25), Monsieur Wapistan indique que certaines recommandations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es alors que d\u2019autres n\u2019ont pas pu l\u2019\u00eatre. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019application relevait du Conseil de bande et un conseiller fut nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, soit monsieur Nicolas Wapistan.\n[114] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la recommandation num\u00e9ro 5 \u00e0 la page 12 du document, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une harmonisation de la politique salariale pour le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation avec celle des \u00e9coles provinciales de la r\u00e9gion, et ce, sans discrimination sur la base de la race ou de la provenance, n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e (voir la recommandation num\u00e9ro 5).\n[115] Cons\u00e9quemment, Monsieur Wapistan a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019il avait entendu parler des plaintes en ce qui a trait aux primes lorsque la firme BDL et lui-m\u00eame s\u2019\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun en 2007. \u00c0 ce moment, il y avait alors eu une rencontre entre les enseignants autochtones qui avaient alors demand\u00e9 les m\u00eames avantages que les enseignants non-autochtones. \u00c0 la fin de son interrogatoire en chef, Monsieur Wapistan a confirm\u00e9 que des primes furent coup\u00e9es \u00e0 des enseignants, lesquels n\u2019\u00e9taient plus consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des non r\u00e9sidents.\n[116] Finalement, monsieur Wapistan a confirm\u00e9 son accord en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 1, qui est un document intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Nutasquan et le Plan Nord \u00bb, lequel fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019inventaire des besoins de la communaut\u00e9 de Natashquan. Ce document est dat\u00e9 du mois de mars 2012. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il confirme le manque criant de logements dont on fait \u00e9tat.\n[117] \u00c9galement, il s\u2019est dit en accord avec la portion de ce document qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation (voir paragraphe 2.1 de la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 1), et consid\u00e8re que la capacit\u00e9 de payer de la communaut\u00e9 est limit\u00e9e. Cons\u00e9quemment, il confirme la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00ab qu\u2019on ne peut pas payer plus. \u00bb\nIII. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des argumentations des parties A. Argumentation des plaignantes [118] Le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignantes soumet qu\u2019il y a lieu de faire droit au paiement des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de logement, et ce, depuis les ann\u00e9es 1989-1990 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, en faveur des plaignantes compte tenu de la discrimination apparaissant dans les r\u00e8gles et les politiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[119] De m\u00eame, il r\u00e9clame des dommages moraux pour toutes les plaignantes consid\u00e9rant la perte d\u2019estime de soi et de l\u2019atteinte \u00e0 leur dignit\u00e9. Il r\u00e9clame encore une fois que le Tribunal mette fin de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte.\n[120] Pour ce qui est de madame \u00c9velyne Malec, le repr\u00e9sentant r\u00e9clame en son nom, le plein d\u00e9dommagement en ce qui a trait aux primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et de logement pour les ann\u00e9es 1989-1990 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui.\n[121] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019existence des primes en tant que telles, le repr\u00e9sentant indique au Tribunal qu\u2019avant 1989, les primes \u00e9taient vers\u00e9es \u00e0 tous, pour des autochtones comme pour les non autochtones, et cela, en un seul montant.\n[122] En 1989, lors de la prise en charge du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation par le Conseil de bande, des changements sont alors survenus.\n[123] Entre 1989 et 2007, le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignantes a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait pas de primes pour les autochtones, qui sont alors disparues, mais qu\u2019il y en avait pour les non autochtones.\n[124] Il soutient qu\u2019avec le temps, certains non autochtones s\u2019installaient dans la communaut\u00e9 de Natashquan, mais qu\u2019ils continuaient \u00e0 garder leurs primes alors que des r\u00e9sidents autochtones n\u2019en avaient pas, d\u2019o\u00f9 la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[125] En 2005, il a constat\u00e9 un changement avec la pr\u00e9sence du s\u00e9questre administrateur, soit la firme BDL.\n[126] Il a alors constat\u00e9 que les quittances qui avaient fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement entre les plaignantes et le Conseil de bande furent alors coup\u00e9es et l\u2019\u00e9talement arr\u00eat\u00e9.\n[127] De m\u00eame, il a confirm\u00e9 une rencontre avec monsieur Wapistan et la firme BDL, dont un avertissement fut servi \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re.\n[128] En 2007, une nouvelle politique fut alors \u00e9tablie.\n[129] En terminant, le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignantes indique :\n- Que ces derni\u00e8res se sentent discrimin\u00e9es ;\n- Qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune rel\u00e8ve comme enseignant afin de donner de l\u2019instruction \u00e0 la nation autochtone de Natashquan ;\n- Que les plaignantes ont d\u00fb faire des plaintes \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes instances afin d\u2019obtenir le remboursement de certaines sommes d\u2019argent qui leur \u00e9taient dues suite \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes contractuels qu\u2019elles ont v\u00e9cus avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 ;\n- Qu\u2019elles veulent mettre fin \u00e0 la discrimination salariale par l\u2019abandon des politiques des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement et d\u2019habitation.\nB. Argumentation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [130] Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique au Tribunal que le litige consiste \u00e0 savoir si la discrimination existe au niveau des primes, soit celles d\u2019\u00e9loignement et d\u2019habitation. Il a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que je n\u2019avais pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider du bien-fond\u00e9 ou non des politiques salariales qui furent adopt\u00e9es.\n[131] De m\u00eame, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019une preuve de discrimination prima facie, en contravention des articles 3 et 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne (la Loi), n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e.\n[132] Il soutient que la politique en jeu ne discrimine pas sur la base de la race ou de l\u2019origine ethnique. La distinction qu\u2019elle cr\u00e9\u00e9e serait plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9e sur la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9finition de r\u00e9sidence sur la r\u00e9serve indienne. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9finitions dans les documents \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, aux onglets 6, 7 et 24, en ce qui a trait aux diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9finitions des termes \u00ab r\u00e9sident \u00bb et \u00ab non r\u00e9sident. \u00bb\n[133] Cons\u00e9quemment, il soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination suivant l\u2019ensemble de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal.\n[134] Toutefois, si j\u2019en venais \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il existait une telle preuve prima facie, il soumet qu\u2019il y aurait une preuve justificative quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de contraintes importantes au plan financier dans la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan. Ainsi, il y aurait donc preuve de justification ad\u00e9quate quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[135] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la situation financi\u00e8re pr\u00e9caire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui existe depuis les ann\u00e9es 2005-2006 et qui perdure toujours. En ce sens, il affirme que la m\u00eame politique en ce qui concerne le redressement financier appliqu\u00e9 fut adopt\u00e9e non seulement au niveau du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, mais \u00e9galement au niveau du secteur de la sant\u00e9 de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan. Les m\u00eames restrictions budg\u00e9taires furent \u00e9galement appliqu\u00e9es en ce qui a trait au personnel de soutien de l\u2019\u00e9cole qui n\u2019a pas, non plus, obtenu de primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement (voir la pi\u00e8ce I-1, onglet 30, \u00e0 la page 3).\n[136] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir l\u2019existence des quittances (voir la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 11) et en ce sens, les plaignantes auraient renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur recours afin d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9dommag\u00e9es. Cons\u00e9quemment, il indique que je ne peux aller ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date du 19 ao\u00fbt 2004 quant \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation des plaignantes.\n[137] Ainsi, si un redressement devait \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 par le Tribunal, il devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2004-2005 et subs\u00e9quemment, s\u2019il y a lieu.\n[138] En dernier ressort, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique que je peux limiter le redressement qui est recherch\u00e9 par les plaignantes m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de prescription quant \u00e0 leur recours.\n[139] Il indique que les plaintes datent du mois de mars 2007 et que certaines des plaignantes ne se sont pas plaintes, m\u00eame \u00e0 leur mari, alors que ce dernier pouvait \u00eatre chef de bande. Il me demande donc de tenir compte de la conduite des plaignantes dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\nIV. Analyse [140] Apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, de m\u00eame que de leur argumentation, j\u2019en viens \u00e0 la conclusion que la plainte des plaignantes ne peut \u00eatre accueillie, et cela, pour les motifs suivants.\n[141] En effet, les plaignantes ont expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal qu\u2019elles se consid\u00e8rent \u00eatre victimes de discrimination par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de par le fait qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas obtenu, au m\u00eame titre que certains enseignants non autochtones, le paiement de certaines primes, soit des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, des primes au logement ainsi que de sorties.\n[142] Dans leur plainte \u00e9crite, dat\u00e9e du 21 avril 2007, la plaignante principale, madame \u00c9velyne Malec, indique plus particuli\u00e8rement que : \u00ab quand je travaille, je me sens d\u00e9valoris\u00e9e, car je n\u2019ai pas droit aux m\u00eames avantages que les non-autochtones. \u00bb\n[143] De fait, l\u2019essence de la plainte des plaignantes pour laquelle l\u2019audition a eu lieu et sur laquelle toutes les plaignantes ont fait valoir leur revendication \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du Tribunal, se d\u00e9finit plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment comme suit : elles veulent obtenir les m\u00eames avantages salariaux que ceux des professeurs non autochtones qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9s afin de venir enseigner \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone de Natashquan.\n[144] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de leur revendication salariale, les plaignantes indiquent qu\u2019elles seraient victimes de discrimination \u00e0 cause de leur race.\n[145] Ainsi, le Tribunal constate que les plaignantes consid\u00e8rent que les dispositions de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9es sur la base de la race ou de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[146] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est donc utile de rappeler les dispositions de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi qui se lit comme suit :\n\u00ab 3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(2) Une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l\u2019accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. \u00bb\n[147] Lors de l\u2019audience, les parties n\u2019ont pas fait \u00e9tat des autres dispositions de la Loi d\u00e9crivant que certains actes discriminatoires auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis \u00e0 leur endroit.\n[148] Apr\u00e8s analyse, il semble au Tribunal que les dispositions de l\u2019article 7 soient plus particuli\u00e8rement vis\u00e9es au regard des all\u00e9gations que les plaignantes ont formul\u00e9es. En ce sens, les plaignantes m\u2019ont fait valoir qu\u2019elles se sentaient d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es au cours de leur emploi par certaines dispositions apparaissant dans des politiques administratives adopt\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[149] Cons\u00e9quemment, je reprends donc les dispositions de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, lesquelles se lisent comme suit :\n\u00ab 7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi. \u00bb\n[150] Dans leur expos\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions et redressements recherch\u00e9s, dat\u00e9 du 30 janvier 2009, les m\u00eames reproches sont adress\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les plaignantes font valoir :\n\u00ab qu\u2019il y a depuis longtemps un \u00e9tat de fait qui dure depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es \u00e0 savoir que les femmes autochtones n\u2019ont pas les avantages salariaux que les non-autochtones. Cet \u00e9tat de fait est connu de tous et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 une mani\u00e8re de diminuer les d\u00e9penses.

En effet, le vrai d\u00e9bat, c\u2019est celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par les plaignantes et qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non une personne r\u00e9side \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du rayon de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan, tel qu\u2019il appert aux diff\u00e9rents documents que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement, et non pas entre autochtones et non autochtones.\n[169] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal aimerait souligner le fait que l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9, madame Genevi\u00e8ve Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit, \u00e9tait une personne vivant \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du rayon de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan, mais qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait le statut d\u2019autochtone par le fait qu\u2019elle avait mari\u00e9 un autochtone ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[170] Or, il appert que madame Taschereau-N\u00e9ashit a pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement, de logement et de sorties malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une autochtone non r\u00e9sidente (voir les pi\u00e8ces I-1, onglet 14 et I-1, onglet 20). De ce fait, je ne peux donc retenir l\u2019argument des plaignantes \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il y aurait discrimination entre autochtones et non-autochtones comme telle.\n[171] \u00c0 l\u2019appui du pr\u00e9sent jugement, j\u2019aimerais faire \u00e9tat de la jurisprudence suivante.\n[172] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] C.S.C. 4, au paragraphe 49, l\u2019honorable juge Abella indique ce qui suit :\n\u00ab 49 Il en r\u00e9sulte une diff\u00e9rence entre discrimination et distinction. Les distinctions ne sont pas toutes discriminatoires. Il ne suffit pas de contester le comportement d\u2019un employeur pour le motif que ce qu\u2019il a fait a eu une incidence n\u00e9gative sur un membre d\u2019un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9. La seule appartenance \u00e0 un tel groupe n\u2019est pas suffisante pour garantir l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration fond\u00e9e sur les droits de la personne. C\u2019est le lien qui existe entre l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 ce groupe et le caract\u00e8re arbitraire du crit\u00e8re ou comportement d\u00e9savantageux \u2014 \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue ou de par son effet \u2014 qui suscite la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9paration. Et ce fardeau de preuve pr\u00e9liminaire incombe au demandeur. \u00bb\n[Je souligne]\n[173] Dans une autre d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, soit Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), (2012) C.S.C. 61, il est indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 33 de la d\u00e9cision :\n\u00ab [33] Comme l\u2019a \u00e0 juste titre reconnu le Tribunal, pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le Code contre la discrimination, qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement au service concern\u00e9 et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Une fois la discrimination \u00e9tablie \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors le fardeau de justifier la conduite ou la pratique suivant le r\u00e9gime d\u2019exemptions pr\u00e9vu par les lois sur les droits de la personne. Si la conduite ou pratique ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal conclura \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination. \u00bb\n[174] Bien que je sois en accord avec le fait que les deux premi\u00e8res conditions soient accomplies en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la troisi\u00e8me condition, soit une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e qui ait pu constituer un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e \u00e0 mon avis.\n[175] En effet, tel que je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, le crit\u00e8re de r\u00e9sidence n\u2019appara\u00eet pas dans les motifs de distinction illicite apparaissant \u00e0 l\u2019article 3, alin\u00e9a 1, de la Loi.\n[176] Ce raisonnement a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi dans une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans Dobbin c. Canada (minist\u00e8re des P\u00eaches et des Oc\u00e9ans), 2005 C.R. 2010, qui a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 le principe que le lieu de r\u00e9sidence d\u2019une personne ne constitue pas un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 de discrimination.\n[177] En cela, je fais miens les paragraphes suivants de la d\u00e9cision Dobbin :\n\u00ab [8] Je conclus que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de d\u00e9clarer la plainte des demandeurs irrecevable en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 41(1)c) de la Loi n'est pas entach\u00e9e d'erreur susceptible de contr\u00f4le. Comme le lieu de r\u00e9sidence d'une personne ne constitue pas un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 de discrimination, il s'ensuit que la Commission n'est pas comp\u00e9tente pour conna\u00eetre d'une diff\u00e9rence de traitement dont seraient victimes les p\u00eacheurs de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador, en comparaison avec les p\u00eacheurs d'autres provinces, en raison des quotas institu\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur. Les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence ne constituent pas un motif de discrimination prohib\u00e9 par la Loi. Il est clair qu'elle ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 la Commission le pouvoir d'enqu\u00eater sur la mani\u00e8re dont les r\u00e9sidents ou groupes de r\u00e9sidents d'une province ou d'un territoire peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s par un minist\u00e8re ou par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 relevant de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale par rapport au traitement accord\u00e9 aux r\u00e9sidents ou groupes de r\u00e9sidents d'une autre province ou d'un autre territoire.\n[9] Il y a de nombreux cas o\u00f9 des personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es diff\u00e9remment en raison de leur \u00ab lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb. Cela ne constitue normalement pas un motif de discrimination ou une distinction interdit par la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Nova Scotia Confederation of University Faculty Assn. c. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), [1995] N.S.J. no 296 (C.S.N.-\u00c9.) (QL), la Cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a examin\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision de la Commission des droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, qui avait rejet\u00e9 une plainte fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb. Dans cette affaire, le motif de discrimination \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9 par l'imposition de frais de scolarit\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaires aux \u00e9tudiants \u00e9trangers par les universit\u00e9s de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. La cour a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, qui avait conclu que la plainte ne relevait pas de sa comp\u00e9tence parce que la diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le \u00ab lieu de r\u00e9sidence \u00bb. Voir aussi Simon Fraser University International Students c. Simon Fraser University, [1996] B.C.C.H.R.D. no 13 (Commission des droits de la personne de la C.-B.) (QL).\n[10] En outre, la plainte des demandeurs ne fait \u00e9tat d'aucun fait donnant \u00e0 penser que la d\u00e9cision du d\u00e9fendeur de refuser d'accorder les m\u00eames possibilit\u00e9s de p\u00eache dans la ZPC 16 aux p\u00eacheurs bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Terre-Neuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e, en tout ou en partie, par le fait que les demandeurs, en qualit\u00e9 de Terre-Neuviens, sont diff\u00e9rents sur le plan ethnique ou constituent un groupe distinct des p\u00eacheurs bas\u00e9s dans d'autres provinces en raison de leur origine nationale. Le fait est que la ZPC 16 est g\u00e9r\u00e9e par la r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec. Il semble que le quota accord\u00e9 en 2002 pour la ZPC 16 aux p\u00eacheurs de la ZPC 13 bas\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur en consultation avec les milieux de l'industrie de la p\u00eache dans la r\u00e9gion du Qu\u00e9bec. Si le d\u00e9fendeur a favoris\u00e9 les p\u00eacheurs bas\u00e9s au Qu\u00e9bec lorsqu'il a attribu\u00e9 les quotas en litige, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement est manifestement fond\u00e9e sur leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence et non pas sur une origine ethnique ou nationale particuli\u00e8re. \u00bb\n[Je souligne]\n[178] Dans une autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique, dans l\u2019affaire Gardezi (Gardezi v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, 2010 B.C.H.R.T. 262), les principes de l\u2019arr\u00eat Dobbin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affirm\u00e9s.\n[179] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il est indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 40 de cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cision :\n\u00ab [40] Ms. Gardezi\u2019s complaint is, at its root, a complaint based on her last place of residence. Place of residence, standing on its own, is not a prohibited ground of discrimination. \u00bb\n[180] Cons\u00e9quemment, et pour les raisons que je viens d\u2019exprimer ci-avant, je consid\u00e8re que la plainte des plaignantes n\u2019est nullement fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit et, pour ce seul motif, elle est donc rejet\u00e9e.\n[181] \u00c0 titre compl\u00e9mentaire, j\u2019aimerai rajouter que dans l\u2019alternative o\u00f9 j\u2019en serais venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une preuve prima facie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, ce que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision ne reconna\u00eet pas, je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait r\u00e9ussi dans sa preuve \u00e0 prouver au Tribunal que les politiques administratives qu\u2019il a appliqu\u00e9es n\u2019apparaissent pas excessives, plus particuli\u00e8rement en tenant compte des conditions financi\u00e8res de l\u2019intim\u00e9, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9es de \u00ab catastrophiques \u00bb par le t\u00e9moin Jules Wapistan.\n[182] Aussi, je consid\u00e8re que les conduites ou pratiques adopt\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vertu des diff\u00e9rentes politiques administratives qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9es ne sauraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme injustifi\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 l\u2019honorable juge Abella dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\nV. Conclusion [183] Pour toutes les raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-avant, la plainte des plaignantes est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1318\/4808\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : \u00c9velyne Malec et autres c.

Contexte [1] La plaignante, madame Fallan Davis, dans une plainte dat\u00e9e du 24 novembre 2006 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Commission), demande de faire reconna\u00eetre que certains des agissements de repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e, soit l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e), soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires en raison de sa race, de son \u00e2ge et de son sexe, et cela, en contravention avec les dispositions de l'article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (Loi).\n[2] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements seraient survenus en date du 18 novembre 2005, au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpell\u00e9e par les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lors de son retour des \u00c9tats-Unis en empruntant le poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e situ\u00e9 sur l'\u00eele de Cornwall, Ontario.\n[3] La plaignante indique dans sa plainte qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e sans avertissement et fut forc\u00e9e de se tenir \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule, sans manteau, alors qu'il faisait froid, et cela, pour une p\u00e9riode de quarante cinq minutes.\n[4] Elle mentionne dans sa plainte \u00e9galement que les agents, alors en place et faisant partie de l\u2019unit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale connue comme \u00e9tant le syst\u00e8me d\u2019inspection des v\u00e9hicules et du fret (VACIS), auraient fait preuve de comportements racistes et auraient agi de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e envers elle.\n[5] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elle fait \u00e9tat que son identit\u00e9 d\u2019autochtone de Onkwehonwe aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9e par les agissements des agents de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[6] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que toute cette op\u00e9ration se serait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e dans le cadre d'une op\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite \u00e0 ce moment au poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e situ\u00e9 sur l'Ile de Cornwall, Ontario, et cela, afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification de v\u00e9hicules comme celui de la plaignante. Cette op\u00e9ration devait permettre de v\u00e9rifier si ces v\u00e9hicules pouvaient comporter de compartiments secrets, permettant ainsi le transport de drogues, d'armes ou d'autres effets de contrebande ill\u00e9gaux.\n[7] Cette op\u00e9ration men\u00e9e par les agents de l'intim\u00e9e en date de 18 novembre 2005 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 command\u00e9e par un agent de \u00ab l'Intelligence \u00bb de l'intim\u00e9e travaillant sur l'\u00eele de Cornwall qui aurait requis la pr\u00e9sence de l'\u00e9quipe VACIS afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'examen des v\u00e9hicules par scanner. Cette op\u00e9ration incluait la v\u00e9rification des v\u00e9hicules tels que : SUV, mini-fourgonnette, camions remorques et d'autres v\u00e9hicules non commerciaux.\n[8] Selon la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue au tribunal, il est donc question d'examiner les comportements tant de la plaignante que ceux des repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e et de v\u00e9rifier si les agissements des repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e envers la plaignante ont pu donner un fondement \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante, telle que d\u00e9crite auparavant.\n[9] Tel que le pr\u00e9sent jugement l\u2019expliquera, il est de mon intention de faire droit \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante.\nII. Les faits A. Preuve de la plaignante [10] En date du 18 novembre 2005, vers 10 h 30 du matin, alors que la plaignante empruntait le poste frontalier de l'\u00eele de Cornwall, Ontario, \u00e0 son retour des \u00c9tats-Unis, elle fut interpell\u00e9e par un des agents de l'intim\u00e9e afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen de son v\u00e9hicule par voie de scanner.\n[11] La plaignante indique au tribunal que normalement, elle utilise une voie d\u2019entr\u00e9e au poste frontalier sp\u00e9cialement r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux autochtones r\u00e9sidant sur l'\u00eele de Cornwall. Avant d\u2019utiliser sa voie d\u2019entr\u00e9e, elle fut interpel\u00e9e par un des agents de l'intim\u00e9e afin d'\u00eatre r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e vers la voie normalement utilis\u00e9e par des v\u00e9hicules de transport commerciaux.\n[12] Elle indique \u00e9galement au tribunal que, de fa\u00e7on quotidienne, elle utilise le poste frontalier de l'\u00eele de Cornwall \u00e0 raison d\u2019une dizaine de fois par jour.\n[13] \u00c9galement, elle indique au tribunal que la journ\u00e9e du 18 novembre 2005 \u00e9tait une journ\u00e9e ensoleill\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019il faisait froid, \u00e0 raison de moins 6 degr\u00e9s Celsius.\n[14] Au moment de cette interception, la plaignante indique au tribunal qu\u2019elle a alors reconnu un premier agent, soit l\u2019agent Derek O\u2019Brien. Ce dernier lui a alors demand\u00e9 si elle avait des cigarettes de contrebande, de l\u2019alcool, des armes \u00e0 feu et d'autres biens, ce \u00e0 quoi elle a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 toutes les questions. Elle a alors fourni son permis de conduire de conducteur \u00e0 l'agent O\u2019Brien.\n[15] Suivant les instructions de l'agent O\u2019Brien, elle a donc dirig\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule vers la voie normalement consacr\u00e9e aux v\u00e9hicules commerciaux situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9difice commercial o\u00f9 \u00e9tait alors situ\u00e9e l\u2019unit\u00e9 VACIS qui devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019examen de son v\u00e9hicule par scanner.\n[16] Comme la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait jamais all\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de cette b\u00e2tisse commerciale, elle \u00e9tait alors apeur\u00e9e face \u00e0 cette situation irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais v\u00e9cue auparavant. Elle rappelle alors au tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e que de 23 ans au moment des faits.\n[17] Une fois rendue \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9difice commercial, elle fut alors interpel\u00e9e par un deuxi\u00e8me agent de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle indique au tribunal qu\u2019elle avait pris la d\u00e9cision de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner sa grand-m\u00e8re afin de l'informer de la situation qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occupante quant \u00e0 elle.\n[18] Selon les instructions de ce deuxi\u00e8me agent, elle aurait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de se diriger vers un camion et de sortir de son v\u00e9hicule. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment qu\u2019elle aurait alors not\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d'un gros camion blanc, lequel comportait un bras \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de celui-ci. Elle aurait \u00e9galement not\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence de panneaux d'arr\u00eat stop \u00e9crits de fa\u00e7on exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, et elle aurait constat\u00e9 l'annotation \u00ab danger radiation \u00bb sur un des panneaux.\n[19] Au moment des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier, la plaignante conduisait un v\u00e9hicule de type DENALI GMC noir portant un num\u00e9ro de licence ontarienne.\n[20] Suivant les instructions de ce deuxi\u00e8me agent, la plaignante s\u2019est alors dirig\u00e9e vers le camion blanc en question et est sortie de son v\u00e9hicule afin de se tenir dans un endroit qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9.\n[21] Une fois sortie de son v\u00e9hicule, un troisi\u00e8me agent de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s'est alors dirig\u00e9 vers elle et lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 de se tenir dans un endroit sp\u00e9cifiquement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et s\u00e9curitaire.\n[22] Elle indique au tribunal que c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment qu\u2019elle a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 blasph\u00e9mer aupr\u00e8s de ce troisi\u00e8me agent tout en sautant sur ses jambes, et cela, afin de pouvoir se r\u00e9chauffer. Elle indique alors au tribunal qu\u2019elle aurait alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce troisi\u00e8me agent de lui redonner ses pi\u00e8ces d'identification et ce dernier lui aurait alors r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 qu'il lui redonnerait ses pi\u00e8ces d'identification une fois que les op\u00e9rations de scanner seront termin\u00e9es.\n[23] La plaignante indique qu\u2019elle aurait demand\u00e9 la permission d'aller \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du poste de l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de se r\u00e9chauffer et d'attendre \u00e0 cet endroit jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de la proc\u00e9dure de scanner sur son v\u00e9hicule.\n[24] Cette permission lui fut refus\u00e9e par ce troisi\u00e8me agent et il lui aurait alors intim\u00e9 l'ordre de rester \u00e0 cet endroit o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait.\n[25] Toujours en communication avec sa grand-m\u00e8re avec son cellulaire, la plaignante indique que sa grand-m\u00e8re aurait appel\u00e9 un d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 John Boots, lequel est un des anciens de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone d\u2019Akwesasne. Sa grand-m\u00e8re l\u2019informe que ledit John Boots lui am\u00e8nerait une couverture afin de pouvoir se r\u00e9chauffer.\n[26] Durant cette s\u00e9quence, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pleurer et aurait demand\u00e9 aux agents en place ce qui se passait et ce qu'ils cherchaient dans son v\u00e9hicule. Elle aurait eu comme r\u00e9ponse [Traduction] \u00ab tout et rien \u00bb, avec une r\u00e9ponse \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle semblait d\u00e9finitivement coupable de quelque chose selon eux.\n[27] Le troisi\u00e8me agent de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avec lequel elle se trouvait lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 si elle transportait des cigarettes de contrebande, tout en concluant selon lui que les op\u00e9rations de scanner sur le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante devraient permettre de trouver des cigarettes de contrebande.\n[28] La plaignante indique au tribunal qu'elle aurait alors r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cet officier qu'elle travaillait dans une boutique situ\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats-Unis. L'agent en question aurait alors \u00e9mis des rires \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante, en se moquant.\n[29] Devant l\u2019attitude de ce troisi\u00e8me agent, elle lui aurait demand\u00e9 de s\u2019identifier et ce dernier lui aurait alors montr\u00e9 son insigne en lui indiquant : [Traduction] \u00ab vous voyez cette insigne, est-ce que vous savez ce que cette insigne repr\u00e9sente? \u00bb.\n[30] La plaignante lui aurait alors r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne le savait pas et que de toute fa\u00e7on, elle ne s'en souciait pas. Elle aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent qu'il \u00e9tait sur son territoire, en indiquant : [Traduction] \u00ab ici c'est mon territoire \u00bb et \u00e0 ce moment, l'agent lui aurait r\u00e9pondu [Traduction] \u00ab savez-vous ce que notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pense de vous? \u00bb en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 autochtone o\u00f9 elle vivait.\n[31] Quelques minutes plus tard John Boots est effectivement arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux. Elle indique au tribunal que ce troisi\u00e8me agent aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s impoli \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Monsieur Boots et que cet agent lui aurait demand\u00e9 de se tenir \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart de la sc\u00e8ne.\n[32] Dans cette s\u00e9quence factuelle, un quatri\u00e8me agent est alors intervenu, lequel avait en sa possession des re\u00e7us pour diff\u00e9rents objets qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s dans le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante. Ce quatri\u00e8me agent lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 de se diriger \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'\u00e9difice principal du poste frontalier afin que cette derni\u00e8re paie des taxes sur les objets qu'elle aurait achet\u00e9s aux \u00c9tats-Unis. La plaignante indique au tribunal qu'elle n'a jamais pay\u00e9 de taxes sur quoi que ce soit, tenant compte de son statut d\u2019autochtone.\n[33] La plaignante indique au tribunal que lors de la fouille, tout son v\u00e9hicule fut inspect\u00e9, et indique que les agents qui avaient proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la fouille auraient essay\u00e9 d'arracher les si\u00e8ges de son v\u00e9hicule.\n[34] \u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'\u00e9difice principal du poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante aurait alors rencontr\u00e9 le superintendant du poste et elle aurait alors confirm\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les objets qui furent retrouv\u00e9s dans son v\u00e9hicule, soit plus particuli\u00e8rement des jouets et des jeans, indiquant qu'elle n'avait pas eu la chance de le faire.\n[35] Elle indique \u00e9galement au tribunal qu'une fois \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de cet \u00e9difice, elle aurait v\u00e9cu de l'hyperventilation, pleur\u00e9 encore une fois tout en se sentant outrag\u00e9e de la situation qu'elle venait de vivre.\n[36] Dans la m\u00eame s\u00e9quence de son t\u00e9moignage, elle indique qu'elle ne se souvenait pas d'avoir mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait pour appeler la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk, m\u00eame si dans son for int\u00e9rieur, cela ne lui apparaissait pas comme une mauvaise id\u00e9e. Elle consid\u00e9rait les gens de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk comme \u00e9tant des gardiens de la paix pour elle.\n[37] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la plaignante indique qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de moqueries de la part des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inspection de son v\u00e9hicule.\n[38] Elle consid\u00e8re que toute cette situation en fut une de confrontation et fut apeurante quant \u00e0 elle. Elle consid\u00e8re que le troisi\u00e8me agent qui lui a parl\u00e9 alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule n'aurait pas agi de fa\u00e7on correcte ou ad\u00e9quate suivant le code de conduite qui le r\u00e9gissait et il n'aurait rien fait afin d\u2019apaiser la situation.\n[39] Elle r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie isol\u00e9e, sans l'appui de personne, devant tous ces hommes qui \u00e9taient habill\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, et surtout, avec une indication qu'il y avait un danger de radiation sur les lieux. Elle indique au tribunal qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte \u00e0 ce moment et confirme qu\u2019aucun des agents sur les lieux ne lui aurait demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait effectivement enceinte avant d'entreprendre les man\u0153uvres de scanner sur son v\u00e9hicule.\n[40] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante est revenue sur son altercation avec le troisi\u00e8me agent de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui aurait fait preuve d\u2019une plus grande confrontation envers elle. Elle avoue encore une fois avoir dit \u00e0 cet agent qu'il \u00e9tait sur son territoire et que ce territoire n\u2019appartenait pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle vivait non loin du poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur l'\u00eele de Cornwall et une fois inform\u00e9 de ce fait, ce troisi\u00e8me agent lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9fiante, si elle \u00e9tait pour s'enfuir.\n[41] Pr\u00e9cisant les faits survenus lors du 18 novembre 2005, la plaignante confirme que l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 les op\u00e9rations de scanner ont eu lieu \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9 par des c\u00f4nes orange. C'est \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de ce p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre marqu\u00e9 par ces c\u00f4nes que les op\u00e9rations de scanner furent entreprises.\n[42] Elle confirme \u00e9galement qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e au froid pendant une p\u00e9riode de quarante minutes environ. Elle confirme que la dur\u00e9e de la fouille sur son v\u00e9hicule aurait pris environ de dix \u00e0 quinze minutes.\n[43] Face \u00e0 toute l\u2019op\u00e9ration qui a eu lieu le 18 novembre 2005, la plaignante consid\u00e8re que cette situation s'apparentait \u00e0 celle d\u2019un viol quant \u00e0 elle. Elle a qualifi\u00e9 les agents de l'intim\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant des agresseurs, lesquels lui auraient caus\u00e9 une grande peur qu'elle \u00e9prouverait toujours. Depuis ce temps, elle se consid\u00e8re comme une paria lorsqu\u2019elle utilise le poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[44] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la plaignante a identifi\u00e9 le troisi\u00e8me agent avec lequel elle aurait eu une confrontation comme \u00e9tant celui portant le num\u00e9ro d\u2019insigne 11275, soit l\u2019agent Denis Demers.\n[45] Finalement, elle informe le tribunal que suite \u00e0 ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements, elle aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de porter plainte contre les agents en question, mais elle ne fut pas retenue contre ces derniers. Elle indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle se serait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant le conseil de bande de sa communaut\u00e9 autochtone afin de parler au chef de la communaut\u00e9 et de lui faire savoir ce qui est arriv\u00e9. Ce dernier l\u2019aurait alors inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat de porter plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\nB. Contre-interrogatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [46] En contre-interrogatoire par l\u2019avocat de la Commission, la plaignante a \u00e9galement r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 les paroles qui auraient alors \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es par l\u2019agent Demers qui lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 dans ces termes : [Traduction] \u00ab Est-ce que vous savez ce que notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pense de vous? \u00bb\n[47] Elle consid\u00e8re que les paroles prononc\u00e9es par l\u2019agent Demers ainsi que son comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont discriminatoires, surtout du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Elle consid\u00e8re que les agents de l'intim\u00e9e lors de cette journ\u00e9e ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une utilisation abusive de leurs pouvoirs.\n[48] De m\u00eame, la plaignante indique au tribunal que suite aux faits qui sont survenus le 18 novembre 2005, elle aurait effectu\u00e9 certaines recherches sur l'Internet afin de conna\u00eetre les effets potentiels des radiations auxquelles elle aurait pu \u00eatre expos\u00e9e et surtout des effets sur son enfant \u00e0 na\u00eetre. Elle indique au tribunal que c\u2019est \u00e0 partir de cette derni\u00e8re recherche qu\u2019elle aurait pris la d\u00e9cision de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019avortement de son enfant \u00e0 na\u00eetre. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'avortement de son enfant \u00e0 na\u00eetre en date du 2 d\u00e9cembre 2005, soit 19 jours apr\u00e8s les incidents du 18 novembre 2005.\n[49] De m\u00eame, en contre-interrogatoire, elle a admis qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait fait aucune mention de son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une premi\u00e8re fois dans un premier document dat\u00e9 du 13 juillet 2007, soit un document intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab R\u00e9plique de Fallan Davis \u00bb adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission (voir la pi\u00e8ce R-5, pages 4, 26 et 27).\n[50] Cons\u00e9quemment, elle confirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune mention de son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte dans son affidavit dat\u00e9 du 21 novembre 2005, lequel affidavit faisait \u00e9tat de tous les faits relatifs aux incidents du 18 novembre 2005.\n[51] De m\u00eame, la plaignante confirme au tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait fait aucune mention de son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui fut alors d\u00e9clench\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, par le biais de sa repr\u00e9sentante, soit madame Lucinda Reading, laquelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mandat\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante mentionne que Madame Reading ne lui aurait pas fait de demandes sp\u00e9cifiques quant \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte.\n[52] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, la plaignante a \u00e9galement admis au tribunal qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas fait \u00e9tat de sa situation de femme enceinte lors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en date du 23 novembre 2006 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission (pi\u00e8ce R-2, onglet 96).\n[53] \u00c0 une autre question du procureur de l'intim\u00e9e, relativement \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte, la plaignante indique au tribunal qu'un autre de ses enfants, n\u00e9 en 2007, soit l'enfant Georgia Jacob n\u00e9e le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2007, aurait pu \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint par les effets de la radiation suite aux op\u00e9rations de scanner effectu\u00e9es le 18 novembre 2005. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 un de ses affidavits dat\u00e9s du 28 octobre 2008, dans lequel on retrouve la mention \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019enfant Georgia souffrait de paralysie de Bell, soit une affection m\u00e9dicale tr\u00e8s rare. La plaignante soutient que son enfant Georgia pouvait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint par les effets de radiation de la machine VACIS.\n[54] Encore une fois, la plaignante a reconnu au tribunal qu'elle n'avait fait aucun test m\u00e9dical afin d'\u00e9valuer les niveaux de radiations auxquelles elle aurait pu \u00eatre expos\u00e9e par les effets des op\u00e9rations de scanner effectu\u00e9es le 18 novembre 2005.\n[55] Dans son contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante indique au tribunal qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait toujours de la peur lorsqu'elle utilise le poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, maintenant situ\u00e9 non loin de la Ville de Cornwall.\n[56] En effet, la plaignante indique au tribunal que le poste frontalier situ\u00e9 sur l'\u00eele de Cornwall fut ferm\u00e9 en date du 31 mai 2009 afin d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 sur la rive-nord, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9e la Ville de Cornwall.\n[57] Elle indique qu\u2019elle a toujours peur lorsqu\u2019elle utilise ledit poste frontalier de l'\u00eele de Cornwall, tout comme certains autres membres de sa communaut\u00e9 autochtone qui auraient \u00e9galement \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s avec les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans le pass\u00e9.\n[58] \u00c0 une autre question du procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a alors admis qu\u2019un autre \u00e9v\u00e9nement serait survenu en date du 6 ao\u00fbt 2005, alors que le v\u00e9hicule dans lequel se trouvait la plaignante fut alors fouill\u00e9 par les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce moment, la plaignante \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e de sa belle-s\u0153ur, soit madame M\u00e9lissa Papineau.

Sans reprendre dans l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait entendre, le tribunal se limitera aux agents qui ont directement \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec la plaignante et pour lesquels cette derni\u00e8re a port\u00e9 plainte en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de discrimination qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue.\nAgent Derek O\u2019Brien\n[107] Ainsi, \u00e0 titre de premier t\u00e9moin directement impliqu\u00e9 avec la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait entendre l\u2019agent Derek O\u2019Brien, lequel devait \u00eatre en charge de la s\u00e9lection des v\u00e9hicules sujets \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS en date du 18 novembre 2005.\n[108] Ainsi, l\u2019agent O\u2019Brien devait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 les [Traduction] \u00ab inspections primaires \u00bb, et ce, avant que les v\u00e9hicules arrivent directement aux portes d\u2019entr\u00e9e du poste frontalier.\n[109] Selon l\u2019agent O\u2019Brien, une op\u00e9ration sp\u00e9cifique relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inspection des v\u00e9hicules de type SUV ainsi que des pick-up devait avoir lieu cette journ\u00e9e.\n[110] Ainsi, vers 10 h 30 du matin du 18 novembre 2005, il a alors aper\u00e7u le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante qui se dirigeait vers la voie 4, celle r\u00e9serv\u00e9e pour les v\u00e9hicules conduits par des r\u00e9sidents autochtones.\n[111] \u00c0 ce moment, il a not\u00e9 que Madame Davis conduisait un gros SUV de couleur noire.\n[112] Tenant compte que le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante correspondait au type de v\u00e9hicule requis pour les fins de l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS, il a alors indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019arr\u00eater afin de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une inspection sommaire du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante.\n[113] Comme le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante \u00e9tait dot\u00e9 de vitres teint\u00e9es, l\u2019agent O\u2019Brien a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il ignorait qui \u00e9tait le conducteur du v\u00e9hicule en question lorsqu\u2019il l\u2019a arr\u00eat\u00e9.\n[114] Une fois que le conducteur eu baiss\u00e9 sa vitre, il a alors reconnu la plaignante qui \u00e9tait une r\u00e9sidente de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone d\u2019Akwesasne, sans toutefois se souvenir de son nom en particulier.\n[115] Au moment de son interrogatoire pour les fins d\u2019inspection primaire, il a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019avait eu aucune dispute avec la plaignante ant\u00e9rieurement et qu\u2019elle avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 polie et qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses questions \u00e0 chaque fois.\n[116] Lors de son interpellation le 18 novembre 2005, il lui a alors demand\u00e9 si elle avait des biens \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer, ce \u00e0 quoi elle a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette question.\n[117] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu aux questions suivantes, \u00e0 savoir si elle avait de l\u2019alcool ou du tabac, des armes \u00e0 feu ou si elle transportait des biens d\u2019une valeur sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 10 000 $.\n[118] Une fois que la plaignante eu r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 toutes ces questions, il a alors r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un formulaire E-67, lequel est un formulaire devant permettre de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une inspection secondaire du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante.\n[119] Il a alors constat\u00e9 que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas heureuse de cette situation.\n[120] Relativement \u00e0 ce formulaire E-67, ce dernier se serait envol\u00e9 au vent. L\u2019agent O\u2019Brien aurait alors proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me formulaire E-67, qu\u2019il a alors remis \u00e0 la plaignante apr\u00e8s lui avoir indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait se diriger vers les \u00e9difices commerciaux du poste frontalier de Cornwall. Il a alors constat\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9e de cette situation. Il a alors imm\u00e9diatement donn\u00e9 cette information au reste de l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS qui devait alors proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019inspection secondaire du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante.\n[121] Quant \u00e0 lui, il n\u2019a eu aucune autre interaction avec la plaignante et son r\u00f4le s\u2019est termin\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment avec elle.\nAgent Todd Smart\n[122] Une fois que la plaignante fut dirig\u00e9e vers l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS, alors situ\u00e9e sur l\u2019air commercial du poste frontalier de Cornwall, la plaignante fut alors intercept\u00e9e par un deuxi\u00e8me agent, soit l\u2019agent Todd Smart.\n[123] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019agent Smart a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il \u00e9tait commun\u00e9ment un \u00ab agent \u00e0 poste fixe \u00bb, lors de la journ\u00e9e du 18 novembre 2005. Il \u00e9tait le premier agent \u00e0 interagir avec des conducteurs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s apr\u00e8s leur inspection primaire.\n[124] L\u2019agent Smart a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019au moment de son premier contact avec la plaignante, il ignorait si cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait une autochtone. Lorsque la plaignante est arriv\u00e9e vers lui, il a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait agressive et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait choqu\u00e9e. De plus, il a not\u00e9 que la plaignante parlait dans son cellulaire. Il a alors imm\u00e9diatement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019arr\u00eater d\u2019utiliser son cellulaire, mais elle n\u2019a pas imm\u00e9diatement raccroch\u00e9. La plaignante lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 pourquoi elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 orient\u00e9e vers cette partie du poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall et pourquoi elle ne pouvait pas utiliser [Traduction] \u00ab sa voie \u00bb.\n[125] L\u2019agent Smart lui a alors r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ignorait pourquoi elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e afin que son v\u00e9hicule soit inspect\u00e9 par voie de scanner, il lui aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 que toute personne est sujette \u00e0 une inspection lorsqu\u2019elle traverse la fronti\u00e8re et que, quant \u00e0 lui, il ne faisait que son travail.\n[126] Un peu plus loin, il lui a expliqu\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure de scanner, mais elle lui coupa la parole en lui indiquant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait inqui\u00e8te en ce qui a trait aux radiations.\n[127] L\u2019agent Smart lui aurait alors r\u00e9pondu que si elle le laissait finir son explication, il lui expliquerait la proc\u00e9dure de scanner et que finalement, elle n\u2019aurait aucune raison d\u2019\u00eatre inqui\u00e8te. Il a donc fini les explications sur la proc\u00e9dure de scanner.\n[128] Tout au long de sa discussion avec la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re ne lui a fourni aucune indication \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019agent Smart a indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante ne lui avait fait aucun \u00e9tat de ses inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 l\u2019impact des radiations sur son enfant \u00e0 na\u00eetre.\n[129] Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante fut donc dirig\u00e9 vers le v\u00e9hicule VACIS lui-m\u00eame. Il a alors communiqu\u00e9 aux autres agents de l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de la plaignante en indiquant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9e.\n[130] Une fois que son v\u00e9hicule fut aux abords imm\u00e9diats de la machine VACIS, la plaignante a alors quitt\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule afin de se diriger dans un endroit s\u00e9curis\u00e9 afin de permettre que son v\u00e9hicule soit scann\u00e9.\nAgent Denis Demers\n[131] Elle fut alors en contact avec un troisi\u00e8me agent, soit l\u2019agent Denis Demers, celui dont le comportement est plus particuli\u00e8rement vis\u00e9 par la plainte de la plaignante.\n[132] Lors de cette journ\u00e9e du 18 novembre 2005, l\u2019agent Demers faisait partie de l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS \u00e0 titre \u00ab d\u2019agent de base \u00bb.\n[133] Dans ses fonctions, l\u2019agent Demers a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une aire de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 avec des c\u00f4nes orange, avec l\u2019indication de signe de radiation ainsi que d\u2019arr\u00eat. Il a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 des tests de radiation \u00e0 quatre endroits pr\u00e8s la machine VACIS elle-m\u00eame, et cela, afin de v\u00e9rifier la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des lieux.\n[134] Tel que l\u2019indiquait la proc\u00e9dure alors existante, une fois qu\u2019un v\u00e9hicule est introduit pr\u00e8s de la zone o\u00f9 se trouvait la machine VACIS, tout conducteur ne doit pas rester \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule durant la proc\u00e9dure de scanner.\n[135] Lorsque le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante est arriv\u00e9 sur les lieux, il a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Todd Smart de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de la plaignante.\n[136] Une fois qu\u2019il se fut approch\u00e9 de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant impolie, blasph\u00e9mant \u00e0 son endroit et en lui disant des mots tels que [Traduction] \u00ab va te faire foutre \u00bb. De m\u00eame, la plaignante a fait usage de mots inappropri\u00e9s et vulgaires \u00e0 son endroit, tels que : [Traduction] \u00ab homo, connard, gros homme avec un gros p\u00e9nis \u00bb.\n[137] L\u2019agent Demers a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019un tel comportement \u00e0 son endroit auparavant, et ce, durant son emploi.\n[138] De m\u00eame, l\u2019agent Demers a indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante ne lui avait jamais fait mention de son \u00e9tat de femme enceinte, et cela, en aucun temps. Aussi, la plaignante ne lui a jamais fait \u00e9tat de ses peurs en ce qui a trait aux effets de la radiation sur elle.\n[139] Dans le cours de la discussion anim\u00e9e qui s\u2019en est suivie, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une autochtone, que jamais elle n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de fouille \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat de femme autochtone.\n[140] Dans la conversation, elle lui aurait demand\u00e9 de lui remettre son permis de conduire, et cela, \u00e0 deux reprises, ce \u00e0 quoi il lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne lui remettrait son permis de conduire qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019ils auraient termin\u00e9 l\u2019op\u00e9ration en cours. Devant l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de la plaignante, l\u2019agent Demers lui aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 d\u2019arr\u00eater de blasph\u00e9mer \u00e0 son endroit, mais il aurait alors not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une autochtone, et que le territoire o\u00f9 elle se trouvait \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00ab son territoire \u00bb et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucun droit de fouiller son v\u00e9hicule ou elle-m\u00eame.\n[141] Auparavant, l\u2019agent Demers n\u2019avait aucunement remarqu\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait autochtone si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une fois que la plaignante lui eut r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 ce fait.\n[142] Au cours de la discussion anim\u00e9e qu\u2019il a eue avec la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re ne lui aurait jamais r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 sa situation de femme enceinte ni non plus ses craintes quant \u00e0 une exposition aux radiations.\n[143] Dans cette s\u00e9quence, l\u2019agent Demers a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019est souvenu de s\u2019\u00eatre identifi\u00e9 en pointant l\u2019insigne qu\u2019il portait.\n[144] En r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de la plaignante (pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 16), l\u2019agent Demers indique au tribunal qu\u2019il aurait tent\u00e9 de calmer la situation, tout en gardant le contr\u00f4le.\n[145] C\u2019est pour cette raison qu\u2019il aurait alors point\u00e9 son insigne afin de r\u00e9affirmer son autorit\u00e9. \u00c0 une question du procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019agent Demers aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 dans un premier temps qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas mentionn\u00e9 les mots suivants [Traduction] \u00ab vous \u00eates d\u00e9finitivement coupable de quelque chose \u00bb (voir interrogatoire du 29 janvier 2014, volume 46, page 164).\n[146] \u00c0 cause de son agressivit\u00e9, il aurait alors indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante que son comportement \u00e9tait r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur et selon son exp\u00e9rience, elle agissait comme une personne qui a fait quelque chose de mal.

De plus, il a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait utilis\u00e9 un langage agressif \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Monsieur Boots, un des anciens de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone d\u2019Akwesasne.\n[150] Il a ni\u00e9 le fait que la plaignante aurait pleur\u00e9 en sa pr\u00e9sence et qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9galement fait de l\u2019hyperventilation.

Cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir \u00e9tait pour lui une mani\u00e8re de s\u2019identifier comme faisant partie de Douanes Canada.\n[154] \u00c0 une autre question du procureur de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il avait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019agir de cette fa\u00e7on pouvait \u00eatre provocateur \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019une personne mohawk r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Akwesasne, le t\u00e9moin a alors r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas d\u2019avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 autre chose.\n[155] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, l\u2019agent Demers consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 poli \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 de langage blasph\u00e9matoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de cette derni\u00e8re, qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit \u00e0 son endroit, et que son comportement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de sanctions et de r\u00e9primandes de la part de ses sup\u00e9rieurs.\nAgent Kevin Sills\n[156] Dans la s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s\u2019en est suivi au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en attente avec l\u2019agent Demers, un autre agent a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame s\u00e9quence des faits.\n[157] Alors que la fouille du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante tirait \u00e0 sa fin, l\u2019agent Kevin Sills s\u2019est alors joint \u00e0 la discussion entre l\u2019agent Demers et la plaignante.\n[158] Comme l\u2019agent Sills avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la fouille du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante, il s\u2019est alors approch\u00e9 vers elle en lui demandant si les biens qu\u2019ils avaient trouv\u00e9s dans son v\u00e9hicule avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait rien dit \u00e0 ce propos lors du processus qui a conduit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission du formulaire E-67. Elle a alors confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agent Sills qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les biens consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de taxes \u00e0 payer puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait autochtone.\n[159] L\u2019agent Sills a alors not\u00e9 que son comportement \u00e9tait hostile et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s f\u00e2ch\u00e9e.\n[160] Devant le comportement de la plaignante, l\u2019agent Sills a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il avait tent\u00e9 de faire diminuer la tension en lui offrant l\u2019option d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur afin de discuter de la situation des biens non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s. Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019agent Sills a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rapporter cette situation \u00e0 son superviseur alors en fonction et de lui laisser prendre la d\u00e9cision finale.\n[161] Dans le court intervalle de temps o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec la plaignante, il a constat\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re avait fait usage de son cellulaire, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas compris les mots qu\u2019elle adressait \u00e0 son interlocuteur. Il a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 au tribunal que la fouille du v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en profondeur sans toutefois causer des dommages au v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante.\n[162] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, il n\u2019a pas entendu la plaignante lui demander d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur durant la fouille.\n[163] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir inform\u00e9e de sa d\u00e9cision de l\u2019amener \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur afin de r\u00e9gler la question des biens qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, il a constat\u00e9 \u00e9galement que la plaignante \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s f\u00e2ch\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle affirmait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 aller \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur en le traitant de [Traduction] \u00ab salaud \u00bb. Cons\u00e9quemment, le ton utilis\u00e9 par la plaignante \u00e9tait d\u2019une voix forte, abrupte, voire hostile.\n[164] En guise de r\u00e9ponse face au comportement hostile de la plaignante, l\u2019agent Sills a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de diminuer la tension alors existante en ne criant pas apr\u00e8s la plaignante, mais en utilisant un ton de voix professionnel.\n[165] Une fois les informations fournies \u00e0 la plaignante afin qu\u2019elle se dirige \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du poste frontalier, lui-m\u00eame s\u2019est alors dirig\u00e9 vers le poste frontalier ou se trouvait l\u2019officier en charge, soit le superintendant Maurice Saucier, et cela, afin de l\u2019informer de la situation. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a alors remis au superintendant Saucier les re\u00e7us au regard des objets non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait trouv\u00e9s dans le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante.\n[166] Dans le m\u00eame espace de temps, la plaignante a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule et l\u2019a stationn\u00e9 dans le stationnement du poste frontalier. Il a alors not\u00e9 que personne n\u2019avait accompagn\u00e9 la plaignante afin de la forcer de se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Elle est donc entr\u00e9e d\u2019elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du poste frontalier.\n[167] En contre-interrogatoire, l\u2019agent Sills a confirm\u00e9 que le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un v\u00e9hicule commercial et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du premier v\u00e9hicule non commercial qui fut scann\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS au poste frontalier de Cornwall lors de cette journ\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, il a confirm\u00e9 au tribunal que le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante \u00e9tait le seul v\u00e9hicule de type SUV qui fut scann\u00e9 lors de cette journ\u00e9e et que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e personnellement afin que son v\u00e9hicule puisse \u00eatre scann\u00e9.\n[168] \u00c9galement, \u00e0 une autre question pos\u00e9e par le procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en compl\u00e9ment de son interrogatoire en chef, \u00e0 savoir pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas eu de contact avec les agents de la force mohawk de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents, il a r\u00e9pondu que tout \u00e9tait sous contr\u00f4le et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas lieu de les appeler.\n\u00c0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du poste frontalier\n[169] Une fois \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du poste frontalier de Cornwall, la plaignante fut alors conduite devant l\u2019officier en charge du poste, soit le superintendant Maurice Saucier.\n[170] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le superintendant Saucier a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a constat\u00e9 que la plaignante \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9e et pleurait, constatant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait vraiment en col\u00e8re.\n[171] Dans ses discussions avec cette derni\u00e8re, elle a alors affirm\u00e9 au superintendant Saucier qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de taxes \u00e0 payer et qu\u2019elle appellerait les autochtones de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk.\n[172] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plaignante, le superintendant Saucier lui a alors mentionn\u00e9 l\u2019existence du D\u00e9cret.\n[173] Le superintendant Saucier a confirm\u00e9 au tribunal que dans le pass\u00e9, il avait eu d\u2019autres interactions avec la plaignante, qu\u2019il la connaissait et qu\u2019il connaissait son nom, \u00e9tant une r\u00e9sidente d\u2019Akwesasne. Il a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 que la plaignante utilisait souvent le poste frontalier pour les fins de ses d\u00e9placements.\n[174] Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 agent de poste frontalier afin d\u2019effectuer des inspections primaires sur des v\u00e9hicules entrant au Canada, il l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9e. Il l\u2019a qualifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant non plaisante et m\u00eame arrogante.\n[175] Selon le superintendant Saucier, il a assum\u00e9 que la plaignante connaissait bien le D\u00e9cret consid\u00e9rant ses nombreux d\u00e9placements au poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall dans le pass\u00e9.\n[176] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le superintendant Saucier a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait contact\u00e9 son superviseur imm\u00e9diat, soit Monsieur Rod Hart \u00e0 Ottawa, et qu\u2019il l\u2019avait inform\u00e9 de la situation pr\u00e9valant le 18 novembre 2005. Monsieur Hart, a alors autoris\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 quitter les lieux sans payer de taxes, et cela, en vertu du D\u00e9cret.\n[177] Avant que la plaignante ne quitte les lieux, il aurait rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante son obligation de d\u00e9clarer les biens qu\u2019elle achetait \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada, et cela, en vertu du D\u00e9cret.\n[178] Constatant cette situation, la plaignante a alors fait une d\u00e9claration en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux agents de l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS comme \u00e9tant des gens apeurants. Le superintendant Saucier a alors not\u00e9 que la plaignante a alors arr\u00eat\u00e9 de pleurer et qu\u2019elle semblait plus calme. Quelques secondes plus tard, la plaignante s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e avec un autre agent du poste frontalier, soit l\u2019agent H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Oakes, o\u00f9 elle a retrouv\u00e9 ses sens et finalement, elle a quitt\u00e9 le poste frontalier.\n[179] En compl\u00e9ment dans son interrogatoire, le superintendant Saucier a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas inquiet en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la menace qu\u2019avait formul\u00e9e la plaignante d\u2019appeler la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk.\n[180] Toutefois, il a confirm\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il avait bel et bien entendu la menace de la plaignante \u00e0 cet effet.\nAgent Sylvie Beaudry-Giroux\n[181] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, un autre agent du poste frontalier pr\u00e9sent, soit l\u2019agent Sylvie Beaudry\u2011Giroux, a bel et bien entendu \u00e9galement la m\u00eame menace \u00e9manant de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019appeler la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk.\n[182] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, l\u2019agent Beaudry-Giroux a \u00e9galement entendu la plaignante blasph\u00e9mer aupr\u00e8s du superintendant Saucier en l\u2019informant qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas payer de taxes. Elle a entendu la plaignante crier et pleurer alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 deux ou trois pieds de la plaignante.\nIII. Analyse [183] Le tribunal a bien r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la preuve du dossier de la plaignante relative aux arguments des parties ainsi que la loi et la jurisprudence applicables au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Apr\u00e8s une longue analyse, j\u2019en viens \u00e0 la conclusion de faire droit en partie \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante, et cela, pour les motifs qui apparaissent ci-apr\u00e8s.\nA. Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux applicables en mati\u00e8re de discrimination [184] Pour une meilleure compr\u00e9hension des dispositions l\u00e9gales applicables en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019aimerais rappeler les dispositions des articles suivants de la Loi :\n3. (1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019original nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(2) Une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse ou l\u2019accouchement est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[185] De m\u00eame, de fa\u00e7on plus sp\u00e9cifique, la plainte de la plaignante est fond\u00e9e au regard des dispositions de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi qui se lit comme suit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\nSp\u00e9cifiquement, la plainte de la plaignante se retrouve sous l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5 b) dudit article 5 de la Loi.\n[186] Tel que j\u2019en ai fait \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieurement, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 discrimin\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de sa race, de son \u00e2ge ainsi que de son sexe.\n[187] Afin de comprendre la port\u00e9e des dispositions de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, la jurisprudence a \u00e9labor\u00e9 certains crit\u00e8res que je me permets de citer.\n[188] Ainsi, dans un premier arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada en mati\u00e8re de discrimination relative \u00e0 des programmes d\u2019\u00e9ducation, la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), [2012] 3 R.C.S. 360, a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les principes suivants relativement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 8 du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[189] Aussi, au paragraphe 33 de la d\u00e9cision, l\u2019honorable juge Abella de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019exprime comme suit :\n[33] Comme l\u2019a \u00e0 juste titre reconnu le Tribunal, pour \u00e9tablir \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue l\u2019existence de discrimination, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par le Code contre la discrimination, qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement au service concern\u00e9 et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Une fois la discrimination \u00e9tablie \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors le fardeau de justifier la conduite ou la pratique suivant le r\u00e9gime d\u2019exemptions pr\u00e9vu par les lois sur les droits de la personne. Si la conduite ou pratique ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal conclura \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination.\n[190] Aussi, dans une autre d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, soit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Conseil des canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. Via Rail Canada Inc., (2007) CSC 15, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 comme suit au paragraphe 129 de ladite d\u00e9cision :\n129 Selon l\u2019al. 5a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, \u00ab [c]onstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public [...] d\u2019en priver un individu \u00bb. Toutefois, selon l\u2019al. 15g) de cette m\u00eame loi, ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire le fait qu\u2019un fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public en prive un individu \u00ab s\u2019il a un motif justifiable de le faire \u00bb. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool, p. 518, la Cour a convenu \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 que \u00ab [s]\u2019il est possible de trouver une solution raisonnable qui \u00e9vite d\u2019imposer une r\u00e8gle donn\u00e9e aux membres d\u2019un groupe, cette r\u00e8gle ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme justifi\u00e9e. \u00bb L\u2019arr\u00eat Grismer a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une justification r\u00e9elle d\u2019une atteinte prima facie \u00e0 une loi sur les droits de la personne, un intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9montrer que \u00ab l\u2019employeur ou le fournisseur de services a pris toutes les mesures d\u2019accommodement possibles tant qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour lui une contrainte excessive \u00bb (par. 21). [...].\n[191] De m\u00eame, au paragraphe 130 de la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019existence d\u2019une contrainte excessive qui :\n\u2026peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie lorsque la norme ou l\u2019obstacle est \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb dans la mesure o\u00f9 il existe un \u00ab risque suffisant \u00bb qu\u2019un objectif l\u00e9gitime comme la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 soit assez compromis pour justifier le maintien de la norme discriminatoire (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c.

Il y a contrainte excessive lorsque les moyens raisonnables d\u2019accommoder ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ne reste que des options d\u2019accommodement d\u00e9raisonnables ou irr\u00e9alistes.\n[192] De m\u00eame, dans une autre d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (Tribunal), soit A.F.P.C. et Murphy c. A.R.C., 2010 TCDP 9, le pr\u00e9sent tribunal a rappel\u00e9 au paragraphe 39 ce qui suit :\n(39) Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit l\u2019un des facteurs qui est compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision o\u00f9 l\u2019action contest\u00e9e (Holden c. Compagnie nationale des chemins de fer) (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, 1995 CanLII 3589 (CF), (1995) 2 CF 569 (CF premi\u00e8re instance).\n[193] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de service apparaissant au premier paragraphe de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale mettant aux prises les m\u00eames parties que le pr\u00e9sent dossier, soit dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Davis, 2013 CF 40, o\u00f9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal qui avait conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournissait bel et bien un service destin\u00e9 au public lorsqu\u2019elle a eu des contacts avec Madame Davis le 18 novembre 2005 (voir paragraphe 54 du jugement).\n[194] En ce qui a trait au degr\u00e9 de preuve requis, un autre arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada bien connu en mati\u00e8re de discrimination, soit Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 2 R.C.S. 536 (\u00ab O\u2019Malley \u00bb), a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 la page 558 :\nDans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire qu'il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9.\n[195] Dans un autre arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, soit F.H. c. McDougall, [2008] 3 R.C.S. 41, \u00e0 la page 60, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada indique ce qui suit en ce qui a trait au degr\u00e9 de preuve requis dans une all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e dans une affaire civile :\n[46] De m\u00eame, la preuve doit toujours \u00eatre claire et convaincante pour satisfaire au crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Mais, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, aucune norme objective ne permet de d\u00e9terminer qu\u2019elle l\u2019est suffisamment. Dans le cas d\u2019une all\u00e9gation grave comme celle consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier la preuve de faits qui se seraient produits de nombreuses ann\u00e9es auparavant, une preuve constitu\u00e9e essentiellement des t\u00e9moignages du demandeur et du d\u00e9fendeur. Aussi difficile que puisse \u00eatre sa t\u00e2che, le juge doit trancher. Lorsqu\u2019un juge consciencieux ajoute foi \u00e0 la th\u00e8se du demandeur, il faut tenir pour acquis que la preuve \u00e9tait \u00e0 ses yeux suffisamment claire et convaincante pour conclure au respect du crit\u00e8re de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[196] Dans des dossiers de discrimination, la preuve n\u2019est pas toujours directe et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, une preuve circonstancielle peut amener le tribunal \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 une forme de discrimination. Ainsi, j\u2019aimerais r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. 5029 (TCDP), o\u00f9 le tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou la couleur se pratique souvent de mani\u00e8re subtile. Rares sont les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. Dans les cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019existe pas de preuve directe, il revient alors \u00e0 la Commission de conclure \u00e0 la discrimination \u00e0 partir de la conduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discriminatoire de la ou des personnes en cause. Ce n\u2019est pas toujours une t\u00e2che facile. Il faut analyser soigneusement la conduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discriminatoire dans le contexte dans lequel elle a pris naissance.\nEn citant directement Kennedy c. Mohawk College (1973) Ontario Board of Inquiry (professeur Borons).\n[197] De plus, il a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par nos tribunaux qu\u2019une attitude de profilage raciale peut \u00eatre consciente ou inconsciente. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la conduite d\u2019une personne peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux inconscients (R. c. Brown, 64 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), au paragraphe 8).\n[198] De plus, dans une autre d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, soit Peel Law Association. c. Pieters, [2013] O.J. No. 2695, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Radek c. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd., 2005 BCHRT 302, de m\u00eame que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Phipps c. Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII), la Cour a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est aucunement besoin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019intention ou la motivation afin de discriminer. Toute l\u2019attention de l\u2019enqu\u00eate doit porter sur les actions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e envers le plaignant (voir paragraphe 111 de la d\u00e9cision Peel Law Association c. Pieters).\n[199] En r\u00e9f\u00e9rence avec les arr\u00eats Radek et Phipps que je viens de citer, j\u2019aimerais reprendre les propositions qui sont contenues dans ces arr\u00eats, lesquelles sont les suivantes :\n[Traduction]\n1) il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019un motif de distinction illicite soit le seul ou le principal facteur menant \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire; il suffit qu\u2019il soit un facteur ;\n2) il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019une intention ou une motivation a men\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination; l\u2019enqu\u00eate doit porter sur l\u2019effet des actions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur le plaignant ;\n3) il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019un motif illicite soit la cause de la conduite discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9; il suffit qu\u2019il soit un facteur ou un \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminant ;\n4) il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il y ait une preuve directe de discrimination; la discrimination est plus souvent \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels et des inf\u00e9rences ;\n5) l\u2019application de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le r\u00e9sultat de croyances, de partis pris et de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s subtils inconscients.\n[200] Aussi, est-il utile de rappeler les paragraphes suivants de la d\u00e9cision Pieters o\u00f9 la Cour, apr\u00e8s avoir reproduit les cinq propositions ci-haut mentionnes, a fait remarquer :\n112 Les quatre premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont des propositions de droit \u00e9tablies depuis longtemps. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9 aux affaires Radek et Phipps \u00e0 titre de fondement de ces propositions. Il y a renvoy\u00e9 parce qu\u2019elles comportaient un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pratique de ces propositions. Le fait que l\u2019affaire Radek portait sur des agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et l\u2019affaire Phipps, sur un agent de police, n\u2019est pas pertinent.\n113 La Cour a reconnu \u00e0 maintes reprises la cinqui\u00e8me proposition comme un fait sociologique. Par exemple, le juge Doherty de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Parks, (1993) 15 O.R. (3d) 324, 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Cour d\u2019appel), au paragraphe 54 :\n[Traduction] Le racisme, en particulier le racisme antinoir, est partie int\u00e9grante de la mentalit\u00e9 de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Une couche importante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 professe ouvertement des vues racistes. Une couche plus large encore est inconsciemment influenc\u00e9e par des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux n\u00e9gatifs.\n114 La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a aussi approuv\u00e9 la proposition. Par exemple, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 R.C.S. 484, au paragraphe 46, les juges L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 et McLachlin ont cit\u00e9 en l\u2019approuvant la d\u00e9claration du juge Doherty de la Cour d\u2019appel.\n[201] Tous ces arr\u00eats font \u00e9tat d\u2019une situation d\u2019une personne en autorit\u00e9 avec une personne vis\u00e9e et ayant une caract\u00e9ristique pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi.\n[202] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Radek pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique a fait une longue et minutieuse analyse des crit\u00e8res devant pr\u00e9valoir en ce qui a trait au profilage racial et aux cons\u00e9quences qui pouvaient en d\u00e9couler. Il n\u2019est pas de mon intention ici de revisiter de fond en comble cet arr\u00eat.\n[203] Toutefois, je retiens que de nombreux st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes peuvent exister, consciemment ou inconsciemment, de fa\u00e7on volontaire ou m\u00eame involontaire et c\u2019est \u00e0 travers une analyse minutieuse de la preuve que le d\u00e9cideur doit \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9celer si oui ou non il y a des odeurs subtiles de discrimination (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Basi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[204] Pour une analyse en d\u00e9tail des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes pouvant exister en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de discrimination envers des autochtones, je r\u00e9f\u00e8re plus sp\u00e9cifiquement au paragraphe 135 de la d\u00e9cision Radek qui est tr\u00e8s instructif \u00e0 cet effet.\n[205] R\u00e9cemment, le Tribunal des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, dans la d\u00e9cision C.D.P.D.J. c . Service de police de la Ville de Montr\u00e9al, 2012 QCTDP 5, (\u00ab Rezko \u00bb) dat\u00e9e du 18 avril 2012, sous la plume de l\u2019honorable juge Mich\u00e8le Pauz\u00e9, indiquait ce qui suit au paragraphe 173 :\n[173] De par sa nature, le profilage constitue une forme particuli\u00e8re de discrimination exerc\u00e9e en contexte d'autorit\u00e9 et ayant pour effet de d\u00e9truire ou de compromettre le droit \u00ab \u00e0 la reconnaissance et \u00e0 l'exercice, en pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9, des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne, sans distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00bb fond\u00e9e sur l'un ou l'autre des motifs interdits par la Charte. \u00bb\n[206] Et un peu plus loin, elle indique ce qui suit au paragraphe 181 en citant l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnson bien connu :\n[181] Le tribunal doit donc plut\u00f4t se pencher sur la preuve factuelle et circonstancielle en vue d'identifier si des \u00e9carts de conduite tels que le manque de courtoisie et l'intransigeance du policier permettent de conclure \u00e0 un traitement diff\u00e9renci\u00e9 ou inusit\u00e9 par rapport aux pratiques usuelles dans des circonstances semblables :\nPour d\u00e9cider si une preuve prima facie de diff\u00e9rence de traitement a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate doit essayer de d\u00e9terminer comment les faits se d\u00e9roulent dans une situation donn\u00e9e. Les d\u00e9rogations \u00e0 la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et la preuve de manque de courtoisie ou d\u2019intransigeance sont des motifs permettant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement.\nNote en bas de page: [98] Johnson c. Halifax Regional Police Service (No. 1), pr\u00e9c., par. 57. [(2003) 48 C.H.R.R.D\/307 (N.S Bd Inq.).]\nB. Analyse des faits La s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des principaux intervenants\n[207] Dans ses arguments \u00e9crits que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au tribunal, la plaignante a fait valoir que toute l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS \u00e9tait une op\u00e9ration planifi\u00e9e d\u2019avance afin de pi\u00e9ger la plaignante puisqu\u2019aucun rapport ou note manuscrite n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit par les agents en cause. De m\u00eame, elle a qualifi\u00e9 les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005 comme \u00e9tant un th\u00e9\u00e2tre de terreur o\u00f9 la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 virtuellement viol\u00e9e dans son identit\u00e9 d\u2019autochtone d\u2019Akwesasne. Aussi dans son argumentation, la plaignante fait \u00e9tat de divergence entre les mots qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9s par l\u2019agent Demers et la plaignante elle-m\u00eame lors de l\u2019altercation qui s\u2019est produite le 18 novembre 2005.\n[208] L\u2019argumentation de la plaignante comprend plusieurs arguments de nature sociologique et historique que je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention d\u2019aborder dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. En effet, tel que l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Attorney General c. Davis, 2009 CF 1104 , au paragraphe 59, l\u2019honorable juge Harrington, mentionne ce qui suit :\n[59] Je m\u2019empresse de mentionner que la question en litige porte sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005 \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re sur l\u2019\u00eele Cornwall et non les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement europ\u00e9en en Am\u00e9rique du Nord.\n[209] Cons\u00e9quemment, le tribunal s\u2019en rapportera uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019analyse des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus le 18 novembre 2005 et rien d\u2019autre.\n[210] Au regard de l\u2019argumentation de la plaignante, le tribunal est en d\u00e9saccord avec les affirmations que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tortur\u00e9e et\/ou attaqu\u00e9e par un groupe d\u2019hommes. Le tribunal se questionne \u00e9galement quant au fait que la plaignante aurait agi correctement lorsqu\u2019elle a utilis\u00e9 les mots grossiers \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le tribunal s\u2019est \u00e9galement questionn\u00e9 quant au fait que toute la s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements aurait constitu\u00e9 un viol \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante.\n[211] Je ne commenterai pas plus \u00e0 fond les arguments \u00e9crits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la plaignante, car je les consid\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant nettement exag\u00e9r\u00e9s eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la trame factuelle pour lesquels la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte.\n[212] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la s\u00e9quence des \u00e9v\u00e9nements proprement dite, je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 non plus de preuve qui m\u2019aurait indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement vis\u00e9e par l\u2019intervention de l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS en date du 18 novembre 2005. Bien que la plaignante soit en d\u00e9saccord avec toute l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e, et cela, pour toutes les raisons qu\u2019elle a mentionn\u00e9es dans ses arguments \u00e9crits, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS qui fut men\u00e9e l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans un contexte qui faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un bulletin de renseignements dat\u00e9 du 21 juin 2005 o\u00f9 une unit\u00e9 VACIS dans le nord de l\u2019Ontario avait alors d\u00e9cel\u00e9 dans un v\u00e9hicule du m\u00eame type que celui de la plaignante des modifications devant permettre de pouvoir effectuer de la contrebande. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il \u00e9tait donc raisonnable de penser qu\u2019une op\u00e9ration similaire men\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9quipe VACIS pouvait \u00eatre tenue \u00e9galement au poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall en date du 18 novembre 2005.\n[213] Tel que la preuve l\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, aucune information de quelque nature que ce soit n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve afin d\u2019indiquer que le v\u00e9hicule de la plaignante ou la plaignante personnellement aurait pu \u00eatre vis\u00e9e par l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS qui fut men\u00e9e le 18 novembre 2005.\n[214] Le premier agent qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec la plaignante, soit l\u2019agent O\u2019Brien, n\u2019avait pr\u00e9alablement pas identifi\u00e9 la plaignante lorsque son v\u00e9hicule s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux abords du poste frontalier en date du 18 novembre 2005. Cons\u00e9quemment, les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement vis\u00e9e par l\u2019op\u00e9ration VACIS ne m\u2019apparaissent pas comme \u00e9tant fond\u00e9s.\n[215] Dans la s\u00e9quence des faits qui s\u2019est poursuivie, une fois que la plaignante eut \u00e9t\u00e9 interpel\u00e9e par l\u2019agent O\u2019Brien, et de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de la plaignante, aucun reproche ne peut \u00eatre adress\u00e9 aux deux agents ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en premier contact avec elle, soit les agents O\u2019Brien et Smart, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leur conduite \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante.\n[216] Cons\u00e9quemment, les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la plainte de la plaignante eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 des comportements discriminatoires qui auraient pu avoir eu lieu le 18 novembre 2005 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante sont ceux vis\u00e9s par le comportement de l\u2019agent Demers et, partiellement, par le comportement de l\u2019agent Sills qui a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec la plaignante au moment o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait en contact avec l\u2019agent Demers.\n[217] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019agent Sills, je ne peux que constater que le comportement et l\u2019attitude de l\u2019agent Sills ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exemplaires et des plus professionnels malgr\u00e9 le fait que la plaignante lui ait \u00e9galement adress\u00e9 des propos vulgaires et irrespectueux \u00e0 son endroit. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la preuve ne m\u2019appara\u00eet nullement concluante afin de d\u00e9terminer que l\u2019agent Sills aurait agi en ayant une attitude ou un comportement discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante. Il en est toutefois autrement en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9changes qui ont eu lieu entre l\u2019agent Demers et la plaignante.\n[218] Tel que l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 la jurisprudence, je me dois comme d\u00e9cideur consciencieux, dans une instance civile comme laquelle je suis saisi, d\u2019examiner la preuve pertinente attentivement afin de d\u00e9terminer [Traduction] \u00ab si, selon toute vraisemblance, le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 a eu lieu \u00bb (voir \u00e0 la fin du paragraphe 49 de l\u2019arr\u00eat McDougall de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada).\n[219] Ce que la preuve a \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier est ce qui suit. L\u2019attitude de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits le 18 novembre 2005 \u00e9tait nettement et d\u00e9finitivement une attitude agressive, irrespectueuse, provocatrice et finalement, revendicatrice de ses droits \u00e0 titre d\u2019autochtone r\u00e9sidant sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall.\n[220] Par les nombreux t\u00e9moignages que j\u2019ai eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019entendre, il m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on claire et non \u00e9quivoque que la plaignante a toujours contest\u00e9e la pr\u00e9sence du poste frontalier sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall comme \u00e9tant non d\u00e9sir\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le pass\u00e9 une personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019arrogante et contestataire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence du poste frontalier sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall.\n[221] De plus, un autre \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019\u00e9tait produit ant\u00e9rieurement, soit en date du 6 ao\u00fbt 2005, o\u00f9 la plaignante avait alors manifest\u00e9 sa d\u00e9sapprobation quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence des agents du poste frontalier sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall en ayant exprim\u00e9 une menace \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle ferait exploser le poste frontalier.\n[222] Je peux comprendre que suivant la plaignante, elle a \u00e9mis cette menace de fa\u00e7on indirecte, mais cela m\u2019a suffi pour me convaincre que depuis un fort laps de temps, pour ne pas dire depuis toujours, la plaignante n\u2019a jamais accept\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall.\n[223] Certes, la plaignante avait le droit de manifester son d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur le territoire d\u2019Akwesasne en date du 18 novembre 2005, en autant que son d\u00e9saccord ne se soit pas manifest\u00e9 par des gestes de menace concrets \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnson pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 au paragraphe 41 in fine).\n[224] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le tribunal a retrouv\u00e9 plusieurs invraisemblances, voire des exag\u00e9rations dans le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante. En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a admis avoir menti lorsqu\u2019elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 certaines situations qu\u2019elle avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans son affidavit (pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 16) de m\u00eame qu\u2019eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 d\u2019autres documents qu\u2019elle avait fournis \u00e0 la Commission pour les fins de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[225] Additionnellement, le tribunal a \u00e9galement constat\u00e9 que la plaignante s\u2019est absent\u00e9e vers la fin de son contre-interrogatoire pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. \u00c0 plusieurs reprises, je suis intervenu aupr\u00e8s des repr\u00e9sentantes de la plaignante afin d\u2019inciter cette derni\u00e8re de revenir afin de finaliser le contre-interrogatoire qui devait se poursuivre par le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Or, le tribunal fut inform\u00e9 par la repr\u00e9sentante de la plaignante que cette derni\u00e8re fut en mesure de retourner travailler alors qu\u2019elle aurait pu facilement venir terminer le contre-interrogatoire auquel elle \u00e9tait sujette.\n[226] Devant le fait que la documentation soumise par la plaignante comportait de nombreuses inexactitudes, voire des exag\u00e9rations, et son admission au tribunal qu\u2019elle avait effectivement menti \u00e0 quelques reprises, j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement atteinte.\n[227] Toutefois, je peux certainement comprendre que la plaignante \u00e9tait personnellement affect\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sence des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et cela depuis un bon moment pr\u00e9alablement aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005 ont certainement donn\u00e9 l\u2019occasion \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019exprimer son exasp\u00e9ration et sa col\u00e8re de fa\u00e7on directe \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[228] Lors de l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame de constater la sensibilit\u00e9 extr\u00eame de la plaignante quant \u00e0 son statut d\u2019autochtone au regard de la pr\u00e9sence des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur [Traduction] \u00ab son territoire \u00bb.\n[229] En ce sens, je peux comprendre les agissements et les paroles prononc\u00e9es par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et peu importe l\u2019\u00e9tat de provocation dans lequel la plaignante a agi, il en revenait aux agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019agent Demers de faire en sorte de ne pas envenimer la situation et surtout, de tenter de l\u2019apaiser. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 incombait \u00e0 l\u2019agent Demers, et \u00e0 la lueur de r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a fournies \u00e0 la plaignante, je ne crois pas que l\u2019agent Demers a fait en sorte de garder le contr\u00f4le du dialogue entre lui et la plaignante ou m\u00eame de l\u2019apaiser (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Maynard c. Toronto Police Services Board, [2012] O.H.R.T.D. no 1122, au paragraphe 189).\n[230] En fait, les propos qu\u2019a tenus la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019agent Demers comportaient une agressivit\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment provocatrice et revendicatrice en tant que jeune femme mohawk.\n[231] La plaignante a d\u2019abord r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son statut d\u2019autochtone \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de l\u2019agent Demers, puis elle a adopt\u00e9 une attitude revendicatrice quant au territoire sur lequel est situ\u00e9 le poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall et o\u00f9 se trouvaient les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en date du 18 novembre 2005. Agissant de cette fa\u00e7on, la plaignante faisait appel directement \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 d\u2019autochtone et elle s\u2019en est servie pour provoquer l\u2019agent Demers.\n[232] Or, j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ci-avant \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Maynard qui a pos\u00e9 comme paradigme que c\u2019est l\u2019agent qui est en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une personne agressive qui est le responsable de garder le contr\u00f4le du dialogue et de faire en sorte de l\u2019apaiser (voir Maynard ci-dessus).\n[233] Qu\u2019en est-il dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier?\n[234] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019une intervention polici\u00e8re doivent pouvoir s\u2019inf\u00e9rer de la preuve dans son ensemble et non seulement de la perception de la victime (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Rezko que j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 185 en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Shaw c. Phipps, 2010 ONSC 3884).\n[235] Cons\u00e9quemment, le tribunal doit donc analyser le comportement de l\u2019agent Demers ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a fournies \u00e0 la plaignante afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer si oui ou non l\u2019agent Demers a commis des actes discriminatoires en contravention avec l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[236] De cette analyse, le tribunal a pu faire les constatations suivantes :\n(a) Pr\u00e9alablement aux faits du 18 novembre 2005, l\u2019agent Demers a admis que c\u2019\u00e9tait une connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qu\u2019il y avait une dispute entre le gouvernement canadien et les autorit\u00e9s mohawks en ce qui concerne le territoire sur lequel \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 le poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall;\n(b) Dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9galement, l\u2019agent Demers a admis qu\u2019il n\u2019avait eu aucune formation sp\u00e9cifique en ce qui concerne des connaissances acquises eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la culture ainsi qu\u2019aux m\u0153urs de communaut\u00e9s autochtones;\n(c) L\u2019agent Demers a utilis\u00e9 un ton de voix \u00e9lev\u00e9 au regard du comportement de la plaignante, et cela, dans une tentative d\u2019affirmation de son autorit\u00e9 et de ce qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 \u00ab recours progressif \u00e0 la force \u00bb;\n(d) Dans le cours des discussions qui a eu lieu avec la plaignante, l\u2019agent Demers a point\u00e9 son insigne afin de s\u2019identifier aupr\u00e8s de la plaignante qui le questionnait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard;\n(e) L\u2019agent Demers a questionn\u00e9 la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un emploi qu\u2019elle pouvait occuper, sans raison apparente;\n(f) En r\u00e9ponse en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une affirmation directe de la part de la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019aspect territorial des lieux occup\u00e9s par le poste frontalier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall, la preuve a \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on claire qu\u2019il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la plaignante en disant qu\u2019il se trouvait sur la [Traduction] \u00ab propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Douanes Canada \u00bb;\n(g) \u00c9galement, devant l\u2019attitude agressive et provocatrice de la plaignante, l\u2019agent Demers a affirm\u00e9 que le comportement de la plaignante pouvait \u00eatre une affirmation qu\u2019elle avait fait quelque chose de mal selon son exp\u00e9rience.\n[237] D\u2019autres affirmations de nature raciste auraient \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9es par l\u2019agent Demers selon la plaignante, mais non reconnues par ce dernier.\n[238] Ainsi, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019agent Demers lui aurait demand\u00e9 si elle transportait des cigarettes en contrebande, ce qui fut ni\u00e9 par l\u2019agent Demers dans son interrogatoire.\n[239] \u00c9galement, l\u2019agent Demers a ni\u00e9 avoir prononc\u00e9 les mots suivants : [Traduction] \u00ab Est-ce que vous savez ce que notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pense de vous? \u00bb (en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au peuple autochtone).\n[240] Relativement \u00e0 ces deux derni\u00e8res affirmations, la preuve n\u2019est pas concluante \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019agent Demers aurait fait de telles affirmations. Je m\u2019en tiendrai donc au comportement de l\u2019agent Demers tel que je l\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 236 ci-dessus.\n[241] Il est vrai que dans l\u2019analyse des faits, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des principaux acteurs, soit la plaignante et l\u2019agent Demers, doit \u00eatre soupes\u00e9e, mais je ne peux conclure qu\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces deux intervenants a enti\u00e8rement eu tout faux ou tout vrai. Comme, je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante comportait de nombreuses inexactitudes, voire certains mensonges, tenant compte de la documentation qu\u2019elle avait fournie. J\u2019ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 donc comme plus cr\u00e9dibles les r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019agent Demers lorsqu\u2019il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle transportait des cigarettes de contrebande ou s\u2019il lui avait pos\u00e9 la question, \u00e0 savoir ce que pensait la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du peuple autochtone.\n[242] Est-ce que les autres r\u00e9ponses ainsi que le comportement de l\u2019agent Demers ont constitu\u00e9 des motifs de discrimination eu \u00e9gard au fait que la plaignante se fut identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une autochtone et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi? (Voir le paragraphe 236) Telle sont les principales questions que je dois r\u00e9pondre.\n[243] Afin de r\u00e9pondre aux questions principales ci-avant, le tribunal s\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de m\u00eame que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Radek du Tribunal des droits de la personne de Colombie-Britannique.\n[244] En faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli que la discrimination a exist\u00e9 \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, il en reviendra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de justifier la conduite ou la pratique suivant un r\u00e9gime d\u2019exception pr\u00e9vu par les lois sur les droits de la personne. Tel que l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, si la conduite ou la pratique ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e, je devrai conclure alors \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la discrimination. (Voir aussi les principes bien connus de l\u2019arr\u00eat O\u2019Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\nPremier point\n[245] Dans un premier temps, le premier crit\u00e8re me para\u00eet largement satisfait, \u00e0 savoir que la plaignante appartenait \u00e0 un groupe clairement identifi\u00e9 pouvant \u00eatre sujet \u00e0 une distinction illicite. En effet, au moment de son intervention avec l\u2019agent Demers, elle lui a avou\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait autochtone et la preuve \u00e9crite produite au dossier a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante en tant qu\u2019autochtone. Ce premier point est donc satisfait.\nDeuxi\u00e8me point\n[246] En ce qui a trait au deuxi\u00e8me crit\u00e8re, je consid\u00e8re \u00e9galement que ce facteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli consid\u00e9rant que la plaignante a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement aux services que devait lui fournir l\u2019intim\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je constate que le comportement de l\u2019agent Demers ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante sont autant de facteurs que je consid\u00e8re comme \u00e9tant une forme de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante. Je consid\u00e8re donc que ce deuxi\u00e8me aspect a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement satisfait de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate par la plaignante. En effet, les commentaires formul\u00e9s par l'agent Demers me sont apparus comme \u00e9tant injustifi\u00e9s, voir agressifs, et provocateurs \u00e0 l'endroit de la plaignante.\nTroisi\u00e8me point\n[247] Je n\u2019ai pas de doute \u00e0 conclure \u00e9galement que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e de la plaignante, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une autochtone, a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\n[248] De fait, toutes les r\u00e9ponses fournies par l\u2019agent Demers \u00e0 la plaignante, ainsi que son comportement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en r\u00e9ponse aux provocations formul\u00e9es par la plaignante et qui avaient trait \u00e0 sa condition d\u2019autochtone de m\u00eame qu\u2019aux affirmations territoriales qu\u2019elle a fait valoir \u00e0 l\u2019agent Demers.\n[249] En d\u2019autres termes, r\u00e9pondant directement \u00e0 la plaignante quant \u00e0 ses provocations, et avec le ton \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9, l\u2019agent Demers a fourni des r\u00e9ponses dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9e qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis par la plaignante.\n[250] Ce faisant, je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019agent Demers a eu des r\u00e9actions excessives ainsi que des r\u00e9ponses qui ont d\u00e9not\u00e9 un comportement empreint de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes racistes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante. (Voir la question pos\u00e9e sur son travail sans motif valable : Radek, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 135, cinqui\u00e8me point)\n[251] Cons\u00e9quemment, je consid\u00e8re donc que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on prima facie l\u2019existence de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit. Est-ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a justifi\u00e9 sa conduite ou sa pratique suivant un r\u00e9gime d\u2019exceptions pr\u00e9vu par la Loi? Dans l\u2019alternative, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il r\u00e9fut\u00e9 les inf\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulant de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante? (Voir par exemple Rezko au para. 192. Johnson, aux paras. 35, 63. Pieters, au para. 68.)\n[252] Je r\u00e9ponds par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 ces questions.\n[253] En effet, l\u2019agent Demers a indiqu\u00e9 au tribunal qu\u2019il avait \u00e9lev\u00e9 sa voix afin de garder le contr\u00f4le sur la situation. Il a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e9galement que cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir devait \u00eatre une mani\u00e8re d\u2019enclencher un processus d\u2019apaisement relativement \u00e0 l\u2019altercation qui a eu lieu entre lui-m\u00eame et la plaignante. Je constate \u00e0 la lueur de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue que c\u2019est la r\u00e9action inverse qui s\u2019en est suivie.\n[254] D\u2019autre part, les r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son insigne, \u00e0 la r\u00e9affirmation \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il \u00e9tait sur le territoire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Douanes Canada, et que le comportement agressif de la plaignante pouvait constituer une forme d\u2019aveu qu\u2019elle avait fait quelque chose de mal, ne peuvent m\u2019amener \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019existence de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes racistes \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante.\n[255] En contre-interrogatoire, la Commission a fait valoir que l\u2019agent Demers ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas comport\u00e9 suivant les crit\u00e8res apparaissant au paragraphe f), du chapitre 3 du Code d\u2019\u00e9thique et de conduite, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme pi\u00e8ce et intitul\u00e9e : [Traduction] Contact avec le public \u2013 Sensibilit\u00e9 et souplesse - en ce que l\u2019agent Demers n\u2019aurait pas agi de la fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e soit :\n[Traduction]\nVous ne devez pas faire de commentaire ni poser de geste violent, m\u00e9prisant, mena\u00e7ant, insultant, offensant ou provocant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une autre personne.\nSi vous occupez le genre d\u2019emploi o\u00f9 il faut parfois surmonter un manque tenace de collaboration de la part d\u2019un client, par exemple, si vous \u00eates un agent des douanes ou du fisc charg\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution, vous devrez parfois faire preuve de fermet\u00e9 et de persistance, tout en conservant une attitude professionnelle. (Voir la pi\u00e8ce HR-2 au paragraphe f). (surlign\u00e9 du tribunal)\n[256] M\u00eame si je reconnais que ma juridiction ne saurait s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 l\u2019analyse d\u2019une contravention du Code d\u2019\u00e9thique et de conduite qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en preuve dans ce dossier, je ne peux que constater que la conduite de l\u2019agent Demers n\u2019a pas correspondu aux crit\u00e8res qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\n[257] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les arr\u00eats Johnson (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) et Abbott c. Toronto Police Services Board, 2009 HRTO 1909, et Abbott c. Toronto Police Services Board, 2010 HRTO 1314, am\u00e8nent un parall\u00e8le int\u00e9ressant entre les situations de ces arr\u00eats en regard des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[258] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnson, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli : Les d\u00e9rogations \u00e0 la pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et la preuve de manque de courtoisie ou d\u2019intransigeance sont des motifs permettant de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement (voir paragraphe 57 de la d\u00e9cision).\n[259] Dans le m\u00eame arr\u00eat, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une autre d\u00e9cision cit\u00e9e, soit l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Zwicker, [1938] 1 D.L.R. 461 (N.S. Co.Ct.), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que le constable Sanford n\u2019avait pas fait montre de tol\u00e9rance raisonnable ainsi que de tact requis dans une situation pareille eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa position. Il a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9r\u00e9 que le facteur de la race avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur majeur dans le manquement professionnel (voir paragraphe 60 in fine)\n[260] Dans les arr\u00eats Abbott pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario, faisant application des principes \u00e9mis dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Radek \u00e9galement pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, a tir\u00e9 des inf\u00e9rences n\u00e9gatives du comportement du policier en cause prenant en consid\u00e9ration les crit\u00e8res \u00e9mis par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. S., (R.D.) [1997] 3 R.C.S. 484.\n[261] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je fais mienne la citation suivante de l\u2019arr\u00eat Abbott (2009) pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il est indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 45 de la d\u00e9cision :\n[45] [Traduction] La plupart du temps, la discrimination raciale provient des attitudes inconscientes et des syst\u00e8mes de croyances.\n[262] Et un peu plus loin dans le m\u00eame paragraphe, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario indique que :\nRien ne me permet de conclure que le sergent Ruffino adh\u00e8re consciemment \u00e0 de telles attitudes ou \u00e0 de tels syst\u00e8mes de croyances. Ce genre d\u2019attitudes et de syst\u00e8mes de croyances font toutefois partie de notre tissu historique et social, et ils nous impr\u00e8gnent tous par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de nos interactions sociales, du syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation, de l\u2019industrie des m\u00e9dias et du divertissement, et d\u2019autres fa\u00e7ons. (voir paragraphe 45)\n[263] De plus, dans la d\u00e9cision Rezko pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, je fais \u00e9galement miens les commentaires de l\u2019honorable juge Pauz\u00e9 au paragraphe 191 lorsqu\u2019elle affirme :\n[191] En d'autres termes, si la race - ou un autre motif interdit de discrimination - constitue l'un des facteurs ayant men\u00e9 la personne en autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer un traitement diff\u00e9renci\u00e9, l'existence d'autres motifs l\u00e9gaux d'intervention ne peut justifier le profilage ainsi exerc\u00e9. [Note en bas de page omise]\n[264] L\u2019honorable juge Pauz\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait exprim\u00e9e en reprenant dans sa d\u00e9cision le paragraphe 91 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Peart c. Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 CanLII 37566 (ON CA), o\u00f9 on affirme :\n[Traduction]\nLe profilage racial est une mauvaise chose. C\u2019est une mauvaise chose quand bien m\u00eame la conduite polici\u00e8re qui r\u00e9sulte du profilage racial pourrait se justifier en dehors de tout recours \u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s n\u00e9gatifs fond\u00e9s sur la race. Par exemple, un agent de police qui voit un v\u00e9hicule rouler \u00e0 une vitesse excessive et qui d\u00e9cide d\u2019intercepter le v\u00e9hicule en partie en raison de la couleur du conducteur fait du profilage racial, et ce, m\u00eame si la vitesse \u00e0 laquelle le v\u00e9hicule roulait aurait pu justifier les actes de l\u2019agent.\n[265] Dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, je n\u2019ai aucun doute que l\u2019agent Demers a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la plaignante en prenant en consid\u00e9ration le fait que la plaignante faisait valoir ses droits \u00e0 titre d\u2019autochtone. Je ne peux consid\u00e9rer comme une justification suffisante l\u2019exercice inappropri\u00e9 de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qu\u2019a exerc\u00e9 l\u2019agent Demers \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la plaignante. Cette approche m\u2019appara\u00eet tout \u00e0 fait conforme tenant compte de la jurisprudence que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9e ci-dessus et plus particuli\u00e8rement, des arr\u00eats Johnson, Abbott et Peart mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus.\n[266] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Johnson, on a fait valoir qu\u2019un test comparatif pouvait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 en tenant compte du comportement du policier s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 par une personne de race blanche au lieu d\u2019une personne de race noire.\n[267] Avec respect, et tenant compte des faits particuliers du pr\u00e9sent dossier, je consid\u00e8re que cette analyse comparative n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre faite. Le simple examen du comportement de l\u2019agent Demers, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 son attitude en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ainsi que ses r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a fournies \u00e0 la plaignante me suffisent afin de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019agent Demers a agi, m\u00eame inconsciemment, en faisant \u00e9tat de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux. (Sur le r\u00f4le accessoire et de moins en moins important de la preuve comparative, voir : Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (\u00ab Morris \u00bb), aux paragraphes 27-30; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2013 CAF 75, aux paragraphes 16-18).\n[268] Dans ces arguments, la Commission fait \u00e9galement valoir d\u2019autres motifs qui pourraient supposer un profilage racial dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. Ainsi, elle fait valoir que l\u2019un des agents aurait fourni une mauvaise identification quant \u00e0 l\u2019insigne qu\u2019il portait.\n[269] Tenant compte que la preuve ne me permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir les motifs subjacents \u00e0 ce refus de fournir une identification appropri\u00e9e, je ne peux conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif de discrimination quant \u00e0 ce seul facteur.\n[270] De m\u00eame, la Commission fait valoir que la fermeture du poste de Cornwall suite aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 18 novembre 2005 est une autre indication de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes raciaux liant les peuples autochtones \u00e0 la violence.\n[271] Dans un premier temps, il est possible \u00e0 la lueur des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier de conclure que la fermeture du poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall le 18 novembre 2005 pouvait constituer un autre st\u00e9r\u00e9otype raciste permettant de lier les peuples autochtones \u00e0 de la violence.\n[272] Toutefois, il m\u2019est difficile de lier directement la fermeture du poste frontalier de l\u2019\u00eele de Cornwall \u00e0 de la violence qui aurait pu \u00eatre commise par un groupe d\u2019autochtone identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk.\n[273] En effet, la preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminante afin de m\u2019indiquer la nature exacte de ce qui est connu comme \u00e9tant la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des vus divergentes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk et au fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un groupement violent.\n[274] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, je retiens les propos de la plaignante elle-m\u00eame qui a d\u00e9not\u00e9 que les autochtones de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers Mohawk \u00e9taient un groupement de nature pacifique et qui venait en aide aux autres membres de la communaut\u00e9 autochtone d\u2019Akwesasne.\n[275] \u00c0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir une preuve plus probante quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un tel st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, tel que le soumet la Commission, je ne peux conclure que ce seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment en lui-m\u00eame me permet de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\nIV. Conclusion [276] En cons\u00e9quence, et tenant compte de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, je conclus donc effectivement que la plainte de la plaignante est bien fond\u00e9e en partie, suivant l\u2019article 5, et cela, en faits et en droit.\n[277] En vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 53 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, je dois donc examiner les mesures correctrices n\u00e9cessaires afin de faire cesser les pratiques discriminatoires.\n[278] \u00c0 la lueur de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il y aurait certainement lieu \u00e0 ce que certains redressements soient accord\u00e9s, soit :\nA. Les rem\u00e8des au niveau de la plaignante [279] Au niveau des rem\u00e8des, je dois donc me prononcer sur les demandes qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es par la plaignante. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante me fait valoir quatre points pour lesquels je devrais lui accorder des dommages.\n[280] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai regroup\u00e9 les trois premiers points sous un seul et j\u2019accorde \u00e0 la plaignante une somme de 5000 $, et ce, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 53 alin\u00e9a 2 e) de la Loi.\n[281] Eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent dossier et en tenant compte du comportement r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensif d\u2019un des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour lequel d\u2019ailleurs j\u2019ai fait droit \u00e0 la plainte de la plaignante, je consid\u00e8re que la somme de 5000 $ m\u2019appara\u00eet juste et appropri\u00e9e.\n[282] J\u2019accorde \u00e9galement aussi les int\u00e9r\u00eats pour le montant susmentionn\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53 alin\u00e9a 4 de la Loi et au paragraphe 9 (12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[283] Dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du montant que je viens de mentionner, soit la somme de 5000 $, je tiens plus particuli\u00e8rement compte des dispositions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2007 CAF 268, o\u00f9 au paragraphe 37 de la d\u00e9cision il est indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit exister un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\n[284] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la plaignante ne m\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on claire et pr\u00e9cise l\u2019\u00e9tendue des dommages qu\u2019elle entendait r\u00e9clamer. De m\u00eame, aucune expertise, soit de nature psychologique ou m\u00e9dicale, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au tribunal en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice physique ou moral qu\u2019elle aurait pu subir suite aux agissements d\u2019un des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit.\n[285] Toutefois, en tenant compte du lien de causalit\u00e9 entre les actes discriminatoires et ce que la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir subi dans ses proc\u00e9dures de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience, je consid\u00e8re que la somme de 5000 $ m\u2019appara\u00eet appropri\u00e9e en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances du pr\u00e9sent dossier dont la preuve m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie.\n[286] En ce qui a trait au quatri\u00e8me point qui consiste en une demande quant aux frais contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il m\u2019est impossible d\u2019accorder une telle demande tenant compte des dispositions de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mowat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, cit\u00e9 comme Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, qui n\u2019a pas reconnu que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pouvait permettre au tribunal d\u2019indemniser une plaignante quant aux frais juridiques engag\u00e9s pour les fins de sa comparution devant le tribunal.\nB. Rem\u00e8des recherch\u00e9s par la Commission [287] La Commission au paragraphe 256 de son argumentation me fait valoir six points en ce qui a trait des mesures devant permettre que tous les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e puissent avoir une formation suffisante en mati\u00e8re de discrimination ainsi que d\u2019autres mesures accessoires.\n[288] Je ferai donc miennes toutes les recommandations de la Commission et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, j\u2019ordonne donc, et cela, en vertu de l\u2019article 53 2 a) de la Loi, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e adopte les mesures suivantes, et cela, en consultation avec la Commission, lesquelles recommandations sont les suivantes :\n(a) prendre des mesures pour veiller \u00e0 ce que le code de d\u00e9ontologie actuel comporte une d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9cise selon laquelle la LCDP interdit aux agents des services frontaliers (ASF) de faire preuve de discrimination sur la base de motifs de distinction illicites lorsqu\u2019ils proc\u00e8dent au traitement des voyageurs qui cherchent \u00e0 entrer au Canada ;\n(b) donner aux ASF travaillant au poste frontalier de Cornwall du mat\u00e9riel de formation concernant la gamme de perspectives diff\u00e9rentes au sein de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Akwesasne, ainsi qu\u2019au sein que l\u2019ASFC, concernant la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des guerriers et\/ou les autres personnes de la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019Akwesasne qui peuvent \u00eatre reconnues comme des gardiens de la paix ;\n(c) \u00e9laborer et mettre en \u0153uvre une politique ou une directive qui interdit express\u00e9ment toute forme de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race aux termes de la LCDP, y compris le profilage racial ;\n(d) pr\u00e9parer une formation, distincte du module existant de formation en ligne sur la diversit\u00e9 et les relations entre les minorit\u00e9s, qui comporte des discussions au sujet de la nouvelle politique ou directive sur la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, ainsi que la jurisprudence actuelle concernant le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne du profilage racial ;\n(e) avoir recours aux services de consultants ind\u00e9pendants poss\u00e9dant l\u2019expertise appropri\u00e9e au sujet des \u00e9l\u00e9ments susmentionn\u00e9s pour aider \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le mat\u00e9riel, les politiques ou les directives n\u00e9cessaires ;\n(f) s\u2019assurer que, dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, (i) tous les ASF re\u00e7oivent la formation susmentionn\u00e9e, (ii) des mesures appropri\u00e9es soient mises en place pour faire en sorte que la formation soit donn\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les nouvelles recrues, et qu\u2019elle soit r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9e p\u00e9riodiquement, selon les besoins, et (iii) l\u2019ASFC confirme \u00e0 Mme Davis et \u00e0 la Commission que ces mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises.\n[289] Additionnellement, et en tenant compte plus sp\u00e9cifiquement des faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019une autre recommandation devrait \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en consultation avec la Commission, et cela, plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019aucune op\u00e9ration du m\u00eame type que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite en date du 18 novembre 2005 ou similaire \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re ne pourra \u00eatre conduite sans la participation directe du Service de police Mohawk d\u2019Akwesasne ou tout autre corps policier autochtone ailleurs au pays.\n[290] En effet, il m\u2019appara\u00eet essentiel que des membres des forces polici\u00e8res autochtones soient pr\u00e9sents avec les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans toute op\u00e9ration comme celle du pr\u00e9sent dossier, et cela, afin de pr\u00e9server le caract\u00e8re distinct des peuples autochtones.\n[291] De cette fa\u00e7on, les personnes autochtones soumises \u00e0 pareille op\u00e9ration de fouille dans un poste frontalier devraient \u00eatre rassur\u00e9es que leur culture, leur identit\u00e9 et leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comme peuples autochtones seront mieux pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es et prot\u00e9g\u00e9es dans l\u2019avenir. J\u2019\u00e9mets cette recommandation tenant compte que l\u2019entente actuelle avec le Service de police Mohawk d\u2019Akwesasne ne permet leur intervention qu\u2019en cas d\u2019arrestation et de d\u00e9tention seulement et suivant les demandes des agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. (Voir la pi\u00e8ce C-6)\n[292] Finalement, et tenant compte des recommandations \u00e9mises ant\u00e9rieurement, le tribunal gardera juridiction dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier pour une p\u00e9riode additionnelle de six mois, et cela, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties aient confirm\u00e9 que toutes les ordonnances mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment mises en application.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 9 d\u00e9cembre 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1342\/7208\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Fallan Davis c.

Introduction [1] Eazy Express Inc. fournit des services de messagerie et de livraison. Elle compte parmi ses clients Postes Canada. Pour ce client, Eazy Express offre des services de livraison de colis sur des circuits pr\u00e9cis. Elle embauche des sous-traitants pour chacun de ces circuits. Ces sous-traitants suivent la proc\u00e9dure de balayage de colis de Postes Canada avant de sortir pour livrer les colis et encore une fois au lieu de livraison aux destinataires. Cette proc\u00e9dure permet de s\u2019assurer que les colis peuvent \u00eatre retrac\u00e9s et \u00eatre livr\u00e9s \u00e0 temps.\n[2] La plaignante travaillait \u00e0 temps plein comme sous-traitante pour Eazy Express jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Selon Eazy Express, la plaignante commettait trop d\u2019erreurs de balayage. La plaignante all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part d\u2019Eazy Express au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C, 1985, ch. H\u20116, (la LCDP) du fait que Eazy Express a tenu compte du motif illicite du sexe (la grossesse) comme facteur pour prendre sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi \u00e0 temps plein de messag\u00e8re. En vertu de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP, la plaignante affirme \u00e9galement que sa situation t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une pratique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e par laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e encourage les messag\u00e8res \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner ou les cong\u00e9die en cas de grossesse.\n[3] L\u2019audience a n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 en tout sept jours \u00e0 Guelph, en Ontario, les 22, 23 et 24 octobre 2013, les 8, 9 et 10 avril 2014 et le 12 ao\u00fbt 2014. En tout, neuf t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus.\nII. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires [4] La Commission a soulev\u00e9 deux questions pr\u00e9liminaires. En premier lieu, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que la plaignante, un autre t\u00e9moin et deux autres personnes nomm\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019audience soient identifi\u00e9s par des initiales dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. En second lieu, la Commission a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 qui existe entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait vis\u00e9e par les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\nA. Identification de la plaignante et d\u2019autres personnes par des initiales [5] Sur cette question, la Commission fait valoir que, comme les d\u00e9cisions du tribunal sont accessibles au public, la plaignante, un t\u00e9moin, et deux autres personnes qui n\u2019ont pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9, mais dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience devraient \u00eatre identifi\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision par des initiales seulement et, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence, par d\u2019autres initiales que les leurs. Selon la Commission, des questions personnelles, qui ne portaient pas sur la question de la discrimination, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019audience et causeraient un pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9 aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s si les faits en cause \u00e9taient rendus publics.\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande visant \u00e0 ce que des initiales soient utilis\u00e9es et fait valoir que les circonstances de l\u2019affaire ne justifient pas cette mesure. On ne sait pas quel pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9 serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et aux autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s et l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que certaines des questions personnelles ont une incidence sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[7] Je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que certaines des questions personnelles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience pourraient \u00e9ventuellement nuire \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 un autre t\u00e9moin si elles \u00e9taient divulgu\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Dans la mesure du possible, j\u2019ai anonymis\u00e9 ces renseignements dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. De fait, je n'ai pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de divulguer le nom les deux autres personnes dont le nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et au sujet desquelles la Commission et la plaignante avaient des pr\u00e9occupations. Toutefois, compte tenu du caract\u00e8re personnel des renseignements r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s au cours de l\u2019audience, je vais utiliser les initiales A.B. pour identifier la plaignante et C.D. pour identifier l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins.\nB. La relation employeur-employ\u00e9 qui existe entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e est-elle vis\u00e9e par la LCDP? [8] La seconde question pr\u00e9liminaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e parce que les messagers d\u2019Eazy Express sont des entrepreneurs ind\u00e9pendants. Suivant la Commission, il ressort de la preuve que : (1) la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les conditions de travail sont impos\u00e9es unilat\u00e9ralement par Eazy Express; (2) tous les messagers rel\u00e8vent du m\u00eame superviseur; (3) les instruments de travail sont fournis aux messagers, notamment leur uniforme, une radio et un scanner, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de leur v\u00e9hicule, pour lequel une indemnit\u00e9 fixe est pr\u00e9vue; (4) les messagers doivent ex\u00e9cuter leur travail au cours d\u2019heures pr\u00e9cises fix\u00e9es par Eazy Express; (5) les messagers doivent respecter les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019Eazy Express. Suivant la jurisprudence applicable (en l\u2019occurrence les arr\u00eats Canadien Pacifique Lt\u00e9e c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1991] 1 C.F. 571 (C.A.) (QL); et, McCormick c. Fasken Martineau DuMoulin SRL, 2014 CSC 39, notamment), la Commission affirme qu\u2019il existait une relation employeur-employ\u00e9 entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que cette relation tombait sous le coup des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 ce que la LCDP s\u2019applique \u00e0 la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 qui existait entre elle et la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s par la Commission, j\u2019accepte que la relation employeur-employ\u00e9 qui existait entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e est vis\u00e9e par les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\nIII. Cadre juridique [10] La plainte est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de deux articles de la LCDP. Suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour un employeur de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite qui sont susceptibles d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu si cet acte discriminatoire est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Le sexe est un motif de distinction illicite, et une distinction fond\u00e9e sur la grossesse est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (paragraphes 3(1) et 3(2) de la LCDP).\n[11] Il incombe \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est \u00ab celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, 1985 CanLII 18 (CSC), par. 28).\n[12] Dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination, qu\u2019elle a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, par. 33 (Moore)).\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9 qui doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une preuve prima facie de discrimination peut \u00e9viter une conclusion d\u00e9favorable en pr\u00e9sentant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9montrant que ses agissements n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires ou en invoquant un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi qui justifie son acte discriminatoire. Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque un moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu par la loi, le fardeau de la preuve lui est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 (Peel Law Association c. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, par. 67 (Pieters)). Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 se contente de soumettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9futant la preuve prima facie, seul le fardeau de pr\u00e9sentation passe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 (Pieters, par. 68). Dans ce cas, il incombe toujours au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 est fausse ou n\u2019est qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte et que le comportement de l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait effectivement empreint de discrimination (Pieters, par. 74 et Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) (Basi)).\n[14] Il est, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, difficile de faire la preuve d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs, ainsi que le Tribunal l\u2019a reconnu dans la d\u00e9cision Basi :\nLa discrimination n\u2019est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu\u2019on puisse prouver par des preuves directes qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement.\n[15] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans de nombreux cas, le Tribunal tirera une conclusion de discrimination, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, en se fondant sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstanciels. Comme la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme habituelle de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qui s\u2019applique en mati\u00e8re civile, [traduction] \u00ab [o]n peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible \u00bb (B\u00e9atrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto, Carswell, 1987), p. 142).\n[16] Enfin, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les actes reproch\u00e9s soient motiv\u00e9s par des consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires pour que la plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la grossesse de la plaignante soit l\u2019un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 419 (C.A.) (QL)).\nIV. Preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience C. T\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par la plaignante et la Commission (i) La plaignante [17] La plaignante a commenc\u00e9 vers la fin de janvier 2008 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le contrat qu\u2019elle avait conclu avec Eazy Express Inc. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9e pour ce travail par Mme C.D., une autre messag\u00e8re d\u2019Eazy Express qui \u00e9tait une de ses amies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Au d\u00e9part, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme travailleuse de rel\u00e8ve \u00e0 contrat. Vers la fin de mars 2008, lorsqu\u2019un poste de messager \u00e0 temps plein a \u00e9t\u00e9 disponible, la plaignante s\u2019est vu offrir le contrat.\n[18] La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est devenue enceinte \u00e0 deux reprises pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour Eazy Express.\n[19] Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait devenue enceinte une premi\u00e8re fois en ao\u00fbt 2008. Suivant la plaignante, cette premi\u00e8re grossesse s\u2019\u00e9tait termin\u00e9e par une fausse couche au cours du week\u2011end des 22 et 23 ao\u00fbt 2008. La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait inform\u00e9 le lundi 25 ao\u00fbt 2008 sa sup\u00e9rieure, Glenda Frandsen, et d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues de travail de sa fausse couche.\n[20] La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours du mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2008, elle avait appris de la part de Sherry Rideout, une coll\u00e8gue de travail, que Mme Frandsen avait dit \u00e0 un autre coll\u00e8gue de travail [traduction] \u00ab conduisez\u2011la [la plaignante] \u00e0 une clinique et d\u00e9barrassez-vous du probl\u00e8me \u00bb. La plaignante a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ses propos comme une invitation \u00e0 se faire avorter.\n[21] La plaignante a annonc\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me grossesse au d\u00e9but de novembre 2008. Elle se rappelle avoir annonc\u00e9 cette deuxi\u00e8me grossesse \u00e0 huit de ses compagnons de travail sans en avoir toutefois inform\u00e9 directement Mme Frandsen. La plaignante explique qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen de sa grossesse parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune raison de le faire. Par la suite, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019en avait pas inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen en raison des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s commentaires de celle-ci au sujet de sa grossesse pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente ([traduction] \u00ab conduisez-la [la plaignante] \u00e0 une clinique et d\u00e9barrassez-vous du probl\u00e8me \u00bb).\n[22] La plaignante raconte que le vendredi 21 novembre 2008, elle a inopin\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 convoqu\u00e9e au bureau de Mme Frandsen, qui l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que son emploi \u00e0 temps plein de messag\u00e8re prenait fin. Pour justifier le licenciement de la plaignante, Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle commettait trop d\u2019erreurs de balayage.\n[23] La plaignante affirme qu\u2019on ne lui avait auparavant jamais signal\u00e9 d\u2019erreurs de balayage et qu\u2019on ne lui avait jamais parl\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes de rendement et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais fait l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires pour quelque raison que ce soit. Elle affirme \u00e9galement n\u2019avoir jamais eu connaissance d\u2019un rapport concernant son rendement en ce qui concerne le balayage. Elle admet toutefois avoir eu certains probl\u00e8mes personnels et familiaux qui concernaient \u00e9galement C.D. et une autre coll\u00e8gue de travail et que ces probl\u00e8mes avaient pu la distraire au bureau en ao\u00fbt 2008. \u00c0 ce propos, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Frandsen lui avait dit ne pas laisser ses probl\u00e8mes personnels nuire \u00e0 son travail. La plaignante a reconnu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab demande raisonnable \u00bb, tout en ajoutant [traduction] \u00ab je nie que Glenda ait affirm\u00e9 que j\u2019avais des probl\u00e8mes au travail \u00bb.\n[24] Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de son licenciement, la plaignante a appris \u00e0 Mme Frandsen qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois. Elle a toutefois suppos\u00e9 que Mme Frandsen \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant de sa grossesse, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 inform\u00e9 plusieurs de ses coll\u00e8gues. La plaignante a tenu pour acquis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bien connu dans son milieu de travail qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois.\n[25] La plaignante explique que, malgr\u00e9 son licenciement, Mme Frandsen lui a offert un emploi \u00e0 temps partiel comme travailleuse de rel\u00e8ve pour la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates qui approchait. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait choqu\u00e9e et bless\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision d\u2019Eazy Express de mettre fin \u00e0 son circuit de livraison \u00e0 temps plein, mais qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 \u00e0 contrec\u0153ur de travailler comme travailleuse de rel\u00e8ve. Elle s\u2019est sentie oblig\u00e9e d\u2019accepter cette offre parce que son revenu \u00e9tait le seul revenu du m\u00e9nage \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, qu\u2019elle avait deux enfants \u00e0 faire vivre et que la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates approchait. Suivant la plaignante, il \u00e9tait \u00e9trange qu\u2019Eazy Express continue \u00e0 l\u2019engager comme travailleuse de rel\u00e8ve compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait accus\u00e9e d\u2019avoir fait trop d\u2019erreurs de balayage et qu\u2019Eazy Express ne lui offrait pas de formation suppl\u00e9mentaire en balayage.\n[26] La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme travailleuse de rel\u00e8ve le lundi 24 novembre 2008. Elle a racont\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de la semaine en question, elle avait surpris des coll\u00e8gues de travail qui parlaient de la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat de sous-traitance. Elle les a confront\u00e9s et ils lui ont dit qu\u2019on avait r\u00e9sili\u00e9 son contrat de sous-traitance en raison de sa grossesse. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de la m\u00eame semaine, Jason Bunnaman, le messager qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9 pour la remplacer lui avait dit qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa grossesse.\n[27] Le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2008 est le dernier jour o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 pour Eazy Express.\n[28] La plaignante affirme que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat avec Eazy Express, elle s\u2019entendait bien avec Mme Frandsen et elle convient que celle\u2011ci \u00e9tait une bonne superviseure et qu\u2019elle faisait preuve d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[29] La plaignante a accouch\u00e9 le 19 juillet 2009.\n(ii) Trudy Guenther [30] Mme Guenther a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour Eazy Express pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es comme entrepreneure ind\u00e9pendante et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enceinte \u00e0 trois reprises pendant cette p\u00e9riode. En tant qu\u2019entrepreneure ind\u00e9pendante, elle croyait comprendre qu\u2019elle devait g\u00e9rer les cong\u00e9s dont elle avait besoin, ce qui l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 engager quelqu\u2019un pour effectuer son parcours. Par cons\u00e9quent, pendant les trois derniers mois de chacune de ces grossesses, elle avait pris l\u2019initiative de demander \u00e0 un des membres de sa famille de la remplacer pour effectuer son parcours \u00e0 sa place. Elle n\u2019avait pas abord\u00e9 la direction d\u2019Eazy Express pour explorer la possibilit\u00e9 de trouver une mesure d\u2019accommodement ou pour demander de trouver quelqu\u2019un pour la remplacer.\n[31] Elle a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne connaissait personne qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 chez Eazy Express par suite d\u2019une grossesse et elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne connaissait aucune politique portant sur les employ\u00e9es enceintes.\n(iii) Kim Bilton [32] Mme Bilton a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler chez Eazy Express Inc. \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2005 comme chauffeuse de rel\u00e8ve jusqu\u2019\u00e0 f\u00e9vrier ou mars 2006, lorsqu\u2019elle est devenue enceinte. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle a eu une conversation avec Mme Frandsen et avec Maria Cunha, une autre superviseure d\u2019Eazy Express au sujet de sa grossesse. Suivant Mme Bilton, on lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de se trouver un autre emploi o\u00f9 elle pourrait avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les entrepreneurs n\u2019avaient pas droit \u00e0 ce genre de cong\u00e9. On a \u00e9galement laiss\u00e9 entendre \u00e0 Mme Bilton que les contraintes physiques de ce genre de travail n\u2019\u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre pas adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 sa situation de femme enceinte. \u00c0 ce propos, Mme Bilton affirme que Mme Cunha lui a dit qu\u2019une femme enceinte qui travaillait pour Eazy Express \u00e0 Cambridge avait perdu son b\u00e9b\u00e9 en raison des exigences physiques du travail. Mme Bilton a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui avait dit que Ted Brooks, le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019Eazy Express \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, n\u2019avait pas d\u2019assurance pour couvrir les grossesses. Mme Bilton a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune conversation concernant des mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u2019avait eu lieu au sujet de sa grossesse, mais qu\u2019elle pouvait continuer \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle se trouve un autre emploi.\n[33] Mme Bilton s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 un autre emploi et a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 son enfant en octobre 2006. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas sentie offens\u00e9e par la conversation qu\u2019elle avait eue avec Mmes Frandsen et Cunha et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de ranc\u0153ur envers la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou ses sup\u00e9rieurs. D\u2019ailleurs, apr\u00e8s sa grossesse, elle avait repris du service chez Eazy Express en tant que chauffeuse de rel\u00e8ve pour la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates 2006. En f\u00e9vrier 2007, on lui avait confi\u00e9 un circuit \u00e0 temps plein.\n[34] En mars ou en avril 2008, Mme Bilton est de nouveau devenue enceinte. Une fois de plus, pour avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se trouver un autre emploi avant de donner naissance \u00e0 son enfant.\n[35] En ce qui concerne les erreurs de balayage, Mme Bilton \u00e9tait convaincue que tous les messagers font des erreurs, mais que dans son cas, on ne lui en avait jamais parl\u00e9.\n(iv) Sherry Rideout [36] Mme Rideout est une autre ex\u2011messag\u00e8re d\u2019Eazy Express et ancienne coll\u00e8gue de travail de la plaignante. Elle a \u00e9galement reconnu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une amie de la plaignante. Elle a travaill\u00e9 pour Eazy Express Inc. pendant environ sept mois, de f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 septembre 2008.\n[37] Mme Rideout a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait la plaignante comme une travailleuse acharn\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle faisait un travail incroyable, qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas paresseuse et qu\u2019elle s\u2019acquittait promptement de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[38] Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de ragots et de potins au travail au sujet des probl\u00e8mes personnels et familiaux de la plaignante et de ses conflits avec C.D. Elle a convenu que tout cela \u00e9tait une source de d\u00e9rangements au travail.\n[39] Mme Rideout a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il arrivait que les chauffeurs fassent des erreurs de balayage et elle a reconnu qu\u2019elle faisait elle-m\u00eame des erreurs et qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 Mme Frandsen de faire un suivi aupr\u00e8s des chauffeurs en ce qui concerne les erreurs de balayage.\n[40] Mme Rideout estimait qu\u2019elle s\u2019entendait bien avec Mme Frandsen comme superviseure et que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait une superviseure \u00e9quitable.\n[41] La raison pour laquelle elle avait quitt\u00e9 Eazy Express Inc. \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle ne faisait pas assez d\u2019argent pour couvrir ses d\u00e9penses de v\u00e9hicule. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que son d\u00e9part d\u2019Eazy Express n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 avoir avec Mme Frandsen ou avec la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019entreprise l\u2019avait trait\u00e9e.\n[42] Mme Rideout a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9but d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2008, elle avait surpris une conversation entre Mme Frandsen et une autre coll\u00e8gue au cours de laquelle Mme Frandsen avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab conduisez-la [la plaignante] \u00e0 une clinique et d\u00e9barrassez-vous du probl\u00e8me \u00bb. Elle a tenu pour acquis que l\u2019on faisait allusion \u00e0 une clinique d\u2019avortement, mais elle a admis qu\u2019elle pouvait se tromper. En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Rideout a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas entendu l\u2019autre coll\u00e8gue de travail dire quoi que ce soit et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait entendu que les paroles de Mme Frandsen.\n(v) Jason Bunnaman [43] M. Bunnaman a travaill\u00e9 comme messager pour Eazy Express Inc. du 24 septembre 2008 au 16 mars 2011. Il a repris le circuit de la plaignante comme chauffeur \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 la suite du licenciement de celle\u2011ci en novembre 2008.\n[44] M. Bunnaman a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 on lui avait offert le circuit \u00e0 temps plein de la plaignante, Mme Frandsen lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle on avait retir\u00e9 ce circuit \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle faisait trop d\u2019erreurs de balayage, qu\u2019elle s\u2019absentait trop souvent, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte et que, comme No\u00ebl approchait et qu\u2019il y avait de lourds colis \u00e0 livrer, elle repr\u00e9sentait un handicap.\n[45] Toutefois, en contre-interrogatoire, M. Bunnaman a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 au sujet de sa d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite du 10 janvier 2011 dans laquelle il avait dit \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission que la plaignante avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 et non qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9crit dans cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait \u00e9crit la note de son plein gr\u00e9.\n[46] M. Bunnaman a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 d\u2019Eazy Express apr\u00e8s avoir pris un cong\u00e9 non autoris\u00e9. Il consid\u00e9rait que ce cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9 et il ressentait encore de l\u2019amertume \u00e0 ce sujet. Toutefois, il reconnaissait qu\u2019il s\u2019entendait bien avec Mme Frandsen, sa superviseure.\n[47] M. Bunnaman a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il travaillait pour Eazy Express, il lui arrivait de faire des erreurs de balayage, qui lui \u00e9taient signal\u00e9es par Mmes Cunha et Frandsen, qui lui demandaient alors de faire plus attention. Il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait mention d\u2019aucune sanction \u00e0 ce sujet. Enfin, M. Bunnaman a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on imprimait un relev\u00e9 pour permettre \u00e0 tous les chauffeurs de v\u00e9rifier leurs erreurs de balayage de la veille.\nD. T\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e (vi) April Desaulniers [48] \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le tribunal a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 une assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au Groves Memorial Community Hospital, \u00e0 Fergus, en Ontario, afin d\u2019obtenir une copie du dossier m\u00e9dical de la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode des 22, 23 et 24 ao\u00fbt 2008.\n[49] Mme April Desaulniers, une agente de gestion de l\u2019information sur la sant\u00e9 qui travaille \u00e0 cet h\u00f4pital a comparu devant le Tribunal et a produit les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante. Mme Desaulniers n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun document constatant la pr\u00e9sence de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital les 22, 23 ou 24 ao\u00fbt 2008. Elle a toutefois produit des documents attestant deux visites effectu\u00e9es par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital en 2008.\n[50] La premi\u00e8re visite, qui remontait \u00e0 mai 2008, concernait une entorse \u00e0 la cheville.\n[51] En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me visite, le 18 ao\u00fbt 2008, pour des raisons qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es, le dossier indiquait que la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enceinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n(vii) C.D. [52] C.D. a travaill\u00e9 comme messag\u00e8re pour Eazy Express Inc. de 2004 \u00e0 2012. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle formait tous les nouveaux employ\u00e9s, dont la plaignante. Elle a convenu que le balayage \u00e9tait une des t\u00e2ches importantes de cet emploi.\n[53] Suivant C.D., la plaignante faisait beaucoup d\u2019erreurs de balayage. Un relev\u00e9 indiquant les erreurs de balayage de chacun des messagers \u00e9tait disponible au bureau \u00e0 la fin de chaque journ\u00e9e de travail pour permettre aux employ\u00e9s de conna\u00eetre leurs erreurs de balayage, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. Selon C.D., suivant les relev\u00e9s d\u2019erreurs de balayage quotidiens, les erreurs de la plaignante \u00e9taient constantes. C.D. affirme qu\u2019elle a remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il arrivait que la plaignante fasse jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dix ou m\u00eame quinze erreurs dans une m\u00eame journ\u00e9e.\n[54] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re grossesse de la plaignante, C.D. se rappelle que la plaignante lui en avait parl\u00e9 et elle se souvient que la plaignante en avait parl\u00e9 ouvertement au travail. Elle se souvient qu\u2019un lundi, la plaignante lui avait appris qu\u2019elle avait fait une fausse couche au cours du week\u2011end.\n[55] En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me grossesse de la plaignante, C.D. a expliqu\u00e9 que la plaignante lui avait dit, en priv\u00e9, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait de nouveau enceinte. Suivant C.D., la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 de n\u2019en parler \u00e0 personne. C.D. affirme qu\u2019elle a respect\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[56] C.D. a \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 des ragots qui circulaient au travail au sujet des probl\u00e8mes personnels et familiaux auxquels la plaignante \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e. Suivant C.D., il y avait tellement de racontars qu\u2019elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 faire son travail compte tenu de l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re tendue. De fait, C.D. a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e dans les probl\u00e8mes personnels et familiaux de la plaignante. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que C.D. affirme qu\u2019elle et la plaignante \u00e9taient amies jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 les probl\u00e8mes familiaux et personnels de celle\u2011ci ont commenc\u00e9, elles ne se sont plus beaucoup parl\u00e9 par la suite.\n[57] En ce qui concerne le retrait du circuit \u00e0 plein temps de la plaignante, C.D. a expliqu\u00e9 que la plaignante lui avait dit que le motif qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour justifier son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle commettait trop d\u2019erreurs de balayage.\n(viii) Maria Cunha [58] Mme Cunha a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Eazy Express en 2004 et elle est la superviseure au bureau de Cambridge. Elle travaille \u00e0 l\u2019occasion \u00e0 Guelph, o\u00f9 elle remplace Mme Frandsen lorsque celle\u2011ci n\u2019est pas disponible. Mme Cunha et Mme Frandsen sont \u00e9galement des compagnes de vie. C.D. est \u00e9galement une amie du couple.\n[59] Mme Cunha a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur son exp\u00e9rience en ce qui concerne les femmes enceintes chez Eazy Express. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 trois cas diff\u00e9rents.\n[60] Dans le premier cas, une chauffeuse s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Cunha vers le cinqui\u00e8me mois de sa grossesse pour lui expliquer que son m\u00e9decin lui avait dit qu\u2019en raison de complications m\u00e9dicales, elle ne pouvait pas continuer \u00e0 travailler comme chauffeuse. Elle a donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis de deux semaines \u00e0 Eazy Express et est all\u00e9e travailler pour une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de taxis. Cette chauffeuse est revenue par la suite travailler pour Eazy Express et s\u2019est vu confier un circuit \u00e0 temps plein.\n[61] Le deuxi\u00e8me cas \u00e9tait celui de Mme Guenther. Mme Cunha a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Guenther avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de travailler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la naissance de son enfant, qu\u2019elle avait pris deux jours de cong\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle ensuite \u00e9tait revenue au travail. Suivant Mme Cunha, Mme Guenther avait pris des dispositions pour confier son circuit \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un de sa famille pendant son cong\u00e9 de deux jours parce qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas perdre d\u2019argent.\n[62] Le troisi\u00e8me cas de grossesse dont Mme Cunha a parl\u00e9 \u00e9tait celui de Mme Bilton. Mme Cunha se souvient de la conversation qu\u2019elle avait eue avec Mme Bilton au sujet de la grossesse de cette derni\u00e8re. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Bilton \u00e9tait venue lui parler de sa grossesse et lui avait demand\u00e9 quels avantages sociaux Eazy Express pouvait lui offrir. Mme Cunha a racont\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Bilton qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019entrepreneure autonome, elle n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi. Elle a inform\u00e9 Mme Bilton qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance, la seule fa\u00e7on pour elle d\u2019obtenir des prestations de maternit\u00e9 \u00e9tait de se trouver un emploi o\u00f9 elle pourrait \u00eatre inscrite sur une liste de paye pendant un certain nombre de semaines. Mme Cunha a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 Mme Bilton de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour Eazy Express si elle le souhaitait, mais que Mme Bilton avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019aller travailler pour une agence de placement temporaire afin d\u2019avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi. Mme Cunha affirme qu\u2019elle ne faisait que donner des conseils d\u2019amie \u00e0 Mme Bilton pour qu\u2019elle puisse obtenir des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi pendant son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Mme Cunha nie avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Bilton d\u2019une employ\u00e9e de Cambridge qui avait fait une fausse couche ou que M. Brooks n\u2019avait pas d\u2019assurance qui couvrait les cas de grossesse. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ignorait si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait une assurance couvrant ce risque.\n[63] Mme Cunha a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2008, elle avait pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps au bureau de Guelph parce qu\u2019elle formait de nouveaux chauffeurs et qu\u2019il y avait une gr\u00e8ve \u00e0 Postes Canada. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par Postes Canada d\u2019un nombre \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019erreurs de balayage faites par la plaignante. Mme Cunha se souvient d\u2019avoir abord\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises pour lui parler de ses erreurs de balayage. Elle a racont\u00e9 qu'au cours de ces rencontres, elle avait montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante un relev\u00e9 indiquant ses erreurs. Suivant Mme Cunha, la plaignante ne semblait pas se souvenir d\u2019avoir fait des erreurs. Elle semblait distraite et ne semblait de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pas en mesure de donner des explications raisonnables au sujet des erreurs en question.\n[64] Mme Cunha a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu d\u2019\u00e9change de lettres ou de documents \u00e9crits entre Postes Canada et Eazy Express au sujet des erreurs de balayage de la plaignante. De plus, les rapports d\u2019erreurs de balayage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9chiquet\u00e9s.\n[65] Mme Cunha a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des plaintes re\u00e7ues par la direction des relations avec la client\u00e8le au sujet de la plaignante dans lesquelles des clients se plaignaient de l'absence de tentative de livraison. Suivant Mme Cunha, lorsqu\u2019elle abordait la plaignante au sujet des plaintes en question, la plaignante niait avoir fait des erreurs.\n[66] Mme Cunha a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait eu une discussion avec Mme Frandsen \u00e0 leur domicile le soir du 21 novembre 2008 au sujet du licenciement de la plaignante. Suivant Mme Cunha, Mme Frandsen lui a dit que M. Brooks lui avait donn\u00e9 pour instruction de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante en raison de ses erreurs de balayage. Mme Cunha a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Frandsen lui avait dit qu\u2019imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir avis\u00e9 la plaignante de son cong\u00e9diement, celle\u2011ci avait inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte, que son mari \u00e9tait sans travail, que No\u00ebl approchait et qu\u2019elle ne serait pas capable de subvenir aux besoins de ses deux enfants. Mme Cunha a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait appris qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 que la plaignante \u00e9tait de nouveau enceinte. Mme Frandsen avait alors dit \u00e0 Mme Cunha qu\u2019elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks pour lui expliquer la situation et que Mme Brooks avait confirm\u00e9 l\u2019annulation de son circuit \u00e0 temps plein, mais que, compte tenu de la situation, il avait offert de la garder au service d\u2019Easy Express en tant que chauffeuse de rel\u00e8ve pour la p\u00e9riode de No\u00ebl. Mme Cunha a alors expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Frandsen lui avait dit que M. Brooks avait donn\u00e9 pour instruction \u00e0 Mme Frandsen d\u2019aider la plaignante avec son travail de balayage pendant son travail de rel\u00e8ve compte tenu des erreurs de balayage de la plaignante.\n(ix) Glenda Frandsen [67] Mme Frandsen travaille pour Eazy Express depuis 2004. Elle est devenue superviseure au bureau de Guelph en 2006. En sa qualit\u00e9 de superviseure, elle agit comme agente de liaison entre Postes Canada et les chauffeurs d\u2019Eazy Express et s\u2019assure que les chauffeurs suivent les bonnes m\u00e9thodes et notamment les m\u00e9thodes de balayage. Elle relevait de M. Brooks jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier en d\u00e9cembre 2012. Suivant Mme Frandsen, M. Brooks \u00e9tait la seule personne qui avait le pouvoir d\u2019embaucher et de cong\u00e9dier des employ\u00e9s chez Eazy Express.\n[68] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a elle-m\u00eame des enfants et que beaucoup de femmes qui travaillaient pour Eazy Express devenaient enceintes.\n[69] Mme Frandsen a re\u00e7u la plaignante en entrevue relativement \u00e0 un poste au sein d\u2019Eazy Express et a recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks de l\u2019engager, apr\u00e8s quoi ce dernier a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de l'embaucher. Suivant Mme Frandsen, la plaignante \u00e9tait au d\u00e9part une chauffeuse dont le rendement \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s satisfaisant, qui commettait peu d\u2019erreurs de balayage et qui semblait bien s\u2019entendre avec les autres chauffeurs. Elle a pour cette raison recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui confie un circuit \u00e0 temps plein en mars 2008 et M. Brooks a autoris\u00e9 sa nomination.\n[70] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que Postes Canada publiait chaque jour un rapport indiquant les erreurs de balayage des chauffeurs. Ces rapports signalaient les erreurs commises par les chauffeurs dans les 48 derni\u00e8res heures. Les chauffeurs pouvaient consulter ces relev\u00e9s chaque jour. Les relev\u00e9s demeuraient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Postes Canada et \u00e9taient d\u00e9truits apr\u00e8s six mois. Mme Frandsen a ajout\u00e9 que Postes Canada transmettait \u00e9galement \u00e0 Eazy Express les plaintes soumises \u00e0 la direction des relations avec la client\u00e8le qui indiquaient les situations dans lesquelles un chauffeur avait omis de faire une tentative de livraison.\n[71] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que le dossier de balayage de la plaignante \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 de [traduction] \u00ab impeccable au d\u00e9part \u00bb \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab mauvais \u00bb au milieu de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2008, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle [traduction] \u00ab des erreurs quotidiennes \u00bb ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre commises. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de juillet 2008, Postes Canada a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle pour lui expliquer qu\u2019Eazy Express devait travailler avec la plaignante pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 commettre moins d\u2019erreurs de balayage. Mme Frandsen a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019erreurs de balayage de cette date et a constat\u00e9 que la plaignante avait fait six ou sept erreurs. Suivant Mme Frandsen, il \u00e9tait raisonnable de commettre une ou deux erreurs par semaine, mais commettre six ou sept erreurs en un seul jour \u00e9tait assez inusit\u00e9. Elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante le relev\u00e9 d\u2019erreurs et qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 des explications \u00e0 la plaignante, qui n\u2019avait rien r\u00e9pondu. Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 en collaboration avec la plaignante pour trouver des fa\u00e7ons de corriger la situation.\n[72] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de juillet au d\u00e9but d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2008, il y avait des rumeurs et des insinuations au travail au sujet des probl\u00e8mes personnels et familiaux de la plaignante, y compris un conflit avec C.D. et avec une autre coll\u00e8gue. Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que cette situation cr\u00e9ait des tensions parmi les chauffeurs et entre la plaignante et C.D. Mme Frandsen a inform\u00e9 M. Brooks de la situation. Il lui a r\u00e9pondu d\u2019inviter la plaignante et C.D. \u00e0 \u00eatre plus professionnelles dans leurs relations au travail. \u00c0 la demande de M. Brooks, Mme Frandsen a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante et C.D. pour leur demander de demeurer professionnelles et de ne pas cr\u00e9er de tensions au travail en raison de leurs probl\u00e8mes personnels. Suivant Mme Frandsen, elles lui ont assur\u00e9 leur collaboration et ont promis de cesser de parler de leurs probl\u00e8mes personnels au travail.\n[73] Au d\u00e9but d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2008, quelques jours apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec la plaignante et C.D., la plaignante a inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte (la premi\u00e8re grossesse). Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante si elle pouvait continuer \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches et qu\u2019elle lui avait demand\u00e9 si le poids des colis posait probl\u00e8me et l\u2019avait invit\u00e9e \u00e0 venir lui demander de l\u2019aide si certains colis \u00e9taient trop lourds. Suivant Mme Frandsen, la plaignante lui aurait r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucun probl\u00e8me et qu\u2019elle la remerciait pour son offre.\n[74] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que le lundi suivant le week-end des 22, 23 et 24 ao\u00fbt 2008, la plaignante l\u2019avait abord\u00e9e pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019elle avait fait une fausse couche. Elle a offert \u00e0 la plaignante de prendre un cong\u00e9 si elle en avait besoin. La plaignante a refus\u00e9 son offre. Mme Frandsen a invit\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 s\u2019adresser \u00e0 elle si la situation changeait.\n[75] En octobre 2008, Mme Frandsen a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e par Postes Canada que la plaignante avait commis 25 erreurs de balayage en un seul jour. Suivant Mme Frandsen, Postes Canada avait \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison du nombre d\u2019erreurs commises, le circuit de la plaignante \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab sur le point d\u2019\u00eatre sacrifi\u00e9 \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Frandsen craignait que les erreurs de balayage de la plaignante compromettent le contrat d\u2019Eazy Express avec Postes Canada.\n[76] Mme Frandsen a inform\u00e9 M. Brook de la situation. M. Brooks lui a donn\u00e9 pour instruction de donner un dernier avertissement \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[77] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que le m\u00eame jour, elle a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante, lui a dit qu\u2019elle devait cesser de commettre autant d\u2019erreurs et l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un avertissement final. Suivant Mme Frandsen, la plaignante a fondu en larmes, l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que son mari ne travaillait pas, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la seule personne \u00e0 subvenir aux besoins de la famille et qu\u2019elle tenterait de limiter le nombre d\u2019erreurs.\n[78] Mme Frandsen a racont\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des deux semaines suivantes, les erreurs de balayage de la plaignante semblaient avoir diminu\u00e9. Toutefois, environ quatre plaintes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9, selon Postes Canada, d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 la direction des relations avec la client\u00e8le au cours des six semaines suivantes au sujet des livraisons effectu\u00e9es par la plaignante.\n[79] En novembre 2008, Postes Canada a de nouveau parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Frandsen pour l\u2019informer que 13 erreurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises en un seul jour sur le circuit effectu\u00e9 par la plaignante et que le chauffeur qui effectuait ce circuit devait \u00eatre remplac\u00e9. Mme Frandsen a inform\u00e9 M. Brooks de la situation. Il lui a demand\u00e9 si elle croyait qu\u2019elle avait fait tout ce qu\u2019elle pouvait pour aider la plaignante; elle a r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative. Il lui a alors dit qu\u2019il fallait [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019en d\u00e9barrasser \u00bb. Mme Frandsen a compris que M. Brooks lui donnait pour instruction de mettre fin au contrat de la plaignante avec Eazy Express.\n[80] Le m\u00eame jour, \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e de travail, Mme Frandsen a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante. Elle explique qu\u2019elle a inform\u00e9 la plaignante de la situation qui existait avec Postes Canada et de la d\u00e9cision de M. Brooks. Mme Frandsen explique qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0, la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pleurer et qu\u2019elle a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Frandsen qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. La plaignante \u00e9tait \u00e9galement inqui\u00e8te au sujet de ses enfants et du fait que No\u00ebl approchait.\n[81] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019elle apprenait que la plaignante \u00e9tait de nouveau enceinte. Mme Frandsen \u00e9tait surprise parce que la plaignante venait tout juste de lui dire quelques semaines plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019elle avait fait une fausse couche. Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle parlerait \u00e0 M. Brooks pour voir s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de mettre en place une entente temporaire.\n[82] \u00c0 la suite de sa rencontre avec la plaignante, Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks pour l\u2019informer que la plaignante \u00e9tait enceinte. Il a autoris\u00e9 Mme Frandsen \u00e0 offrir un poste de rel\u00e8ve \u00e0 la plaignante pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 passer la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates, \u00e0 la condition toutefois que Mme Frandsen aide la plaignante avec son balayage.\n[83] Mme Frandsen explique que ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour l\u2019informer que M. Brooks avait autoris\u00e9 du travail de rel\u00e8ve.\n[84] Suivant Mme Frandsen, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 comme chauffeuse de rel\u00e8ve jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2008.\n[85] Mme Frandsen nie avoir entendu toute conversation entre Mme Bilton et Mme Cunha au sujet de la grossesse de Mme Bilton.\n[86] Elle nie \u00e9galement avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019amener la plaignante dans une clinique pour se d\u00e9barrasser du probl\u00e8me. Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle est contre l\u2019avortement et qu\u2019elle ne ferait jamais un tel commentaire.\n[87] Mme Frandsen nie \u00e9galement avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bunnaman des motifs justifiant la cessation du contrat de la plaignante. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas coutume de discuter avec les chauffeurs des motifs ou des circonstances entourant la cessation du contrat d\u2019autres chauffeurs.\nV. La plaignante a\u2011t\u2011elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination? [88] Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination, qu\u2019elle a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore, par. 33).\n[89] Il est acquis aux d\u00e9bats que les deux premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette analyse ont \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits. La plaignante a perdu son emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Elle \u00e9tait enceinte au moment o\u00f9 elle a perdu son emploi. La grossesse est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination par le paragraphe 3(2) de la LCDP. La derni\u00e8re question est celle de savoir si la grossesse est un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans la perte de son circuit \u00e0 temps plein.\nE. La grossesse est\u2011elle un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans le licenciement de la plaignante? [90] Eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour que la grossesse constitue un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans le licenciement de la plaignante, il faut qu\u2019il y ait une certaine indication qu\u2019Eazy Express \u00e9tait au courant de sa grossesse. Si Eazy Express n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de la grossesse de la plaignante, elle ne pouvait en tenir compte, et ce facteur ne pouvait entrer en ligne de compte lors de la d\u00e9cision de licencier la plaignante. Suivant mon appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve de la plaignante, je ne crois pas, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la grossesse de la plaignante lorsqu\u2019elle a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[91] La plaignante a admis qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen, sa sup\u00e9rieure imm\u00e9diate, de sa grossesse avant son licenciement parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune raison de le faire. Plus tard, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019en avait pas inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen en raison de ses pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s commentaires au sujet de sa grossesse pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (\u00ab conduisez-la [la plaignante] \u00e0 une clinique et d\u00e9barrassez-vous du probl\u00e8me \u00bb). En tout \u00e9tat de cause, il est \u00e9vident que la plaignante n\u2019a pas directement inform\u00e9 Eazy Express de sa deuxi\u00e8me grossesse. La plaignante a tenu pour acquis que son employeur \u00e9tait au courant de sa deuxi\u00e8me grossesse \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle en avait inform\u00e9 huit coll\u00e8gues de travail. Elle a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que sa grossesse \u00e9tait un fait notoire dans son milieu de travail. Toutefois, le fait de croire abstraitement quelque chose sans qu\u2019il existe un certain fait qui le confirme n\u2019est pas suffisant (Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 32, aux paragraphes 41 \u00e0 43, conf. par 2006 CF 785).\n[92] La plaignante affirme qu\u2019elle a surpris des coll\u00e8gues de travail en train de parler de son cong\u00e9diement et qu\u2019ils lui ont dit qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Il est toutefois difficile d\u2019accorder quelque valeur que ce soit \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage parce qu\u2019aucun des coll\u00e8gues de travail en question n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et qu\u2019aucun contexte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni pour expliquer le fondement de cette affirmation. Sur quoi se sont fond\u00e9s les coll\u00e8gues de travail en question pour conclure que la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa grossesse? En ont\u2011ils \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s par un superviseur? L\u2019ont\u2011ils pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 en raison du moment o\u00f9 ce licenciement est survenu? Ou s\u2019agissait\u2011il tout simplement de ragots de bureau? En derni\u00e8re analyse, ce t\u00e9moignage laisse le tribunal devant une autre hypoth\u00e8se non \u00e9tay\u00e9e.\n[93] Le seul autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve soumis par la plaignante ou par la Commission pour confirmer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la grossesse de la plaignante et qu\u2019elle a tenu compte de ce fait pour mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la plaignante est le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bunnaman. Toutefois, son t\u00e9moignage est contradictoire sur la question. D\u2019une part, M. Bunnaman a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 une liste de raisons que lui aurait donn\u00e9es Mme Frandsen pour justifier la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de la plaignante, et notamment le fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte et, d\u2019autre part, il s\u2019en tient \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure qu\u2019il avait faite devant la Commission suivant laquelle la plaignante avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 et n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je signale que M. Bunnaman avait fait cette d\u00e9claration \u00e0 la Commission avant son propre cong\u00e9diement. Au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, M. Bunnaman a admis qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait que son propre cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il restait amer \u00e0 ce sujet, ce qui me donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il avait peut-\u00eatre des raisons de prendre position en faveur de la plaignante. De plus, j\u2019ai du mal \u00e0 croire que Mme Frandsen, la sup\u00e9rieure de M. Bunnaman, lui aurait fourni une liste de toutes les raisons justifiant la r\u00e9siliation du contrat d\u2019une employ\u00e9e et notamment qu\u2019elle aurait admis avoir commis un acte discriminatoire, et ce, d\u2019autant plus lorsque les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par la plaignante et par la Commission, y compris la plaignante et M. Bunnaman, ont expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils s\u2019entendaient bien avec Mme Frandsen et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une superviseure \u00e9quitable. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je n\u2019accorde aucune valeur \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration faite par M. Bunnaman au sujet des motifs du cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante.\nF. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait\u2011elle l\u2019habitude de licencier les femmes enceintes ou de les inciter \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner? [94] Les autres t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la plaignante et la Commission, en l\u2019occurrence ceux de Mmes Guenther et Bilton, visaient \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cong\u00e9die les messag\u00e8res ou les incite \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner lorsqu\u2019elles deviennent enceintes. Les commentaires entendus par Mme Rideout sembleraient \u00e9galement relever de cette all\u00e9gation. L\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 ici est qu\u2019il existe un usage syst\u00e9mique qui peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour prouver que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime personnellement de discrimination. Toutefois, \u00e0 mon avis, la preuve n\u2019appuie pas les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[95] Mmes Guenther et Bilton ont eu plusieurs grossesses alors qu\u2019elles travaillaient pour Eazy Express. Mme Guenther a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle croyait comprendre qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019entrepreneure autonome, il lui incombait de se trouver un rempla\u00e7ant pour effectuer son parcours lorsqu\u2019elle avait besoin de cong\u00e9s, y compris de cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9. Pendant chacune de ses trois grossesses, elle avait pris l\u2019initiative de demander \u00e0 un membre de sa famille de la remplacer pour effectuer son parcours. Elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e ou incit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner pendant ou apr\u00e8s ses grossesses. La Commission soutient que Mme Guenther a agi ainsi parce qu\u2019elle aurait perdu son circuit si elle n\u2019avait pas trouv\u00e9 de remplacement, ce qui semble \u00eatre \u00e9galement ce que Mme Guenther croyait. Toutefois, Mme Guenther a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 la direction d\u2019Eazy Express pour discuter de cette hypoth\u00e8se ou de mesures d\u2019accommodement de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[96] Mme Bilton a expliqu\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait devenue enceinte en 2006, elle avait eu une conversation avec Mmes Frandsen et Cunha au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, des contraintes physiques de son travail et des cons\u00e9quences \u00e9ventuelles de ces contraintes sur sa grossesse et du fait que la compagnie n\u2019avait pas d\u2019assurance pour couvrir les cas de grossesse. Au cours de cette conversation, elle a appris que, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une entrepreneure autonome, elle n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 des prestations de maternit\u00e9 au titre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi. Mme Bilton a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui avait dit que, si elle voulait recevoir de telles prestations, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu\u2019elle postule un emploi qui la rendrait admissible \u00e0 de telles prestations. C\u2019est effectivement ce qu\u2019elle a fait. Elle n\u2019entretient aucun sentiment n\u00e9gatif envers Eazy Express ou ses superviseurs en raison de cette situation et elle est par la suite revenue travailler pour cette compagnie. Elle a fait la m\u00eame chose lors de sa deuxi\u00e8me grossesse, qui est \u00e9galement survenue alors qu\u2019elle travaillait pour Eazy Express.\n[97] Je ne vois rien de discriminatoire dans cette conversation. En l\u2019invitant \u00e0 se trouver un emploi couvert par l\u2019assurance-emploi qui lui permettait de percevoir des prestations de maternit\u00e9, il semble que l\u2019on ait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Bilton des conseils dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur et pour des raisons \u00e9conomiques valables d\u2019abord et avant tout. Si d\u2019autres questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es, ce que nie l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Bilton n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pensait qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient soulev\u00e9es dans le but de l\u2019inciter \u00e0 remettre sa d\u00e9mission. Au bout du compte, Mme Bilton n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e et c\u2019est de son propre chef qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se trouver un autre emploi qui lui permettrait d\u2019\u00eatre admissible \u00e0 l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[98] En ce qui concerne les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s propos tenus par Mme Frandsen \u00e0 un autre coll\u00e8gue de travail que Mme Rideout aurait entendus au sujet de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e premi\u00e8re grossesse de la plaignante (\u00ab conduisez-la [la plaignante] \u00e0 une clinique et d\u00e9barrassez-vous du probl\u00e8me \u00bb), il est difficile d\u2019accorder beaucoup de poids \u00e0 ce t\u00e9moignage, compte tenu du fait que le coll\u00e8gue de travail qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conversation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et qu\u2019aucun contexte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni au sujet de cette conversation. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, je ne suis pas certain des inf\u00e9rences que l\u2019on pourrait tirer des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s propos tenus, compte tenu du fait qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019actes discriminatoires dont la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime en ce qui concerne sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e premi\u00e8re grossesse. M\u00eame si la demanderesse a inform\u00e9 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail, y compris ses sup\u00e9rieurs, de sa pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e premi\u00e8re grossesse, elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qui tendrait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner.\nG. Conclusion sur la preuve prima facie [99] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le tribunal ne dispose pas de suffisamment de preuves pour appuyer l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la plaignante suivant laquelle la grossesse est un facteur qui a jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 son contrat comme chauffeuse \u00e0 temps plein. Il n\u2019y a \u00e9galement pas suffisamment de preuves pour appuyer l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e cong\u00e9die les messag\u00e8res ou les incite \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner lorsqu\u2019elles deviennent enceintes. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens des articles 7 ou 10 de la LCDP et sa plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nVI. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a\u2011t\u2011elle fourni une explication raisonnable pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision de mettre fin au contrat de la plaignante? [100] Bien que la plaignante n\u2019ait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, j\u2019accepte \u00e9galement l\u2019explication fournie par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante.\n[101] Mme Cunha, Mme Frandsen et C.D. ont expliqu\u00e9 que la plaignante avait fait de nombreuses erreurs de balayage entre les mois de juillet et de novembre 2008.\n[102] Mme Cunha affirme qu\u2019elle a discut\u00e9 de la situation avec la plaignante \u00e0 quelques reprises et que celle\u2011ci a r\u00e9agi en expliquant qu\u2019elle ne se rappelait pas avoir fait d'erreurs de balayage, qu\u2019elle semblait distraite et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pas en mesure de donner d\u2019explications raisonnables pour ses erreurs.\n[103] Mme Frandsen a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u de nombreuses plaintes de la part de Postes Canada au sujet des erreurs de balayage de la plaignante. Lorsqu\u2019elle a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante et lui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des explications, elle n\u2019en a re\u00e7u aucune. Elle affirme \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9 avec la plaignante pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 diminuer ses erreurs. Toutefois, la situation n\u2019a sembl\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer que pendant un court laps de temps.\n[104] Le t\u00e9moin C.D. a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, alors qu\u2019elle consultait le rapport d\u2019erreurs de balayage quotidien, elle avait constat\u00e9 que la plaignante faisait beaucoup d\u2019erreurs de balayage, parfois jusqu\u2019\u00e0 15 en une seule journ\u00e9e.\n[105] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mmes Cunha, Frandsen et C.D. confirme les explications de l\u2019intim\u00e9e suivant lesquelles la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de ses nombreuses et continuelles erreurs de balayage. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pas soumis de preuve documentaire confirmant sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante, et notamment aucun des rapports d\u2019erreurs de balayage ni aucun relev\u00e9 des conversations entre la plaignante et ses superviseurs ou des conversations avec Postes Canada, je suis convaincu que le t\u00e9moignage donn\u00e9 par Mmes Cunha, Frandsen et C.D. est cr\u00e9dible et fiable. Elles ont syst\u00e9matiquement donn\u00e9 la m\u00eame version des faits; leurs r\u00e9ponses sont, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, claires et br\u00e8ves, et, malgr\u00e9 le fait que C.D. ait eu des probl\u00e8mes personnels avec la plaignante et le fait que Mmes Cunha et Frandsen travaillent toujours pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, rien ne me permet de croire qu\u2019elles ont donn\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage int\u00e9ress\u00e9. De plus, le t\u00e9moignage suivant lequel les erreurs de la plaignante se sont aggrav\u00e9es et ont atteint leur paroxysme \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait confront\u00e9e \u00e0 de nombreux \u00e9v\u00e9nements importants dans sa vie rend le t\u00e9moignage de Mmes Cunha, Frandsen et C.D. encore plus plausible dans les circonstances.\n[106] La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais eu acc\u00e8s aux rapports concernant les erreurs de balayage et qu\u2019on ne lui a jamais parl\u00e9 de ses erreurs de balayage. Toutefois, bon nombre des t\u00e9moins remettent cette affirmation en question. Mmes Frandsen et Cunha ont expliqu\u00e9 que Postes Canada publiait chaque jour des rapports d\u2019erreurs de balayage que tous les chauffeurs pouvaient consulter. Mmes Cunha et Frandsen ont expliqu\u00e9 que, lorsque Postes Canada leur a signal\u00e9 les erreurs de balayage de la plaignante, elles les ont relay\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante, lui ont demand\u00e9 des explications et ont tent\u00e9 de collaborer avec elle pour corriger le probl\u00e8me. Le t\u00e9moin C.D. a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle consultait le rapport d\u2019erreurs de balayage r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et qu\u2019elle avait remarqu\u00e9 que la plaignante faisait beaucoup d\u2019erreurs de balayage. Mme Rideout a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il incombait \u00e0 Mme Frandsen de faire un suivi relativement aux erreurs de balayage. Enfin, M. Bunnaman a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019un relev\u00e9 \u00e9tait mis \u00e0 la disposition de tous les chauffeurs pour qu\u2019ils v\u00e9rifient leurs erreurs de balayage de la veille. M. Bunnaman a ajout\u00e9 qui lui arrivait parfois de faire des erreurs de balayage, qui lui \u00e9taient signal\u00e9es par Mmes Cunha et Frandsen, qui lui demandaient alors de faire plus attention.\n[107] La plaignante et la Commission affirment \u00e9galement que le fait que la plaignante a pu continuer \u00e0 travailler comme chauffeuse de rel\u00e8ve apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement remet en question les explications donn\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour justifier son cong\u00e9diement. Si Eazy Express \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les erreurs de balayage de la plaignante, pourquoi alors a\u2011t\u2011elle continu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019employer dans un travail qui n\u00e9cessitait du balayage?\n[108] L\u00e0 encore, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Frandsen sur cette question. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir inform\u00e9e de son cong\u00e9diement, la plaignante lui a alors fait savoir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte, que son mari \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage et qu\u2019elle devait s\u2019occuper de leurs deux enfants et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e en raison de l\u2019approche de la p\u00e9riode des F\u00eates. Mme Frandsen a alors dit \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle parlerait \u00e0 M. Brooks pour voir si l\u2019on pouvait trouver une solution temporaire. M. Brooks a autoris\u00e9 un travail de rel\u00e8ve pour la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode achaland\u00e9e des F\u00eates, \u00e0 condition toutefois que Mme Frandsen aide la plaignante avec le balayage.\n[109] La version des faits de la plaignante n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de celle de Mme Frandsen. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Frandsen lui avait simplement offert du travail de rel\u00e8ve apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle lui a annonc\u00e9 sa grossesse. Par la suite, elle a toutefois admis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que Mme Frandsen ait communiqu\u00e9 avec elle en soir\u00e9e ce jour\u2011l\u00e0 pour lui offrir du travail de rel\u00e8ve apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Brooks. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, il est \u00e9vident que le travail de rel\u00e8ve a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019annonce, par la plaignante, du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte et qu\u2019elle avait diverses pr\u00e9occupations. De plus, le fait que Mme Frandsen devait aider la plaignante avec le balayage rend encore plus probables les motifs du licenciement de la plaignante et l\u2019offre d\u2019emploi subs\u00e9quente.\n[110] \u00c0 titre de commentaire final et pour \u00e9valuer la preuve dans son ensemble, je tiens \u00e0 signaler que j\u2019ai des r\u00e9serves au sujet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la plaignante en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Hormis certaines des contradictions d\u00e9j\u00e0 relev\u00e9es (les raisons pour lesquelles elle n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 Mme Frandsen de sa deuxi\u00e8me grossesse, au par. 91 et le fait qu\u2019elle dit n\u2019avoir jamais eu acc\u00e8s aux rapports d\u2019erreurs de balayage, au par. 106), j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par les contradictions entre la version des faits de la plaignante et le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desaulniers. La plaignante a dit \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de travail et \u00e0 Eazy Express qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte en ao\u00fbt 2008 et qu\u2019elle avait fait une fausse couche. Elle a maintenu cette version des faits devant le tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Desaulniers ait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu. Mme Desaulniers a expliqu\u00e9 que la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital en mai 2008 pour une entorse \u00e0 la cheville. Toutefois, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si elle s\u2019\u00e9tait foul\u00e9 la cheville vers le 16 juin 2008, elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Aucune explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour expliquer ces contradictions. Bien qu\u2019aucune des contradictions portant sur la premi\u00e8re grossesse ou sur l'entorse \u00e0 la cheville ne soit entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte directement dans mon analyse des questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, j\u2019estime que ces probl\u00e8mes suppl\u00e9mentaires de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 renforcent davantage mes conclusions, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s.\n[111] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour ces motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires, m\u00eame si la plaignante avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fourni une explication raisonnable pour justifier le cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante et que cette explication n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte lui permettant de poser des actes discriminatoires.\nVII. D\u00e9cision [112] Pour les motifs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Eazy Express Inc., n\u2019a commis aucun acte discriminatoire pour le motif de distinction illicite fond\u00e9 sur le sexe (la grossesse) au titre de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, lorsqu\u2019elle a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la plaignante le 21 novembre 2008.\n[113] Je conclus \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 une ligne de conduite, au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP, consistant \u00e0 cong\u00e9dier les messag\u00e8res \u00e0 temps plein ou \u00e0 les inciter \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner lorsqu\u2019elles deviennent enceintes.\n[114] Comme la plainte n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e, le tribunal n\u2019accorde aucune r\u00e9paration \u00e0 la plaignante.\nSign\u00e9 par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre instructeur\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 10 d\u00e9cembre 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1798\/2812\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : A.B. c.

D\u00e9cision. 13\nI. Contexte \u2013 La plainte [1] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) instruise la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Ken Kelsh (le plaignant) contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique (l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] La plainte concerne une all\u00e9gation de discrimination en cours d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et un manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019adaptation, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) et sur les repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e le 1er juin 2012 pour inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans les pratiques et proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019administration de tests et de postulation, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[3] Le plaignant est membre d\u2019une section du syndicat des Teamsters (le syndicat). Son emploi est r\u00e9gi par une convention collective (la convention collective) conclue entre le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[4] Bien que la Commission ne participe pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[5] Les observations orales concernant la requ\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence le 19 septembre 2014.\nII. Requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte [6] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire rejeter la plainte pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\n\u2022 Le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9puis\u00e9 les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui lui sont ouverts en vertu de la convention collective, en contravention du paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi.\n\u2022 Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi donne au Tribunal le pouvoir de trancher toutes les questions de droit et toutes les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi, y compris celles concernant sa propre comp\u00e9tence.\n[7] Outre ses observations dans l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la preuve documentaire suivante \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate :\n\u2022 l\u2019affidavit de Brianne Sly, souscrit le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2014 (l\u2019affidavit de Mme Sly);\n\u2022 la plainte;\n\u2022 le rapport et la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, dat\u00e9s du 17 avril 2012, concernant l\u2019application des articles 40 et 41;\n\u2022 la lettre du 20 octobre 2011 de Me David Brown, un avocat du syndicat, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Caroline Audet, l\u2019agente du r\u00e8glement anticip\u00e9 de la Commission (la lettre de Me Brown).\nIII. Contexte de la requ\u00eate en rejet [8] Le contexte de la requ\u00eate d\u00e9crit ci\u2011dessous n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 par les parties.\n\u2022 Le 24 ao\u00fbt 2011 : le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission;\n\u2022 Le 21 octobre 2011 : le syndicat a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission la lettre de Me Brown. Essentiellement, cette lettre explique que le syndicat a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser un grief pour le compte du plaignant parce que, selon la connaissance du syndicat, le fait que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas de certification particuli\u00e8re (la carte D) alors qu\u2019il occupait un poste \u00e9quivalent sans perte de salaire ferait en sorte qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas avoir gain de cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du grief ou de l\u2019arbitrage;\n\u2022 Dans la lettre de Me Brown, on mentionne aussi que les questions du plaignant concernant les droits de la personne devraient \u00eatre adress\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission;\n\u2022 La Commission est convaincue que le d\u00e9faut de pr\u00e9senter un grief n\u2019\u00e9tait pas imputable au plaignant et, le 27 juin 2012, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait donner suite \u00e0 la plainte, parce qu\u2019aucun autre m\u00e9canisme de recours n\u2019\u00e9tait normalement ouvert au plaignant, conform\u00e9ment au rapport et \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, dat\u00e9s du 17 avril 2012, concernant l\u2019application des articles 40 et 41;\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du 27 juin 2012;\n\u2022 Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013 : la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[9] En ce qui concerne les griefs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour le compte du plaignant, les \u00e9tapes principales sont d\u00e9crites de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n\u2022 Le 21 juin 2013 : M. Wade Phillips, un employ\u00e9 syndiqu\u00e9 qui assumait \u00e0 titre int\u00e9rimaire la fonction d\u2019assistant du directeur du syndicat, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief (le grief no 1) pour le compte du plaignant, qui comprenait une demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation en vertu de la Loi. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tape 1 \u00bb de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs;\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 le grief no 1;\n\u2022 Le 17 septembre 2013 : M. Phillips a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 1 pour le compte du plaignant (le grief no 2), qui comprenait aussi une demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation en vertu de la Loi;\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 le grief no 2;\n\u2022 Le syndicat a fait passer les griefs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante (l\u2019\u00e9tape 2) de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs;\n\u2022 L\u2019intim\u00e9e a rejet\u00e9 les deux griefs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape 2;\n\u2022 L\u2019\u00e9tape suivante de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs est l\u2019arbitrage;\n\u2022 En f\u00e9vrier 2014, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a signifi\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate;\n\u2022 Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, le syndicat a retir\u00e9 les griefs sous r\u00e9serve de tout droit;\n\u2022 Dans le contexte de la r\u00e9ponse du plaignant \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate, M. Phillips a souscrit un affidavit le 17 avril 2014 (l\u2019affidavit de M. Phillips) dans lequel il d\u00e9clarait essentiellement ce qui suit :\n(i) il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les deux griefs du plaignant parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de la lettre de Me Brown (au paragraphe 3);\n(ii) lorsqu\u2019il a appris l\u2019existence de la lettre de Me Brown le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2013 [sic], il a retir\u00e9 les griefs sous r\u00e9serve de tout droit (au paragraphe 4). [Ma note : compte tenu des dates figurant dans tous les documents concernant la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je suppose qu\u2019au paragraphe 4, M. Phillips voulait dire le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2014 et non 2013.]\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contre\u2011interrog\u00e9 M. Phillips concernant son affidavit.\nA. Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate en rejet [11] La th\u00e8se de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous.\n\u2022 La proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs est encore normalement ouverte au plaignant, mais il a choisi de ne pas y recourir;\n\u2022 Les griefs portent essentiellement sur les m\u00eames faits que ceux qui sont en cause dans la plainte. Les griefs \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du processus de l\u2019\u00e9tape 2;\n\u2022 Le syndicat n\u2019a retir\u00e9 la plainte qu\u2019\u00e0 la demande de l\u2019avocat du plaignant;\n\u2022 En outre, le retrait des griefs a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait [traduction] \u00ab sous r\u00e9serve de tout droit et sans que cela cr\u00e9e de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00bb, et les griefs peuvent donc \u00eatre relanc\u00e9s. Les griefs et la plainte sont essentiellement de m\u00eame nature. En fait, le plaignant peut \u00e9puiser la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs au moyen d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de griefs sur [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] exactement les m\u00eames faits et les m\u00eames questions concernant les droits de la personne dont le Tribunal est saisi dans cette affaire, en tout temps \u00bb (au paragraphe 6 de la r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse que le plaignant a faite \u00e0 la requ\u00eate);\n\u2022 Le Bureau d\u2019Arbitrage et de M\u00e9diation des Chemins de fer du Canada (le BAMCFC) est la tribune la plus appropri\u00e9e pour traiter la plainte, parce que les arbitres du BAMCFC connaissent mieux le milieu de travail sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e;\n\u2022 Les arbitres en droit du travail ont la comp\u00e9tence pour se pencher sur les questions de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne et l\u2019obligation de le faire;\n\u2022 Si le Tribunal permet \u00e0 la plainte de suivre son cours, cela serait contraire aux objectifs de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e estime \u00eatre les suivants :\na) \u00e9viter les d\u00e9doublements inutiles des instances, en particulier lorsqu\u2019un grief susceptible d\u2019arbitrage et une plainte relative aux droits de la personne [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] d\u00e9coulent du m\u00eame contexte factuel \u00bb;\nb) favoriser un r\u00e8glement rapide des conflits en milieu de travail par des \u00ab experts qui connaissent bien le milieu de travail \u00bb, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board c. S.E.E.F.P.O., section locale 324, 2003 CSC 42 (\u00ab Parry Sound \u00bb).\n\u2022 Au lieu de recourir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure relative aux droits de la personne lorsque le syndicat a refus\u00e9 de le repr\u00e9senter, le plaignant aurait d\u00fb invoquer l\u2019article 37 du Code canadien du travail (L.R.C. (1985), c. L\u20112). [Ma note : l\u2019article 37 pr\u00e9voit essentiellement qu\u2019il est interdit \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant syndical d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re arbitraire ou discriminatoire ou de mauvaise foi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019exercice des droits qui sont reconnus \u00e0 ceux\u2011ci par la convention collective.]\nB. La th\u00e8se du plaignant [12] La th\u00e8se du plaignant est expos\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous.\n\u2022 Les griefs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par erreur par M. Phillips, l\u2019assistant temporaire du directeur du syndicat, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de la lettre de Me Brown;\n\u2022 La pr\u00e9sente affaire n\u2019en est pas une o\u00f9 l\u2019on recherche le tribunal le plus favorable \u2013 l\u2019avocat du plaignant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant des griefs que lorsqu\u2019il a re\u00e7u la requ\u00eate en question;\n\u2022 Le plaignant ne pouvait pas comprendre les cons\u00e9quences possibles que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des griefs pouvait avoir sur sa plainte. Il n\u2019a fait ces d\u00e9marches que pour comprendre pourquoi on lui refusait un poste;\n\u2022 Lorsque l\u2019avocat du plaignant et l\u2019avocat du syndicat, Me Brown, ont communiqu\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone en pr\u00e9sence du directeur du syndicat William Brehl en octobre 2013, l\u2019avocat du syndicat a, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s directe, persistante et non \u00e9quivoque, confirm\u00e9 que le syndicat n\u2019appuyait pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un grief pour le compte du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs n\u2019est normalement ouverte au plaignant;\n\u2022 Le Tribunal devrait rejeter la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nC. La th\u00e8se de la Commission [13] La th\u00e8se de la Commission est expos\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous.\n\u2022 Le tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter une plainte \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9liminaire : c\u2019est la Commission qui a comp\u00e9tence pour ce faire (Harkin c. (Canada) Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2009 TCDP 6 (Harkin), au paragraphe 20;\n\u2022 Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi \u2013 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Cette loi habilitante ne donne pas au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer ce que l\u2019on pourrait consid\u00e9rer comme une deuxi\u00e8me fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable lorsque la Commission renvoie une plainte pour instruction. Si telle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, celui\u2011ci aurait explicitement accord\u00e9 ce pouvoir au Tribunal dans sa loi habilitante;\n\u2022 Lorsque la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction, elle \u00e9tait convaincue que le plaignant ne pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019aucune proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi, parce que l\u2019avocat du syndicat, Me Brown, avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre que le syndicat ne d\u00e9poserait pas de grief \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune autre proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement de griefs n\u2019\u00e9tait normalement ouverte au plaignant;\n\u2022 Le Tribunal ne devrait rejeter une plainte \u00e0 un stade pr\u00e9liminaire que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles \u2013 par exemple, si une instruction constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal ou si une instruction porterait atteinte aux principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice.\nIV. Questions soulev\u00e9es [14] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate sont les suivantes :\nA. Le Tribunal peut\u2011il statuer sur sa propre comp\u00e9tence?\nB. Le Tribunal peut\u2011il rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, avant la tenue d\u2019une audience?\nC. Le Tribunal a\u2011t\u2011il le pouvoir de rejeter la pr\u00e9sente plainte compte tenu du fait qu\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs est par ailleurs normalement ouverte au plaignant, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi?\nV. Analyse A. Le Tribunal peut-il statuer sur sa propre comp\u00e9tence? [15] Le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n50(2) Il [le membre instructeur du Tribunal] tranche les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente partie.\n[16] Je conclus que l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019expression \u00ab les questions de droit et les questions de fait \u00bb donne au libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi une port\u00e9e suffisante pour que le Tribunal puisse statuer sur des questions touchant \u00e0 sa propre comp\u00e9tence.\nB. Le Tribunal peut\u2011il rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, avant la tenue d\u2019une audience? [17] Je conclus \u00e9galement que, dans des circonstances tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, avant la tenue d\u2019une audience. Ces circonstances limit\u00e9es sont les suivantes :\n(i) Lorsqu\u2019une instruction est susceptible de constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure, comme dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 (Cremasco), conf. par l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CAF 363;\n(ii) Lorsqu\u2019une instruction \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une affaire, ce qui, sans qu\u2019il y ait pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, porterait \u00ab [\u2026] atteinte aux principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb (Toronto (Ville) c. Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (S.C.F.P.), section locale 79, [2003] A.C.S. no 64, au paragraphe 37).\nC. Le Tribunal a\u2011t\u2011il le pouvoir de rejeter la pr\u00e9sente plainte compte tenu du fait qu\u2019une proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs est par ailleurs normalement ouverte au plaignant, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi? (i) Abus de proc\u00e9dure et r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019affaire [18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas qu\u2019il y aurait abus de proc\u00e9dure si l\u2019instruction de la plainte devait \u00eatre poursuivie.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend plut\u00f4t essentiellement que la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs est le recours appropri\u00e9 pour r\u00e9gler les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte parce que : a) les deux arbitres du BAMCFC connaissent mieux le milieu de travail sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et ont la capacit\u00e9, l\u2019autorisation et l\u2019obligation de se pencher sur les all\u00e9gations relatives aux droits de la personne soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte; b) l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi renferme l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019\u00e9viter que des plaintes qui devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es au moyen du processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs soient tranch\u00e9es au moyen du processus administratif concernant les droits de la personne.\n[20] M\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait invoqu\u00e9 un abus de proc\u00e9dure, j\u2019estime qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a pas abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de retard excessif dans l\u2019affaire du plaignant. Aucune question concernant la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019affaire ne se pose en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, parce qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision arbitrale n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u2013 les griefs aux \u00e9tapes 1 et 2 consistaient en des observations \u00e9crites et des r\u00e9ponses \u00e9crites. Aucune audience n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue et aucune d\u00e9cision arbitrale n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, ce qui aurait constitu\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive.\n[21] La poursuite de l\u2019instruction ne porterait pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie, \u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence, au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances ni \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice.\n(ii) Le Tribunal devrait\u2011il rejeter la plainte au motif que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi s\u2019applique? [22] Bien que le Tribunal poss\u00e8de le pouvoir, dans des circonstances tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es, de rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire avant la tenue d\u2019une audience, il subsiste la question de savoir si ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend aux circonstances envisag\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi.\n[23] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n41(1) Sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 40, la Commission statue sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle estime celle\u2011ci irrecevable pour un des motifs suivants :\na) la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019acte discriminatoire devrait \u00e9puiser d\u2019abord les recours internes ou les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel ou de r\u00e8glement des griefs qui lui sont normalement ouverts;\n[24] En incluant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) dans la Loi, le l\u00e9gislateur a reconnu qu\u2019il y avait des proc\u00e9dures parall\u00e8les qui coexistaient.\n[25] Le paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi oblige la Commission \u00e0 statuer sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00e0 moins que la Commission estime que des circonstances comme celles qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) s\u2019appliquent.\n[26] Par cons\u00e9quent, le l\u00e9gislateur a express\u00e9ment conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission le pouvoir et la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour \u00ab statue[r] sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie \u00bb, sous r\u00e9serve des alin\u00e9as 41(1)a) et suivants de la Loi.\n[27] Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 ce pouvoir au Tribunal \u2013 autrement, ce pouvoir lui serait confi\u00e9 dans la Loi, comme l\u2019\u00e9nonce la d\u00e9cision Harkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 21 et 22.\n[28] En outre, le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer une deuxi\u00e8me fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable \u2013 tel n\u2019est pas l\u2019esprit de la Loi.\n[29] Si une partie n\u2019est pas satisfaite de la mani\u00e8re dont la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi, elle dispose d\u2019un recours aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qu\u2019elle exerce en pr\u00e9sentant une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 ce recours apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Commission du 12 juin 2012 d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec la plainte.\n[30] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lesquelles M. Phillips, en tant que repr\u00e9sentant syndical, a retir\u00e9 les griefs uniquement parce que l\u2019avocat du plaignant lui avait demand\u00e9 de le faire sont contraires \u00e0 ce qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019affidavit de M. Phillips, dans lequel il d\u00e9clare que [traduction] \u00ab [L]orsque j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de la lettre de Me Brown le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2013 [sic] ou vers cette date [\u2026] J\u2019ai retir\u00e9 les griefs [\u2026] \u00bb\n[31] S\u2019ils sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s ensemble, les paragraphes 3 et 4 de l\u2019affidavit M. Phillips \u00e9tablissent que M. Phillips a retir\u00e9 les griefs lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de la lettre de Me Brown. Les renseignements que l\u2019avocat du plaignant a communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Phillips concernant la situation n\u2019ont servi qu\u2019\u00e0 aviser M. Phillips qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les griefs par inadvertance, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019avis de son syndicat.\n[32] Autrement dit, je conclus que M. Phillips n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u les instructions de retirer les griefs de l\u2019avocat du plaignant, mais plut\u00f4t de l\u2019avocat du syndicat, dont les instructions et l\u2019avis \u00e9taient exprim\u00e9s dans la lettre de Me Brown.\n[33] Au cours de l\u2019audience de la requ\u00eate tenue le 19 septembre 2014 par voie de conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, l\u2019avocat du plaignant a confirm\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il disait dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, \u00e0 savoir que lorsque l\u2019avocat du plaignant avait eu un entretien t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en octobre 2013 avec l\u2019avocat du syndicat, Me Brown, et en pr\u00e9sence aussi du directeur du syndicat, William Brehl, Me Brown avait encore une fois confirm\u00e9 que le syndicat ne pr\u00e9senterait pas de grief pour le compte du plaignant en raison de la question li\u00e9e \u00e0 la carte D.\n[34] En outre, l\u2019affidavit de M. Phillips a \u00e9t\u00e9 souscrit en avril 2014, apr\u00e8s le retrait des griefs. J\u2019estime que le fait que les griefs aient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab sous r\u00e9serve de tout droit \u00bb n\u2019est pas pertinent quant \u00e0 la v\u00e9ritable th\u00e8se du syndicat, qui n\u2019avait pas et n\u2019a toujours pas chang\u00e9 depuis la lettre de Me Brown. Selon cette th\u00e8se, tant qu\u2019un \u00e9ventuel grief porte sur le manque d\u2019une carte D, et qu\u2019il est formul\u00e9 par un plaignant \u00e9ventuel dont le salaire n\u2019est pas touch\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas la carte D, le syndicat ne d\u00e9posera pas de grief, parce qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance, ces griefs ne sont jamais accueillis.\n[35] Le plaignant serait d\u00e9pourvu de recours quant \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs ou \u00e0 toute autre proc\u00e9dure visant \u00e0 r\u00e9gler sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[36] La Loi est claire, tout comme la jurisprudence \u2013 le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter une plainte \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire de sa proc\u00e9dure au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi. Cette comp\u00e9tence appartient \u00e0 la Commission.\n[37] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci\u2011dessus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal devait rejeter la plainte conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nVI.

Le contexte [1] La plaignante, madame Shelley MacEachern, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) le 6 juillet 2010 (la plainte). Dans cette plainte, la plaignante soutient que son employeur, le Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC), en janvier 2010 ou vers cette date, lui a refus\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente correctionnelle dans l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de Grande Cache (l\u2019EGC) en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, soit le diab\u00e8te de type 1. La plaignante soutient que cette d\u00e9cision constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience. Le 7 mai 2012, la CCDP a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[2] Le 26 ao\u00fbt 2013, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, dans lequel elle formulait son all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, mais dans laquelle elle soulevait aussi un certain nombre de nouvelles all\u00e9gations au sujet de probl\u00e8mes continus qu\u2019elle avait eus dans le cadre de son emploi dans un poste administratif au sein du SCC \u00e0 l\u2019EGC entre janvier 2010 et ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[3] En d\u00e9cembre 2013, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter les all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019elle avait formul\u00e9es dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (la demande de modification). La demande de modification fait l'objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. En particulier, la plaignante souhaite modifier la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) et de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi).\nII. La position de la plaignante [4] Les observations formul\u00e9es par la plaignante dans la demande de modification \u00e9taient parfois difficiles \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter. Elle a fourni de nombreux d\u00e9tails au sujet de ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes entre mai 2010 et ao\u00fbt 2013. Il est difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir lesquelles de ces activit\u00e9s quotidiennes forment le fondement des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) et de repr\u00e9sailles au sens de l\u2019article 14.1. Cependant, il convient de noter que, comme la plaignante n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, le Tribunal a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 tous les efforts pour interpr\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale les documents qu\u2019elle a soumis \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la demande.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 un poste d\u2019agente correctionnelle au d\u00e9but de 2010, la plaignante a obtenu un emploi dans un poste administratif \u00e0 l\u2019EGC. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a subi aucun harc\u00e8lement, repr\u00e9sailles ou discrimination dans son poste au sein du SCC \u00e0 l\u2019EGC \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte en 2010 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019hiver 2011, auquel moment une autre personne, madame T. Opperman, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e au groupe de travail de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de superviseure. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de madame Opperman, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, d\u2019un comportement constituant du harc\u00e8lement ou des repr\u00e9sailles. Bien que la plaignante ne pr\u00e9cise pas lesquels des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la demande de modification constituent le fondement de chacune de ses all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement ou de repr\u00e9sailles, les principales all\u00e9gations semblent comprendre les faits suivants :\n(a) les superviseurs du Service du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (SRF) de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de travail de la plaignante verrouillaient parfois la porte du bureau du SRF et pla\u00e7aient une affiche sur la porte mentionnant que le bureau du SRF \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9. La plaignante soutient que cela s\u2019est produit alors que les superviseurs \u00e9taient dans ce bureau ;\n(b) la porte d\u2019une salle de r\u00e9union a \u00e9t\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9e plus d\u2019une fois alors que la plaignante se trouvait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la salle de r\u00e9union avec son repr\u00e9sentant syndical ;\n(c) un \u00e9tudiant a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dans l\u2019unit\u00e9 de travail du SRF pour travailler sur un projet portant sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des d\u00e9tenus sur lequel la plaignante avait travaill\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. La plaignante soutient que le transfert de ce projet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tudiant constituait une sanction de la part d\u2019un de ses superviseurs, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas termin\u00e9 le projet \u00e0 temps l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ;\n(d) on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de classer de 40 \u00e0 50 dossiers dans un d\u00e9lai de 15 minutes ;\n(e) la superviseure de la plaignante a critiqu\u00e9 ses v\u00eatements ;\n(f) la plaignante a eu une altercation verbale avec sa superviseure au cours de laquelle on lui a demand\u00e9 de quitter le bureau du SRF, alors qu\u2019elle y travaillait sur des dossiers \u00e0 ce moment ;\n(g) la plaignante a fait l\u2019objet de la part de sa superviseure d\u2019un rapport de conduite non professionnelle, portant sur ses interactions avec un autre employ\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9tablissement. La plaignante semble soutenir que ce rapport n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 ;\n(h) on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante la directive de participer \u00e0 une r\u00e9union portant sur l\u2019assiduit\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 le fait que son repr\u00e9sentant syndical n\u2019approuvait pas la directive. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e en probation pendant trois mois ;\n(i) la plaignante a d\u00fb d\u00e9placer son bureau dans une autre unit\u00e9 de travail pendant environ six semaines dans le cadre d\u2019une r\u00e9solution de conflits r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s avec un autre superviseur ;\n(j) la plaignante a eu de nombreux diff\u00e9rends avec sa superviseure portant sur son utilisation des heures compensatoires, des indemnit\u00e9s de maladie et des paiements en argent. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de prendre un cong\u00e9 sans solde plut\u00f4t que d\u2019utiliser ses heures compensatoires pour ses journ\u00e9es de maladie.\n[6] La plaignante soutient que toutes ces actions constituent du harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 son endroit ou des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es contre elle parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte.\nIII. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien factuel entre les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient notamment que le harc\u00e8lement en question fait partie des probl\u00e8mes r\u00e9currents de conflits en milieu de travail et n\u2019a trait qu\u2019au droit aux indemnit\u00e9s, qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les parties vis\u00e9es dans la demande de modification \u00e9taient au courant de la plainte ou y r\u00e9pondaient. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, dans ses all\u00e9gations, la plaignante pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucun probl\u00e8me de \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb pendant plus de 18 mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a aucun lien factuel entre la plainte originale et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait aussi valoir que la demande de modification ne devrait pas \u00eatre accueillie parce qu\u2019il subirait un pr\u00e9judice si les all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e9taient ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il subirait, entre autres, les pr\u00e9judices suivants :\n(a) les all\u00e9gations qui se trouvent dans la demande de modification ne sont pas d\u00e9crites de fa\u00e7on assez pr\u00e9cise pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre les arguments invoqu\u00e9s contre lui ;\n(b) Les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification font l\u2019objet d\u2019un grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la plaignante devant le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada, ce qui pourrait, par cons\u00e9quent, entra\u00eener la multiplication des instances et des conclusions contradictoires ;\n(c) si les all\u00e9gations dans la demande de modification \u00e9taient accept\u00e9es, la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience serait rallong\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on importante parce que de nombreux t\u00e9moins qui ne savent pas sur quoi porte la plainte seraient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\nIV. La modification de plaintes [9] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en droit que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de modifier une plainte \u00ab aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb (Canderel Lt\u00e9e c. Canada, [1994] 1 C.F. 3 (C.A.F.) ; cit\u00e9 dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, au paragraphe 30 [Parent]).\n[10] Malgr\u00e9 le vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont dispose le Tribunal pour accorder des modifications, une modification ne peut pas introduire ce qui constitue essentiellement une nouvelle plainte, car cela aurait pour effet de contourner le processus de renvoi pr\u00e9vu par la Loi (voir Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 7 \u00e0 9, et Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 45929 (TCDP, au paragraphe 11).\n[11] Compte tenu de cette restriction, une modification propos\u00e9e doit avoir un lien, du moins selon le plaignant, avec les all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte originale. Il doit exister un lien factuel entre la plainte originale et la modification demand\u00e9e (voir Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7, Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 31, aux paragraphes 17 et 18, et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 24, au paragraphe 16).\n[12] Lorsque la modification propos\u00e9e d\u00e9coule d\u2019un ensemble de faits diff\u00e9rents, ce qui constitue essentiellement une nouvelle plainte, la modification ne rel\u00e8ve pas du champ d\u2019application de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e par la CCDP et, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour l\u2019instruire (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada, 2006 CF 704, aux paragraphes 40 et 50).\n[13] En plus d'\u00e9tablir un lien entre l'objet de la plainte et la modification propos\u00e9e, il faut aussi que le Tribunal examine le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait subir l'intim\u00e9 si l'on autorisait la plaignante \u00e0 modifier sa plainte. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 40 :\nLa question du pr\u00e9judice est le facteur pr\u00e9dominant \u00e0 \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans de telles circonstances. L\u2019amendement ne doit pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9 s\u2019il cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[14] La plaignante, dans sa demande de modification, soutient essentiellement qu\u2019elle a subi un harc\u00e8lement constant et des repr\u00e9sailles r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es entre l\u2019hiver 2011 et l\u2019automne 2013. La plaignante est d\u2019avis que ces all\u00e9gations devraient \u00eatre ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 sa plainte, \u00e0 titre de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c), ou \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es contre elle, au sens de l\u2019article 14.1, parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte.\n[15] Les articles 14 et 14,1 de la Loi pr\u00e9voient :\n14(1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d'installations ou de moyens d'h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public ;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements ;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n(2) Pour l'application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu'en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n14,1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[16] Alors que la plainte originale de la plaignante, renvoy\u00e9e par la CCDP au Tribunal, portait sur le fait qu\u2019on lui avait refus\u00e9 un emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente correctionnelle en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, soit le diab\u00e8te, les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification portent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur une question de diff\u00e9rends dans le cadre du poste administratif qu\u2019elle occupe \u00e0 l\u2019EGC. Pour que la plaignante puisse modifier sa plainte pour ajouter une question de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c), le harc\u00e8lement en question doit n\u00e9cessairement avoir un certain lien avec les faits ou la d\u00e9ficience qui sont \u00e0 la base de sa plainte originale. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que les points soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de harc\u00e8lement ont un lien avec la plainte originale ou avec le diab\u00e8te de la plaignante.\n[17] Pour que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019article 14.1 et constituent des repr\u00e9sailles exerc\u00e9es contre la plaignante parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, il faut que cette derni\u00e8re ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve \u00e9tablissant que les personnes qui ont commis les actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e9taient quelque peu au courant de la plainte ou y r\u00e9pondaient d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. La plaignante ne soutient pas que les personnes charg\u00e9es de la superviser dans le cadre de son poste administratif \u00e9taient au courant de la plainte ou y r\u00e9pondaient, et il n\u2019existe aucun lien entre le refus d\u2019emploi qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte originale et les situations mentionn\u00e9es dans la demande de modification. En fait, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es par la plaignante semblent viser principalement l\u2019attribution des t\u00e2ches, les politiques officielles relatives aux cong\u00e9s et les probl\u00e8mes interpersonnels entre la plaignante et l\u2019une de ses superviseures \u2013 toutes des questions qui n\u2019ont aucun lien factuel avec le diab\u00e8te de la plaignante ou sa plainte.\n[18] Il n\u2019y a aucun lien factuel entre les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification et la plainte. En fait, la demande de modification constitue essentiellement une nouvelle plainte et le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour l\u2019instruire sans qu\u2019elle ait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la CCDP.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient aussi qu\u2019il subira un pr\u00e9judice si les modifications propos\u00e9es par la plaignante sont accept\u00e9es, parce que les all\u00e9gations ne sont pas assez pr\u00e9cises pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 sache quels sont les arguments invoqu\u00e9s contre lui. Les demandes de pr\u00e9cisions peuvent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ou par l\u2019octroi d\u2019un d\u00e9lai suffisamment long pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations (voir par exemple Itty c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2013 TCDP 33, au paragraphe 61; Tabor c. Premi\u00e8re nation de Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9, au paragraphe 14; Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 31; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (Repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 24, au paragraphe 17). De toute fa\u00e7on, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner l\u2019argument du pr\u00e9judice soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, parce que, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je suis convaincue que les modifications ne sont pas appropri\u00e9es.\n[20] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, soit la conclusion selon laquelle il n\u2019existe aucun lien factuel entre la plainte originale et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la demande de modification, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser la modification de la plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter les all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de modification de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRicki Johnston\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 11 f\u00e9vrier 2014\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1823\/5312\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Shelley Annette MacEachern c.

Conclusion et d\u00e9cision. 30\nI. Aper\u00e7u [1] Les faits relatifs \u00e0 cette plainte ont la possibilit\u00e9 de soulever des questions importantes et complexes concernant le traitement des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle qui sont sous la garde et le contr\u00f4le du Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC). La port\u00e9e de ces questions et leurs incidences sont au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nII. La plainte [2] Le 12 mars 2008, Mme Doreen Lothian, la tutrice l\u00e9gale du plaignant, M. Roger Desmarais, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que le SCC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers M. Desmarais du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle et de sa situation de famille, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[3] Dans la plainte, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que des actes discriminatoires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis de fa\u00e7on continue au cours de deux peines f\u00e9d\u00e9rales diff\u00e9rentes que le SCC \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d\u2019administrer : la premi\u00e8re peine s\u2019\u00e9tendant du 13 novembre 2001 au 12 novembre 2003, et la deuxi\u00e8me, du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2005 au 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007.\n[4] En outre, dans la plainte, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la discrimination dont a fait l\u2019objet M. Desmarais [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9sultait d\u2019une question syst\u00e9mique li\u00e9e au traitement des d\u00e9linquants atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle et en particulier de ceux qui ne disposent pas d\u2019un soutien familial ad\u00e9quat \u00bb.\n[5] La plainte pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019il y avait suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci de la proc\u00e9dure, pour donner \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il \u00e9tait susceptible que les questions syst\u00e9miques, qui existaient au moment o\u00f9 M. Desmarais a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, ne sont pas disparues.\n[6] Le 22 novembre 2010, David Langtry, vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Commission, a inform\u00e9 les parties, par lettre, de sa d\u00e9cision :\n[traduction]\n[...] la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), de demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte parce que :\nles questions soulev\u00e9es par cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l\u2019existence possible d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques au traitement et \u00e0 la r\u00e9adaptation des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle et que, en cons\u00e9quence, un examen plus pouss\u00e9 du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est justifi\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\n\u00c0 titre de renseignement, les parties a une plainte peuvent demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019examiner la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\n[7] Le 16 ao\u00fbt 2012, la Commission a remis au Tribunal son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, dans lequel elle a en outre d\u00e9fini les actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique constante qui, selon elle, sont au c\u0153ur de la discrimination dont M. Desmarais a fait l\u2019objet. Les voici :\na) le placement en isolement des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, qui a des effets n\u00e9gatifs sur leur bien-\u00eatre physique et mental;\nb) le manque de programmes adapt\u00e9s aux besoins des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle;\nc) des politiques pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019\u00e9valuation des risques et le classement selon le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9;\nd) les processus en cause pour obtenir un consentement \u00e9clair\u00e9 afin de recueillir des renseignements sur un d\u00e9tenu atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle ou souffrant d\u2019une maladie mentale.\nIII. La requ\u00eate [8] Le 26 juillet 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en radiation d\u2019une partie de la plainte. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait faire fi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019instruction portant sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, limiter leur port\u00e9e aux p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, en l\u2019occurrence de 2001 \u00e0 2003, pour les questions portant sur les pratiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019isolement pr\u00e9ventif en vigueur au SCC et la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e absence de programmes destin\u00e9s aux d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, et, de 2004 \u00e0 2006, pour les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur les politiques applicables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation des risques et au classement selon le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande en outre, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, que la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique soit limit\u00e9e aux documents qui d\u00e9finissaient la situation dans laquelle se trouvait le plaignant au moment o\u00f9 il purgeait sa peine sous la surveillance du SCC.\nIV. Les faits [10] M. Desmarais, qui est n\u00e9 le 2 octobre 1982, a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de retard mental (QI global de 56), selon les crit\u00e8res du DSM-IV, et est analphab\u00e8te.\n[11] En 2001, alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 18 ans, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu coupable de trois infractions sexuelles et d\u2019une introduction par effraction; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9, entre autres, \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de deux ans dans un p\u00e9nitencier f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et \u00e0 trois ann\u00e9es de probation, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vivement recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Philippe\u2011Pinel de Montr\u00e9al (l\u2019Institut Pinel) pour recevoir des traitements.\n[12] Au cours du proc\u00e8s, le juge, qui voulait s\u2019assurer que M. Desmarais soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Pinel apr\u00e8s la condamnation, a appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin M. Bigras, un agent de classement du SCC.\n[13] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, M. Bigras a affirm\u00e9 que M. Desmarais faisait partie d\u2019un groupe de d\u00e9tenus sous responsabilit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui \u00e9taient atteints de d\u00e9ficits cognitifs graves. M. Bigras, qui n\u2019avait jamais rencontr\u00e9 M. Desmarais, a mentionn\u00e9 que, mis \u00e0 part le QI de ce dernier, il savait peu de choses sur M. Desmarais. N\u00e9anmoins, il pr\u00e9voyait que M. Desmarais ne se serait pas incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans une prison \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 minimale, mais pourrait se retrouver dans la prison \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 maximale de Port\u2011Cartier. En outre, son ordonnance de maintien en incarc\u00e9ration ferait tr\u00e8s probablement l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen. Voici quelques\u2011unes des d\u00e9clarations faites par M. Bigras :\nExcusez, je sais que [...] je connais un peu ses d\u00e9lits. Je n\u2019ai lu aucun rapport puis je sais un peu la [...] \u00e0 cause de son quotient intellectuel, \u00e7a se limite \u00e7a\n[...]\nOn n\u2019a pas toujours l\u2019encadrement \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention en protection o\u00f9 on les envoie en isolement pr\u00e9ventif [\u2026][1].\n[14] Le plaignant a purg\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re peine du 13 novembre 2001 au 12 novembre 2003.\n[15] Le plaignant a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 au Centre r\u00e9gional de r\u00e9ception o\u00f9 son cas a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 en vue de d\u00e9terminer le classement appropri\u00e9 selon le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le SCC a attribu\u00e9 au plaignant le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 moyenne et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que ce dernier devrait \u00eatre incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 La Macaza, un \u00e9tablissement situ\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de Qu\u00e9bec, qui a mis en place un certain nombre de programmes \u00e0 l\u2019intention des d\u00e9linquants sexuels.\n[16] Il est ressorti du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation que M. Desmarais n\u00e9cessitait :\n[traduction]\nun traitement intensif ciblant plus particuli\u00e8rement les besoins des d\u00e9linquants sexuels atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle et, \u00e0 long terme, d\u2019un plan de suivi coh\u00e9rent en vue d\u2019une r\u00e9insertion sociale[2].\n[17] En f\u00e9vrier 2002, l\u2019Institut Pinel a refus\u00e9 la demande d\u2019admission de M. Desmarais.\n[18] \u00c9galement en f\u00e9vrier 2002, l\u2019Unit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de sant\u00e9 mentale du SCC (l\u2019URSM) a refus\u00e9 d\u2019admettre M. Desmarais, parce que, semble-t-il, elle n\u2019avait pas la [traduction] \u00ab structure ou les possibilit\u00e9s de traitement appropri\u00e9es pour un d\u00e9linquant sexuel anglophone ayant un niveau de fonctionnement trop bas[3] \u00bb.\n[19] Le 10 avril 2002, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 en isolement pr\u00e9ventif \u00e0 La Macaza, parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9 sexuellement par d\u2019autres d\u00e9tenus et avait fait l\u2019objet de plaintes pour [traduction] \u00ab masturbation compulsive \u00bb. Selon un rapport psychologique du SCC, M. Desmarais \u00e9tait incapable de participer au programme de traitement des d\u00e9linquants sexuels de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement La Macaza en raison de [traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 son retard mental[4] \u00bb.\n[20] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 gard\u00e9 en isolement pr\u00e9ventif pour une p\u00e9riode de 11 mois.\n[21] En octobre 2003, le plaignant a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 en isolement pr\u00e9ventif, cette fois apr\u00e8s avoir menac\u00e9 un employ\u00e9.\n[22] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en libert\u00e9 le 12 novembre 2003 apr\u00e8s avoir purg\u00e9 sa peine.\n[23] Depuis 2003, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime de protection, soit la tutelle. Le 7 juin 2007, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec a nomm\u00e9 Mme Doreen Lothian \u00e0 titre de tutrice l\u00e9gale de M. Desmarais.\n[24] En juillet, octobre et novembre 2005, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour plusieurs violations de conditions de probation, de m\u00eame que pour avoir r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 une arrestation.\n[25] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2005, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9, entre autres, \u00e0 une peine d\u2019emprisonnement de deux ans concernant ces arrestations. Il a purg\u00e9 cette deuxi\u00e8me peine du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2005 au 20 d\u00e9cembre 2007.\n[26] Compte tenu de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le plaignant a re\u00e7u la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 maximale. Toutefois, son transfert dans un \u00e9tablissement \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 maximale a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu lorsque le SCC a demand\u00e9 son transfert \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Pinel.\n[27] Le ou vers le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, l\u2019Institut Pinel a accept\u00e9 la demande d\u2019admission du plaignant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 dans cet \u00e9tablissement en avril 2006 o\u00f9 il est rest\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement.\n[28] Le 19 mars 2008, le plaignant, par l\u2019entremise de sa tutrice, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, au titre de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[29] Le 12 avril 2011, dans le contexte de nouvelles accusations criminelles pour des incidents de nature sexuelle qui ont eu lieu apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement du plaignant, ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s par la Chambre criminelle de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[30] Le 26 juillet 2011, le Tribunal administratif du Qu\u00e9bec (le TAQ) a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 savoir que le plaignant \u00e9tait inapte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s, et a ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit gard\u00e9 en d\u00e9tention.\n[31] Le 10 septembre 2013, le TAQ, qui examinait chaque ann\u00e9e la situation du plaignant afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu apte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu apte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire devant le tribunal p\u00e9nal.\n[32] \u00c0 la suite de cette d\u00e9cision, M. Desmarais a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en d\u00e9tention dans un \u00e9tablissement sous responsabilit\u00e9 provinciale \u00e0 Rivi\u00e8re\u2011des\u2011Prairies, en attendant de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau devant le tribunal, le 21 septembre 2013.\nV. Les arguments A. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (i) L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Moore soutient une limitation de la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte [33] L\u2019arr\u00eat rendu le 9 novembre 2012 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, est au c\u0153ur de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les paragraphes ci\u2011dessous expliquent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que donne l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore.\n[34] L\u2019affaire Moore porte sur des all\u00e9gations de discrimination de la part de la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique contre Jeffrey Moore, un enfant atteint d\u2019un trouble d\u2019apprentissage s\u00e9v\u00e8re dont les besoins en enseignement correctif intensif n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s par le r\u00e9seau scolaire public au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de contraintes budg\u00e9taires dans cette province.\n[35] Tout au long de ses motifs, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada insiste sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mettre l\u2019accent sur une plainte de discrimination \u00ab durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00bb : arr\u00eat Moore, aux paragraphes 35, 37, 50 et 51. Elle souligne \u00e9galement que les redressements accord\u00e9s par un tribunal doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s \u00ab compte tenu de la port\u00e9e concr\u00e8te de la plainte \u00bb : arr\u00eat Moore, au paragraphe 56. Cette d\u00e9cision a jet\u00e9 un nouvel \u00e9clairage sur les cas o\u00f9 une situation de \u00ab discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00bb \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9e dans les all\u00e9gations pour \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte individuelle. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, ce n\u2019est plus possible.\n[36] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, compte tenu de cet arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent, les cours et le Tribunal doivent s\u2019assurer que les instructions du Tribunal reposent sur la situation particuli\u00e8re du plaignant. Quelles que soient les conclusions de nature syst\u00e9mique tir\u00e9es dans un cas particulier, elles doivent donc d\u00e9couler directement de cette situation personnelle.\n(ii) Les pr\u00e9sents faits se pr\u00eatent \u00e0 une conclusion de discrimination syst\u00e9mique [37] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que les pr\u00e9sents faits ne permettent pas de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et que les all\u00e9gations du plaignant ne concernent que la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration et qu\u2019une br\u00e8ve partie de la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\n[38] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que l\u2019examen par le Tribunal de la pratique du SCC de placer en isolement pr\u00e9ventif les d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux pratiques en vigueur au SCC de 2001 \u00e0 2003 et pour quelques jours en avril 2006, lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en isolement pr\u00e9ventif. Il fait observer que le plaignant n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti \u00e0 de longues p\u00e9riodes d\u2019isolement pr\u00e9ventif au cours de sa deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration.\n[39] En ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 manque de programmes du SCC, destin\u00e9s aux d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que l\u2019examen devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant, parce qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Pinel peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 pour la deuxi\u00e8me fois et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait donc pas besoin d\u2019un programme offert par le SCC.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir en outre que l\u2019examen par le Tribunal des politiques applicables qui pr\u00e9voient l\u2019\u00e9valuation des risques et le classement selon le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne devrait porter que sur les deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant, parce que des pratiques diff\u00e9rentes peuvent ou non avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9es apr\u00e8s avril 2006 et qu\u2019elles ne sont pas prises en compte dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la situation particuli\u00e8re du plaignant.\n[41] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la Commission selon laquelle les processus mis en place par le SCC pour obtenir le consentement \u00e9clair\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu atteint de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle ou souffrant d\u2019une maladie mentale et pour ainsi avoir acc\u00e8s aux renseignements personnels sont discriminatoires, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cette question devrait \u00e9galement se limiter aux deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant.\n[42] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on, puisque le plaignant a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre sous la responsabilit\u00e9 du SCC depuis 2007 et qu\u2019il demeure peu probable et hypoth\u00e9tique que le plaignant se retrouve \u00e9ventuellement sous la garde du SCC et, que cela, finalement, d\u00e9pend en grande partie du plaignant lui-m\u00eame. En outre, comme, selon toute probabilit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne sera plus jamais jug\u00e9 apte \u00e0 subir un proc\u00e8s, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il ne tirerait aucun avantage personnel d\u2019un examen de l\u2019\u00e9volution des pratiques et des politiques du SCC. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il serait donc inutile pour le Tribunal d\u2019examiner les pratiques actuelles du SCC et de surveiller la mise en \u0153uvre de mesures correctives, parce que, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de Jeffrey Moore qui ne pouvait pas r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le r\u00e9seau scolaire public, le plaignant ne r\u00e9int\u00e9grera probablement jamais un p\u00e9nitencier f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, ainsi qu\u2019il est expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, l\u2019examen devrait porter sur la discrimination dont aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime le plaignant au cours des longues p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait sous la surveillance du SCC. \u00c9tendre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction aux politiques ant\u00e9rieures et actuelles du SCC, li\u00e9es aux quatre motifs de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte, reviendrait \u00e0 transformer le Tribunal en une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate parlementaire et \u00e0 r\u00e9orienter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction bien au\u2011del\u00e0 de la situation particuli\u00e8re du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore est appuy\u00e9e par le r\u00e9cent arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019affaire British Columbia v. Mzite, 2013 BCSC 116 (l\u2019arr\u00eat Mzite), et la d\u00e9claration de cette cour au paragraphe 54, qui est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi :\n[traduction]\nEn tant qu\u2019arbitre saisi de la plainte particuli\u00e8re, son enqu\u00eate sur les pratiques mises en place \u00e0 VIRCC, qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des interruptions d\u2019administration de m\u00e9dicaments, porterait sur la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de M. Mzite. S\u2019il \u00e9tait conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il ne pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019une mesure de redressement individuelle accord\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Mzite aurait une incidence sur les autres se trouvant dans sa situation, deux ans apr\u00e8s la date de la mise en libert\u00e9 de M. Mzite. La valeur accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019accueillir cette plainte tr\u00e8s tardivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e semble indiquer un but r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une enqu\u00eate sur les pratiques en mati\u00e8re de fourniture de m\u00e9dicaments aux d\u00e9tenus du VIRCC, \u00e0 compter de d\u00e9cembre 2010, soit au moins vingt mois apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis les actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par M. Mzite. Je conclus que cela, combin\u00e9 aux erreurs susmentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la raison du retard, est manifestement d\u00e9raisonnable.\n[44] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les faits nouveaux ayant pu survenir depuis l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant n\u2019ont pas de rapport avec l\u2019instruction dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Le Tribunal ne devrait donc pas se livrer \u00e0 une analyse de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, car celle-ci ne serait d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour le plaignant.\n[45] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, bien que les faits particuliers de l\u2019affaire Desmarais ne donnent pas lieu \u00e0 un vaste examen des pratiques du SCC, l\u2019affaire Starblanket, qui est aussi actuellement devant le Tribunal, pourrait \u00eatre plus appropri\u00e9e. Cette affaire a \u00e9galement trait \u00e0 un d\u00e9tenu atteint de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle qui a pass\u00e9 de longues p\u00e9riodes en isolement pr\u00e9ventif. Cependant, contrairement \u00e0 M. Desmarais, M. Starblanket est encore actuellement incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou l\u2019\u00e9tait il y a peu de temps encore.\n(iii) La bonne administration de la justice pr\u00e9conise de limiter la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte [46] Suivant les articles 44 \u00e0 46 de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, si le Tribunal accepte d\u2019examiner l\u2019ensemble des pratiques et des politiques mises en place par le SCC depuis 2001, consid\u00e9rant que le plaignant n\u2019est nullement touch\u00e9 par ces politiques, il faudrait un engagement tr\u00e8s ferme de la part de toutes les parties et du Tribunal au chapitre des ressources financi\u00e8res et humaines, parce que la divulgation des faits aurait, de mani\u00e8re exponentielle, une port\u00e9e plus large et qu\u2019il y aurait plus de t\u00e9moins, c.-\u00e0-d., des t\u00e9moins ordinaires et des t\u00e9moins experts.\n(iv) La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ne pouvait pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t [47] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pu pr\u00e9senter une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer pour ces motifs la plainte au Tribunal, parce que le renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 le 2 novembre 2010, soit deux ans avant que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ne rende sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Moore.\n[48] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient en outre qu\u2019il ne pouvait pr\u00e9senter cette requ\u00eate plus t\u00f4t et affirme que, de toute fa\u00e7on, ni le plaignant ni la Commission ne seraient l\u00e9s\u00e9s par le retard de quelques mois entre la date de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Moore et la date de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[49] Il fait observer qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties que le Tribunal statue sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate avant l\u2019audience et qu\u2019il est plus avantageux de proc\u00e9der de le faire maintenant que de le faire apr\u00e8s la divulgation compl\u00e8te des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et le d\u00e9but des audiences.\n(v) Les ordonnances demand\u00e9es [50] Pour ces raisons, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait retirer les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique du cadre de l\u2019instruction.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande aussi que toutes les demandes de divulgation qui ne se rapportent pas aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la plainte soient rejet\u00e9es, parce qu\u2019elles sont en dehors du cadre de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal et ne sont donc pas pertinentes.\n[52] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, si le Tribunal demeure convaincu qu\u2019il y aurait certains avantages \u00e0 examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande qu\u2019un tel examen soit limit\u00e9 aux p\u00e9riodes pr\u00e9cises pendant lesquelles le plaignant \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu dans une institution sous la surveillance du SCC.\n[53] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande que la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique se limite aux documents qui traitent de la situation qui existait au moment o\u00f9 le plaignant \u00e9tait incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 sous la surveillance du SCC, pas \u00e0 un autre moment.\nB. La position de la Commission (i) La requ\u00eate ne devrait pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en l\u2019absence d\u2019une audience sur le fond. [54] La Commission n\u2019accepte pas les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9, selon lesquels la port\u00e9e de cette plainte devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite et qu\u2019il ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 fournir des renseignements relatifs \u00e0 de pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique constante. Elle fait valoir que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, mais qu\u2019il doit exercer son pouvoir avec prudence lorsqu\u2019il lui est demand\u00e9 de rejeter une plainte ou des parties d\u2019une plainte sans tenir une audience. La LCDP pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9j\u00e0 un processus d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable, qui est effectu\u00e9 par la Commission. Cette derni\u00e8re fait observer que le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal n\u2019a pas restreint la port\u00e9e de la plainte au point d\u2019exclure les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et que le mandat du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la lettre de demande de renvoi de la plainte de la Commission. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP mentionne \u00e9galement que le Tribunal donne aux parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. La Commission est d\u2019avis que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, cela inclut les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\n[55] La Commission fait valoir que, selon la d\u00e9cision Buffet c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 16 (Buffet) et la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada), conf. par l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2013 CAF 75, une telle situation n\u00e9cessite une audience compl\u00e8te sur les faits. Elle s\u2019appuie sur les paroles de la protonotaire Aronovitch dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations et autres, T\u20111753\u20111708 (Ordonnance modifi\u00e9e \u2013 26 novembre 2009) \u00e0 la p. 5 (conf. par Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations et autres, 2010 CF 343) (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations - ordonnance SSEFPN de 2009), qui a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n[l]e sujet de la plainte \u00e9tant s\u00e9rieux et complexe, je conviens qu\u2019il ne doit pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sommaire, rendue sans le dossier factuel n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation globale des questions en cause.\n[56] La Commission soutient que l\u2019esp\u00e8ce porte sur un ensemble complexe de faits et du droit, qui soul\u00e8vent de graves questions concernant le traitement des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle. Au fil des ans, le Bureau de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur correctionnel (le BEC) a constamment rendu compte de la pratique de l\u2019isolement comme moyen de g\u00e9rer les d\u00e9tenus souffrant de maladies mentales et a fait part de ses pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 ce sujet. Ce point de vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada, le Comit\u00e9 des droits de l\u2019homme des Nations Unies, le rapporteur sp\u00e9cial des Nations Unies sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d\u00e9gradants et le Comit\u00e9 des Nations Unies contre la torture, qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le placement en isolement cellulaire des d\u00e9linquants atteints d\u2019une maladie mentale constitue une forme de peine ou de traitement cruel, inhumain et d\u00e9gradant et, dans certaines circonstances, de torture. La Commission fait valoir que pour bien \u00e9tudier ces questions, une audience sur le fond de l\u2019affaire est requise.\n(ii) La plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant sous la garde du SCC [57] La Commission fait valoir en outre que les actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis avant l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de M. Desmarais et au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration, et qu\u2019ils se poursuivent toujours. Il est \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que de nombreuses autres personnes incarc\u00e9r\u00e9es, qui \u00e9taient sous la garde et le contr\u00f4le du SCC, en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes. Cela \u00e9tant, la Commission estime qu\u2019il ne serait pas acceptable que la plainte soit limit\u00e9e aux deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant, comme le demande l\u2019intim\u00e9, en particulier sur le fondement de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire actuelle. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, de l\u2019avis de la Commission, il importe peu que le plaignant ne soit plus incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement du SCC, qu\u2019il se soit \u00e9coul\u00e9 beaucoup de temps apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le du SCC et qu\u2019il ne f\u00fbt plus incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. En outre et contrairement aux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le fait qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s en 2011 n\u2019est pas pertinent, parce qu\u2019il pourrait de nouveau \u00eatre plac\u00e9 sous la garde et le contr\u00f4le du SCC.\n[58] La Commission affirme qu\u2019elle tentera de d\u00e9montrer que tous les faits v\u00e9cus par M. Desmarais r\u00e9sultent de l\u2019application des politiques ou des pratiques syst\u00e9miques du SCC. \u00c0 cette fin, la Commission compte pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve factuels semblables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s en isolement cellulaire pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes.\n[59] Au nombre de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve figurent les cas de Marvin Jeffrey Tekano et de Ashley Smith, l\u2019affaire Starblanket \u00e9voqu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, de m\u00eame que de nombreux cas document\u00e9s par le BEC au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie. Seront \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s des rapports traitant de la question de l\u2019isolement cellulaire qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s par divers organismes de d\u00e9fense des droits de l\u2019homme des Nations Unies. La Commission all\u00e8gue que, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intim\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019affirme cat\u00e9goriquement que les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es pratiques ne sont plus employ\u00e9es et s\u2019engage en outre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles ne soient plus employ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, la bonne administration de la justice exige que le Tribunal entende les all\u00e9gations de nature syst\u00e9mique [\u2026] \u00bb. Le plaignant a le droit de se faire entendre devant le Tribunal et de pr\u00e9senter tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, y compris les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations.\n[60] La Commission est d\u2019avis que, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 entend soutenir que les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es pratiques discriminatoires ne sont plus employ\u00e9es ou que les politiques du SCC ont chang\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a le droit de produire les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve y aff\u00e9rents dans la pr\u00e9sentation de sa preuve principale. En outre, si M. Desmarais n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, apr\u00e8s avoir eu la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter l\u2019ensemble de la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard lors d\u2019une audience, le Tribunal pourrait alors rejeter les parties de la plainte ayant trait \u00e0 des aspects syst\u00e9miques.\n[61] La Commission soutient que, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans la d\u00e9cision Emmett c. L\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, 2013 TCDP 12 (Emmett), l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombe de d\u00e9montrer que sa requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre accueillie.\n(iii) L\u2019objet de la LCDP appuie le rejet de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [62] La Commission est d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle le Tribunal ne peut ni entendre les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ni ordonner des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques nie l\u2019objet m\u00eame de la LCDP pour deux raisons. La premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est que cela minerait l\u2019objectif pr\u00e9ventif de la LCDP. Cet objectif est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP, qui est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii)de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17;\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[63] La Commission fait valoir que cet article autorise express\u00e9ment le Tribunal \u00e0 utiliser son pouvoir de redressement pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et que son interpr\u00e9tation est en accord avec les termes de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 RCS 1114 (Action Travail), \u00e0 la page 1142 :\nLorsqu\u2019on a affaire \u00e0 un tel cas de \u00ab discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00bb, il se peut qu\u2019une ordonnance comme celle rendue par le tribunal soit le seul moyen de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019objet de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[64] La deuxi\u00e8me raison est que, si la requ\u00eate du SCC \u00e9tait accueillie, la Commission fait valoir que cela donnerait lieu \u00e0 un gaspillage important des ressources publiques parce que d\u2019autres plaignants potentiels se trouvant dans une situation semblable \u00e0 celle de M. Desmarais remettraient en litige les m\u00eames questions qui sont soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[65] Dans l\u2019ordonnance SSEFPN de 2009, la protonotaire Aronovitch affirmait ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nIl importe, cependant, de permettre un examen complet et minutieux par le tribunal sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re de questions pouvant avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la capacit\u00e9 future des peuples autochtones de pr\u00e9senter des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de discrimination.\n[66] La Commission fait valoir que, de m\u00eame, si la requ\u00eate du SCC \u00e9tait accueillie, la possibilit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9tenus handicap\u00e9s ou tout autre groupe vuln\u00e9rable dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne de d\u00e9poser \u00e9ventuellement des plaintes valables qui soul\u00e8vent des questions syst\u00e9miques sera fortement limit\u00e9e, ce qui aura pour effet de miner davantage l\u2019objectif de la LCDP qui est d\u2019emp\u00eacher les actes discriminatoires.\n[67] Enfin, la Commission fait valoir qu\u2019elle ne demande pas au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00ab commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate parlementaire \u00bb, mais plut\u00f4t de remplir l\u2019obligation que lui impose la loi, \u00e0 savoir d\u2019entendre et d\u2019appr\u00e9cier les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux all\u00e9gations d\u2019actes discriminatoires de nature individuelle et syst\u00e9mique, soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Elle fait observer qu\u2019un examen de l\u2019ensemble des pratiques pass\u00e9es et actuelles du gouvernement que requiert cette affaire est le type m\u00eame d\u2019examen que le Tribunal, en tant qu\u2019organe quasi judiciaire, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, est autoris\u00e9 l\u00e9galement \u00e0 mener. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux d\u00e9cisions rendues dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res nations (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2013 CAF 75, et l\u2019affaire Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4.\n(iv) L\u2019arr\u00eat Moore ne s\u2019applique pas de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019a fait valoir l\u2019intim\u00e9 [68] La Commission soutient que, contrairement aux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Moore n\u2019appuie pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le Tribunal ne peut pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen des actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique constante. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par l\u2019absence de lien entre la port\u00e9e r\u00e9elle de la plainte et les mesures de redressement de nature syst\u00e9mique ordonn\u00e9es. Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019un tribunal doit, dans tous les cas, limiter son examen et les mesures de redressement \u00e0 une plainte individuelle.\n[69] La Commission fait aussi observer que l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore est fond\u00e9 sur un ensemble de faits pr\u00e9cis et sur le British Columbia Human Rights Code, et que cette affaire doit \u00eatre distingu\u00e9e de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que la plainte dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore repose sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique, la discrimination syst\u00e9mique n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en cause (ou une plainte collective, ainsi que l\u2019autorise le British Columbia Human Rights Code); il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte portant sur des actes discriminatoires individuels. La plainte de M. Desmarais, quant \u00e0 elle, pr\u00e9cise clairement que la plainte soul\u00e8ve des all\u00e9gations de discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique.\n[70] Le paragraphe 7 de la plainte \u00e9nonce clairement ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLe caract\u00e8re syst\u00e9mique de ces actes discriminatoires a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par M. Bigras, un agent de classement du SCC qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en 2001 au sujet de l\u2019admission \u00e0 l\u2019IPPM. M. Bigras, qui n\u2019avait jamais rencontr\u00e9 Roger ou lu de rapports \u00e0 son sujet, avait pr\u00e9vu avec exactitude, uniquement d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle de Roger, ce qu\u2019il adviendrait de Roger \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du SCC s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019IPPM comme le juge le souhaitait, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire : isolement (isolement cellulaire), ordonnance de maintien en incarc\u00e9ration interdisant la lib\u00e9ration d\u2019office, classement au niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 minimale [\u2026]\n[Soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[71] La Commission fait \u00e9galement observer que le fait que l\u2019application continue d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire syst\u00e9mique est au c\u0153ur de la plainte a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans la section 40\/41 du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, les lettres de demande de renvoi et l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions fourni par les parties au Tribunal. En cons\u00e9quence, la Commission soutient que l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore ne s\u2019applique pas de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019a fait valoir l\u2019intim\u00e9, parce que des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ont clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es par le plaignant au d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Elle soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucune des d\u00e9cisions qui se sont ensuite fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore ou qui ont invoqu\u00e9 cette affaire n\u2019a appliqu\u00e9 le type d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avance dans sa requ\u00eate.\nC. La position du plaignant (i) La plainte ne doit pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant. [72] Le plaignant s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la p\u00e9riode de divulgation des faits doit \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux deux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant, soit de 2001 \u00e0 2003 et de 2005 \u00e0 2007. L\u2019acceptation d\u2019une telle position va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 administrative qui exigent que les d\u00e9lais doivent, au minimum, \u00eatre les m\u00eames pour le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[73] Le plaignant ne peut pas accepter que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des documents importants li\u00e9s au pass\u00e9 de M. Desmarais, soit de son enfance jusqu\u2019en 2013, alors que le plaignant serait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode qui serait plus courte que la dur\u00e9e de son incarc\u00e9ration. Il en r\u00e9sulterait que le plaignant n\u2019aurait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des renseignements importants concernant les pratiques du SCC et la gestion de la situation de M. Desmarais.\n[74] En outre, le plaignant soutient que, dans les circonstances actuelles, le d\u00e9but de la \u00ab p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00bb devrait \u00eatre fix\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 ont commenc\u00e9 les actes discriminatoires, soit en novembre 2001, date \u00e0 laquelle M. Bigras a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le tribunal et a pr\u00e9vu avec exactitude ce qu\u2019il adviendrait de M. Desmarais au sein du SCC. La divulgation des faits pertinents devrait commencer par l\u2019ajout de tous les renseignements sur lesquels M. Bigras aurait fond\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage.\n[75] Le plaignant ajoute que la fin de la \u00ab p\u00e9riode pertinente \u00bb devrait \u00eatre le moment de l\u2019audience afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que de nouveaux actes discriminatoires soient commis.\n(ii) Un examen de situation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique est n\u00e9cessaire et utile au cas du plaignant [76] L\u2019un des arguments soulev\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui vise \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019examen d\u2019actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique n\u2019est ni n\u00e9cessaire ni utile est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune similitude entre la pr\u00e9sente affaire et la situation d\u2019un autre d\u00e9tenu handicap\u00e9 plac\u00e9 sous la surveillance du SCC. Le SCC n\u2019a jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour appuyer une telle affirmation et il en d\u00e9coule qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Starblanket, au paragraphe 46 de sa requ\u00eate, laisse entendre que les affaires Desmarais et Starblanket ont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments en commun, ce qui semble donner en outre \u00e0 penser que le cas de M. Desmarais n\u2019est pas unique.\n[77] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les chances que le plaignant r\u00e9int\u00e8gre l\u2019\u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sont faibles, puisqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que M. Desmarais n\u2019est pas touch\u00e9 par les pratiques et les politiques mises en place par le SCC apr\u00e8s la fin de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. Le plaignant ne souscrit pas \u00e0 ce point de vue. En fait, M. Desmarais n\u2019est pas d\u00e9tenu pr\u00e9sentement \u00e0 l\u2019Institut Pinel, mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de Rivi\u00e8re\u2011des\u2011Prairies, un centre de d\u00e9tention provincial, en attendant de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau devant un tribunal. Certes, M. Desmarais est atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, qui est permanente, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tort d\u2019assimiler un handicap et une constatation d\u2019inaptitude \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019inaptitude est un \u00e9tat permanent. Une personne handicap\u00e9e, qui est inapte, peut \u00e9voluer, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une formation sp\u00e9ciale, au point o\u00f9 elle comprend le syst\u00e8me judiciaire suffisamment pour atteindre le seuil qui s\u00e9pare l\u2019aptitude physique et mentale de l\u2019inaptitude. En fait, le 10 septembre 2013, le TAQ a statu\u00e9 que M. Desmarais \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 subir son proc\u00e8s et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire devant un tribunal p\u00e9nal. En cons\u00e9quence, il faut pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il est possible que M. Desmarais puisse encore, dans une certaine mesure, \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, une am\u00e9lioration des pratiques et des politiques du SCC pourrait \u00eatre b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour le plaignant.\n[78] En outre, dans la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom de M. Desmarais, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la discrimination dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime \u00e9tait d\u2019origine syst\u00e9mique, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience et sa situation de famille. Les tribunaux des droits de la personne, en se pronon\u00e7ant sur la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 statu\u00e9 que la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique est recevable lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de prouver une plainte individuelle. Au paragraphe 64 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la juge Abella a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[\u2026] Le Tribunal \u00e9tait certes autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir compte de la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique afin de d\u00e9cider si Jeffrey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, [...]\n[79] Le plaignant soutient que, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu pr\u00e9sentation de preuve sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, cette affaire reconnaissait que des plaintes individuelles pouvaient contenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique et que des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques pouvaient naturellement d\u00e9couler d\u2019une demande. Cela est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and others, 2003 BCHRT 6750, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Malgr\u00e9 le fait que j\u2019ai conclu que cette plainte est de nature syst\u00e9mique, il s\u2019agit toujours de la plainte individuelle d\u2019un plaignant \u00bb.\n(iii) La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 retarde davantage la pr\u00e9sente instance [80] Le plaignant conteste l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la requ\u00eate n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t. L\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s m\u00e9diatis\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu au d\u00e9but de novembre 2012. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a sign\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions le 17 octobre 2012 et s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir tous les renseignements dans un court d\u00e9lai. Il a report\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ses documents \u00e0 maintes reprises au cours des mois suivants et, \u00e0 la fin de mai 2013, la divulgation de renseignements n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au cours d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance organis\u00e9e par le Tribunal en juin 2013 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a annonc\u00e9 son intention de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pour limiter la p\u00e9riode de divulgation.\n[81] M\u00eame si les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et l\u2019intention de les examiner avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transparentes tout au long du processus, la r\u00e9ticence du SCC \u00e0 communiquer tous les renseignements en temps opportun a occasionn\u00e9 un retard de pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an.\nVI. Analyse [82] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de faire fi des aspects syst\u00e9miques de la discrimination de la pr\u00e9sente instruction ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, de limiter leur port\u00e9e aux p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, pour les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es. Ce faisant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de restreindre consid\u00e9rablement le d\u00e9bat sur la plainte. La Commission et le plaignant s\u2019opposent tous les deux \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate.\n[83] Compte tenu du fait que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, il incombe \u00e0 ce dernier de convaincre le Tribunal d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour rejeter les aspects syst\u00e9miques de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure (alin\u00e9a 50(3)e) de la LCDP) et a la capacit\u00e9 de rejeter des parties d\u2019une plainte. Toutefois, ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9ponse de la Commission, lorsqu\u2019il lui est demand\u00e9 de le faire sur requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, sans audience, le Tribunal doit exercer de fa\u00e7on prudente sa comp\u00e9tence et m\u00eame alors, la jurisprudence pr\u00e9cise clairement que cela ne devrait se faire que \u00ab dans les cas les plus clairs \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Buffet, au paragraphe 39. La LCDP pr\u00e9voit d\u00e9j\u00e0 un processus d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable, examen qui est effectu\u00e9 par la Commission.\n[84] Lors de l\u2019examen d\u2019une telle requ\u00eate, le Tribunal doit tenir compte des exigences prescrites au paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP, qui mentionne que le Tribunal doit donner aux parties \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Le Tribunal doit aussi rendre sa d\u00e9cision conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle : voir Buffet, aux paragraphes 38 \u00e0 40, et SSEFPN, aux paragraphes 125, 131, 132 et 140.\n[85] C\u2019est en ne perdant pas de vue ces principes directeurs que je dois trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nA. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique [86] La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u00e9coule de la LCDP :\n49.(1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. [\u2026]\n[87] La lettre de la Commission du 22 novembre 2010, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par David Langtry et qui chargeait le Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte, demandait clairement que l\u2019aspect syst\u00e9mique des actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s par la plainte fasse plus particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen :\n[traduction]\n[\u2026] les questions soulev\u00e9es par cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l\u2019existence possible d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques au traitement et \u00e0 la r\u00e9adaptation des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle [...].\n[88] La lettre mentionnait aussi ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 titre de renseignement, les parties a une plainte peuvent demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019examiner la d\u00e9cision de la Commission en vertu du paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. La demande \u00e0 la Cour doit normalement \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans les 30 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[89] Dans les deux d\u00e9cisions suivantes, le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 le but vis\u00e9 par la lettre de demande de la Commission :\ne) Dans la d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7, le Tribunal affirm\u00e9 que : \u00ab c\u2019est cette lettre de demande [de la Commission] adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente qui donne comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Kanagasabapathy, au paragraphe 37;\nf) Dans la d\u00e9cision Emmett, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli ce qui suit : \u00ab Si la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, elle aurait rendu une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 ce sujet, aurait fourni des motifs pour ce rejet et, par la suite, aurait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que cette partie de la plainte \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e dans sa lettre de renvoi au Tribunal \u00bb : d\u00e9cision Emmett, au paragraphe 40.\n[90] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de m\u00eame que dans l\u2019affaire Emmett, non seulement la Commission n\u2019a pas restreint une partie de la plainte, mais elle a express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de v\u00e9rifier si les questions soulev\u00e9es par cette derni\u00e8re [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9v\u00e8lent l\u2019existence possible d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques au traitement et \u00e0 la r\u00e9adaptation des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la Commission voulait que le Tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction de l\u2019ensemble de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Desmarais, en tenant plus particuli\u00e8rement compte des aspects syst\u00e9miques. Il n\u2019est pas loisible au Tribunal de contester ou de revoir la d\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard : cette comp\u00e9tence rel\u00e8ve de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Toutefois, dans ce cas, aucune des parties n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[91] La LCDP donne explicitement au Tribunal, apr\u00e8s le renvoi appropri\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte, le pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire de corriger et pr\u00e9venir les actes discriminatoires, tels que ceux qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par M. Desmarais. Cet article est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n53.(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[92] Ces pouvoirs accord\u00e9s au Tribunal assurent l\u2019application de la LCDP. L\u2019objet de celle-ci n\u2019est pas de punir, mais de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination. Ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail, \u00e0 la p. 1134 :\nPour que tous puissent avoir des chances \u00e9gales d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9panouissement \u00bb, la Loi cherche \u00e0 interdire les \u00ab consid\u00e9rations \u00bb fond\u00e9es notamment sur le sexe. C\u2019est l\u2019acte discriminatoire lui-m\u00eame que l\u2019on veut pr\u00e9venir. La Loi n\u2019a pas pour objet de punir la faute, mais bien de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original]\n(i) L\u2019arr\u00eat Moore [93] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cet examen en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, parce qu\u2019il y a absence de lien entre les all\u00e9gations et la plainte.\n[94] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, bien que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ait confirm\u00e9 la conclusion de discrimination du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique contre Jeffrey Moore et la conclusion relative \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du district scolaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, elle a constat\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui constituaient le fondement de la responsabilit\u00e9 de la province \u00e9taient trop indirects pour \u00e9tablir que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Ce faisant, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la discrimination syst\u00e9mique doit avoir un lien avec la plainte telle qu\u2019elle est formul\u00e9e par le plaignant, plainte qui, dans cette affaire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au nom de Jeffrey Moore. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019approche dualiste du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de discrimination (individuelle et syst\u00e9mique), en affirmant que les mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es par un tribunal doivent \u00ab d\u00e9couler de la demande \u00bb : voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, aux paragraphes 58 \u00e0 71.\n[95] Malgr\u00e9 les arguments contraires de l\u2019intim\u00e9, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que cet arr\u00eat emp\u00eache l\u2019examen des actes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Contrairement \u00e0 la plainte formul\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, qui concernait uniquement Jeffrey, la plainte de M. Desmarais fait clairement \u00e9tat d\u2019une discrimination de nature syst\u00e9mique et a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour ce motif au Tribunal. Le paragraphe 7 de la plainte est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLe caract\u00e8re syst\u00e9mique de ces actes discriminatoires a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par M. Bigras, un agent de classement du SCC qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en 2001 au sujet de l\u2019admission \u00e0 l\u2019IPPM. M. Bigras, qui n\u2019avait jamais rencontr\u00e9 Roger ou lu de rapports \u00e0 son sujet, avait pr\u00e9vu avec exactitude, uniquement d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle de Roger, ce qu\u2019il adviendrait de Roger \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du SCC s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019IPPM comme le juge le souhaitait, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire : isolement (isolement cellulaire), ordonnance de maintien en incarc\u00e9ration interdisant la lib\u00e9ration d\u2019office, classement au niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 maximale [\u2026]\n[Soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[96] Jumel\u00e9es \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi de la Commission au Tribunal, lettre qui, ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, contient clairement des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, je suis d\u2019avis que ces all\u00e9gations sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, au Tribunal en bonne et due forme. Par contre, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que la port\u00e9e de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et des ordonnances r\u00e9paratrices en d\u00e9coulant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019objet des plaintes pr\u00e9cises d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Jeffrey \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du contr\u00f4le judiciaire : arr\u00eat Moore, aux paragraphes 68 et 69.\n[97] Il s\u2019ensuit que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si le Tribunal tient compte de la preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et ordonne des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il juge que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, cela serait conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[98] L\u2019intim\u00e9 se fonde sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Mzite \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore. L\u2019arr\u00eat Mzite portait sur une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique d\u2019accepter la plainte de M. Mzite malgr\u00e9 le fait que celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en dehors du d\u00e9lai de six mois pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(1)b) du Human Rights Code. Le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique a conclu que, compte tenu de la nouveaut\u00e9 de la plainte et de ses aspects syst\u00e9miques, il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 22(3)a) du Human Rights Code, d\u2019accepter la plainte malgr\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai. Lors du processus de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique a conclu que le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait commis une erreur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De l\u2019avis de la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique, une d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la plainte de M. Mzite aurait d\u00fb se limiter \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de ce dernier qui avait pris fin vingt-deux mois plus t\u00f4t, donc elle ne pourrait servir \u00ab l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 22(3)a), si elle appuyait l\u2019acceptation de la plainte.\n[99] Avec \u00e9gards, j\u2019estime que cette d\u00e9cision n\u2019est pas utile \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. La Cour semble limiter l\u2019instruction de la plainte \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de M. Mzite et fait observer que toute mesure de redressement en d\u00e9coulant n\u2019aurait qu\u2019une valeur limit\u00e9e pour les autres compte tenu du d\u00e9lai. Toutefois, cette affirmation vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la plainte doit \u00eatre accept\u00e9e bien apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai de prescription en raison de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public au sens du Human Rights Code. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore qui doit \u00eatre transpos\u00e9e au contexte actuel. Je constate, en outre, que cette d\u00e9cision ne lie en rien le Tribunal.\n(ii) Limiter la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience et la divulgation des faits aux p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant [100] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande, en outre, que l\u2019audience et la divulgation des faits se limitent principalement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration, puisque les all\u00e9gations de discrimination durant la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration ne concernent qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de temps limit\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que, puisque M. Desmarais n\u2019est plus incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 et qu\u2019il est peu probable qu\u2019il se retrouve sous la garde du SCC \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, le fait d\u2019\u00e9tendre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience et la divulgation des faits \u00e0 des dates d\u00e9passant cette p\u00e9riode, reviendrait \u00e0 d\u00e9passer la port\u00e9e de la plainte et \u00e0 aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore.\n[101] Il importe de souligner que, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique d\u2019octroyer des r\u00e9parations d\u2019ordre syst\u00e9mique, mais elle n\u2019a cependant pas interdit au Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique de prendre en compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve syst\u00e9miques dans sa d\u00e9cision pour \u00e9tablir le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de la plainte. En fait, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a express\u00e9ment reconnu la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie\u2011Britannique \u00e0 tenir compte de la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique afin de d\u00e9cider si Jeffrey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination : arr\u00eat Moore, au paragraphe 63.\n[102] L\u2019intim\u00e9 cherche \u00e0 obtenir, dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, la radiation des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique en dehors des p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration du plaignant sous la surveillance du SCC, un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que le Tribunal, ainsi qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, ne doit exercer que \u00ab dans les cas les plus clairs \u00bb. Si le Tribunal devait consentir \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, cela emp\u00eacherait le plaignant d\u2019invoquer, en appui \u00e0 sa propre plainte de discrimination, quelque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au SCC en dehors des p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incarc\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a express\u00e9ment reconnu le fait qu\u2019une preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique \u00ab puisse jouer un r\u00f4le important dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00bb : arr\u00eat Moore, au paragraphe 65. Il ne fait nul doute qu\u2019une preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique commise par le SCC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, pendant les p\u00e9riodes d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration de M. Desmarais et en dehors de ces p\u00e9riodes, peut appuyer la plainte individuelle de discrimination du plaignant.\n[103] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir en outre qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instar de Jeffrey Moore, qui avait termin\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes secondaires et ne r\u00e9int\u00e9grerait pas le r\u00e9seau scolaire public, M. Desmarais n\u2019est plus sous la surveillance du SCC et, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 subir un proc\u00e8s, il ne le serait pas \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Par cons\u00e9quent, ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, toute r\u00e9paration au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode de temps pertinente \u00e0 la plainte individuelle, d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[104] Ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate concerne la divulgation et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience, et non quelque mesure de redressement d\u2019ordre syst\u00e9mique possible \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Par ailleurs, M. Desmarais a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9\u00e9valuation et a r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 apte \u00e0 subir un proc\u00e8s. Il pourra donc, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, se retrouver possiblement \u00e0 nouveau plac\u00e9 sous la garde du SCC. Ainsi, les pratiques et les politiques actuelles du SCC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle comme M. Desmarais s\u2019av\u00e8rent pertinentes pour le plaignant. Cela appuie leur inclusion dans le cadre de la divulgation et de l\u2019audience.\n[105] De plus, si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il incombera au Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), d\u2019accorder une mesure de redressement \u00ab destin\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables \u00bb. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une connaissance des pratiques et des politiques actuelles du SCC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle, le Tribunal ne sera pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9laborer ou de mettre en \u0153uvre toute mesure de redressement, contrecarrant ainsi l\u2019objet m\u00eame de la LCDP.\n[106] J\u2019estime qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de citer la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal relativement \u00e0 la m\u00eame question dans l\u2019affaire Emmett, d\u00e9cision qui indique la voie \u00e0 suivre :\n\u00c0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, je ne vois aucun motif pour lequel je pourrais rejeter les demandes de mesures de redressement de la plaignante qui sont post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par sa plainte. On ne m\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun fondement l\u00e9gal, que ce soit la Loi ou une autre source, qui restreint la p\u00e9riode pour laquelle un plaignant peut demander une mesure de redressement. [...] Enfin, la plaignante doit encore \u00e9tablir un lien entre les actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et sa perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. S\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien, et que les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es ne sont li\u00e9es qu\u2019aux plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles, aucun redressement ne sera accord\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses observations \u00e0 ce sujet lors de l\u2019audience.\n[107] Tout comme dans l\u2019affaire Emmett, on ne m\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun fondement l\u00e9gal permettant de restreindre la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte du plaignant.\n[108] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019ai \u00e9tabli que la p\u00e9riode pertinente pour la pr\u00e9sentation des documents divulgu\u00e9s et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience d\u00e9butera en novembre 2001, le jour o\u00f9 M. Bigras a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et \u00e9tabli des pr\u00e9dictions quant \u00e0 l\u2019avenir du plaignant au SCC, et se terminera le jour du prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n(iii) La bonne administration de la justice [109] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que le fait d\u2019autoriser le plaignant \u00e0 aller de l\u2019avant avec ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique augmenterait les co\u00fbts pour l\u2019ensemble des parties et le Tribunal en raison du grand nombre de documents \u00e0 divulguer. Bien qu\u2019il soit toujours difficile de faire ces pr\u00e9dictions, je suis d\u2019avis que le fait de trancher ces questions d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui se r\u00e9percute sur le plaignant, ainsi que sur les plaignants comme lui \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter une multitude de cas et se traduirait par des \u00e9conomies en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts pour toutes les parties concern\u00e9es. \u00c0 mon avis, cela servirait mieux l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\n[110] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire Desmarais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas aussi appropri\u00e9e et aussi justifi\u00e9e que l\u2019affaire Starblanket, qui est aussi actuellement devant le Tribunal, aux fins d\u2019une analyse de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique touchant les d\u00e9tenus qui sont atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle. Je ne peux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une assertion de ce genre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire Desmarais rel\u00e8ve de ma comp\u00e9tence, mais qu\u2019il en va autrement pour toute autre affaire g\u00e9r\u00e9e par d\u2019autres membres du Tribunal.\n(iv) Le choix du moment pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate [111] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je n\u2019estime pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exposer plus en d\u00e9tail cette question.\nVII. Conclusion et d\u00e9cision [112] La pr\u00e9sente affaire implique un ensemble complexe de faits, comme en t\u00e9moignent les paragraphes 8 \u00e0 32 ci\u2011dessus, et de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives, qui soul\u00e8vent des questions directement li\u00e9es aux politiques et aux pratiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9 eu \u00e9gard au traitement des d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle. Compte tenu de la prudence que doit exercer le Tribunal au moment de rejeter certains aspects d\u2019une plainte sur un fondement pr\u00e9liminaire, et du libell\u00e9 clair du formulaire de plainte et de la lettre de renvoi au Tribunal, j\u2019estime que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique ne peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies qu\u2019une fois que les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter, lors d\u2019une audience, tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se rapportant \u00e0 cette affaire. Cet avis est appuy\u00e9 par bon nombre d\u2019affaires d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9es : voir par exemple les affaires Buffet et SSEFPN.\n[113] Le Tribunal d\u00e9tient toujours la capacit\u00e9 de rejeter des parties syst\u00e9miques de la plainte, dans le cadre de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement. Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en vertu de principes, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37) et de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire ainsi qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (d\u00e9cision Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\n[114] Pour ces motifs, ma d\u00e9cision est la suivante :\nLa requ\u00eate est annul\u00e9e;\nLa p\u00e9riode de divulgation d\u00e9bute en novembre 2001, le jour o\u00f9 M.

Le Tribunal devrait-il tenir une audience pour prendre connaissance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations relatives \u00e0 la demande de suspension d\u2019instance pour abus de proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire?. 7\n3. Ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ordonnance de renvoi, modifi\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. 9\na) Jugement d\u00e9claratoire. 9\nb) Ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire. 10\nc) Indemnisation de la victime identifi\u00e9e dans la communication pour discrimination inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e ou d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. 11\nI. Le contexte [1] La pr\u00e9sente affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne cons\u00e9cutivement \u00e0 un appel d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire entendu par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2014 CAF 18). Le Tribunal est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent charg\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2012 CF 1162), modifi\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nII. La plainte de M. Warman contre M. Lemire [2] La plainte de M. Warman faisait uniquement \u00e9tat de documents trouv\u00e9s sur Freedomsite.org. Il all\u00e9guait que M. Lemire \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et l\u2019administrateur du site Web. Les documents mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte \u00e9taient surtout des messages affich\u00e9s par des utilisateurs inscrits sur le babillard du site Web.\n[3] Lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte, M. Warman et la Commission ont toutefois \u00e9largi la port\u00e9e de celle-ci pour inclure des documents trouv\u00e9s sur JRBooksonline.com et Stormfront.org. Ils ont fait valoir que M. Lemire \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire inscrit de JRBooksonline.com et donc responsable de son contenu. \u00c0 propos de Stormfront.org, ils ont fait valoir que M. Lemire affichait sur le babillard de ce site des messages qui violaient l\u2019article 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP ou la Loi).\nIII. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2009 TCDP 26) [4] Le membre instructeur Hadjis a conclu que M. Warman et la Commission n\u2019avaient pu \u00e9tayer leur pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle M. Lemire \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire de JRBooksonline.com (paragraphe 47). Il a de plus conclu que ce que M. Lemire affichait sur Stormfront.org ne constituait pas la propagande haineuse vis\u00e9e par la Loi. Il a enfin conclu que celui-ci n\u2019avait pas fait transmettre de documents haineux sur le site Freedomside.org, dont il \u00e9tait l\u2019administrateur, puisque c\u2019\u00e9tait Craig Harrison qui avait affich\u00e9 le contenu haineux (voir Warman c. Harrison, 2006 TCDP 30).\n[5] Seul l'article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Aids Secrets \u00bb [les secrets du sida] affich\u00e9 sur Freedomsite.org a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu comme un acte discriminatoire au sens du paragraphe 13(1), car il exprimait \u00ab des \u00e9motions exceptionnellement fortes et profondes de d\u00e9testation envers les homosexuels en particulier \u00bb (Warman c. Lemire, 2009 TCDP 26, au paragraphe 207). Selon l\u2019article, \u00ab [l]es homosexuels sont des personnes dangereuses et immorales [...] qui, en \u00e9tant motiv\u00e9es par un d\u00e9sire \u00e9go\u00efste de se livrer \u00e0 leurs pratiques sexuelles d\u00e9viantes et en ne faisant pas analyser leurs dons de sang, sont responsables de la mort de milliers de personnes (au paragraphe 200). L\u2019article citait de plus des statistiques hors contexte pour \u00e9tablir que le VIH\/SIDA \u00e9tait une maladie propre aux Noirs (au paragraphe 195).\n[6] \u00c0 propos de la question constitutionnelle de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019article 13 viole l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, le Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9carter de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 RCS 892, que si M. Lemire pouvait faire une distinction entre les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce et celles de l'arr\u00eat Taylor (au paragraphe 221).\n[7] Le membre instructeur Hadjis a conclu que le libell\u00e9 en vigueur de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi, modifi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arr\u00eat Taylor, ne portait plus une atteinte minimale \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression vis\u00e9e par la violation, car les peines en cas de verdict pour avoir transmis ou fait transmettre de la propagande haineuse \u2014 alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et paragraphe 54(1.1) \u2014 ressemblent \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent trop \u00e0 des sanctions criminelles plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 des sanctions administratives. Il a \u00e9galement conclu que \u00ab [l]a disposition ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant le caract\u00e8re exclusivement r\u00e9parateur, pr\u00e9ventif et conciliatoire, qui \u00e9tait au c\u0153ur de la conclusion tir\u00e9e par la Cour dans l'arr\u00eat Taylor selon laquelle la justification de la restriction apport\u00e9e par le paragraphe 13(1) \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression peut se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique et, ainsi, elle est justifi\u00e9e au regard de l'article premier de la Charte \u00bb (au paragraphe 279). Le Tribunal a en outre conclu que la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal pour instruction, m\u00eame si le contenu offensant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9, et le fait que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Commission a peu recours \u00e0 des mesures de conciliation rendaient inconstitutionnelles, au regard de leur effet pratique, les dispositions l\u00e9gales contest\u00e9es (aux paragraphes 283 et 284). Le Tribunal a donc refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer le paragraphe 13(1), l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et le paragraphe 54(1.1) de la LCDP.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2012 CF 1162) [8] En contr\u00f4le judiciaire et selon la norme de la d\u00e9cision correcte, la Cour a reconnu que les mesures de r\u00e9paration vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 54 sont devenues punitives de fa\u00e7on inconstitutionnelle, mais que le Tribunal a commis une erreur en refusant d\u2019appliquer la doctrine de la dissociation; il aurait d\u00fb dissocier les paragraphes 54(1) et (1.1), et conclure \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Taylor. La Cour a donc d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 des paragraphes 54(1) et (1.1) et renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal afin qu\u2019il prononce en vertu de l\u2019article 13 une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la seule disposition discriminatoire et qu\u2019il d\u00e9cide s\u2019il y a lieu de prendre des mesures r\u00e9paratrices en vertu des alin\u00e9as 54(1)a) ou b) (aux paragraphes 138 et 139).\n[9] La Cour a conclu que \u00ab [l]es articles 50 \u00e0 54 de la Loi, qui d\u00e9finissent les pouvoirs dont dispose le Tribunal au moment de mener une instruction, ne contiennent aucune disposition lui octroyant [le pouvoir d\u2019examiner les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission] \u00bb (au paragraphe 52). Le Tribunal ne peut examiner que les questions portant sur des dispositions de la Charte qui sont soulev\u00e9es en audience, car il n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission rend des d\u00e9cisions dans ses fonctions administratives; seuls les cours peuvent examiner le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la Commission, et cet examen doit prendre la forme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire (au paragraphe 57). L\u2019examen du bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de proc\u00e9der par m\u00e9diation et conciliation ou de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal outrepassait donc le mandat de celui-ci et n\u2019aurait d\u00fb influer en aucune fa\u00e7on son analyse constitutionnelle.\nV. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (2014 CAF 18) [10] Le juge Evans de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a acquiesc\u00e9 sans r\u00e9serve \u00e0 la constitutionalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13, de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et du paragraphe 54(1.1). Il a conclu \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 \u2014 ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celle des dispositions sur les sanctions, en particulier au regard de l\u2019objectif urgent et r\u00e9el de l\u2019\u00c9tat de pr\u00e9venir la diffamation de groupes vuln\u00e9rables. De surcro\u00eet, les sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires possibles dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 est reconnu coupable de violation de l\u2019article 13 ne sont pas r\u00e9ellement p\u00e9nales, mais administratives, et donc \u00e9galement constitutionnelles. En annulant la d\u00e9claration d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9, il a modifi\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sans toutefois toucher \u00e0 celle-ci (au paragraphe 107).\n[11] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a convenu que [traduction] \u00ab les effets d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gale peuvent invalider cette disposition s\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent n\u00e9cessairement de ses termes \u00bb, mais que des mesures administratives inconstitutionnelles n\u2019ont pas les m\u00eames incidences que les dispositions l\u00e9gales inconstitutionnelles (au paragraphe 47). Elle a en revanche \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9saccord avec la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle le Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tent pour enqu\u00eater sur l\u2019exercice par la Commission de ses pouvoirs administratifs. [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9troite par le juge de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte minerait les raisons de lui conf\u00e9rer le pouvoir l\u00e9gal de se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de sa loi habilitante \u00bb (au paragraphe 51). Le Tribunal peut enqu\u00eater sur les mesures prises par la Commission, pour autant qu\u2019elles soient pertinentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la question de droit dont il est saisi. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce cependant, les mesures prises par la Commission n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pertinentes \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle (au paragraphe 52).\n[12] Se fondant largement sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) c. Whatcott, 2013 CSC 11, [2013] 1 RCS 467, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 que l\u2019existance des lois visant la propagande haineuse adresse aux Canadiens un message qui fait partie de la n\u00e9cessaire \u0153uvre de promouvoir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle des dispositions l\u00e9gales dans les cas o\u00f9 le contenu Internet contest\u00e9 est stock\u00e9 dans des serveurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger n\u2019est pas pertinente pour la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de ces dispositions (aux paragraphes 60 \u00e0 63). Le paragraphe 13(2), qui le rend applicable \u00e0 Internet \u2013 o\u00f9, selon la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, les groupes vis\u00e9s ont amplement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre \u2013 constitue aussi une atteinte minimale au droit de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression que garantit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte, car la propagande haineuse emp\u00eache r\u00e9ellement des groupes opprim\u00e9s de contribuer en \u00e9gaux au d\u00e9bat social (aux paragraphes 64 et 70). La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a de plus rejet\u00e9 la proposition qu\u2019Internet facilite les \u00e9changes d\u2019id\u00e9es formateurs sur des sujets \u00e9voqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019objet de l\u2019article 13; [traduction] \u00ab du fait de la nature extr\u00eame de la propagande haineuse interdite, imaginer que les personnes qui s\u2019y adonnent soient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre ouvertes aux \u00e9changes d\u2019id\u00e9es formateurs me para\u00eet relever de la fantaisie \u00bb (au paragraphe 65).\n[13] Le juge Evans a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit \u00e0 propos des sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires en cas de violation de l\u2019article 13 :\n[traduction] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que les sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires impos\u00e9es pour violation d\u2019un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal et payables au Tr\u00e9sor ne sont pas de nature p\u00e9nale aux fins de d\u00e9cider de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 des garanties proc\u00e9durales de l\u2019article 11 de la Charte \u2026 Les sanctions pour inobservation impos\u00e9es par la r\u00e9glementation pour la protection de la population conform\u00e9ment aux objectifs de la loi ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement de nature p\u00e9nale aux fins de l\u2019article 11. (Au paragraphe 78.)\n[14] Soulignant que les sanctions n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre parfaites, le juge Evans a fait preuve de retenue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019imposer une sanction p\u00e9cuniaire pour inciter au respect de l\u2019article 13 de la Loi et dissuader d\u2019y porter atteinte (au paragraphe 91). En conjonction avec l\u2019objectif de [traduction] \u00ab protection du statut social des groupes vuln\u00e9rables et de pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard \u00bb (au paragraphe 92) et le fait que la sanction emp\u00eache que les d\u00e9linquants \u00e9vitent la responsabilit\u00e9 quand ils visent des groupes plut\u00f4t que des personnes (au paragraphe 93), le juge Evans a affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9paration que pr\u00e9voit la LCDP, l\u2019imposition d\u2019une sanction en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et du paragraphe 54(1.1) n\u2019est pas moralement plus r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible que la conclusion que la communication de la propagande haineuse a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, lequel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9] et, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b), elle vise \u00e0 indemniser les personnes identifi\u00e9es. (au paragraphe 98)\n[15] C\u2019est pourquoi les sanctions p\u00e9cuniaires ne sont pas p\u00e9nales mais administratives, et sont un moyen pour imposer [traduction] \u00ab la responsabilit\u00e9 des dommages caus\u00e9s par la diffamation de groupes vis\u00e9s et dissuader la communication de propagande haineuse, afin que diminue la discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard \u00bb (au paragraphe 104).\nVI. La r\u00e9attribution de l\u2019affaire [16] Il convient de mentionner que, post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de renvoi, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim du TCDP a attribu\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 un autre membre du Tribunal, le mandat du membre instructeur Hadjis ayant expir\u00e9 au d\u00e9but 2010.\nVII. Les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi [17] Le Tribunal est actuellement saisi des questions suivantes, qu\u2019il doit trancher :\n1. Le Tribunal devrait-il ajourner l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le litige concernant le contr\u00f4le judiciaire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement tranch\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appelant \u00e9puise sa possibilit\u00e9 de demander l\u2019autorisation de se pourvoir en appel, ou que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada refuse l\u2019autorisation ou qu\u2019elle l\u2019accorde et qu\u2019elle se prononce sur l\u2019appel?\n2. Le Tribunal devrait-il tenir une audience pour prendre connaissance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations relatives \u00e0 la demande de suspension d\u2019instance pour abus de proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire?\n3. Le Tribunal doit-il ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance de renvoi, modifi\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale?\n1. Le Tribunal devrait-il ajourner l\u2019affaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le litige concernant le contr\u00f4le judiciaire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement tranch\u00e9? [18] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que l\u2019affaire devrait \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e ind\u00e9finiment en attendant l\u2019issue finale de toutes les proc\u00e9dures d\u2019appel dans le contr\u00f4le judiciaire susmentionn\u00e9. L\u2019affaire soul\u00e8ve selon lui d\u2019importantes questions touchant l\u2019une des libert\u00e9s les plus fondamentales des Canadiens, la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression. Ces questions n\u2019ont pas encore fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive, ce qui sera seulement le cas apr\u00e8s que tous les appels auront \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. Je le cite : [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019affaire peut encore \u00eatre port\u00e9e devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. \u00bb\n[19] Je ne puis accepter les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[20] Les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal et les ordonnances de renvoi des Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne sont pas susceptibles d\u2019ajournement automatique en attendant l\u2019appel ou l\u2019autorisation d\u2019en appeler. Le Tribunal doit donner suite aux ordonnances d\u2019une instance sup\u00e9rieure, sauf si les parties peuvent obtenir un sursis judiciaire. De plus, le Tribunal est tenu, en vertu du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, d\u2019instruire les plaintes \u00ab sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. \u00bb En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal n\u2019ajournera pas l\u2019affaire en attendant l\u2019issue des appels du contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans le m\u00eame dossier.\n[21] Les parties peuvent solliciter la suspension conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 50 de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C., 1985, ch. F-7, ou au paragraphe 65.1(1) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, L.R.C. 1985, ch. S-26.\n[22] Dans ses observations sur une demande d\u2019ajournement ind\u00e9fini, M. Lemire n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que sans ajournement, il y aurait d\u00e9ni des principes de justice naturelle ou de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Ceci est important, car un manquement possible aux principes de justice naturelle aurait constitu\u00e9 un motif l\u00e9gitime pour que le Tribunal n\u2019instruise pas de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive : paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP.\n[23] Au vu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la demande d\u2019ajournement ind\u00e9fini est refus\u00e9e.\n2. Le Tribunal devrait-il tenir une audience pour prendre connaissance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations relatives \u00e0 la demande de suspension d\u2019instance pour abus de proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Lemire? [24] Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande que se tienne une audience pour traiter les \u00ab questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es \u00bb, notamment selon lui une requ\u00eate en suspension pour abus de proc\u00e9dure. Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission et le plaignant ont poursuivi la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 oppressive, malveillante, m\u00e9prisable et de mauvaise foi, de nature \u00e0 d\u00e9consid\u00e9rer l\u2019application de la loi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[25] Si M. Lemire voulait avoir gain de cause dans une requ\u00eate en suspension pour abus de proc\u00e9dure, ce qui n\u00e9cessiterait obligatoirement la remise en cause de l\u2019affaire, il devrait satisfaire aux conclusions sur l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure par voie de remise en cause des faits que la Cour supr\u00eame a expos\u00e9es dans Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P. section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63, [2003] 3 RCS 77 (Toronto c. S.C.F.P.). Sinon, sa requ\u00eate constituerait elle-m\u00eame un abus de proc\u00e9dure. La Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 dans son arr\u00eat :\nIl peut en effet y avoir des cas o\u00f9 la remise en cause pourra servir l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire plut\u00f4t que lui porter pr\u00e9judice, par exemple : (1) lorsque la premi\u00e8re instance est entach\u00e9e de fraude ou de malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9, (2) lorsque de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, qui n\u2019avaient pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s auparavant, jettent de fa\u00e7on probante un doute sur le r\u00e9sultat initial, (3) lorsque l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que le r\u00e9sultat initial n\u2019ait pas force obligatoire dans le nouveau contexte. (au paragraphe 52)\n[26] La premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e devant un membre instructeur qui ne si\u00e8ge plus au Tribunal. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, il a men\u00e9 une analyse minutieuse des proc\u00e9dures de la Commission \u00e0 la fois dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dont le Tribunal \u00e9tait saisi et dans son mode de fonctionnement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Le membre instructeur a conclu que les m\u00e9thodes administratives de la Commission contribuaient \u00e0 l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 des dispositions relatives \u00e0 la propagande haineuse. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour prendre ces m\u00e9thodes en consid\u00e9ration. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 cette question sur la comp\u00e9tence, mais a conclu qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ces m\u00e9thodes administratives n\u2019avaient simplement aucune pertinence. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se trouve de nouveau devant le Tribunal, il cherche \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les m\u00eames arguments, reformul\u00e9s en [traduction] \u00ab requ\u00eate en suspension d\u2019instance pour abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb.\n[27] Il est inutile de poursuivre l\u2019analyse. Le contexte dans lequel M. Lemire voudrait pr\u00e9tendre que la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission et M. Warman ont men\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente affaire constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure ne diff\u00e8re en rien de l\u2019audience initiale. Les faits et les preuves en cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au membre instructeur initial; il n\u2019y a aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, qui n\u2019avait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 auparavant; qui plus est, aucun contexte nouveau n\u2019emp\u00eacherait la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de lier le Tribunal et les parties.\n[28] La requ\u00eate pour abus de proc\u00e9dure de M. Lemire ne saurait \u00eatre conforme aux exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans Toronto c. S.C.F.P. et constituerait elle-m\u00eame un abus de proc\u00e9dure, car elle cherche \u00e0 remettre en cause des questions tranch\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement. Le fait d\u2019entendre la requ\u00eate porterait de plus atteinte au mandat d\u2019instruire de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive que le paragraphe 48.9(1) conf\u00e8re au Tribunal. Il n\u2019y aura donc ni audience ni observation touchant la demande de suspension pour abus de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par M. Lemire.\n[29] Je souhaite ajouter, comme derni\u00e8re observation sur cette question, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait loisible \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de faire valoir \u00e0 la fois devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que les ordonnances qui renvoient les affaires au Tribunal devraient lui enjoindre d\u2019examiner \u2013 ou en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner \u2013 son argumentation sur l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Peu importe que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait ou non sollicit\u00e9 ou non une telle directive, car aucune ne figure dans l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019aucune des deux Cours. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9duire une telle directive du libell\u00e9 limpide du dispositif des deux jugements.\n3. Le Tribunal doit-il ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019ordonnance de renvoi, modifi\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale? a) Jugement d\u00e9claratoire [30] La Cour a ordonn\u00e9 que le Tribunal prononce un jugement d\u00e9claratoire \u00e0 propos de la communication discriminatoire. Le Tribunal ne peut exercer aucun pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans l\u2019observation de cette partie de l\u2019ordonnance. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal d\u00e9clare que M. Lemire a viol\u00e9 l\u2019article 13 de la LCDP, pour avoir fait transmettre de la propagande haineuse en affichant l\u2019article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab AIDS Secrets \u00bb sur le forum public Freedomsite.org.\nb) Ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire [31] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Lemire, conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 54(1)a) et 53(2)a) de la LCDP, de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte discriminatoire susmentionn\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de mettre fin au fait de transmettre ou de faire transmettre par les moyens vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 13, \u00e0 savoir Internet, des questions du type que contient l\u2019article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab AIDS Secrets \u00bb, lequel est susceptible d'exposer \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe identifiable sur la base d'un motif de distinction illicite. La Commission reconna\u00eet que M. Lemire a retir\u00e9 avant la premi\u00e8re audience le contenu offensant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9, mais cela importe peu au regard de l\u2019objectif d\u2019une ordonnance d\u2019interdiction rendue en vertu de la Loi. \u00ab L'objectif d'une ordonnance d'interdiction rendue en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 54(1)a) de la Loi est de corriger un comportement qui contrevient au paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi et d'envoyer \u00e0 tous le message qu'un tel comportement n'est pas acceptable \u00bb (Warman c. L\u2019Alliance du Nord, 2009 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 57 (L\u2019Alliance du Nord)). De surcro\u00eet, le fait de restreindre l\u2019ordonnance au contenu qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment reproch\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet de ces dispositions l\u00e9gales qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ues pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et persistante dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. L\u2019ordonnance vise donc \u00e0 garantir que l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Lemire, n\u2019ait plus de comportement comme celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 discriminatoire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce (L\u2019Alliance du Nord, au paragraphe 57).\nc) Indemnisation de la victime identifi\u00e9e dans la communication pour discrimination inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e ou d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e [32] Aucune ordonnance ne sera rendue en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 54(1)b), les parties n\u2019en ayant pas demand\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

James Louie (les plaignants) ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en leurs noms des plaintes distinctes contre le minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (MAINC), \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission). Les plaignants all\u00e8guent que l\u2019intim\u00e9, en refusant d\u2019accepter et de traiter la demande de bail minist\u00e9riel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Louie pour la parcelle 175 dont il est propri\u00e9taire\/titulaire en vertu du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C., 1985, ch. I\u20115, a fait preuve de discrimination envers eux en raison de leur origine nationale ou ethnique et de leur race, en violation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP).\n[2] Le 29 juillet 2011, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les deux plaintes au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal), lui demandant de mener une seule instruction, les plaintes soulevant essentiellement les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit.\nII. Les faits pertinents [3] M. Louie est membre de la bande indienne Okanagan (la Bande), et r\u00e9side dans la r\u00e9serve indienne no 1 Okanagan. M. Louie est propri\u00e9taire l\u00e9gitime des parcelles 170-1 et 175, bloc 4, r\u00e9serve indienne no 1 Okanagan. Cette terre, d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00ab appartenant \u00e0 des titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel \u00bb, a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e par le conseil de bande \u00e0 M. Louie, l\u2019\u00ab occupant \u00bb, avec l\u2019approbation du ministre du MAINC. Le droit de M. Louie de poss\u00e9der l\u00e9gitimement cette terre est attest\u00e9 par un certificat de possession, d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en application de l\u2019article 20 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[4] Le 29 juin 2007, M. Louie et Mme Beattie, elle aussi Indienne au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens, ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, sur le fondement du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens, une demande d\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne et une demande de louer des terres appartenant \u00e0 des titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir au nom de Mme Beattie, promoteur, un bail r\u00e9sidentiel pr\u00e9pay\u00e9 pour la parcelle 170. Le bail propos\u00e9 avait une dur\u00e9e de quarante-neuf ans et un loyer symbolique d\u2019un dollar. Cette demande de bail a donn\u00e9 lieu au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte distincte au Tribunal, pour laquelle celui-ci a rendu le 26 janvier 2011 la d\u00e9cision Louie et Beattie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 2 (Louie et Beattie c. MAINC).\n[5] Le 23 janvier 2008, M. Louie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une demande semblable en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir un bail pour la parcelle 175, entre le ministre et lui-m\u00eame, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de quarante-neuf ans, \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2008 pour un loyer symbolique d\u2019un dollar. La demande pr\u00e9cisait que le bail propos\u00e9 \u00e9tait destin\u00e9 \u00e0 un usage r\u00e9sidentiel, notamment \u00e0 la construction d\u2019une maison unifamiliale. M. Louie avait l\u2019intention, pour financer cette construction, d\u2019engager le pr\u00eat afin d\u2019obtenir de Mme Beattie un pr\u00eat \u00e0 la construction de 200 000 $ au maximum. M. Louie entendait lui transf\u00e9rer le bail pour la dur\u00e9e du pr\u00eat, le bail lui revenant \u00e0 la fin du remboursement du pr\u00eat.\n[6] C\u2019est cette demande de bail, relative \u00e0 la parcelle 175, qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[7] Le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2008, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a envoy\u00e9 le courriel suivant au repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants, M. Bruce Beattie :\n[Traduction] Je vous informe que le MAINC a re\u00e7u un avis juridique et ne peut accepter et traiter la demande dat\u00e9e du 23 janvier 2008 concernant l\u2019utilisation de terres dans une r\u00e9serve indienne situ\u00e9es sur la parcelle 175, car la Loi sur les Indiens ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 l\u2019occupant de droit de tenure \u00e0 bail sur la terre pour laquelle il d\u00e9tient un certificat de possession (CP). Si M. Louie souhaite avoir un tel droit, il devra se constituer en personne morale.\n[8] Plus tard la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant a r\u00e9pondu par courriel, exprimant son d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Selon M. Louie, la Loi sur les Indiens ne pr\u00e9voit rien quant \u00e0 savoir si les occupants peuvent avoir des droits de tenure \u00e0 bail sur la terre qu\u2019ils ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019abandonner \u00e0 la Couronne pour la dur\u00e9e du bail. La Loi sur les Indiens est \u00e9galement muette au sujet de savoir si l\u2019occupant est tenu de se constituer en personne morale afin de d\u00e9tenir un bail. Le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que M. Louie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 se constituer en personne morale, car il n\u2019en tirerait aucun avantage. Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019autres retards, M. Louie a demand\u00e9 toutefois la modification de la demande de bail de 2008, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 nommer Mme Beattie comme preneuse \u00e0 bail propos\u00e9e.\n[9] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2008, M. Louie a adress\u00e9 une lettre au chef et au conseil de bande et a envoy\u00e9 une copie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il y d\u00e9clarait que, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne veut pas \u00e9tablir \u00e0 son nom un bail de titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel, il ferait signer \u00e0 Mme Beattie le bail pour la parcelle 175. Il expliquait que le bail serait ensuite transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son nom, par transfert ou par sous-location. M. Louie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en outre qu\u2019il voulait signer le bail en vue d\u2019accro\u00eetre la valeur de la terre et de faciliter le financement par pr\u00eat hypoth\u00e9caire classique de la construction d\u2019une maison neuve pour lui-m\u00eame sur la parcelle 175.\n[10] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2008, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie a demand\u00e9 par courriel \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que leur soit communiqu\u00e9e la jurisprudence sur laquelle celui-ci s\u2019appuyait pour all\u00e9guer que [Traduction] \u00ab la Loi sur les Indiens ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 l\u2019occupant le droit de tenure \u00e0 bail de la terre pour laquelle il d\u00e9tient un certificat de possession \u00bb.\n[11] Le 5 mars 2008, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie a \u00e9crit par courriel \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu au courriel du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2008, M. Louie avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait toujours que le bail pour la parcelle 175 soit \u00e9tabli entre le ministre et lui-m\u00eame plut\u00f4t qu\u2019entre le ministre et Mme Beattie.\n[12] Le 19 mars 2008, M. Louie a exprim\u00e9 par lettre au ministre du MAINC son m\u00e9contentement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du retard de traitement des demandes de bail pour la parcelle 175 ainsi que de la demande de bail pour la parcelle 170-1 adress\u00e9e le 29 juin 2007. Il a expliqu\u00e9 :\n[Traduction] Afin que je puisse utiliser mes terres d\u00e9cern\u00e9es en vertu de CP, la Loi sur les Indiens m\u2019oblige \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande de bail minist\u00e9riel au sens du paragraphe 58(3). Un tel bail vise clairement \u00e0 offrir des avenues de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique et des avantages pour les d\u00e9tenteurs de CP, mais selon mon exp\u00e9rience, le processus de demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location, tel qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9sentement g\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, est devenu tellement inefficace et offensif du point de vue de la race qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019il bloque, plut\u00f4t que facilite, le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique. Il m\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vident que la majorit\u00e9 des aspects n\u00e9gatifs du processus de demande de bail existant d\u00e9coulent d\u2019une attitude archa\u00efque et raciste ancr\u00e9e selon laquelle tous les Indiens sont incomp\u00e9tents et ne peuvent d\u00e9terminer leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont assur\u00e9ment besoin du paternalisme d\u00e9gradant que les agents du MAINC appellent de fa\u00e7on euph\u00e9mique une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb. Bien que je reconnaisse que cette perception existe chez les agents du MAINC et qu\u2019elle est incorpor\u00e9e dans les politiques et les pratiques administratives du MAINC, je n\u2019accepte pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une justification factuelle ou l\u00e9gale. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accepte pas qu\u2019elle ait un effet contraignant pour moi ou pour la fa\u00e7on dont je choisis d\u2019utiliser mes propres terres.\n[\u2026]\nJe crois que cette suite d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9montre clairement un niveau de dysfonction administrative au bureau des terres de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique qui ne peut que se refl\u00e9ter de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative sur tout engagement que vous et votre minist\u00e8re avez en ce qui concerne l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et le traitement honorable des particuliers indiens propri\u00e9taires fonciers. La situation n\u2019est certainement pas propice au d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique des terres sur les r\u00e9serves, en particulier puisque la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de terres d\u00e9cern\u00e9es en vertu de CP est bien \u00e9tablie et est la seule occasion de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique viable et durable.\n[13] M. Louie a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les retards ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par l\u2019obstruction manifest\u00e9e par les gestionnaires du Bureau des terres de la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique, et a demand\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate minist\u00e9rielle sur la fa\u00e7on dont les fonctionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9 administrent le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[14] Le 15 avril 2008, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie a remis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la version la plus r\u00e9cente du projet de bail. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu le 17 avril 2008 qu\u2019il n\u2019acceptait pas le document du bail. Il a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa position selon laquelle M. Louie devait se constituer en personne morale avant que le bail puisse lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait besoin de plus de renseignements pour s\u2019assurer de la conformit\u00e9 avec le Code national du b\u00e2timent et avec la Loi sur les esp\u00e8ces en p\u00e9ril et pour r\u00e9gler d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 li\u00e9s de la demande de bail.\n[15] Le 21 avril 2008, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un autre exemplaire du projet de bail du 15 avril 2008. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son courriel d\u2019accompagnement que M. Louie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 envisager de modifier les conditions du projet de bail.\n[16] Le 15 mai 2008, le ministre du MAINC a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de M. Louie du 19 mars 2008 :\n[Traduction] La pr\u00e9sente porte sur votre lettre du 19 mars 2007 et sur votre demande de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location sur la r\u00e9serve indienne Okanagan no 1.\nEn droit, il existe une relation sp\u00e9ciale entre un d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un certificat de possession et le Canada. Le droit sous-jacent aux terres d\u2019une r\u00e9serve appartient \u00e0 la Couronne f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, alors que les avantages de ces terres et le droit de les poss\u00e9der appartiennent au d\u00e9tenteur du certificat de possession. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas habituellement pour un propri\u00e9taire foncier priv\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit de circonstances sp\u00e9ciales, entra\u00eenant une \u00ab relation sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb. Un rapport fiduciaire est cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre le d\u00e9tenteur du certificat de possession et le Canada lorsque le Canada contracte des baux de certificats de possession. Cela est fond\u00e9 sur le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire unilat\u00e9ral du Canada sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du d\u00e9tenteur indien du certificat de possession. Seule une r\u00e9forme l\u00e9gislative peut annuler ou modifier cette relation.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, comme le Canada est la premi\u00e8re partie dans tout instrument accordant un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les terres des r\u00e9serves, un examen attentif des d\u00e9tails du bail doit \u00eatre entrepris afin que les modalit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es soient \u00e9tablies dans le bail.\nEn vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer revient au Canada et ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, sauf par modification de la loi. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et une d\u00e9charge ne modifiera pas le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s du bail, qui comprennent aussi, sans s\u2019y limiter, des dispositions quant \u00e0 l\u2019environnement.\nLe processus de bail pour les terres des r\u00e9serves est le m\u00eame partout au Canada et il d\u00e9coule de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures qui sont actuellement en place. Certaines exigences doivent \u00eatre respect\u00e9es avant que le droit de tenure \u00e0 bail soit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre partie sur les terres des r\u00e9serves.\nLes Premi\u00e8res nations peuvent choisir de se retirer de la Loi sur les Indiens pour la gestion des terres gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la Loi sur la gestion des terres des Premi\u00e8res nations, \u00e0 l\u2019autonomie gouvernementale et \u00e0 des trait\u00e9s. Le minist\u00e8re encourage les membres des Premi\u00e8res nations et les conseils de bande \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e9gimes \u00e0 long terme qui satisfont aux besoins de leur collectivit\u00e9.\nLe 31 mars 2008, une \u00e9bauche de bail vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e pour examen. Je vous demande de travailler avec le bureau r\u00e9gional de la Colombie-Britannique afin que les agents puissent vous aider \u00e0 satisfaire aux exigences pour l\u2019obtention d\u2019un bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location sur une terre de r\u00e9serve. J\u2019encouragerai mes agents \u00e0 vous consulter pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un loyer qui sera rentable.\nChuck Strahl\n[17] Le 20 juin 2008, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conjointement aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte all\u00e9guant que la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour la parcelle 170-1 est discriminatoire. Cette plainte a finalement donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Louie c. MAINC, dans laquelle le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 raison aux plaignants. Il a notamment ordonn\u00e9 : \u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9 examinera de nouveau les demandes de bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location des plaignants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision et \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00bb et \u00ab L\u2019intim\u00e9 modifiera son Guide de gestion des terres et prendra des mesures, en collaboration avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, afin de rajuster ses pratiques ou d\u2019\u00e9viter que des pratiques semblables soient utilis\u00e9es \u00bb : Louie c. MAINC, paragraphe 64.\n[18] Le 9 septembre 2008, M. Louie a expliqu\u00e9, lors d\u2019une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique entre les parties, que son intention est de se servir du bail comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 pour un pr\u00eat \u00e0 la construction d\u2019une maison neuve, Mme Beattie devant lui transf\u00e9rer le bail une fois le pr\u00eat rembours\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu par courriel dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2008 et a confirm\u00e9 sa position initiale selon laquelle la Loi sur les Indiens ne permet pas d\u2019accorder \u00e0 l\u2019occupant un droit de tenure \u00e0 bail sur la terre qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient par certificat de possession et qu\u2019un transfert de bail de la part de Mme Beattie \u00e0 M. Louie reviendrait en fait \u00e0 un bail direct \u00e0 M. Louie.\n[19] Le processus de demande s\u2019est poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin 2008, avec d\u2019autres \u00e9changes infructueux entre les plaignants et l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[20] Le 23 octobre 2009, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la demande de bail pour la parcelle 175.\n[21] Le 30 octobre 2009, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\n[22] Le 6 novembre 2009, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il acceptera la demande de bail pour la parcelle 175 uniquement si le preneur \u00e0 bail est une personne morale, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens. De plus, il a demand\u00e9 les d\u00e9tails de l\u2019arrangement commercial entre les plaignants afin de pouvoir exercer sa diligence raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 et de la comp\u00e9tence de M. Louie d\u2019effectuer l\u2019op\u00e9ration propos\u00e9e et d\u2019\u00e9viter de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019all\u00e9gations de manquement \u00e0 son obligation fiduciaire envers les Premi\u00e8res Nations et envers leurs membres.\n[23] Le 17 avril 2011, apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision Louie c. MAINC a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en janvier, le repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louis a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, pour obtenir les commentaires de ce dernier, une nouvelle demande de bail pour la parcelle 175 ainsi que des exemplaires d\u2019un projet de bail entre le ministre et M. Louie. Le 3 mai 2011, M. Louie a envoy\u00e9 de nouveau la nouvelle demande et un bail entre le ministre et lui-m\u00eame, le bail \u00e9tant cette fois r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans une forme d\u00e9finitive.\n[24] Le 2 juin 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu par lettre au repr\u00e9sentant de M. Louie que le bail abr\u00e9g\u00e9 fourni le 3 mai 2011 ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences de l\u2019\u00c9tat et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant du ministre.\n[25] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 15 juillet 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Commission :\n[Traduction] [\u2026] je vous informe que le minist\u00e8re des Affaires autochtones et du D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 attentivement la demande de bail pour la parcelle 175 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Louie. Le minist\u00e8re a assoupli sa position initiale et se trouve en mesure de signer un bail avec M. Louie. Un bail sera envoy\u00e9 sous peu \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant pour que M. Louie l\u2019examine et le signe.\n[26] Le 16 novembre 2011, les plaignants ont pris connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois de l\u2019existence de la lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission dat\u00e9e du 15 juillet 2011.\n[27] \u00c0 ce jour, les plaignants n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u le bail de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[28] La semaine du 7 octobre 2013, le Tribunal a tenu une audience sur cette affaire. M. Louie n\u2019y a pas assist\u00e9. Mme Beattie y a assist\u00e9, mais n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignants, M. Beattie, y a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le plaignant.\nIII. Les dispositions l\u00e9gales [29] L\u2019article 2 de la LCDP est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[30] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[31] L\u2019article 28 de la Loi sur les Indiens est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\n(1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), est nul un acte, bail, contrat, instrument, document ou accord de toute nature, \u00e9crit ou oral, par lequel une bande ou un membre d\u2019une bande est cens\u00e9 permettre \u00e0 une personne, autre qu\u2019un membre de cette bande, d\u2019occuper ou utiliser une r\u00e9serve ou de r\u00e9sider ou autrement exercer des droits sur une r\u00e9serve.\n(2) Le ministre peut, au moyen d\u2019un permis par \u00e9crit, autoriser toute personne, pour une p\u00e9riode maximale d\u2019un an, ou, avec le consentement du conseil de la bande, pour toute p\u00e9riode plus longue, \u00e0 occuper ou utiliser une r\u00e9serve, ou \u00e0 r\u00e9sider ou autrement exercer des droits sur une r\u00e9serve.\n[32] L\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur les Indiens est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nLes terres des r\u00e9serves ne sont assujetties \u00e0 aucune saisie sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019un acte judiciaire.\n[33] Le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nLe ministre peut louer au profit de tout Indien, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, la terre dont ce dernier est en possession l\u00e9gitime sans que celle-ci soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9e.\n[34] Les paragraphes 89(1) et 89(1.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\n(1) Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les biens d\u2019un Indien ou d\u2019une bande situ\u00e9s sur une r\u00e9serve ne peuvent pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge, d\u2019un nantissement, d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que, d\u2019une opposition, d\u2019une r\u00e9quisition, d\u2019une saisie ou d\u2019une ex\u00e9cution en faveur ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une personne autre qu\u2019un Indien ou une bande.\n(1.1) Par d\u00e9rogation au paragraphe (1), les droits d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un bail sur une terre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge, d\u2019un nantissement, d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que, d\u2019une opposition, d\u2019une r\u00e9quisition, d\u2019une saisie ou d\u2019une ex\u00e9cution.\nIV. Les questions en litige A. Les plaignants se sont-ils acquitt\u00e9s de leur obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP?\nB. S\u2019il existe une preuve prima facie de discrimination, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est-il acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir que son refus initial d\u2019approuver le bail avait un motif justifiable?\nC. Si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie et qu\u2019aucun motif justifiable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9, quelles mesures de redressement conviendraient?\nV. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des observations des plaignants [35] Les plaignants soutiennent que le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui autorise le ministre \u00e0 louer au profit de tout Indien la terre qui est en la possession de ce dernier, pr\u00e9voit une exception au paragraphe 28(1). Le paragraphe 28(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens interdit \u00e0 un \u00ab membre d\u2019une bande \u00bb comme M. Louie de signer un bail ou tout autre accord susceptible de \u00ab permettre \u00e0 une personne, autre qu\u2019un membre de cette bande, d\u2019occuper ou utiliser une r\u00e9serve ou de r\u00e9sider ou autrement exercer des droits sur une r\u00e9serve \u00bb. Les plaignants font valoir que la location des terres priv\u00e9es des r\u00e9serves sur le fondement du paragraphe 58(3) \u00e9tant enti\u00e8rement soustraite au principe du paragraphe 28(1), la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019exclure des occupants, que ce soit \u00e0 titre de bailleur, de cobailleur ou de preneur \u00e0 bail, de toute participation \u00e0 un bail conclu sur le fondement du paragraphe 58(3), ne peut en aucun cas se justifier.\n[36] Aux termes de l\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur les Indiens, les terres des r\u00e9serves ne sont pas saisissables sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019un acte judiciaire, et aux termes du paragraphe 89(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, les Indiens ne peuvent assujettir leurs biens personnels sur une r\u00e9serve \u00e0 \u00ab un privil\u00e8ge, [\u2026] un nantissement, [\u2026] une hypoth\u00e8que, [\u2026] une opposition, [\u2026] une r\u00e9quisition, [\u2026] une saisie ou [\u2026] une ex\u00e9cution en faveur ou \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une personne autre qu\u2019un Indien ou une bande \u00bb. Les plaignants pr\u00e9tendent que ces dispositions ont pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher des occupants Indiens d\u2019effectuer des op\u00e9rations avec des non-Indiens qui seraient autrement \u00e9conomiquement avantageuses. Selon eux, le paragraphe 58(3) vise donc \u00e0 permettre aux propri\u00e9taires priv\u00e9s des terres des r\u00e9serves \u00e0 en augmenter la valeur marchande. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que la politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui exige que des occupants Indiens se constituent en personne morale et repr\u00e9sentent le preneur de bail au lieu de participer personnellement au bail, va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019objet du paragraphe. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9tant ni \u00ab un Indien ou une bande \u00bb au sens du paragraphe 89(1) et selon la d\u00e9finition du paragraphe 2(1), elles n\u2019ont pas la capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale d\u2019effectuer l\u2019op\u00e9ration de pr\u00eat ex\u00e9cutoire par bail sur la r\u00e9serve dont M. Louie avait besoin pour construire une maison sur la parcelle 175.\n[37] Les plaignants appuient leur interpr\u00e9tation sur Louie c. MAINC, qui porte sur des actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au cours du traitement de la demande de bail fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 58(3) qu\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e M. Louie pour la parcelle 170-1. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que le Tribunal a ni\u00e9 dans cette d\u00e9cision l\u2019existence d\u2019une obligation fiduciaire dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire par le ministre aux termes du paragraphe 58(3) et qu\u2019il a reconnu le droit des Indiens de d\u00e9cider en toute ind\u00e9pendance de tous leurs propres int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s et d\u2019agir en toute ind\u00e9pendance \u00e0 titre personnel en vue de leur r\u00e9alisation l\u00e9gitime, y compris en prenant \u00e0 bail des terres priv\u00e9es des r\u00e9serves.\n[38] Les plaignants all\u00e8guent qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9cider d\u2019une approbation de bail de titulaire d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel de fa\u00e7on paternaliste et discriminatoire. Son exigence que M. Louie se constitue en personne morale sous peine de lui refuser de traiter sa demande constitue un abus du pouvoir minist\u00e9riel pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3), et constitue une preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux plaignants, fond\u00e9e sur leur race ou leur origine raciale, nationale ou ethnique.\n[39] Les plaignants rejettent le motif justifiable de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Le caract\u00e8re fiduciaire de la relation entre l\u2019\u00c9tat et les Indiens ne justifie pas les lignes de conduite discriminatoires sur le plan de la race qu\u2019applique l\u2019administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour contr\u00f4ler tous les usages des terres des r\u00e9serves.\n[40] Les plaignants demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s sur le fondement des alin\u00e9as 53(2)c) et d) de la LCDP pour la perte de possibilit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques que chacun d\u2019eux a subie du fait du retard injustifi\u00e9 caus\u00e9 au pr\u00eat qu\u2019ils voulaient contracter et \u00e0 leurs projets de construire une maison neuve. Ils demandent cette indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du d\u00e9but du projet initial de bail, soit la date du 1er mars 2008, jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 ils ont abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir un bail aux termes du paragraphe 58(3), soit la date du 1er juin 2011.\n[41] Les plaignants demandent de plus une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $ chacun, au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP, pour les actes discriminatoires d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ils font valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait en permanence acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des avocats, et que ses d\u00e9cisions et ses actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 planifi\u00e9es et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9es et t\u00e9moignent d\u2019un m\u00e9pris inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019elles engendrent.\n[42] En cas de non-paiement de ces sommes dans les 30 jours suivant l\u2019ordonnance, les plaignants demandent le versement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\nVI. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [43] L\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que ni le statut d\u2019Indien de M. Louie, ni son appartenance \u00e0 la bande ne sont intervenus dans le traitement de sa demande de 2008. Il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019aux termes du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens, un bail ex\u00e9cutoire et contraignant doit cr\u00e9er un \u00ab droit de tenure \u00e0 bail \u00bb, et que par cons\u00e9quent, il cherchait uniquement \u00e0 respecter les responsabilit\u00e9s que lui impose la loi.\n[44] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination contre Mme Beattie, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que celle-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il l\u2019avait priv\u00e9e d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, ni que, de toute fa\u00e7on, le refus de la demande de bail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur son statut d\u2019Indienne. Le refus de la proposition de 2008 que Mme Beattie soit la preneuse \u00e0 bail n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur un motif discriminatoire, mais sur le fait que la cession ne cr\u00e9e pas de \u00ab droit de tenure \u00e0 bail \u00bb reconnu par la Loi sur les Indiens. L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que la demande de bail qu\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e M. Louie ne pr\u00e9cisait pas que Mme Beattie \u00e9tait la preneuse \u00e0 bail propos\u00e9e et, \u00e0 aucun moment, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a demand\u00e9 si celle-ci avait le statut d\u2019Indienne.\n[45] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019aucun des plaignants n\u2019ayant \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il ou elle a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable, fond\u00e9 sur un motif illicite de discrimination et r\u00e9sultant de la position initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la demande de bail, il ou elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, ainsi que le d\u00e9taille l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au paragraphe 33. Les \u00e9ventuelles r\u00e9percussions de la position initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur les activit\u00e9s ou les intentions commerciales des plaignants ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique de ces derniers.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, si le Tribunal conclut que les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il dispose du motif justifiable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celle-ci.\n[47] Le caract\u00e8re unique des terres des r\u00e9serves, \u00ab les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens \u00bb, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 constitutionnelle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 91(24) de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, restreint l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des normes environnementales et de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publiques, \u00e9tablies par des r\u00e9gimes de r\u00e9glementation provinciaux et municipaux. Les tribunaux ont reconnu que la possession de terres sur une r\u00e9serve rel\u00e8ve \u00ab de l'essence m\u00eame de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale exclusive que conf\u00e8re le par. 91(24) \u00bb : Derrickson c. Derrickson, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 285, au paragraphe 41, et que toute disposition l\u00e9gale provinciale ou municipale visant \u00e0 r\u00e9glementer l\u2019usage de ces terres empi\u00e8terait sur la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du l\u00e9gislateur : Surrey (District) v. Peace Arch Enterprises Ltd., (1970) 74 W.W.R. 380 (BCCA), \u00e0 la page 383.\n[48] N\u00e9anmoins, quand l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite des demandes de bail pour des terres appartenant \u00e0 des titulaires d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat individuel, il est li\u00e9 par plusieurs responsabilit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant de la Loi sur les Indiens et d\u2019autres textes l\u00e9gislatifs, dont la Loi canadienne sur l'\u00e9valuation environnementale. Il a \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard la t\u00e2che difficile d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer les int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents, dont ceux de l\u2019\u00c9tat, de la population, de la bande et du demandeur : Tsartlip, aux paragraphes 41 et 47. Les bandes ont certes le pouvoir de prendre des r\u00e8glements administratifs en application de l\u2019article 81 de la Loi sur les Indiens, y compris des r\u00e8glements touchant la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, mais en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Bande n\u2019a pris aucun r\u00e8glement de ce genre. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019intim\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 de bailleur, et la Bande disposent de moyens limit\u00e9s pour demander r\u00e9paration ou intervenir, si l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des plaignants, en qualit\u00e9 de preneur \u00e0 bail, enfreint la loi, manifeste de l\u2019inconduite ou des incommodit\u00e9s ou construit un b\u00e2timent non s\u00e9curitaire.\n[49] C\u2019est pour pallier cette lacune de la r\u00e9glementation que l\u2019intim\u00e9 examine les conditions du bail pouvant s\u2019av\u00e9rer n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir des normes et r\u00e9glementer l\u2019usage propos\u00e9 des terres. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce toutefois, M. Louie a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que les conditions du bail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9gociables. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les plaignants doivent faire leur part dans le processus d\u2019accommodement conform\u00e9ment aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qu\u2019ils ont l\u2019obligation de faciliter la recherche de l\u2019accommodement : Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, au paragraphe 43 (Renaud). L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. Louie ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de cette obligation et que, si la demande de bail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e, il aurait conclu un bail sans protection convenable pour l\u2019\u00c9tat, la Bande et la population. Ceci aurait constitu\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[50] Au sujet des mesures de redressement que demandent les plaignants, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019aux termes des alin\u00e9as 53c) et d) de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour indemniser les pr\u00e9judices financiers tels que la perte de l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un pr\u00eat \u00e0 la construction et de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Ces deux alin\u00e9as pr\u00e9voient que le Tribunal peut indemniser des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte discriminatoire (53c)) ainsi que des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte (53d)). L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, selon les principes de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour accorder une indemnit\u00e9 se limite \u00e0 ces alin\u00e9as, et ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00ab le pouvoir distinct d\u2019accorder des d\u00e9pens pour tous les types de plaintes \u00bb : Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CSC 53, aux paragraphes 37, 38 et 41. C\u2019est pourquoi, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition explicite autorisant le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser les pr\u00e9judices financiers, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder ce que demandent les plaignants.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient de plus que, si le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il a comp\u00e9tence pour accorder les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es, les plaignants ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9s du fardeau de preuve requis pour une demande de pr\u00e9judice financier. Ils n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve documentaire exposant les conditions du pr\u00e9tendu pr\u00eat \u00e0 la construction, le taux de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du pr\u00eat ou pr\u00e9cisant si l\u2019argent pour le pr\u00eat \u00e9tait disponible et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019usage qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l\u2019intervalle. Il fait valoir en outre que puisque l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le pr\u00eat est ce que M. Beattie aurait pay\u00e9 et non re\u00e7u, il est difficile de comprendre comment cela constitue un pr\u00e9judice. Quant \u00e0 la demande de Mme Beattie, elle non plus n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve documentaire \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en possession de l\u2019argent pour le pr\u00eat, que les parties s\u2019\u00e9taient entendues et si elle avait de quelque fa\u00e7on limit\u00e9 la perte d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le pr\u00e9tendu pr\u00eat.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient enfin que les plaignants n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur demande d\u2019indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP, et que les faits n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas leur demande d\u2019indemnisation fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pour les actes d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s qu\u2019il aurait commis. Les tribunaux ont conclu que cette indemnisation peut uniquement \u00eatre accord\u00e9e si les actions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019intentionnellement discriminatoires ou d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de prudence : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Collins, 2011 CF 1168 (infirm\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres motifs 2013 CAF 105). M\u00eame si les lignes de conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui \u00e9taient en vigueur lors de ces demandes \u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre erron\u00e9es, rien ne laisse entendre qu\u2019elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre de mauvaise foi ou dans l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers les plaignants.\nVII. L\u2019analyse Les plaignants se sont-ils acquitt\u00e9s de leur obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, fond\u00e9e sur la race ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP ?\n[53] La LCDP est une loi quasi-constitutionnelle, adopt\u00e9e pour donner effet \u00e0 la valeur canadienne fondamentale qu\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. Son objet, que d\u00e9finit l\u2019article 2, est de garantir le droit de tous les individus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es notamment sur la race et l\u2019origine ethnique. La Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises qu\u2019il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les lois sur les droits de la personne d\u2019une mani\u00e8re large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qui soit compatible avec la r\u00e9alisation de son objet qui est d\u2019apporter une solution de droit. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019analyse grammaticale stricte peut se trouver subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 cet objet afin de le renforcer plut\u00f4t que de le diminuer. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations, 2012 CF 445 (SSEFPN); Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] A.C.S. no 42 (Action Travail).\n[54] Il incombe au plaignant qui all\u00e8gue une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Il faut \u00e0 cette fin g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9tablir ce qui suit selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\n(a) l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournissait des \u00ab services destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5;\n(b) l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soit priv\u00e9 le plaignant du service ou l\u2019a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de sa fourniture;\n(c) le refus ou le traitement d\u00e9favorable a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 totalement ou partiellement sur un motif de distinction illicite, ou a eu des effets disproportionnellement pr\u00e9judiciables sur les personnes vis\u00e9es par un tel motif.\n[55] Le crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination est peu exigeant. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le plaignant qui a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration en l\u2019absence de toute autre justification de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9. SSEFPN, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\n[56] La LCDP ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019expression \u00ab services destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb. Cependant, selon la jurisprudence, le terme \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 d\u00e9signe en quelque sorte une prestation procur\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de service \u00e0 la population, dans le contexte de rapports publics. Toutefois, toujours selon la jurisprudence, pour \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5, les services n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019ensemble de la population. Il suffit qu\u2019un segment de la population soit en mesure de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, [2008] A.C.F. no 710; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin, [1991] 1 C.F. 391.\n[57] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les services fournis par l\u2019administration f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires et offerts dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, sinon ils ne seraient pas fournis. Le service tel que le traitement de la demande de bail minist\u00e9riel au sens du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce par M. Louie repr\u00e9sente un travail n\u00e9cessaire ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par des fonctionnaires, au nom de la population et dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire du demandeur). Si finalement la demande est approuv\u00e9e, certains avantages iront au demandeur, par exemple conclure le bail afin d\u2019obtenir du financement et de permettre qu\u2019il y ait mise en valeur et activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique. Les Canadiens qui ne vivent pas dans des r\u00e9serves n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 subir un processus dans lequel des terres dont ils ont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou le contr\u00f4le ne peuvent \u00eatre donn\u00e9es \u00e0 bail ou hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9es sans que des ministres f\u00e9d\u00e9raux doivent \u00e0 ces fins donner les terres \u00e0 bail pour eux \u00e0 des preneurs \u00e0 bail ou \u00e0 des cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires.\n[58] Dans Louie et Beattie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 2, le membre instructeur Craig du Tribunal \u00e9tait saisi du m\u00eame type de demande de bail, pour essentiellement les m\u00eames fins et avec les m\u00eames parties qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour la parcelle adjacente pour laquelle M. Louie d\u00e9tenait aussi le certificat de possession. Aux paragraphes 44 \u00e0 50 des parties IV et V de sa d\u00e9cision, il a analys\u00e9 les questions de savoir si le MAINC a fourni des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et quelle est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation correcte du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Je partage et je fais miens aux fins de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce les motifs qu\u2019il a expos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces deux questions. Je souscris \u00e9galement \u00e0 ses commentaires aux paragraphes 54, 55, 57, 58 et 59 dans lesquels il a comment\u00e9 la m\u00eame lettre de Chuck Strahl, qui \u00e9tait alors ministre, dat\u00e9e du 15 mai 2008 et pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e au paragraphe 16. Il est donc utile de reproduire ci-apr\u00e8s les paragraphes susmentionn\u00e9s de la d\u00e9cision du membre instructeur Craig :\n[44] Des extraits de deux d\u00e9cisions sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si toutes les actions gouvernementales sont des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[45] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, [2008] A.C.F. no 710 (C.A.), \u00e0 la page 9, la Cour a fait l\u2019observation suivante :\nSur ce point, je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que, comme les mesures du gouvernement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prises au profit du public, l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre \u00ab destin\u00e9es au public \u00bb est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires mettant en cause une discrimination attribuable \u00e0 des mesures prises par le gouvernement (voir, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions Rosin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 11, et Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission c. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services) , (1988), 52 D.L.R. (4th) 253, aux p. 266-268). Toutefois, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir lorsqu\u2019on applique l\u2019article 5 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s constituent des \u00ab services \u00bb (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le juge La Forest, au paragraphe 60).\n[46] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Rosin, 1 C.F. 391 (paragraphes 8 et 11), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019un service n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre offert \u00e0 tous les membres du grand public pour qu\u2019il soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb :\nPour qu\u2019un service ou une installation soit destin\u00e9 au public, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que tous les citoyens y aient acc\u00e8s. Il suffit qu\u2019un segment de la population soit en mesure de se pr\u00e9valoir du service ou de l\u2019installation. Le fait de prescrire que certaines exigences ou que certaines conditions soient remplies n\u2019\u00e9limine pas le caract\u00e8re public d\u2019une activit\u00e9. La jurisprudence a montr\u00e9 que le terme \u00ab public \u00bb signifie \u00ab qui n\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 \u00bb, ce qui laisse, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019activit\u00e9s hors de la port\u00e9e de la l\u00e9gislation.\nIl est difficile d\u2019imaginer un gouvernement ou un secteur du gouvernement qui pr\u00e9tendrait qu\u2019un service qu\u2019il offrait \u00e9tait un service priv\u00e9, non destin\u00e9 au public. En fait, il serait permis de dire que pratiquement tout ce que fait le gouvernement, il le fait pour le public, est destin\u00e9 au public, et le public peut s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir.\n[47] Le MAINC est un minist\u00e8re gouvernemental qui offre de nombreux services aux Indiens inscrits en vertu de la Loi. Dans son t\u00e9moignage au sujet de baux d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location en application du paragraphe 58(3), Mme Craig a appel\u00e9 les plaignants des \u00ab clients \u00bb et a expliqu\u00e9 les nombreuses fa\u00e7ons dont le MAINC interc\u00e8de pour les occupants lorsqu\u2019il prend des ententes de location avec des locataires possibles.\n[48] Le fait que le paragraphe 58(3) comprenne des dispositions quant \u00e0 la fourniture de services \u00e0 une certaine partie du public est reconnu par les Services fonciers et fiduciaires du MAINC, comme le prouve le courriel de Mme Davidson envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Louie le 24 septembre 2007 :\n[Traduction] Je peux vous garantir que les Services fonciers et fiduciaires sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 travailler avec vous dans le processus de bail. Nous fournissons un service aux Premi\u00e8res nations en Colombie\u2011Britannique et nous souhaitons plus que tout suivre le processus de fa\u00e7on collaborative et respectueuse.\n[49] Je conclus que le MAINC fournit des services qui sont \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les membres du public qui sont des Indiens inscrits, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de services importants qui sont \u00ab destin\u00e9s \u00bb et \u00ab offerts \u00bb au public.\n[50] Je suis convaincu que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a faite du paragraphe 58(3) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Boyer c. R. [1986] 2 C.F. 393, s\u2019applique aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n15 [\u2026] Ce droit que poss\u00e8de un membre de la bande sur la parcelle de terrain qui lui est attribu\u00e9e et qui se trouve en sa possession l\u00e9gitime, m\u00eame s\u2019il est, en principe, irr\u00e9vocable, demeure soumis \u00e0 un grand nombre de restrictions formelles. Le membre n\u2019a pas le droit de c\u00e9der son droit \u00e0 la possession ou de louer son terrain \u00e0 une personne qui n\u2019est pas membre (article 28) ; il ne peut non plus l\u2019hypoth\u00e9quer, puisque les terres en question ne sont assujetties \u00e0 aucune saisie sous le r\u00e9gime d\u2019un acte judiciaire (article 29); il peut \u00e9galement se voir forc\u00e9 d\u2019en disposer s\u2019il cesse d\u2019avoir droit de r\u00e9sider sur la r\u00e9serve (article 25). Il ne fait aucun doute que chacune de ces restrictions a pour effet de rendre le droit d\u2019un Indien en possession l\u00e9gitime tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire poss\u00e9dant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue selon la common law. Il doit cependant \u00eatre not\u00e9 que toutes ces restrictions n\u2019ont qu\u2019un seul but : emp\u00eacher que la fin poursuivie par la mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 du terrain, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019utilisation de celui-ci par la bande et ses membres, soit contrecarr\u00e9e. Aucune de ces restrictions ne concerne l\u2019usage pouvant \u00eatre fait du terrain ou le profit pouvant en \u00eatre tir\u00e9. Le terrain faisant partie de la r\u00e9serve, son usage est, naturellement, toujours assujetti aux lois provinciales d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et aux r\u00e8glements de zonage \u00e9dict\u00e9s par le conseil de bande, comme c\u2019est le cas pour tout terrain situ\u00e9 dans une municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de laquelle des r\u00e8glements de zonage sont en vigueur; cependant, outre cela, je ne vois ni comment ni pourquoi l\u2019Indien en possession l\u00e9gitime d\u2019un terrain situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une r\u00e9serve pourrait \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de l\u2019exploiter \u00e0 sa guise. Rien dans la Loi ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme [Traduction] \u00ab assujettissant \u00bb son droit \u00e0 un autre droit du m\u00eame type appartenant simultan\u00e9ment au conseil de bande. Selon moi, par l\u2019\"attribution\" d\u2019une parcelle de terrain faisant partie d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, le droit \u00e0 l\u2019usage de ce terrain et au profit qu\u2019il peut procurer, de collectif qu\u2019il \u00e9tait, devient le droit individuel et personnel du locataire. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la bande, entendu dans son sens technique et juridique, a disparu ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. [\u2026]\n17 [\u2026] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne crois tout simplement pas que la Couronne soit soumise \u00e0 des obligations de fiduciaire lorsqu\u2019elle exerce le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le paragraphe 58(3). Dans l\u2019affaire Guerin, il \u00e9tait question de terrains non attribu\u00e9s faisant partie d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, terrains qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la Couronne afin qu\u2019elle consente \u00e0 leur sujet un bail \u00e0 long terme ou vende ces terrains \u00e0 des conditions favorables \u00e0 la bande. Selon mon interpr\u00e9tation du jugement, c\u2019est \u00e0 cause de toutes ces circonstances qu\u2019il a pu \u00eatre dit qu\u2019une obligation de caract\u00e8re fiduciaire \u00e9tait n\u00e9e : en effet, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de la bande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 au Ministre lors de la cession des terrains et \u00e9tait en jeu au moment de leur ali\u00e9nation. Lorsqu\u2019un bail est consenti en vertu du paragraphe 58(3), les circonstances sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes : aucune ali\u00e9nation n\u2019est envisag\u00e9e et le droit qui sera transf\u00e9r\u00e9 temporairement est le droit \u00e0 l\u2019usage d\u2019un terrain, droit qui appartient individuellement \u00e0 l\u2019Indien qui en a possession [...]\n18 La conclusion me semble \u00e9vidente. Consid\u00e9rant la structure de la Loi sur les Indiens et la clart\u00e9 du libell\u00e9 de son paragraphe 58(3), il n\u2019existe aucun motif de croire que le Ministre est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir le consentement de la bande ou de son conseil avant de consentir un bail comme celui dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il semble que cette Loi, dont l\u2019esprit paternaliste a fait l\u2019objet de tant de critiques, ait n\u00e9anmoins jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019accorder \u00e0 chaque membre de la bande une certaine autonomie, et une ind\u00e9pendance relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des dicta de son conseil de bande dans l\u2019exercice de son esprit d\u2019entreprise et la mise en valeur de son terrain.\n[54] L\u2019attitude paternaliste du MAINC envers M. Louie a \u00e9t\u00e9 avalis\u00e9e et soutenue sans \u00e9quivoque par le ministre Chuck Strahl dans sa lettre \u00e0 M. Louie le 15 mai 2008. Le ministre a carr\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Louie ne pouvait pas dicter les modalit\u00e9s du bail d\u2019un titulaire d\u2019un billet de location qu\u2019il demandait, et il a soutenu qu\u2019[Traduction] \u00ab un rapport fiduciaire est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [\u2026] lorsque le Canada contracte des baux de certificats de possession. [\u2026] En vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir le loyer revient au Canada et ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, sauf par modification de la loi. Ce pouvoir s\u2019\u00e9tend au-del\u00e0 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du loyer et une d\u00e9charge ne modifiera pas le pouvoir unilat\u00e9ral du Canada d\u2019\u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s du bail, qui comprennent aussi, sans s\u2019y limiter, des dispositions quant \u00e0 l\u2019environnement. \u00bb [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[55] Le ministre avait tort. Il n\u2019existe aucune obligation fiduciaire dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3). De plus, l\u2019exercice unilat\u00e9ral du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ne serait pas judicieux et annulerait l\u2019objet du paragraphe 58(3), qui vise \u00e0 faciliter la location de terres par des propri\u00e9taires fonciers individuels indiens qui y voient un avantage (voir Boyer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[57] Le refus du MAINC d\u2019accepter le fait que M. Louie avait le droit de d\u00e9terminer les avantages dont il pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son association d\u2019affaires avec Mme Beattie a immobilis\u00e9 le processus de demande. En pratique, la demande des plaignants pour un bail minist\u00e9riel selon les modalit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils s\u2019\u00e9taient entendus a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le ministre dans sa lettre du 15 mai 2008 \u00e0 M. Louie. La lettre du ministre a exacerb\u00e9 le traitement discriminatoire dont le MAINC a fait preuve envers les plaignants.\n[58] Bien que la question n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans la preuve qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il convient de noter que le 18 juin 2008, un peu plus d\u2019un mois apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Louie, le ministre a annonc\u00e9 que la loi assurant la protection des droits de la personne \u00e0 toutes les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res nations avait re\u00e7u la sanction royale. \u00ab L\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u201121, Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personn, constitue un point tournant dans la relation entre les Premi\u00e8res nations et le gouvernement du Canada \u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le ministre Strahl. \u00ab Elle souligne l\u2019engagement solide pris par notre gouvernement en vue de prot\u00e9ger les droits de la personne pour tous les Canadiens. \u00bb Cependant, cette annonce n\u2019a apparemment pas eu d\u2019effet sur les demandes des plaignants. Rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9, et la plainte qui m\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en est le r\u00e9sultat.\n[59] Comme la Loi est maintenant assujettie \u00e0 la LCDP, je conclus que le processus de demande pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 58(3) doit devenir une fonction administrative habilitante qui reconna\u00eet et qui accepte que les Indiens inscrits (sauf ceux qui sont mineurs ou frapp\u00e9s d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 mentale) sont des Canadiens responsables qui sont capables d\u2019\u00e9valuer eux-m\u00eames les avantages qui d\u00e9couleraient de la location de leur terre et que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel ne doit pas \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on unilat\u00e9rale.\n[59] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP exige que les services destin\u00e9s au public soient fournis sans discrimination. Lorsqu'une disposition l\u00e9gale est, de par l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 de son libell\u00e9, susceptible de plus d'une interpr\u00e9tation, la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le minist\u00e8re charg\u00e9 de l\u2019administrer doit retenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui est la plus conforme aux principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4.\n[60] Pour qu\u2019une plainte soit jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e aux termes de la LCDP, il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9faut de fournir le service sans discrimination, soit par refus du service ou par traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, a eu des effets pr\u00e9judiciables ou n\u00e9gatifs sur des personnes.\n[61] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9, avant le 11 juillet 2011, \u00e9tait que M. Louie \u00e9tant l\u2019occupant, il ne pouvait prendre le bail, car celui-ci ne cr\u00e9erait aucun droit de tenure \u00e0 bail (m\u00eame si le bailleur \u00e9tait le ministre et non M. Louie) et que M. Louie devait former une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 afin de cr\u00e9er une personne juridique diff\u00e9rente. Selon cette interpr\u00e9tation initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il \u00e9tait de plus interdit \u00e0 Mme Beattie de prendre le bail (quand cette id\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e), m\u00eame si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019occupante, puisque l\u2019intention des plaignants \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle transf\u00e8re ensuite le bail \u00e0 M. Louie, op\u00e9ration qui selon l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, \u00e9tait identique \u00e0 un bail donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Louie et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inacceptable. Cette interpr\u00e9tation initiale ne d\u00e9coulait pas du libell\u00e9 de la loi elle-m\u00eame, mais de l\u2019exercice par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir une interpr\u00e9tation pendant le traitement, aux termes de la Loi sur les Indiens, de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sens du paragraphe 58(3). L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ainsi jug\u00e9 que tant M. Louie que Mme Beattie ne pouvaient prendre le bail pour la parcelle 175 en vue de permettre une op\u00e9ration de financement et de construction, pour des motifs qui ne sont ni pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 58(3), ni \u00e9tay\u00e9s par une interpr\u00e9tation de ce paragraphe qui co\u00efncide avec les principes des droits de la personne qu\u2019il y aurait lieu d\u2019invoquer dans des interpr\u00e9tations, selon la jurisprudence, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 renforcer plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 diminuer la loi.\n[62] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation initiale erron\u00e9e de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qu\u2019il a infirm\u00e9e le 11 juillet 2011, a eu des effets pr\u00e9judiciables pour M. Louie et pour Mme Beattie, en ce qu\u2019ils ont perdu des occasions de mise en valeur et de financement d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence sur une parcelle. Je pense qu\u2019elle a de surcro\u00eet rabaiss\u00e9 la dignit\u00e9 de ces deux Indiens d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019arriverait jamais \u00e0 des non-Indiens hors r\u00e9serve qui voudraient s\u2019occuper de leurs terres de la fa\u00e7on propos\u00e9e par les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[63] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP exige que les services destin\u00e9s au public soient fournis sans discrimination. Dans son interpr\u00e9tation initiale et son refus de la demande de M. Louie, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a employ\u00e9 une m\u00e9thode restrictive, \u00e9troite et formaliste plut\u00f4t que la m\u00e9thode large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique que pr\u00e9conisent les tribunaux dans les affaires portant sur les droits de la personne. Son refus, qui a dur\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es et qui se fondait sur une interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e de la loi, constitue un refus de service \u00e0 des Indiens inscrits au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a), fond\u00e9 sur leur race et sur leur origine nationale ou ethnique, ainsi qu\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la fourniture d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) si l\u2019on compare le traitement de ces deux Indiens inscrits \u00e0 celui des non-Indiens hors r\u00e9serve.\n[64] Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que les plaignants se sont acquitt\u00e9s de leur obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est-il acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation d\u2019\u00e9tablir que son refus initial d\u2019approuver le bail avait un motif justifiable ?\n[65] Dans les cas o\u00f9 le plaignant \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, le fardeau de la preuve est transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui doit r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie en d\u00e9montrant que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ne se sont pas pass\u00e9s comme on le pr\u00e9tend, ou bien que ses actes avaient un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) ou du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP.\n[66] Il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur le motif justifiable au sens de la LCDP au regard de la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, selon laquelle il sera \u00e9tabli uniquement dans les cas o\u00f9, notamment, la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb, en ce sens que s\u2019en \u00e9carter aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive. Colombie-Britannique (Superintendant of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), (1999) 3 R.C.S. 868.\n[67] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en vertu de sa lettre du 11 juillet 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 modifi\u00e9 sa m\u00e9thode et autoris\u00e9 les demandes de bail minist\u00e9riel fond\u00e9es sur le paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens dans les cas o\u00f9 le preneur \u00e0 bail est l\u2019occupant. Ceci constitue en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 l\u2019admission que sa m\u00e9thode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb au sens de la jurisprudence applicable, et qu\u2019il n\u2019existait donc pas de motif justifiable au sens de la LCDP et de la jurisprudence applicable.\n[68] L\u2019intim\u00e9 continue toutefois de maintenir sa position selon laquelle il ne peut conclure un bail sauf s\u2019il obtient du preneur (qui, dit-il, peut \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent \u00eatre occupant) des conditions qui pallient la \u00ab lacune dans la r\u00e9glementation \u00bb qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e aux paragraphes 47,48 et 49 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cette position perp\u00e9tue \u00e0 mon avis une application paternaliste et discriminatoire du paragraphe 58(3) de la Loi sur les Indiens qui n\u2019est pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire et n\u2019a pas de motif justifiable. Dans le reste du Canada, hors r\u00e9serve, les r\u00e8glements n\u00e9cessaires en mati\u00e8re de construction, d\u2019am\u00e9nagement du territoire et d\u2019environnement tels que ceux dont il est question dans les paragraphes susmentionn\u00e9s ne sont pas appliqu\u00e9s par des baux publics qui s\u2019adressent uniquement aux personnes ayant besoin des baux pour garantir du financement, mais pas \u00e0 celles ayant l\u2019argent pour construire ou mettre en valeur sans avoir besoin d\u2019obtenir de financement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit, plut\u00f4t que de se servir du paragraphe 58(3) pour r\u00e9soudre la \u00ab lacune dans la r\u00e9glementation \u00bb gr\u00e2ce aux conditions de baux minist\u00e9riels conclus dans les r\u00e9serves, pr\u00e9senter une autre m\u00e9thode qui \u00e9tablisse un r\u00e9gime exhaustif et global d\u2019interdiction des constructions non conformes \u00e0 des exigences en mati\u00e8re de construction, de zonage et d\u2019environnement qui s\u2019appliquent dans tous les cas, qu\u2019il faille ou non financer la mise en valeur et que des baux minist\u00e9riels soient demand\u00e9s par la suite ou non.\nVIII. La d\u00e9cision [69] Pour ces motifs, je juge fond\u00e9e la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nIX. Les mesures de redressement [70] Les dispositions suivantes relatives aux mesures de redressement figurent aux paragraphes 53(2) et (3) de la LCDP :\nPlainte jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e\n53. (2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17;\nb) d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\nd) d\u2019indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires occasionn\u00e9s par le recours \u00e0 d\u2019autres biens, services, installations ou moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement, et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte;\ne) d\u2019indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\nIndemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[71] Les plaignants demandent des mesures de redressement, notamment pour les pertes financi\u00e8res de la valeur du pr\u00eat \u00e0 la construction que Mme Beattie aurait consenti, affirment-ils, \u00e0 M. Louie en 2008 pour financer la construction de la maison, ainsi que pour la perte de l\u2019occasion du pr\u00eat \u00e0 M. Louie et la perte de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Beattie. Le pr\u00eat bien s\u00fbr n\u2019a jamais eu lieu, et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment tangible sur les d\u00e9tails et la documentation de celui\u2011ci n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je retiens les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux paragraphes 50 et 51 ci-dessus au sujet de cette demande de redressement, parce que rien ne prouve qu\u2019il y ait r\u00e9ellement eu perte et que le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP ne me donne pas comp\u00e9tence pour autoriser un tel redressement.\n[72] Les plaignants ont droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP, car je pense, en fonction de la preuve dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, que lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 les demandes de bail minist\u00e9riel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les plaignants, il a agi en parfaite connaissance des cons\u00e9quences et des incidences de ses actes pour les plaignants au moment de son refus et du maintien de son interpr\u00e9tation et de sa position. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019a retenue ult\u00e9rieurement l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre claire pour lui d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, dans l\u2019esprit du raisonnement t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique et large qui devrait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 dans des interpr\u00e9tations de cette nature en de telles circonstances. Je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que les actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s et rel\u00e8vent du paragraphe 53(3).\nX. L\u2019ordonnance [73] Le Tribunal ordonne donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9 verse \u00e0 chaque plaignant, dans le mois qui suit la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la somme de 5 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Le plaignant a soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience m\u00e9dicale, soit la douleur chronique, qui \u00e9tait exacerb\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il travaillait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a fait valoir que son cong\u00e9diement contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. La preuve et les observations du plaignant montraient implicitement qu\u2019il y avait eu violation de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est une petite entreprise de camionnage qui op\u00e8re \u00e0 Saskatoon (Saskatchewan) et, tout au long de l\u2019instance, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident et principal actionnaire de l\u2019entreprise, Brian Slobodian.\n[4] Le plaignant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et il \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 au lieu de travail de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019op\u00e9rateur de chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur. On lui demandait aussi d\u2019effectuer du levage manuel.\n[5] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait souffert de douleur aig\u00fce au bas du dos le 18 avril 2011 en raison des mouvements brusques et des secousses qu\u2019il subissait lorsqu\u2019il op\u00e9rait le monte-charge dans le cadre de son emploi chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le plaignant a aussi ressenti de vives douleurs au dos le 21 avril 2011 et le 29 avril 2011 et il en a avis\u00e9 son superviseur, John Simpson. Le plaignant a pris cong\u00e9 ces jours-l\u00e0. La douleur au dos a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une discopathie d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative par le conseiller m\u00e9dical de la Worker\u2019s Compensation Board (la WCB) (commission des accidents de travail). La preuve a montr\u00e9 que le superviseur, John Simpson, n\u2019a pas avis\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Brian Slobodian, des absences du plaignant aux dates susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[6] Le 2 mai 2011, le plaignant a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur, John Simpson, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance d\u2019entra\u00eenement de baseball de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il avait vu son m\u00e9decin pendant la fin de semaine et que ce dernier lui avait conseill\u00e9 de prendre cong\u00e9. Le superviseur du plaignant l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019indemnisation pour accident du travail.\n[7] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, plus tard le m\u00eame jour, il avait re\u00e7u un appel de Brian Slobodian l\u2019avisant que, s\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la WCB, il \u00e9tait un [Traduction] \u00ab trou de cul \u00bb, et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pendant l\u2019appel, M. Slobodian l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Le plaignant a soutenu que Brian Slobodian avait aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si le plaignant se pr\u00e9sentait sur le terrain de l\u2019employeur, il serait accus\u00e9 d\u2019intrusion.\n[8] Le plaignant a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa m\u00e8re, avec qui il habite actuellement, avait \u00e9cout\u00e9 la conversation sur un autre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. La m\u00e8re du plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant au sujet de sa conversation avec M. Slobodian.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contredit la preuve au sujet du cong\u00e9diement, de la remarque d\u00e9sobligeante ou du commentaire au sujet du fait que le plaignant serait accus\u00e9 d\u2019intrusion. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a expliqu\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9 par les actions du plaignant, puisque celui-ci avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une pratique de baseball de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 le 30 avril 2011, mais qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de travailler le 2 mai 2011. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais contest\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation du plaignant selon laquelle il souffrait d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ou d\u2019une blessure. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ait pas contredit le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant au sujet de la conversation du 2 mai 2011, le pr\u00e9sident a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au plaignant \u00e0 son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire et non \u00e0 son num\u00e9ro \u00e0 la maison. Par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait donc impossible que la m\u00e8re du plaignant ait \u00e9cout\u00e9 la conversation.\n[10] Le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019indemnisation \u00e0 la WCB conform\u00e9ment aux lois de la Saskatchewan et, dans la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a rendue, la WCB a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder l\u2019indemnisation parce qu\u2019il a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. En appel, lors duquel la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9examin\u00e9e, le plaignant a eu gain de cause et a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de 5 421,90 $, \u00e0 partir de la date de cong\u00e9diement jusqu\u2019au 15 juillet 2011, date \u00e0 laquelle, selon les conclusions de la WCB, le plaignant \u00e9tait en mesure de retourner au travail.\n[11] Le plaignant n\u2019a jamais repris le travail pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e et il a finalement trouv\u00e9 un autre emploi pour un autre employeur, qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9 du 21 ao\u00fbt 2011 au 31 ao\u00fbt 2011. Le plaignant a quitt\u00e9 ce poste pour en occuper un autre, \u00e0 partir du 4 septembre 2011. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pour des raisons personnelles qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9es, et qu\u2019on ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 de divulguer, il a volontairement quitt\u00e9 le troisi\u00e8me poste apr\u00e8s moins d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Il n\u2019a jamais soutenu qu\u2019il avait quitt\u00e9 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre poste qu\u2019il avait obtenu apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en raison de probl\u00e8mes physiques ou m\u00e9dicaux.\n[12] Quant \u00e0 la question du d\u00e9dommagement pour la perte de revenus qu\u2019il avait subie en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9, le plaignant \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il devait recevoir un paiement pour la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant le jour o\u00f9 ses prestations de la WCB se sont termin\u00e9es, soit le 15 juillet 2011, auquel moment il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 apte au travail, et se terminant apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part de ses deux autres emplois, le 31 octobre 2011, soit la date \u00e0 laquelle son emploi pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pris fin de toute fa\u00e7on : le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qu\u2019un lieu de travail secondaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 le 31 octobre 2011 et que les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Le plaignant aurait lui aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment. Le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019entendent sur le fait que le lieu de travail secondaire est maintenant ferm\u00e9 et que l\u2019emploi du plaignant aurait pris fin \u00e0 ce moment, si les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 2 mai n\u2019avaient pas eu lieu.\n[13] Ni le plaignant, ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ont expos\u00e9 clairement le calcul pr\u00e9cis de la perte de salaire applicable au plaignant qui d\u00e9coulait des actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Les parties se sont entendues sur le fait que la paye finale du plaignant aurait suivi un taux horaire de 17,50 $. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la blessure ou la d\u00e9ficience et elle n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de questions au sujet de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation des pertes du plaignant jusqu\u2019au 21 ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[14] La question de la d\u00e9ficience est un crit\u00e8re essentiel auquel le plaignant doit satisfaire. De plus, afin d\u2019obtenir gain de cause en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Dans Chaudhary c. Smoother Movers, 2013 TCDP 15 (CanLII), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 33 :\n(33) Dans une affaire soumise au Tribunal, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie \u00ab [\u2026] est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur [du plaignant], en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de [l\u2019] intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, (1985) CanLII 18 (CSC), [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28).\n(35) Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Dans les plaintes relevant de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a), le plaignant est tenu d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre un motif de distinction illicite et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur de refuser de l\u2019employer ou de continuer de l\u2019employer (voir Roopnarine c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 TCDP 5 (CanLII), 2010 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 49). Cela dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la distinction soit le seul motif de la d\u00e9cision; il suffit qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un seul des facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision (voir Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 419 (C.A.F.) (QL), et Khiamal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495 (CanLII), 2009 CF 495, au paragraphe 61)\n[15] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le motif de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est la d\u00e9ficience. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la question de ce que constitue une d\u00e9ficience dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Desormeaux c. Ottawa (Ville), 2005 CAF 311, au paragraphe 15, o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nAinsi que l\u2019expliquait la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Granovsky c. Canada, 2000 CSC 28 (CanLII), [2000] 1 R.C.S. 703, au paragraphe 34, et dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Ville de Montr\u00e9al, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 71, la d\u00e9ficience au sens juridique consiste en un handicap physique ou mental, qui occasionne une limitation fonctionnelle ou qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la perception d\u2019un handicap.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour avoir gain de cause, le plaignant doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie : (1) qu\u2019il avait une d\u00e9ficience et (2) que sa d\u00e9ficience a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP.\n[17] La preuve confirme que le plaignant a satisfait aux deux crit\u00e8res : il avait une d\u00e9ficience et son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait fond\u00e9, du moins en partie, sur sa d\u00e9ficience. En raison de la blessure au dos du plaignant, son m\u00e9decin lui a conseill\u00e9 de prendre cong\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019il a fait part de ce conseil \u00e0 son superviseur, ce dernier lui a dit qu\u2019il devait remplir un formulaire de la WCB. Lorsque M. Slobodian a appris qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir une demande aupr\u00e8s de la WCB, il a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant. Par cons\u00e9quent, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant, il n\u2019aurait pas perdu son emploi.\n[18] Une fois qu\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019acte contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9. Au paragraphe 52 de la d\u00e9cision Chaudhary c. Smoother Movers (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nUne fois qu\u2019un plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination prima facie en question n\u2019a pas eu lieu de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou que l\u2019acte est justifiable selon la Loi (voir les paragraphes 15 \u00e0 24 de la Loi).\n[19] La seule explication possible que je puisse relever de la preuve et des arguments de M. Slobodian est que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 non pas en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, mais en raison d\u2019une all\u00e9gation fabriqu\u00e9e de d\u00e9ficience, compte tenu du fait que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de participer \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance d\u2019entra\u00eenement de baseball. Cependant, compte tenu de toute la preuve, cette explication ne peut pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e. La preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi \u00e9tait claire : l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait d\u00fb savoir que le plaignant avait une d\u00e9ficience, parce que ce dernier en avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur. De plus, peu importe ce que M. Simpson a pu faire des renseignements que le plaignant lui avait donn\u00e9s, le pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Brian Slobodian, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment reconnu pendant sa conversation avec le plaignant le 2 mai que le plaignant \u00e9tait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Comme je n\u2019ai relev\u00e9 aucune explication raisonnable permettant de r\u00e9futer la preuve prima facie, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience de ce dernier et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nLes mesures de redressement\n[20] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, non seulement jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a accept\u00e9 un autre emploi le 21 ao\u00fbt 2011, qui s\u2019est termin\u00e9 le 31 ao\u00fbt 2011, mais aussi jusqu\u2019apr\u00e8s le troisi\u00e8me emploi qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9 le 4 septembre 2011, qui a dur\u00e9 moins d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 une indemnisation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019entrep\u00f4t de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a ferm\u00e9, le 31 octobre 2011, auquel moment le plaignant a reconnu qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied de fa\u00e7on permanente.\n[21] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, le plaignant peut \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour toute perte de salaire d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019acte discriminatoire. La perte de salaire du plaignant est le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019acte discriminatoire, soit le cong\u00e9diement, et je conclus par cons\u00e9quent que le plaignant a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\n[22] La preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal \u00e9tait mauvaise et inad\u00e9quate. Cependant, les parties se sont entendues sur le fait que le taux horaire du poste du plaignant \u00e9tait de 17,50 $, et la preuve a montr\u00e9 que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, le 15 juillet 2011, par la WCB. Le nouvel emploi que le plaignant a accept\u00e9 a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 21 ao\u00fbt 2011.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve et les observations, je conclus que le plaignant devrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode allant jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 il a commenc\u00e9 son nouvel emploi, le 21 ao\u00fbt 2011. Il serait d\u00e9raisonnable d\u2019exiger que l\u2019intim\u00e9e rembourse le plaignant pour la perte de salaire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e d\u00e9coulant du choix du plaignant de ne pas travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019\u00e9tablis le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire en fonction de cinq semaines, du 18 juillet 2011 au 21 ao\u00fbt 2011, soit 200 heures au taux horaire de 17,50 $, ce qui donne un total de 3 500 $.\n[24] Le plaignant a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. La preuve a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui \u00e9tait au fait de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant, a agi d\u2019une fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e en ne tenant pas compte de l\u2019\u00e9tat physique du plaignant. Cette demande est accueillie. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les circonstances, y compris le fait que les commentaires d\u00e9sobligeants et le cong\u00e9diement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en priv\u00e9 (\u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019intim\u00e9e), je conclus qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 1 000 $ au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi est appropri\u00e9e.\n[25] Je conserve ma comp\u00e9tence au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne s\u2019entendraient pas sur les montants ou l\u2019application des mesures de redressement ordonn\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nOrdonnance\n[26] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ordonne :\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 3 500 $;\nConform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 de 1 000 $.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

Gupta, Mme Zagorska, avocate pour le SATJ et TPSGC, David Langtry, pr\u00e9sident de la CCDP, Jodie van Dieen, directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et avocate principale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et l\u2019honorable Mike Wallace, d\u00e9put\u00e9 de Burlington et pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 gouvernemental sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] Le Tribunal a aussi re\u00e7u une lettre de la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Anne Marsden, envoy\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur le 6 mars 2014 \u00e0 9 h 32, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin traitant.\n[3] Dans les deux lettres, la plaignante explique qu\u2019elle abandonne les plaintes dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi.\n[4] Le Tribunal r\u00e9pondra aux lettres dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\n[5] La plaignante d\u00e9clare :\n[traduction] La promesse du Tribunal de tenir une instruction rapide donnant pleinement \u00e0 la plaignante l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00eatre entendue, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du pr\u00e9sident de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne David Langtry, a \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment et cat\u00e9goriquement bris\u00e9e.\n[6] Elle d\u00e9clare aussi :\n[traduction] Les cons\u00e9quences connues de la d\u00e9cision \u00e9vidente et intentionnelle du Tribunal de constamment priver la plaignante de son plein droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendue sur la sant\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 de vie de la plaignante ne lui laissent d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019abandonner ses plaintes.\n[7] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que le dossier de l\u2019instance n\u2019appuie pas les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante selon lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de la pleine occasion d\u2019\u00eatre entendue par le Tribunal.\n[8] Au contraire, le Tribunal note que la plaignante a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 ou a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux tentatives du Tribunal de pr\u00e9voir une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance qui devait avoir lieu \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2013 et qui visait en particulier \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les dates d\u2019audience.\n[9] De plus, des dates d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues pour mars 2014 et une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue pour le 7 mars 2014 afin de discuter des param\u00e8tres de la poursuite de l\u2019instruction des plaintes. Cependant, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019abandonner ses plaintes pour les raisons mentionn\u00e9es dans ses lettres.\n[10] Le Tribunal note aussi que, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 21 novembre 2011 envoy\u00e9e au greffe du Tribunal, le m\u00e9decin traitant de la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab Depuis 2010, je conseille [\u00e0 la plaignante] d\u2019abandonner son r\u00f4le de d\u00e9fenseur des int\u00e9r\u00eats, car cela est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour sa sant\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[11] En d\u00e9pit des conseils de son m\u00e9decin, la plaignante a choisi de poursuivre ses plaintes devant le Tribunal \u2013 c\u2019est l\u00e0 son droit \u2013 mais elle a alors mis sa propre sant\u00e9 en jeu. Bien que le Tribunal ait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 tous les efforts possibles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, il ne peut pas \u00eatre tenu responsable d\u2019une situation m\u00e9dicale qui d\u00e9coule de la d\u00e9cision de la plaignante de poursuivre ses plaintes.\n[12] De plus, au cours des derni\u00e8res semaines, le Tribunal a remarqu\u00e9 l\u2019envoi de nombreux courriels dont le ton \u00e9tait agressif, abusif et mensonger \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s du Tribunal et au membre instructeur, y compris au pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim. De nombreux messages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s directement \u00e0 des membres du Tribunal, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00eatre envoy\u00e9s au bureau du Greffe pour qu\u2019ils soient ensuite transmis aux personnes vis\u00e9es (malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses directives et les nombreux rappels envoy\u00e9s). Ces communications abusives ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019envoi d\u2019un courriel le 5 mars 2014, dans lequel la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne de lancer une enqu\u00eate de la GRC au sujet d\u2019un comportement qu\u2019elle jugeait criminel et qui aurait eu lieu pendant l\u2019instruction, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire [traduction] \u00ab entrave \u00e0 la justice, agression, assertion inexacte de faits \u00bb.\n[13] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que les nombreuses all\u00e9gations exag\u00e9r\u00e9es dans ces courriels ne sont pas fond\u00e9es et il note qu\u2019elles illustrent bien l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de la plaignante de se repr\u00e9senter de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate.\n[14] Il convient de noter que, pendant la majorit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction, la plaignante semblait \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son conjoint, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9signait sous le titre de [traduction] \u00ab soutien personnel \u00bb. Une grande partie des communications abusives en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es par le conjoint de la plaignante, au nom de celle-ci. Cela dit, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9tabli, plusieurs fois dans le cadre de communications directes avec la plaignante, que son soutien personnel avait le plein pouvoir de pr\u00e9senter des observations pour son compte et que la plaignante en avait pleinement connaissance et qu\u2019elle y consentait.\n[15] Le Tribunal r\u00e9p\u00e8te le fait qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations envers la plaignante pr\u00e9vues par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il est enti\u00e8rement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de tous les participants \u00e0 une audience et, en effet, il est rest\u00e9 engag\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la plaignante, malgr\u00e9 le comportement vexatoire de celle-ci. N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019attitude n\u00e9gative et agressive de la plaignante, l\u2019instruction de ses plaintes aurait pu avoir lieu en mars 2014 ou m\u00eame plus t\u00f4t, si elle avait fait part de ses disponibilit\u00e9s, comme elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire il y a bien longtemps.\n[16] Ce n\u2019est pas le Tribunal qui a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019instruction. C\u2019est la plaignante qui l\u2019a fait.\n[17] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire de formuler une conclusion expresse \u00e0 ce sujet, compte tenu du fait que la plaignante abandonne ses plaintes, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante n\u2019a pas de preuve suffisante \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses plaintes, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e plus d\u2019une fois \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ses arguments, et malgr\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 continue du Tribunal de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins.\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaintes sont, en pratique, rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9 par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 7 mars 2014",
